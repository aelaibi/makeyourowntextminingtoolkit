IActions C o n s o l i d a t e d by Order of the Honourable Mr.

justice H i d d e n dated 25th of June 1990J



             SKELETON ARGUMENT OF T H E R E S PON DENT

                             PETER WRIGHT



1.     The analysis by the Court was correct              in fact and

in law and the conclusions, properly arrived at, ought

not to be disturbed.



 2.    The claims in each case are for damages                for

 injuries alleged to have been s u f f e r e d by the Deceased

 sisters S a r a h Louise Hicks and V i c t o r i a Jane Hicks and

 by the D e c e a s e d Colin Wafer a c c o r d i n g to the res pe ct iv e

 Endorsements     on Writ     (re spectively    at   bundle 1 pages 13

 and 27)
 and pleaded     in identical terms in the statements of

 Pacts in e ach case       (respectively at bundle 1 pages 14

 and 28)*



  3.    in neithe r pleading were the c l a i m s e x p r e s s e d to

  be for injury alleged to be the c o n s e q u e n c e of the

  appr eh e n s i o n of injury to another.
             4.      The direct evidence concerning                   Victoria and Sarah

             Hicks    is accurately set out by the Learned Judge in his

             Judgment      (see pages 38 and 39 of bundle 1).



             5.      There was no evidence before the Learned Judge

             concerning      the Deceased Colin W a f e r at the football
                                                                  t*0
             g r o u n d prior to his being found       de a d in   pen 3.Where

             he h a d been in that            pen or for h o w long                 or how he had

             com e   to be in the position when                  found was not in

             evidence,



             6.      That of the 95           who died in          the tragedy at

             H i l l s b o r o u g h it was   in evidence that at least 16 and

             p r o b a b l y 21 individuals came in t o the ground after Gate

             C o p e n e d at 2.52 p.m.         see p a ragr aph 108 of the interim

              r e p o r t of Lord Justice Taylor.                (Bundle 2 page 39).



              7.     It was in evidence that c o m p a r a t i v e l y late

              a r r i v a l s m a d e their way,        " w o r m e d " , well into and in

              c e r t a i n instances towards the front of the crowds in

              pens   3 and 4.          See the evidence of for example

            9.          W hat any individual      in pens 3 or 4 experienced

            d e p e n d e d upon the pre c is e    location of that individual.

            Such was conceded,             see the Judgment,         (bundle 1 page     38

             d i d in fact vary according to the individuals whose

             e vi d e n c e was before the Court.             See for example

              10.        In the circumstances the conclusion complained of

              at P a r a g r a p h 1 of the Notice of Appeal was reasonable

              and warranted.



              11.        As to Paragraph 2 of the Notice of Appeal                  it is

              su bm i t t e d that the judgment does not reflect any

                  con c l u s i o n or direction that,       as a pre-requisite of

               exact       extent of the Deceased's suffering was req.uired.
                                                                      •*




               12.        As to Par a g r a p h   3 of the Notice of Ap peal        it is

               submitted that the conclusions which the Learned Judge

               came to were p r o p e r l y arrived at and that such-,

               inferences as the Appellants assert should have been

               drawn could not have been drawn.



               13.        For damages to be awarded nothing short of the

               proof of injury,            (whether by inference or direct

               evidence will suffice).                In addition to being referred

               to Behrens -v- B e r t r a m Mills 1957 2 Q.B.              1 . (at pages

                   27 and 28), m e n t i o n e d in the Judgment       (bundle 1 page

                   49) the Judge had been generally referred to the

                   authorities d i s c u s s e d in the immediately preceding

                   nervous shock hearing, which included:-



                           McLouqhlin -v- O'Brian 1983 A.C. 410 at                 418 D and

                           page 42 G .



                   The common law gives no damages for emotional distress.



                   14.     Where there ma y have been emotional distress

                   preceding the s uffering of some injury it is submitted

                   that that which was not capable of being compensated by

                   itself is not rendered capable of compensation by that

                   subsequent injury.



                   15.     If such inferences as the Appellants ask to be

        Mr. T. Hicks,
        Hillsborough Family Support Group,




        Dear Hr. Hicks,

         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.

         Thank you for your letter of the 24th of August.

         I am somewhat astonished by some of the comments which you make, but I do
         feel that any useful purpose would be served in responding to these.

         It seems to me that the points which you raise might perhaps be better
         addressed to your legal advisers.

         To avoid misunderstanding, I want to make it quite clear that the content,
         scope, form and procedure relating to the Inquests is a matter for me.

         Once the D.P.P. has announced his decision, I will consider it and take
         whatever decision is appropriate in relation to the Inquests.


         Yours sin/ferely,

 PETER BECKETT ROBINSON states:-

 I am Chief Executive and Company Secretary of Liverpool Football Club &

 Athletic Grounds PLC.
 I took up my appointment as Secretary to the Club in June, 1965 having

 previously served as Office Junior/Assistant Secretary at Stockport

 County between 1954/58 and Secretary at Crewe Alexandra between

 1958/60, Scunthorpe United 1960/64 and Brighton & Hove Albion Football

 Club 1964/65-

 I therefore have experience of the administration of football in all

 Four Divisions over a period of 35 years.

 On Monday, 20th March, 1989, I observed on the Breakfast Television that

 we had drawn Nottingham Forest in the Semi-Final of the F.A. Cup.

 We had also drawn them as Semi-Finalists in the previous year.

 Upon arrival at the Club, I telephoned Steve Clark, the Competitions

 Secretary of the Football Association, to enquire as to whether a choice

 of ground had been made.               He told me that this would be considered later

 in the morning and I asked him to take into account our experience in the

 previous year.            I reminded him that there had been much criticism that

 Nottingham Forest had been given a larger allocation of tickets than us

■- although their average gate and support was much smaller.             I informed

  him that my Club felt very strongly that Hillsborough should not be

  chosen as the venue if a different ticket allocation could not be arranged

  to give Liverpool a more equitable share.

  We had no complaint about the general facilities at the ground, but

  firmly believed another venue must be chosen If last year's ticket

  allocation could not be altered.

  He promised that he would advise the Committee of my Club’s views when

  the decision was being made.

  Later that morning he telephoned me to say that the Committee had

  selected H i l l s b o r o u g h .   He said the Police would not agree to the

  allocation b e i n g altered and that was the end of the matter.

  I informed him that I would therefore have to go public with my

  criticism of the Football Association.

                                                 time and Iinvited them in

and made a statement, which was widely reported.

I criticised the F.A. over their Cup       Semi-Final ticketplane,saying

’’They appear to be living in an Ivory to«er showing complete disregard

for the fans who are the life blood of the game.          Their decision is

unjust and it means that many of our loyal supporters are going to miss

out."      I pointed out that our average attendance at Anfield was almost

 38,000.    This was more than 17,000 higher than Nottingham Forest.

 For the second consecutive year the allocation provided for Nottingham

 to receive approximately 4,500 more tickets than Liverpool.

 I also checked that the Manchester United Ground was available and

 stated that, in the circumstances, it would have been fairer to use that

 ground for the Semi-Final.
 The press contacted Steve Clark about my comments and he claimed that

 Manchester United was the wrong location geographically.            This is

  ludicrous, particularly as that ground was selected as tto re-play

  ground at the same time as Hillsborough was chosen.
  In 1988, the Sheffield Wednesday Secretary, Graham Nackrell, had called

. a planning meeting prior to the game.     1 attended with a representative

' from Nottingham Forest and the Football Association.           The intention was

  to meet the Police and discuss arrangements.           On that occasion I

  pointed out the risks as to safety that could occur from the allocation.

  Nottingham Forest might have surplus tickets    w h i c h   could end up on the

  ■’black market" and thereby into the hands of Liverpool supporters.

  This would affect the segregation arrangements at the other end and I

   stated that Liverpool was not prepared to accept responsibility if these

   arrangements broke down.
   No planning meeting was summoned by Sheffield Wednesday in 1989-

   I produce a copy of a notice inserted in the Daily Post and Liverpool
   Echo showing the manner in which tickets were initially lloca e

   Season Ticket Holders.     Not all Season Ticket Holders took up their

   allocation and a small balance was eventually sold to the general public.
                                                                              7y>r     _

I attended the Semi-Final Tie on Saturday,.15th April, having a,seat in


the Directors' Box.
After the game had started I noticed spectators coming onto the running

track at the Leppings Lane end.      I could see that It appeared that the

central area was over-populated although there seemed to be room on both

sides.
It was also clear to me that the problem was not one of misbehaviour as

the spectators were careful not to encroach orito the pitch although

there was little room for them between the barriers and the pitch.

After the game had been stopped for some minutes I decided to go down

onto the pitch to investigate.

I was accompanied by one of our Directors, Tony Ensor, who is a

 Solicitor, and had been Involved with me in the Investigations of the

 Heysel Stadium.      We came out of the Players' Tunnel onto the pitch and

 as we walked towards the goal mouth, I was accosted by a number of
 Liverpool spectators complaining angrily that the Police had opened an

 exit gate and allowed a large number of people to get through into, the

 ground.     They showed me their tickets which had not been torn.

 I proceeded towards the goal area where It became apparent, that many

 spectators were Injured.      Some were lying motionless on the ground

 while others were being attended to.        Some appeared unconscious

 and as one young boy was being carried away on a mke-shift stretcher,

 a coat was placed over his head.        This confirmed to me that he was dead

 and I was told that other dead bodies were evident.

  Although there were numerous Police Officers around, there appeared to

  be no one in charge.      I could not see any Ranking Officers.

  The impression I got was that the Police were mainly concerned about a

  pitch invasion and problems of law and order.

  I believe I was on the pitch for no more than 10 minutes.

  I then returned to the Players' Dressing Room to inform the Trainers and

  Players that deaths had occurred and that the match could obviously not

  proceed.
I was then called to a meeting by Graham Kelly of the F.A. in the Board

Room.   This meeting was attended by one or two F.A. Council Members,

Mr. Smith and Mr. Ensor from Liverpool Football Club, Mr. Roworth, the

Chairman of Nottingham Forest and Mr. McGee and Mr. Mackrell, the

Chairman and Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday.     Mr. Kelly had asked

for the Chief Superintendent of Police to attend for a report upon the

situation.

We had to wait for some short time for the arrival of the Chief

Superintendent.   When he arrived his main concern appeared to be to

prevent an outbreak of disorder between the opposing supporters.

He was not agreeable to a public address announcement being made at that

stage as he felt it would hinder the arrival of the emergency services.

He wished to keep the spectators in their place.

When asked what was the cause of the disaster, his response was that the

Liverpool supporters had failed to heed the Police warning to arrive

early and so had caused additional congestion and pressure on the

approach to the ground.    The Chief Superintendent remained at the

meeting for only a short period.

I continued to persuade the authorities to make a public address

announcement although Nottingham Forest supporters were for some

considerable time unaware of the nature of the tragedy and were taunting

 Liverpool supporters.    I spent some of this time in the Club Room

 Foyer and I also returned to the Directors' Box where I heard the

 Manager, Kenny Dalglish, make a public accouncement requesting

 co-operation from the fans in the difficulties which had arisen.

 At this stage the impression I had from various sources was that

 our fans had forced open a gate.

 I was anxious to investigate this allegation and so, with Mr. Ensor, I

 made a careful investigation of the Leppings Lane end.     By this

 time, most of the spectators had left although there were still some

 there-who were anxious to tell me that the Police had opened the gate.

 They showed me the gate and I could see that it was of the concertina

 type which would be difficult, if not impossible, for fans to force open

 from the outside.

I also examined the tunnel leading to the central penned area behind the

goal, where the tragedy occurred.

I noted the broken crash barrier and the limited means of gaining access

from the ground onto the pitch.

At Anfield, before the fences were removed following           th e   Hillsborough

T r a g e d y ,.   there were no gates, but gaps at intervals to enable escape to

be made in emergencies.

Finally, I observed the location of the close circuit television cameras,

which should have enabled Police officers to observe closely the state

of packing of that area and any discomfort which spectators might

 experience.

                                                           HILLSBOROUGH - RESUMED INQUESTS

          As you will recall from our letter of 16th November our clients'
            (the Football Supporters Association)                                                                          funding is such that we have
          been unable to attend before you to represent our client's interest
          Our clients' attempts to raise financing are, however,                                                                                                                      still
          continuing and it may be that our clients will be able to attend at
          some later date.                                 Should financing become- available cir clients
          would,          of course, have to take a view as to whether an appearance
          after the Inquests had started could usefully assist you.


          At the pre-inquests meeting our representative                                                                                                stated that ifour
          clients were unable to represent the interests                                                                                                of Liverpool
          supporters there would in effect be a void in representation before
         you.            We have to say that on the basis of the reports on the opening
         days' evidence at the Inquests which both we and our clients have
         read in the media, this void in representation                                                                                                 is now marked and                                     is
         possibly affecting the outcome of the Inquests                                                                                                 themselves.


         Our clients have asked us to write to you to explain their views in
         the light of the various media reports we have been reading and
        hearing in respect of the first weeks of evidence.                                                                                                           As a party whom
        you invited to be represented before you, we would invite you to
        place copies of this letter before the members of the Jury, as this

may be our clients' only way of having their views considered.
You can obviously stress to the Jury the weight which you feel
ought to be placed upon the sentiments and views we set out below.


The source of our clients' frustration and anger has been the gist
of the evidence concerning the behaviour of Liverpool supporters in
the hours leading up to the disaster occurring.                                     The general
impression given by the evidence lead to show the behaviour of
Liverpool supporters seems to be that:-


1.   The vast majority of Liverpool supporters had drunk to excess
and that drink has affected tneir behaviour.


2.   That Liverpool supporters were not only drinking to excess in
public houses but had purchased large quantities of alcohol from
local stores and off-licences.


3.   That Liverpool supporters largely arrived "late" at the game,
and that this lateness was caused by drinking in local hostelries.


4.   That there were hundreds,                                   if not thousands of Liverpool
     ,rr

supporters without tickets and that these ticketless supporters
were in some way responsible for the disaster.


5.   That Liverpool supporters were involved in other criminal
activities which in some way influenced the cause of the disaster.


It would appear to us from reports seen by our clients that this
scenario is not being substantially challenged.                                     In saying this we
imply no criticism of the representatives of those bereaved or
injured at Hillsborough.                                   It has already been accepted that their
brief and emphasis has,of necessity, been different to that of our
clients.            If our clients had been able to be present at the Inquests
they would have challenged this scenario most rigorously,                                      as it is a
scenario they do not accept as being factually correct.

     To                      ^                                        Mo




Our clients would                       like to draw to the attention of the Jurors                 the
following facts:-


1.   At the Taylor Inquiry the South Yorkshire Police produced
excellent collections                              of photographs of the crowd outside the
Hillsborough Stadium in the hours leading up to the disaster.
These photographs                       were timed and presumably give              an accurate
reflection of the                       visibly apparent nature of the crowd,              in so much
as it would appear to an onlooker.                                     None of those phtographs at any
time support the view that the majority of Liverpool supporters were
carrying large amounts of alcoholic drinks.                                      Indeed, the
photographs show that three or four individuals (in separate
photographs)                are seen to be carrying one can of beer.


2.    The video compiled by the West Midlands Police investigation
team similarly does not support the theory that vast numbers of
supporters around the ground were carrying large quantities of
alcoholic beverages.                             Nor does it support the view that the vast
majority of the crowd were badly behaved or openly hostile towards
the South Yorkshire Police.                                     It does show quite clearly that'some
elements of the crowds at the back of the mass of supporters seeking
entrance to the ground were boisterous;                                    it supports the view that
there was an altercation between one Police Officer and one fan; but
it does no more than that.                                     There is a marked difference between the
boisterous,               excited bahaviour of a football crowd, expectant of
seeking an exciting,                           important game and the badly behaved crowd, the
picture of which appears to have been painted on the basis of the
report we have seen.


3.    We have heard reports of bad behaviour of Liverpool supporters
in public houses well away from the ground - one particular incident
involving supporters who allegedly pulled a cigarette machine off
the wall of a public house.                                     Our clients feel that this evidence
has little,               if any, relevance to the matters in issue.

4.   Our clients are firm believers that Lord Justice Taylor's
interim report provided an accurate description of the factual
circumstances which ensued on 15th April, 1989.                                 Our clients feel
that Lord Justice Taylor heard sufficient representative evidence to
have formed an accurate factual overview of the events.


We know that you have discussed the use that you will make of the
Taylor Report and we do not know, because of our absence, of the
final view you have formed in this regard.                                However, bearing that in
mind our clients would like to make the following points :-


A.   Lord Justice Taylor heard much evidence as to the alleged
bahaviour of Liverpool supporters in the hours leading up the
tragedy.          On the question of the alleged drunkenness of the fans he
heard evidence from many of those witnesses appearing at the
Inquest,       such as witnesses Hockenhull,                         Lindley and Buck,    and will
have read many other statements.                               In dealing with this aspect of the
behaviour of Liverpool fans, he concluded at Paragraph 196 of his
interim rep o r t :-



            Of those who arrived at 2.30 p.m. or after, very many
           had been drinking at public houses or had brought drink
           from home or an off-licence.    I am satisfied on the
           evidence, however, that the great majority were not drunk,
           nor even the worse for drink.    The Police witnesses varied
           on this.  Some described the high proportion as drunk, as
           "lager louts" or even as "animals".    Others described a
          generally normal crowd with an unco-operative minority who
          had drunk too much.    In my view, some Officers, seeking to
          rationalise their loss of control, over-estimated the
          drunkal element in the crowds.     There certainly was such an
          element.   There were youngsters influenced by drink and
          bravado pushing impatiently at the rear of the crowd,
          thereby exacerbating the crush.     But the more convicing
          police witnesses, including especially Detective
          Superintendent McKay and Chief Inspector Creaser, as well
          as a number of responsible civilian witnesses, were in my
          view right in describing this element as a minority.     Those
          witnesses attributed the crush to the sheer numbers of fans
          all anxious to gain entry.    There was no criticism of the
          crowd by any of their witnesses in the period up to 2.30p.m.
          or even 2.3 5 p.m.  What happened then was not a sudden

            deterioration in the mood or sobriety of those assembled
            there. No doubt those coming behind would have had more to
            drink and would have included the unruly minority.  But the
            crisis developed because this very large crowd became packed
            into a confined turnstile area and its very density hampered
            its passage through the turnstiles."


B.   Lord Justice Taylor also heard much evidence as to the
"lateness" of Liverpool fans and the allegation that it was this
 lameness' which caused or at least contributed to the caotic scenes
outside Hillsborough.                            In this regard he concluded at paragraph
192:-



           "Whether those who arrived between 2.30 p.m. and 2.4 0 p.m.
           were "late" was much debated.   The ticket simply requested
           its holder "to take up (his) position 15 minutes before
           kick-off". That may have been intended to pursuade those with
           stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be
           unreasonable for a standing spectator to arrive at the
           turnstiles between 2.3 0 p.m. and 2.4 0 p.m. Whether they were
           "late" or not, however, there was certainly a large
           concentration of Liverpool fans arriving at about 2.30 p.m.
           and after."



C.   Substantial evidence at the Public Inquiry was brought tc
allege disgraceful behaviour on the part of Liverpool fans, both in
and around the ground and further afield.                                In this regard,    Lord
Justice Taylor concluded at paragraph 1 9 7 :-



           "Superintendent Marshall and other Officers criticised the
          crowd as uncoperative because Police exortations to stop
          pushing into his back were not heeded.   How could they be?
          In that crush most people had no control over their
          movements at all.   Two incidents involving police horses
          illustrate the point.   One horse was found afterwards to
          have cigarette burns on its rump.   Clearly that was the
          despicable work of a hooligan whether in drink or not.
          However, there were also eye witness accounts of a horse
          being physically lifted off its feet by the crowds.   That
          occurred, as the police accepted, without malice or intent
          but as an involuntary consequence of crowd pressure which
          those by the horses flanks could not resist any more than the
          horse itself."

 Further,         at paragraph 199 Lord Justice Taylor went on:-

              The result was that in the early stages Police Officers were
            pestered by fans for help as to where they should go.     Later,
            as the crowd became more dense, fans were presenting their
            tickets at the wrong turnstile.    There were also Liverpool
            supporters who had acquired tickets for The Kop end but
            sought entry at Leppings Lane.   They caused delay in the
            turnstile operation when entry was refused, and after a while
            the police instructed the operators to let them through.
            There was further delay because the crush made it difficult
            for fans to get into the turnstile entrances.    Once there,
            the pressure from behind was such as, on occasions, to jam
            them in the doorway or against the paddle of the turnstile.
            Finally, there were fans without tickets who sought to
            enter by offering payment, by seeking to go over or under
            the paddle or by sliding through with a ticket holder. All of
            these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the
            worse period was only about 600 per hour per turnstile.     The
            waiting crowd therefore expanded and as the minutes passed
            frustration grew.   Visitors who had paid for tickets and
            travelled from afar realised they were making little forward
            progress, frustration increased pressure and induced panic
            at the front.   Determination to get into the match was
            intensified by determination to get out of the crush."


Earlier in the Report,                          at paragraph 64, and in describing the
situation outside the turnstiles,                             Lord Justice Taylor stated:—



            Superintendent Marshall was in the midst of the turmoil.
           He extracated himself and stood on a paraphet of the bridge
           to get a clear view.  A drunken fan tried to push him off;
           a beer can was thrown at a mounted officer.  But these were
           isolated acts by individuals; the menace came from the
           massive number single—mindedly determined to be in for the
           kick-off with time running out".



D.    At the Public Inquiry much play was made by the South Yorkshire
Police of an argument that thousands of Liverpool supporters arrived
     Hillsborough without tickets and that the presence of these
people without tickets in someway caused or contributed to the
disaster.          The Police also produced bundles 'of evidence to support a
                                                                                              QcbC S / 4

"conspiracy theory" to the effect that the presence of many of the
Liverpool supporters without tickets was pre-planned as a means of
forcing the Police to allow them to enter the ground.                                        This
conspiracy theory was soundly rejected.                                     In concluding on this
aspect,       Lord Justice Taylor said at paragraphs 201 - 202:-



           "200 - it has become a fact of football life that fans do
           turn up at all ticket matches without tickets.   It is not
           possible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable
           estimate of the number without tickets on 15th April.   Police
           estimates varied from about about 200 to about 2,000.   There
           was certainly frequent requests for tickets or "spares"
           during the hours before the build up.  Many of those warned
           off by the Police were seen to return to the area.   Some were
           hanging about on the bridge.  Again, however, the police
           witnesses who most impressed me did not consider the number
           of ticketless fans to be inordinately large.   This accords
           with two other sources of evidence.

           201 - First, there was a wide range of witnesses who observed
           inside the ground that the Liverpool end was at a late stage
           well below capacity save for pens 3 and 4. The North Stand
           still had many empty seats and the wing pens were sparse,
           the match being a sell-out, there were clearly many ticket
           holders to come and they could account for the large crowd
           still outside the turnstiles.  Had the Liverpool
           accommodation been full by 2.40 p.m. one could have inferred
           that most or much of the large crowd outside lacked tickets.

          202- Secondly, such figures as are available from the Club's
          electronic monitoring system and from analysis by the HSE
          suggest that no great number entered without tickets and
          show that the number who passed through turnstiles A-G plus
          those who entered through gate C roughly equalled the terrace
          capacity figure of 10,100 for which tickets had been sold.
          The Club's records showed 7,038 passed through turnstiles
          A-G.  However, the counting mechanism on turnstile G was
          defective so the HSE did a study using the video film and
          projecting figures from the other turnstiles.  This gave
          an assessment of 7,494 with a maximum of 7,644 passing
          through A-G.  Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the
          number who entered the ground whilst gate C was open at
          2,240 with a maximum of 2,480.  Accordingly, the HSE's best
          estimate of the total entering through gate C and turnstiles
          A-G was 9,734 with a maximum of 10,1-24. I recognise that
          these can only be rough checks because, for example, some
          with terraced tickets were allowed through turnstiles 1-16
          and there would be other similar factors which have not
          formed part of the assessment.  Nevertheless, the figures do

              S.L. Popper Esq                                           8                  03-Dec-90
      To                                                           No




              suqqest that there was not a very significant body of
              ticketless fans in the crowd which built up."

Lord Justice Taylor went on at paragraph 208:-

              "I have already found that there was not an abnormally large
              number of fans without tickets on this occasion.  With one
              or two exceptions, the Police witnesses themselves did not
              subscribe to the "conspiracy" theory.  I am satisfied that
              the large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 p.m. to
              2.50 p.m. did not arrive as a result of any concerted plans.
              There were, I accept, small groups without tickets who were
              willing to exploit any adventitious chance of getting into
              the ground.  They, together with a minority who had drunk
              too much, certainly had aggravated the problem faced by the
              Police. But that main problem was simply one of large numbers
              packed into the small area outside the turnstiles".




The purpose of our clients wishing up to make these points is
simple:          our clients believe that the evidence which has been heard
at the Inquests and reported in the media has all been put before.
It has been challenged and its limitations have been found.


Our clients are quite prepared to accept that:-


i.         There were some Liverpool supporters who drank too much to the
extent that it affected their behaviour.


ii.        There were some Liverpool supporters who behaved quite
disgracefully.


iii. There were present some supporters without tickets who should
not have been there and who would have made life difficult for the
Police.


The extracts we have quoted from Lord Justice Taylor's report are,
to our mind,                 fairly balanced and support the points which our
clients are prepared to accept.                                  However,   and having said that, our
clients wish to say most forceably that;

i.     All of the above supporters were in a very small minority,


ii.     Their actions were not responsible for the death and injuries
which ensued and,


iii. Their actions,                 in themselves, were perfectly capable of being
policed and were,                indeed,       foreseeable to a Police Authority having
a reasonable knowledge of the manner in which football crowds behave
and the tendencies which do, unfortunately, appear to manifest
themselves.

Our clients accept that as the allegations referred to above are the
honestly held views and beliefs of witnesses whom it is perfectly
relevant to call,                it is quite proper for them to be heard at the
Inquests.           However, our clients perceive two dangers


i.        That the allegations are passing seemingly unchallenged in the
absence of our clients and


ii.       The allegations are being reported as being fact by the media
who are obviously seeking only to attract readers, viewers or
listeners.

Both of these dangers may result in the allegations being accepted
as fact by the jurors or the public.                          The allegations are not
accepted as fact by our clients.


As our clients cannot appear before you and make these points, they
 felt that they had no other option but to write to you, through
 ourselves,          and attempt to redress the balance in the Jurors' minds.
 Had our clients been present at the Inquests all of the above
 points would have been made on our clients' behalf.


 Finally,         and in the light of the manner in which the evidence has so

   To




far been reported in the media, our clients had asked us to write
an open letter in terms of the above to the Editors of all national
and relevant local newspapers and to local radio stations in
Liverpool and Sheffield.                                  Our clients feel that the allegations made
in the media must be answered.


We have considered with our clients the possibility that such a step
may be considered as an attempt by our clients to influence the
outcome of the Inquests, and in some way as being in contempt of
court.        We understand from those who have attended the Inquests that
you have requested parties not to speak to the press.


We have considered this point most carefully as it obviously causes
us concern.                The above letter is certainly an attempt by our clients
to influence the outcome of the Inquests:                                   that is precisely what
each party at the Inquests sees as its aim.                                   Our clients were, quite
properly in our view,                             invited by you to be such a party.          Our
clients are unable to attend personally be fore y o u , or through
Counsel or solicitors, to have their views known.                                    This method is,
therefore,             the only method of making those views known.


In our submission,                        therefore,           it must be proper for you to place
this letter before the Jurors, with an appropriate advice from
yourself as to the weight which the Jurors should attach to it.                                            If
that is correct, and we would submit it is, then the letter must
also be capable of reading by the media as the Inquests are open and
reportable by the media.


If you decline our invitation to place this letter before the
Jurors, then we still feel that our clients are entitled through the
media, to respond to the points made in the media reports of the
evidence given so far.                                 Our clients are merely repeating the views
which they have already made public on several occasions and the
line which they took through Counsel at the Public Inquiry.                                         They
are, as we have said, already a party to the Inquests.

Consequently, and after much consideration we are of the view that
our clients would be at liberty to release this letter to the media
without they, or indeed ourselves, being in contempt of your court
or in anyway acting improperly.   However, before taking such a step
both we and our clients would welcome your views and comments.     If
you believe that our clients would be acting improperly in
releasing this letter to the media, please advise us as we know that
our clients will respect your views and consider carefully any
points you may wish to make.


We await your comments on the above as soon as feasible and if you
wish to discuss any element of the points we have made with us,
please do not hesitate to contact us as you should feel appropriate.


Yours faithfully

Hill Dickinson Davis Campbell,
Solicitors,

Liverpool. L2 9XL.

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough - Resumed Incueste

Thank you for your letter of the 3rd of December.

I hope that you will excuse the relative brevity and steccato style of this
reply, but I as: Eure you will appreciate that I am rather pressed for time.
N e v e r t h e l e s s I felt it right that I should respond     to yo-Jas q ui ck l y as
possible.             May I crake a few general observations first-

As you know, I have been perfectly willing to allow your clients to be
treated as an interested party and tc be represented at the inquest.   The
fact that for whatever reason they ere unable or unwilling to ba present is
regrettable, but not something that I can do anything about.  I should
perhaps add that they are not unique in this situation, and indeed even in
th8se inquests they are at present interested parties who no doubt would wish
to be legally represented but who for various reasons are unable to be so.

1 note what you         say with regard to funding.  Should your position change and
should you feel         that you would vieh to avail yourself of the opportunity for
representation,         then I would not stand in your way. Whether such attendance
would be useful         would I think in the final analysis have to be for you to
determine.

You are of course quite right that this matter was investigated                            byLord
Justice Taylor and that he wrote a report.

Hovever, whether one likes it or not. the present legal position is quite
clear that notwithstanding a Public Inquiry (and thi6 would apply whether the
Public Inquiry was a statutory one or a departmental one) there is a duty on
the coroner to hold an inquest (6ee R - v - H.K.Coroner for East Kent ex
parte Peter Alan Spooner et el Queen’s Bench Division October the 6th 1987).
Furthermore, if an inquest is to be held X took the view that this should be
held with a Jury.

It is perfectly plain that before the Jury can reach a verdict, they have to
hear the evidence.  The fact that some or all of the evidence may have been
heard or considered by Lord Justice Taylor is neither here or there.
It is the duty of the Jury to reach a verdict in accordance with the evidence
which is presented to them In court. What verdict the Jury will reach is of

            course a matter for them at the conclusion of the inquests.

           As a general point, you will I aa SUre appreciate that n e w s p a p e r reports do
           not necessarily gi7« a full account of what happens in proceedings and you
           m x y be interested to learn that there are alr.ady hundreds of pages o*

           Dealing with the two specific points that need addraesing:-

                         sent to me before the Jurors.

              Z.         U is my cl«ar understanding that publication of the letter
                         in the media vould constitute a s*rious contempt.  I draw your

For the attention of Mr D Fraser


Dear Doug

Thank you for your circular letter of 1 9 March 1 990 and for finding
the time to discuss it with me on the telephone.

I would like to make the following points in connection with Jenni
and myself.

1   I will require copies of all the information on both Sarah and
     Victoria.  If there is any difficulty in reproducing them at
     your end, then I will gladly arrange to collect them,
     duplicate them and return them to your safe keeping.

     I would like, if possible to also receive a copy of       the
     computer produced flow chart. Having visited Neachells Green
     and knowing something of computers, I would suggest the
     simplest route is to ask the Police to supply an extra copy.
     (They may even choose to use 2 copy computer paper!)

2   Although not applicable at this time, we would wish to obtain
    copies of the complete files including all photographs.

3   I will be in Sheffield for the opening phases and at various
     times during the Hearings.  Bothh Jenni and I will be there
     for Sarah and Victorias' individual Inquests.

     I am sure you will advise us at the earliest opportunity of
     the proposed programme.

4   Again for the record, I would ask you to register my intention
    to bring an individual criminal charge in the event the DPP
    fails to do so.



                                   1
It is a little premature at the moment but ^ w ould ask vou to
cogitate on the most suitable Barrister -




As discussed we will await the summaries but I would give
advance notice that I am still concerned about the conflicting
evidence regarding Victoria prior to her arrival on the pitch.
Do you think it is wise for me to advise the West Midlands
Police Authority so this can be incorporated with the
summaries or do you feel it better to await the Inquest
proper?

You  agreed  to circularise   the  families  regarding  the
requirements for the programme to proceed as scheduled, for
my part, I will make sure we cover it at the Family Group
Meeting.

May I suggest that something goes out from the Hillsborough
Steering Committee advising Lawyers to advise their clients
of the stipulation.




                           2
I enclose an envelope in which your letter was despatched and I am
quite amazed how the GPO could have it with us the next day. Could
you please arrange to have your data base corrected.

Once again thanks for all your help.

     Dear Sirs
®    REQUEST F O R T H E RELEASE OF INFORMATION

     I refer to y o u r letter of 12 November 1990 in which you request a copy of a
     statement made in relation to Victoria J Hicks by Mr Paul Taylor. The policy
     on the release of information is as follows:
     The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police invited the West Midlands Police
     back in April 1989 to undertake the investigation into the Hillsborough Disaster.
     In fulfilling this investigatory role the West Midlands Police constitutional y were
     artimr as the aeents of South Yorkshire Police. Consequently the "ownership
     of i ! th e rnfo fraa5on gathered is v e ste d in the Chief C onstable of South
     Yorkshire Police.
      The policy on the release of information has variously been determined by Lord
      Justice Taylor, later the Director of Public Prosecutions (in conjunction with
      the Police^ Complaints Authority), and the Coroner.     I now have to ook to
      South Yorkshire Police, as owners of the information, for the pohcy
      responding to your request.
®     At the Dresent time the policy of the South Yorkshire Police directed to me is
      not to release any information to any party until they have sought legal advice
      on the disclosure issues. I suspect in due course on receiving legal advice
      they will direct me as to how to respond to your request and others.

      I am sorry I cannot be any more helpful at the moment and as explained at the
      present time I must decline your request.

      Yours faithfully

      Dear Sir,

      Re:        Hillsborough - Sarah and Victoria HICKS

      Reference is made to your letter dated 25 November 1991 and my letter of
      21 January 1992.

      Enclosed herewith is a copy of photograph, reference number: PR5/17 which
      is a South Yorkshire Police document.

      The question of ownership of the other material which you request is not
      so clear as other outside organisations have an interest in the material.

      Accordingly,                 I have referred those requests to the organisations listed
      be l o w :-

      Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 video recordings have been brought to the
      attention of Russell Peasgood, Editor, News & Current Affairs, BBC
      Television, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds.  LS2 9PX

      Items 8 and 9 photographs NGN2/35 and NGN1/55 respectively have been
      forwarded to Paul Buttle, Picture Editor, News International, 1 Virginia
      Street, London.  El 9XN

      With regard to the request for copies of the A4 size black ring binder
      which you describe as having been used in the 'mini inquests', I do not
      feel personally able to release this documentation and I have referred
      your request to H . M . Coroner for his consideration.




                                                                                            Inspector Brentnall                                CYTCMCiriN           8i>15

I trust that you will appreciate why the course of action described has
been taken.

May I take this opportunity of thanking you on behalf of the South
Yorkshire Police for the patience you have shown in awaiting the release
of material which I am sure you will appreciate was due to many factors
beyond my control.

Yours faithfully,

 Dear Mr .-and M / y Iliaks ,




Since writing to you outlining H.M. Coroners intentions con-erring che
resumed Inquests I have received the summary v/hich I mentioned .

It was originally my intention not to send a copy of this to vou by
post, I wanted to tell you 1 had it and invite you here to see me by
appointment so that I could go through it sympathetically with you and
then give you a copy to take away if you wanted one.  However, because
time is pressing and I am sure that you will want to know what is in
tne Summary I have changed my mind and a copy of it is In the brown
envelope which accompanies this letter.

The Summary contains some information which you already nave and sows
fresh details that you will not have been aware of until now and n;j.t<ht
I suggest that you have someone with you when you open the evslope,
± do not think it would be  a good idea if you were on your own when
you read the Summary for the first time.

I am sorry that I have not been able to carry out my original wishes
ior deaxing with the Summary but 1 am sure you will understand the reasons
for my change of heart and    if I have offended you or upset you in any
way by senaing the Summary straight out to you in    this way then I sincerely
apologise.

Having ceen the Summary I anticipate that you will want to discuss some
of the points raised with me and I certainly need to see you to discuss
a couple of matters and explain in a little more d.etaj.1 oreoi-ssly wnat
                                                                         l>oc n    In
                                 -2-                                              ! C'

 will happen when the Summary is presented in open Court in Sheffield.

 I have not yet seen a timetable for the Inquests in Sheffield so I do
 not know when your Summary will be presented, you may rest assured that
    3000 33 1 have tnis ^ f o r m a t i o n I will be in touch with you immediately.

In anticipation that you will want to see me to discuss matters I have
 “ en the liberty of arranging an appointment for you and details are
shown at the bottom of this letter.

If for any reason the appointment is not convenient or you do not want
to see me to discuss the Summary would you please telephone my Secretary
to either change the appointment or let her know that you will not be
coming.                                               J


Provision has been made for the Coroners Officers to receive written
questions on matters arising from the Summary in advance of the Hearings
and if you have queries which might be able to be dealt with in this
way then we can discuss this when we meet.

Once again might I apologise if I have caused distress or upseet by
sending a copy of the Summary this way, I can assure you that it was
certainly not my wish to do so.

Yours Sincerely

         SU R V IV IN G IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF DISASTERS



  S u r v iv in g D isaster

  In the im m ediate aftermath of disasters the experiences o f survivors often are
  n eglected and m arginalised. The priority is investigation and, understandably,
 sym p ath y is focused on the bereaved. Survivors of a disaster in w h ich there has
 b een substantial dam age to property or to physical infrastructures often have their
 physical needs identified. Usually, if the num bers are not too great, they will have
 access to social w orkers, other 'caring' professionals or volunteers at reception
 centres or via helplines.         W hen disasters involve m ultiple survivors a n d /o r
 w itn esses, how ever, it is unlikely that official responses w ill m eet their needs in the
 first hours, or e v en days. The fact that survivors often disperse, unrecorded,
 accentuates the difficulty. W ith or w ith o u t official help, isolated or supported,
 survivors begin their processes of adjustment, seeking to com prehend and make
 sen se of w hat has hap pened to them, h o w it relates to their pasts and futures. These
 are processes w h iclv m ig h t take months, years, even a lifetime. W hile m any people,
 including professionals, remain sceptical about post-traumatic reactions, urging
 p eo p le to "pull them selves together" or "get over it", it is important that survivors'
 experiences are recounted and taken seriously1.

 T h e O rdeals o f Survival

 It is important to em phasise that there is no hierarchy attached to degrees of
 suffering, but also to recognise the diversity o f experiences encom passed by the term
 'survivor'. Som e p eople w itn ess the deaths of others from a position of helpless
 safety, perhaps k n ow in g that loved o n es are am ong those w h o se lives are
 threatened. Others experience a direct, personal threat to their lives, escaping death
narrow ly. M any o f those w h o survive disaster are 'rescuers' or are bereaved, or
both. For these survivors n ot only are they caught in the fight for personal survival
bu t also they becom e active participants in the unforgettable anguished confusion of
rescue, resuscitation and evacuation. Som e peop le will have k n o w led g e and skills
that are valuable. Such skills and experience, how ever advanced, cannot prepare
th em for the horror of the experience. Those w ithout such skills help as best they
can, often subsequently torm ented by recollections of their helplessn ess as people
d ie d in their presence. It is not unusual for survivors to feel both a 'guilt' of survival
and a 'guilt' that they could or should have 'don e more' to assist those w h o died.




1 T h is section focuses on the experience of those w ho surviv ed Hillsborough. T hose in Lockerbie w ho survived
th e fall of the fuselage of Flight 103 on their town, or w ho escaped or w itnessed the sin king of the Marchioness,
h a v e sim ilar experiences to recount. T he focus here on H illsborough reflects the research data.

   Surviving a disaster is, inevitably, a life-changing experience, and the establishm ent
   of post-disaster psychosocial teams represents a recognition of the support necessary
   for survivors in the longer-term aftermath o f disaster. In large-scale disasters,
   however, it is often the case that in the im m ediate aftermath, survivors, w hatever the
   traumatic dim ensions of their experience, sim ply 'go hom e', leaving the site; their
   suffering, their needs and their contributions unrecorded and unrecognised.

   Paul Taylor's wife, for example, w o k e during the night of 14 April 1989. She told
  him that she did not want him to g o to the football match at H illsborough the
  follow ing day as she had an unaccountable feeling that he w ould be hurt. On the
  w ay to the match, Paul joked about her 'premonition' w ith his friends, Steve and                   i pj
  Jimmy, and his brother-in-law, Eifion. They laughed that on the terraces maybe
  som ebody w ould step on Paul's painful in-grow ing toe-nail (Paul Taylor, personal                  !
  interview).

  Arriving at the stadium, accom panying tw o children, Sue Swift found herself caught
  in the crush outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles. It was:

        ... just mad. There was no control, there w as no queueing, there w as
        nothing. I just pushed the kids in front o f me, trying to get in ... It just
        got tighter and tighter. I rem em ber there w as a pregnant w om an in
        front of me, she was screaming. It just got w orse and worse. (Sue
        Swift, personal interview)

  She managed to enter the ground, noticing several police officers, just inside the
  turnstiles. When she shouted angrily that they should be doing som ething and that
  people outside were going to die, she w as threatened w ith arrest if she did not m ove
 on. She took the children to their seats and w en t to her ow n, at the w est end o f the
 North Stand, overlooking the Leppings Lane pens to her right side. She noticed the
 em ptiness of the side pens compared w ith the pens behind the goal, "I looked d ow n
 and you could just see that things w eren't right in there. There w as no m ovem ent,
 like there usually is, it was just a block."

 By 2.40 pm behind the goal on the Leppings Lane terrace, Paul Taylor thought that             !
 the crowd w as becoming "compacted". Ten m inutes later he and another fan locked
 their knees against the fence so that other fans could use them to clim b’ over the
radial fence to the right of Pen 3, accessing the virtually em pty terrace alongside.
Ten minutes later he noticed that som e o f the p eop le he w as helping over w ere w et
w ith urine, som e smelling of faeces. The last person he helped out w as his brother-             '
in-law. Paul declined to be helped out. A big man, but shy, he recollected saying,
"No, know ing my luck I'll be dangling off the railings and everyone'll be laughing"!
He reflected that his concern to avoid embarrassment m ight have cost him his life.

Peter Power had follovved Liverpool since the 1960s. He once knocked on the front
door at the hom e of famous Liverpool Manager, Bill Shankly, to request an
autograph and was invited in for tea. On 15 April 1989 he struggled for his life in
the same pen as Paul Taylor. The pen became so full that it w as "just like being in a


                                          80
                                                                                              ■h

  vice". He was against the barrier that even tually collapsed and could feel it m oving
  under the weight of bodies com pressed from the back of the terrace.

         When that barrier w as m ovin g I really thought I w as going to die. I
         thought, if this goes over, it's n ot just go in g to go over and w e can get
         out, they're all g oin g to just pile on top of m e, I've just got to get out.
         (Peter Power, personal interview)

 H e did not remember how , but he m a n aged to clim b into the em pty adjacent pen.
 Others, like Bob Jones escaped to the rear o f the pen, from w here they w ere pulled
 up into the West Stand by other fans. From there h e reached d ow n to assist others
 w h o w ere trying to escape into the stand:

        There was nobody shouting orders or nothing, but for som e reason
        som ething just clicked into gear w ith everyone. I pulled this girl up
        and she w as shouting to pull up her boyfriend but I didn't know' w ho
        he was ... You were just putting y o u r hands d o w n and shutting your
        eyes and w hoever grabbed you, y o u w as pulling them up like. A nd it
        turned out it w as her fella, and they w ere just like hugging and kissing,
        and I remember thinking it w as like som ethin g off a film. (Bob Jones,
        personal interview)

 H e recalled with anger that w hile the fans w ere trying desperately to help, som e
 police officers w ere doing the opposite:

        All the other stuff w as goin g on, w ith the coppers at the front. You
        kn ow the w ay the railings com e ... and as peop le w ere getting over the       ■
        coppers were throwing them back. I even seen som eone w ith his
        truncheon hitting som eone.

In the North Stand, Sue Swift w as also w itn essin g the fans' escape from the pens:

        ... people w ere just com ing over the top, and getting onto the pitch. All
       hell let loose then. It w as distressing being there and not being able to
       do anything. You could see the p o lice putting people back in ... You
       could just see this disorganization. The police just standing round all
       the time, and then I remember the am bulance com ing on ... People on
       the pitch, you could see them ju st dropping, and people trying to
       resuscitate them.

For those still in the pens, struggling for their lives, the personal fear and the deaths
o f others surrounded them. Peter Carney tried to m anoeuvre him self into a position
to the front o f a barrier. He remem bered v iv id ly the sights and sounds of the crush:




                                           81
                                                                                 T M C

        Listening to a fella w h o w as apologising, and 1 can remember that as
        clear as a bell, he w as apologisin g for bringing his kid ... Time and time
        again, "I'll never bring you again, w e'll be all right once w e get out of
        this lad, w e're not com ing to the football no more." (Peter Carnev,
        personal interview )

Once in front of the barrier Peter discovered:

       There w as no w ay I could use m y arms. My arms w ere at m y sides. I
       w as on m y tip-toes m ost of the time, and I m ade a conscious decision
       to concentrate on m y breathing ... Seeing the colours on the faces, one
       lad, I know he died, stood next to m e so I gave up on w atching people
       around me and I concentrated on m y breathing.

Peter felt that he lost consciousness, and remembered looking d ow n on himself,
before the thought of his partner and baby son brought him "back again". In severe
pain and unable to see, he w as carried back up the tunnel at the back of the pens. He
fell into unconsciousness.

Eddie Spearritt entered Leppings Lane through a main egress gate on the direction
of the police. He w as w ith his son A dam and had stood back from the crow ding
outside the ground so as to avoid the crush. Together they w alked through the gate,
d ow n the central tunnel beneath the stand and into Pen 4. It w as m inutes before the
kick-off and they m anaged to m ove d o w n the terrace to a position close to the
perimeter track.

       The crush came, and I have heard this w ord several tim es, this word           ‘
       surge, It w asn't a surge. It w as like a vice just getting tighter and
       tighter and tighter. I turned Adam round to me. He w as obviously in
       distress. There w as a Police Officer just slightly to m y right about five
       or six feet aw ay and I started begging him to open the gate. When I
      say in my statem ent that I w as scream ing, I literally m ean screaming.
       A dam at this time had fainted and m y actual w ords, although they are
      not on a statem ent were, "My lovely son is dying", and begging him to
      help me and he didn't do anything. H e just stood there looking at me.
      I realised he w asn't going to do anything so I grabbed hold o f A dam ...
      and I tried to lift him over the (perimeter) fence, and the fence is 10 feet
      thereabouts w ith spikes com ing in. I couldn't lift him. So I then
     started punching the fence in the hope that I m ight punch it d ow n ... all
     I m anaged to do w as to make m y hands double in size and full of holes
     w here I had actually punched the fence. N o one opened that gate.
     Right at the beginning w hen I w as b egging the Officer to open the gate,
     if he w ould have opened it then I k n ow I could have got A dam out. I
     know that because 1 w as there and know what the situation was.
     (Eddie Spearritt, verbal evidence to the Inquest)
  A dam w as pronounced dead soon after his arrival at the N orthern General Hospital
  E ddie regained consciousness the follow in g day. H is hospital records begin at 5 pm
  on his adm ission to the Intensive Care Unit.         H e has no k n o w led g e of his
  w hereabouts betw een 3.05 pm and 5 pm.

 Paul Taylor w as unsure exactly w hat w as happening, ev en th ough he had helped
 p eop le out of the pen. Unable to m ove, he w a s crushed against the right hand radial
 fence, w hile fans on the other side tried to pu sh him back aw ay from it. H e sa w a
 y o u n g man in front o f him change colour, but still the realisation that p eo p le w ere
 d yin g around him did not sink in. H e recalled speaking through the fence to a
 police officer:

        ... 1 said to the copper w h o w as like on the railings "W hen you're
        going blue doesn't that m ean you're dying?" A nd he said so m eth in g
        like "Don't be alarmed, don't be stupid". A nd he w a s g o in g even
        brighter blue. I said "He's blue! D oesn't that m ean you're dead. I
        thought you w ere dead w hen y o u w ere blue." H e said "D on't be
        stupid." ... After that I lost track o f the lad, and it w as o n ly later on            -
        w hen w e w ere picking p eople off the floor, he w as on the floor. H e'd
        obviously died standing up. (Paul Taylor, personal interview )

 A s fans escaped, Paul felt the crush abate. Then, seein g a p ile o f b o d ies at the front
 o f Pen 3, he realised w h at had happened. The horror o f that sig h t still liv es w ith
 him . H e compares it to newsreel film footage of N azi concentration cam ps w ith
 "body on body".

       They were about eight or nine deep on the floor, p eop le stacked up. .
       What I was doing was tilting their head back and if they lo o k ed like
       they were breathing and just num b ... then y o u 'd just physically drag
       them o u t ... and threw them behind you, because there seem ed to be a
       gap that had opened up betw een the peop le who- w ere just standing
       there, and couldn't believe w hat w a s happening and the p eo p le w h o
       were actually helping.

Bob Jones, also looking dow n from the W est Stand, rem em bered the sight as the
crush eased:

       W hen it quietened d ow n in the p ens they w ere all just
       standing...Everyone w ho could get ou t took a few yards back and then
       the ones at the front, you could see them like ... falling like. (Bob Jones,
       personal interview)

U nderstanding the gravity of what had happened, Bob w en t d o w n into the p en to
see if he could help. H e was shocked by w hat he found:
                                                                                       ~ W   .B       k
                                                                                                  *


          You w ere getting people like, and y ou were thinking like ... these are
          just ... like dead ... You thought they're not breathing like, they're not
          even m ovin g, and the colour of them like. A nd there were more and
          more o f them being taken o u t ...

  Frantically trying to save their iellow fans, survivors w ere w ell aware o f their lack of
  first-aid skills. Yet, in the absence of experienced help and assistance, they tried
  desperately to help. O ne survivor remembered trying to help a "young lad":

          ... I tilted h ii head back and 1 was trying to give him the kiss of life, and
         he w as sick in m y mouth. So I started being sick, and then w hen I went
         to help him again his tongue had gone right d ow n and I couldn't get
         his tongue out because m y fingers w ere wet. I didn't kn ow that if I'd
         turned him on his side at the time that his tongue w ouldn't have gone.
         I didn't know . Som eone said then, "He's dead", and I took his anorak
         off that he had tied around his waist and put it over his head, and just
         helped a few more, (personal interview)

  From the stands p eop le w itnessed the tragedy. For m any it w as clear what was
  happening but they felt pow erless to intervene. They could see those on the terrace
  and on the pitch trying desperately to save lives. Sue Swift recalled:

         The fans w ere just organising them selves, getting onto the hoardings
         and pulling them dow n. They were actually w orking quite w e l l ... But
         w hat w ou ld y ou have done on there? There w as nothing y ou could
         have done ... They were pounding each others' chests and doing
        m outh-to-m outh. But unless you k n ow what you are doing ... I m ean >
        there w ere plenty of people doing it, but whether they w ere doing it
        right or w rong, I m ean they couldn't have know n either. I saw this
        little lad com in g off with, it must have been his dad. A nd I just
        remember him , the copper m ust have said, you know , there's nothing
        doing here, and it w as the kid's dad. They had to pull the kid off and
        cover this fella s head up. (Sue Swift, personal interview)

Realising the extent of the deaths and feeling unable to help, Sue decided to leave.
She could not cope w ith the scenes unfolding before her.

 Doctors, nurses, param edics and others w ith first-aid skills w h o w ere at the gam e
 w ent onto the pitch to help. Eileen McBride, an accident and em ergency nurse, was
in the West Stand w ith her partner. Leaving the stand at the rear, she approached
police officers, but w as told that what was happening w as a "public order problem".
She insisted that p eo p le were dying, and w as taken by an officer to the opposite end
of the ground, from w here she entered the pitch area. She checked p eople w ho were
laid out on the ground, gradually m oving tow ards the pens w here the crushing had
occurred. There, she helped lift a man out o f Pen 3. He w as dead. She recalled
being asked by a police officer to check whether a man he had covered w as actually
dead:


                                            84
                                                                                         Ix k    n/*)


         This really got to me. The idea that h e'd actually covered som eone but
         w asn't sure if he w as dead. A s it h a p p en ed , he was. (Eileen McBride,
         personal interview)

 She m et up w ith a doctor, w h o had g o n e to the match w ith som e m edical students,
 and together they w ent to the g y m n asiu m . There w ere tw o ambulances outside and
 she saw a you n g boy w h o w as "alive, but h e w asn 't very well". H e subsequently
 died. At first Eileen and the doctor w ere not adm itted to the gym nasium . The
 doctor insisted that he and Eileen co u ld h elp , and they pushed through. Inside the
 g ym n asiu m she helped exam ine the " w alking w ound ed " , and im m obilised a child
 w h o w as suffering chest pains. H er frustration m ounted. W hen she asked for a pair
 o f scissors she was told that the first-aid eq u ip m en t w as, "three quarters of the w ay
 round the ground", and sh e w a s g iv e n a p en-knife by a police officer. Although
 o x yg en w as needed the cylinders in the g y m n a siu m w ere empty. At on e point the
 doctor considered perform ing a tracheotom y o n the child; Eileen "just thought, h o w
 do you do that here?"

 Behind the W est Stand, Peter C arney recovered consciousness. H e w as lying in the
 recovery position to the right sid e o f the tunnel entrance in a row o f p eople w ho
 w ere dead. His vision slo w ly returned, but he remembered that initially all the
 colours w ere of extreme intensity. N ex t to h im so m eon e placed a jacket over the face
 o f a dead man.

       The thought that kept g o in g th rou gh m y m ind w as "I'm here, I'm
       here".     I w as just thankful, lo o k in g at that fella, and probably
       subconsciously thinking, "That's m e". A nd the coppers w h o w ere
       standing there w ere neither u se nor fucking ornament. They were .
       literally just m inding the dead ... (Peter Carney, personal interview)

A friend em erged from the tunnel, and w e n t over to Peter. H e tried to shake him, to
bring him around:

       The pain w as just unbelieveable. W ell I could feel m y arms and upper
       body again, but I couldn't feel m y le g s, I did n't have no legs as far as I
       knew.

H e w as exam ined briefly by Dr John A sh to n , and .although he w as not p u t into one
o f the first ambulances, this did not bother him . Despite his condition he felt
relieved to be alive. Even in these dire circum stances survivors gave each other
w h at support they could.

       There w as a fella next to m e and I had a little thing w ith him, not that 1
       could talk, but w here w e w ere sq u e e z in g each other and that. H e w as
       badly injured. I didn't feel like 1 w as b ad ly injured, you know.

Peter w as full of praise for those trying to help, and for the ambulance and hospital
staff he met subsequently:


                                            85
                                                                                    ' W

          From John Ashton on, they were so in control, and there s no way thev
          deserve any stick, because yo u 'v e got to im agine this courtyard, it was
          like three walls, it w as like a triangle, and one wall I know for a fact
          w as lined w ith the dead, and the other tw o w alls w ere lined with the
          injured in varying degrees.

  Yet still the primary medical help w as not part of an official response:

         It w as only survivors or p eople w h o had com e from the stands. That
         w as h o w John Ashton cam e to be there. It w as spontaneous and
         intuitive, and it w as in no w ay organised by the authorities.

  Peter felt that the police sh ow ed no consideration of survivors' experiences or needs.
  They gave the survivors no support. H e noted that w hile several police officers were
   m inding a relatively few dead people, about 150 injured survivors lay against the
  other walls, "recovering from the m ost traumatic thing that they're ever going to be
  asked to encounter in all their days on the planet." Eventually Peter was put into an
  am bulance and taken to Sheffield's Northern General Hospital. H e was convinced
  that he had lost the use of his legs.

 Still in the pens, Paul Taylor helped to carry the last bodies from Pen 3, His
 em otions were surging and he refused to hand over one dead young man to the
 police:

        I didn't want the police to have him. I remembered back to before the
        gam e had started, the policem en w hen people w ere trying to climb up
        on the fence and they w ere hitting them w ith their sticks on their            ‘
        fingers ... I thought N o you re not having him", but eventually I had                                \
        to let him go. (Paul Taylor, personal interview)                                      if*                 \

 H e w as reunited w ith his brother-in-law, Eifion, and they stood holding each other
 for a while. A number of fans rem ained in the pen. Sitting on the steps, in the rear

                                                                                                          }

Peter Power, w h o had been sitting on the ground since his escape from the pen left
at about the sam e time. Bob Jones had also decided that he could do no more. He
w a s glad that he w as alone, as fans around him w ere searching and calling for
friends or relatives they had lost. H e left the stadium and w alked away along a row             \

of ambulances, "bumper to bumper".                                                            /

 In the gym nasium , Eileen McBride found it increasingly harrowing, and difficult to
cope. She remembered a man w h o drifted in and out of consciousness: "He kept
say in g 'Don't worry, please look for m y boy"'. She noticed tw o "kids" from the St
John's Ambulance, taking nam es of the m issing and com piling a list of those already
dead. She helped two police officers w ho were searching the dead for evidence of
identification, but then she decided "'1 can't do this' and left them ... I'd just had
enough".

 Survivors in th e Im m ediate Aftermath

 As Eileen left the gymnasium, sh e realised that she had no know ledge as to the
 w hereabouts of her partner, w ith w h om sh e had travelled to the match. She had no
 tickets for the return journey to I iverpool, and no money. She went back towards
 the pitch and w as challenged by a police officer w ho asked her where she w as going.

        I said to him "I've got no m oney, no ticket home, I'm on m y own". H e
        said "What do you want m e to do about it? The ground's been em pty
        for ages". I walked away and onto the pitch. A kid came up ... he w as
        scream ing that he had lost his mate. I started walking towards
        Leppings Lane and then I heard the shout "Let's go!". It was ... (her
        partner). H e'd been looking for me.

 T hose fans w h o w ere able to leave H illsborough and begin their journeys hom e were
 left to com prehend the enormity of w hat had happened. Many, like Peter Power
 and Sue Swift, tried to telephone their fam ilies, realising that they w ould be worried.
 A lthough queues w ere long, local people allow ed fans to u se their hom e telephones.
 M any remained uncertain as to the fate of friends or fam ily w ho had gone w ith them
 to the match. Bob Jones, w alking back to his car alone remembered the atm osphere
 around him:

       It w as just unbelieveable. A lot o f p eop le w ere just running around,
       mad, looking for som eone else. There w ere fellas just sitting there on
       walls, stunned. (Bob Jones, personal interview)

A t the coaches people waited for others to return, grow ing increasingly anxious
about those m issing. Peter Power w as the last to arrive at his coach, bringing delight
and relief to those waiting. N obody from his coach had died. On other coaches the
uncertainty w as not so quickly resolved. Sue Swift remembers one fan returning to
her coach w ithout his brother:

       H e w as com pletely manic, no shoes or nothing. Then w e w ere like
       trawling around the hospitals ... We found him in the hospital (at about
       7.30 pm ). H e'd broken his arm. (Sue Swift, personal interview)

Peter Carney w as one of those w h o had been taken to hospital. A lthough he had lost
the use of his legs and his pow ers of speech, this did not strike him as important at
the time. H e w as alive. W hen he reached hospital he w as examined and x-rayed
and the feeling began to return to his legs. H e felt extreme pain in his chest. He
praised the hospital staff, describing the scenes as:

      M adness ... no, not m adness, and not panic, but people flying
      everyw here. The doctor came in and his eyes were so big, and his head
      w as all over the place, bouncing around you know, not that he rushed
      treating me, you know, he gave me a full examination. But it w as b u sy.
      (Peter Carney, personal interview)


                                           87
  Despite the fact that he was allocated a bed on a w ard, Peter w as determ ined to
  leave. He "chased" his mate to go back for the car and to find out what had
  happened to their three friends. Peter felt that his injuries did not warrant him
  "wasting" a m uch-needed hospital bed. He explained his thoughts:

         H ow do I get out of here? I've got to get out o f here, I can't stay here.
         Because I knew that there w as people dead in there. I knew that there
         w as people badly injured and I knew that w hatever injuries I had, they
         weren't nothing compared to no-one else.

  At first he w as told that he could not leave the hospital for at least tw enty-four hours
  but he consciously tried to relax himself. An hour later he asked to see a doctor. His
  blood pressure had dropped, and he told the doctor (falsely) that his pain w as no
  longer intense, and then he w as allow ed to go hom e w ith his friend.

 For m any survivors the journey back to Liverpool had an unreal, dream -like quality,
 punctuated by the radio reports of an ever-increasing death-toll. Paul Taylor, unable
 to cry, w as told by a friend that he spent the w hole journey staring at the w ind ow .
 Sue Swift was "gone" by then:

        From getting in that ground and looking at the terraces it w as like m y
        head had gone in a bubble. I couldn't break out o f it for days, w eeks. 1
        w as just sitting there on m y ow n. I mean I knew m ost people there but
        I w as on m y own. I w as just like angry you k n ow ... devastated
        everybody w as just ripped apart. (Sue Swift, personal interview)

 Even in the hours that im m ediately followed the disaster som e o f those Who
 survived already were thinking about how they w ould "manage" the im pact of the
experience on their lives.        Bob Jones drove over to his partner's parents in
Manchester, before returning to Bristol with her. On M onday he w as starting a new
job in Bristol as a manager and it w as to be their "big break". The significance of the
change had been heightened for him by the new s that m orning, that Jill, his partner,
w as expecting their first child. As he drove to Manchester he thought:

        I ve just got to put it behind me. That's where things started g o in g
       wrong because I knew that Jill couldn't handle it ... I don't think that
       she could have looked after me, if I had opened up to her. I bottled it
       up because I had to start this new job on the M onday. I didn't even
       know if anybody I kn ew w as dead, because w e had to drive back to
       Bristol on the Sunday. Shutting it off, it seem ed so easy at the time.
       (Bob Jones, personal interview)

Paul Taylor returned to Liverpool to a "hero's welcom e". From the stands his
friends had seen him pulling peop le out of the pile in the pens and trying to revive
them. In passing on the news that he was safe they had described his actions. When
the taxi pulled up outside his h ou se a crowd had gathered.
              When we got hom e the street w as, w ell, people from dow n the street
              w ho I'd never seen, they w ere all standing outside our h o u se as w e
              pulled up in the taxi, and m e m ate's w ife said "Here's the hero". And
              1 ,1 didn t feel like the hero, I just w anted to com e into the hou se. I just '
              sat on a chair in the kitchen and they said at the time that I w a s starting
              to go , rocking backwards and forwards, and they were trying to
             calm m e dow n. A nd it w a s only w hen Julie cam e in w ith M ichael (his           §
             son, aged six weeks) that I reacted, bursting o u t in tears that had been             ;       ^
             held back. And they said that I w en t uncontrollable, h old ing onto the             j
             baby, and they had to call the doctor to knock m e out, put m e to bed                     *
             and put m e on Diazepam, and for nearly nine m onths after it w a s like
             one big buzz ... My o w n doctor w en t m ad w h en he found o u t ... For
             about tw o w eeks after I couldn't really rem em ber anything about
             Hillsborough. (Paul Taylor, persona] interview)

     Eileen McBride, despite having helped amid the chaos o f the g ym n a siu m , left
     Hillsborough unacknowledged. It w as a silent train journey back to Liverpool,
     w here they were met by police officers asking p eople to ring h om e to let relatives
     k n o w that they w ere safe. She and her partner w en t into a packed pu b, w here the
     television was on.

             John Smith (Liverpool FC Chairman) w as going o n about Liverpool not
             getting back-into Europe. People w en t berserk:"Tum that sh it off!"
             (Eileen McBride, personal interview)

     She recognised that her partner w as in shock. She told him not to drink too m uch
     and to eat something. On their w ay to collect their baby they stopped at a chip shop,
     but they could not eat and w ent on to her mother's house. H er partner:

            ... sat with the baby ... he never spoke ... he w as go in g into shock. We
           left at about one in the morning. H e sat in the chair w ith the baby until
           5 am then put the baby to bed. H e w as up again at 7 am. H e w ou ld n 't
0          answer the phone to the fam ily and he left at about 11 am ... H e
           functioned on: "It didn't happen".

     Peter Power arrived back in Liverpool, leaving the coach at Priory Road, near
    A nfield football ground. There seem ed to be thousands of p eop le w aitin g for
    coaches to return. After reading the latest estimates o f the dead in the L iverp o o l Echo
    P in k he m ade his way home. It "hit him" on the Sunday. H is brother cam e to the
    hou se to see if he was well. Later he sa w his mother. H er cousin had been killed in
    the disaster and she had visited the family.

           (Peter's brother) ... burst out crying and then I burst out crying. I w as
           going worse then. I w as crying my eyes out on the couch, and m y
           mam s crying, it w as terrible. (Peter Power, personal interview)




                                               89
 The next day he w ent to w ork w here a colleague sh o w ed him the D a ily M irror. Me
 was in the two page photograph of fans being crushed. H e w as shocked by how
 close he w as to those being crushed at the front of the crow d. He felt that he could
 not stay at work and w as a llo w ed to leave, g o in g w ith his boss to Liverpool's
 ground at Anfield. Peter found his w ork colleagues and boss very supportive in the
 follow ing weeks. H e did not seek counselling nor other help in the immediate
 aftermath, although he w a s aw are that others did. Further, he did not speak to the
 police, claim com pensation or approach the disaster fund. As far as he was
 concerned, "I v?as lucky to be alive, that w as m y reward".

 While all survivors w ere outraged at the m edia coverage of H illsborough, it was
 particularly difficult for those liv in g a w a y from Liverpool. In Bristol, Bob Jones felt
 that people did not understand; it w a s not "their" disaster. His only contact with
 Hillsborough was through the m edia, and he collected all the new spapers as they
 covered the disaster. D espite this he tried to take his mind off his personal
 experiences through work:

       I w as working tw elv e hours a day ... trying to keep m yself busy. And
       Jill, of course, she w as w orried about me. I rem em ber sh e said things
       like I should stop b u yin g all the new spapers, because I w as buying
       e v ery newspaper ... I just felt so isolated d o w n there ... I'd be at w ork, or
       I'd be out and just through talking, som eb od y'd find out I w as there.
       A nd they'd ask "Did p eo p le really piss on the (dead) fans?" "Were
       people really g o in g through their pockets?" A nd that put a different
       angle on things, a different edge. Then it becam e frightening that.
       You're thinking like, "H old on, everybody is believing this". (Bob
       Jones, personal interview )

In Liverpool, on the M onday after the disaster, Peter Carney bought a football with
the intention of placing it on the penalty sp ot at A nfield w hich he had heard was
open to fans. This he did, w riting a m essage on the ball: •

       I w as doing som ething that I th ought w as of use to the dead, you know
       w hat I mean, or p ayin g m y respects, or som ethin g like th a t... A lthough
       taking a ball and putting it on the penalty spot, it doesn't seem like a
       normal way to m ourn the d ead does it? It's just spontanaeity isn't it?
       Just responding in the w a y that you think at the time. (Peter Carney,
       personal interview)

On the Tuesday, returning to the ground he decided to m ake a banner, a tribute to
the dead, which he com pleted by the Friday.

Sue Swift managed to ring h om e before her fam ily had seen the new s of the disaster.
After a quiet day on the Sunday, sh e returned to w ork at a local university the
follow ing day. She later learned that the university had arranged counselling for
those em ployees affected by the disaster.       Unfortunately, the person in her
department w ho took the telephone call about the initiative told the caller that
                                                                                   Dot n/f(,
 nobody in the departm ent had been involved. It w as seven months later, finding
 herself increasingly irritable and em otional, that she contacted Liverpool Social
 Services.

 Surviving: E p ilogu e

 A lthough Peter P ow er continued w orking, he had frequent flashbacks to the
 disaster. H e found that they hap p en ed particularly if he w as on his o w n in the
 house. H e could feel the barrier m o v in g . The flashbacks m ade him realise that he
 needed to talk to so m eo n e about his experiences and, h avin g heard of the Centre set
 up by Social Services, he called in after a Liverpool match. An ev en in g group for
 survivors w as set u p and he w as invited to attend. A lth ough he felt that it w a s a
 necessary process to go through, the prospect scared him:

       The funny thing w as I actually got there early and w aited by the
       church on the corner. And I'm sayin g to m yself "If nobody goes in, I'm
       not going in, I'm not going in o n m y own" and I couldn't see anyone
       g oin g in. W hen I w ent in it w a s packed. T hey all had cars and they'd
       com e round the back! (Peter Pow er, personal interview )                           ___

According to his partner, Paul Taylor becam e w ith d raw n in the w eeks fo llo w in g the
disaster, sitting around "like a zom bie". H e w o u ld n ot w ash, whereas norm ally, as a
man w ho w orked in'dirty jobs, he w a s m eticulous over personal hygiene.

        I started sm ashing things. If I had a cup in m y hand, next m inute it
        w o u ld be g o in g at the w all ... I just had a cob on for nothing. T hese
        doors are solid now , because it w as costing us a fortune w ith the •
        panels. It g o t that bad in the end ... there w a s a w o o d shop up the
       road, he actually cut me an eig h t by four sheet o f ply into squares to fit
       the panels, because I w as d o in g it regular, every w eek I w as sm ashing
       doors and p u lling them off w alls. I had never don e that in m y life. I
       k n ew I w as d oin g it but l just couldn't stop it I w a s so angry ... W e had
       a dinner table, and I just pu nched and split that up w ith m y f i s t ... the
       baby's high chair, I just w recked that one day ...' (Paul Taylor, personal
       interview)

Eventually he w as persuaded to go to a church for a m em orial service for som eon e
w h o had been killed in the disaster. This m ade matters worse:

      W hen they started playing "Walk On" I just w en t mad and I w en t
      outside and I w as shaking. A nd by the tim e w e got hom e, m e and this
      other lad ... w e w ere so w o u n d up that they actually got an ambulance
      and took us to hospital and I spent the night being spoken to by a
      psychiatrist. They had to tie m y hands onto the wheelchair because the
      nurses said they were frightened. I w ould n't w alk anywhere, and by
      n o w I think I had shot up to about eighteen stone from m y original

           out and eat it, flour, y ou know , it w as fucking stupid.

   A lth ough he felt he had to give up his job, he later obtained casual work as a
   bricklayer and a labourer. H e became depressed, crying for m uch of the time.
   V isited by a local social w orker on a daily basis eventually he agreed to attend the
   n ew ly established Centre. H e w as led in by the hand by another fan feeling "like a
   little kid going to school on the first day".

   W hile he found the service at the Centre generally helpful, his distress w as made
I w orse by his agreem ent to help the police in their investigations. H e remembered
ft so m eb o d y checking one y o u n g fan's pulse as he tried to help her and later recalled
] that the hand that had com e over his shoulder had been gloved . When he
I m entioned this to the deceased girl's parents they told the investigating police. The
   police officers then visited Paul.

          H e said "Well you never m entioned (the glove) in your statem ent you
          gave to the first police officers ... (or to the psychiatrist)". I said "Well,
          I'm remembering things n o w , that I'd blanked ou t o f m y m ind ..." He
          said "Well do you k n o w if you say this and it is proved not to be true it
          is perjury and you could be fined or even (go to) jail". W ell m e and
          Julie, once he-left w e spoke about it and w e thought it w as best not to
          say nothing ;about it again because at the time, Julie w asn't working, I
          w as on a crap w age, and M ichael w as only yo u n g and she w as saying
          "I don't want you to g o to prison and leave m e and Michael". So w hen.,,
                                    ich again, I said it w as a npstake, and I don't
          think they w as very happy

  Bob Jones felt that the after-effects of the disaster cost him his job, and his family's
  big chance:

         (Hillsborough) w as alw ays on your m ind ... and that'd stpp you , you'd
         forget to put an order in, or set the machinery a certain w a y and you
         lost your m anagem ent skills. You w ent to extremes, so y ou were
         (either) narky and nobody could talk to you ... or you'd let them do
         w hat they w anted. So instead of getting things running sm oothly,
         som etim es I'd just be in the store-room where I k n ew I could be on my
         ow n. (Bob Jones, personal interview)

 Feeling that taking leave w o u ld have been difficult at the firm for w hich he worked,
 he never w ent to see a doctor, nor took time off for illness. There w ere no teams of
 disaster social workers in Bristol. His only involvem ent w ith official agencies was
 w h en the police interview ed him after he called their advertised telephone line.
 Even this caused problems, how ever, as they called at his hom e on a day different to
 that arranged, and he received a telephone call from Jill w hile he w as at work.
 Feeling that he could not tell his n ew boss that he had to go hom e to m eet the CID,
 he left work w ithout telling anybody. He worked until 1 am the next morning to

9th March 1990


Dear

You will almostcertainly have seen some press or media reports this week of
the Coroner's intention to re-open the Hillsborough Inquests and now that I
have all the relevant     information to hand I am writing to you to put you
fully in the picture.

In response to an invitation issued by H.M. Coroner I went to the Coroner's
Court in the Medico-Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield on Tuesday of
this week together with four members of the Hillsborough Family Support
Group Committee and having told us what was in his mind and then having
heard representations from myself and other Solicitors representing various
interested bodies Dr. S. L. Popper confirmed that he will resume Che 95
Inquests on a strictly limited basis on the 18th April 1990,

H.M Coroner has been under considerable pressure from a variety of sources
recently notable the Steering Committee on which I sit, the Family support
Group and the Solicitors acting for South Yorkshire 'Police to release
certain information in advance of the resumption of the Inquests ... the
maiority of that pressure relates to the release of what Dr. Popper    calls
"non-controversial information" which many of you want and which, strictly
speaking, has nothing to do with any civil claim which you are making or any
potential criminal proceedings.

As a result of their investigation into the Hillsborough Disaster for Lord
Justice Taylor and then for the Director of Public Prosecutions and also for
H.M. Coroner himself officers of West Midlands Police have amassed a great
deal of information about the movements of most (but not all) of tlte 95 fans
who died m the tragedy and that information is contained in the statements,
still photographs, sections of video film etc held by West Midlands Pol ice
in Birmingham.    It is not possible for either West Midlands Police, the
Director of Public Prosecutions or H.M.      Coroner to release ail this
information at this stage because scsoe of it relates to the criminal
aspect of the investigation but it is possible to extract from each of the)
95 separate files detailed information about the novements of each fan iron:
the time they left home until the time death was certified in the temporary
mortuary at the ground or in hospital and these summaries are currently in
 the course of preparation.                                                               ]5           M M1I,.vliY,                                                                    ,,                „

The summaries are being prepared by senior officers from the West Midlands
force and are then being scrutinized by other more senior officers and then
by Dr. Popper himself before they are released to ensure that they contain  -
n o controversial details and that they a r e accurate and as detailed as
possible in the circumstances.

The Director of Public Prosecutions as confirmed to H.M. Coroner that this
controversial information my now be released to the families in accordance
with a strictly laid down procedure and this procedure is as follows.

As soon as possible copies of the summaries relating to each deceased fan
for whose family I act will be sent to me and as soon as I get it I will be
in touch with you immediately.
No photograph or video film extracts will be issued to us along with the
summary but references to this will almost certainly be included and 1    or
any reason you particular want to see the photographs or video film
then the Coroner will consider your request. The Coroner does not feel that
the supplying of photographs etc is necessary at this stage, you will almost
certainly have seen the photographs and video footage already as part of
your discussions with West Midlands Police officers who have been to your
home.
A "flow chart" may also be issued (although no firm decision has been made
about this yet) and these charts will show the movement of each fan within
certain time bands and will identify the individual (whether a relative, a
member of the public or a police officer) who identifies fan at a particular
spot or at a particular time prior to or following his or her death.

I do not propose simply sending you a copy of the summary when I receive it,
I will let you know that I have it and invite you to either ask for a copy
or let you call to the office so that I can go through it with you and you
can then decide whether you wnat to have a copy to take home. It is likely
that the summary will contain information which might cause stress and I
have no wish to do this.
If when you have seen the summary you are satisfied with its contents then
you may decide not to go to Sheffield for its formal presentation to H.M.
Coroner in open Court but on the other hand if you would like to go over
when the summary is being prevented you will be made weleone by H.M. Coroner
and his staff and myself.
 I will be in Sheffield for the entire duration of the resumed inquests and
 when I see or speak to you when the summary arrives I will give you details
 of my movements in Sheffield, perhaps we could meet before your summary is
 presented or even afterwards for a chat.

 If you do decide to go to Sheffield then you might like to have your social
 worker with you (if you are still in touch with him or her); Sheffield
 Social Services Department have made arrangements for a number of members 01
 that Department to be present in Court during the presentation of all the
 summaries and you may find that their services would be helpful.

 The officer from West Midlands Police who will present the summary is likely
 to meet you before your Inquest begins and fill you in with last minute
                                                                         l> o c

details, he will then take you into Court and you will be able to hear
present the evidence and he will then leave the Court with you and take you
to a quite room from which the press and public will be excluded and you
will be offered a cup of tea and given an opportunity to gather your
thoughts I regret that I will not be able not be able to spend very much
time with you personally either immediately before or either your Inquest
because I will have to remain in Court to deal with the case both before and
after yours ... I will be there not only as your Solicitor but also as a
member of the Hillsborough Steering Committee.

As I have said each summary will be presented personally by the officer who
prepared it in accordance with a timetable which will be published as soon
as possible and it is hoped that 8 summaries a day can be received by H.M.
Coroner who will sit in open court with a jury.



The press and public will be allowed into Court, we imagine that press
interest will diminsh after the first couple of day once they realise that
these Inquests are very "low key" and no one will have the opportunity to
cross examine police officers, club officials etc as they will not be giving
evidence.

At the conclusion of the presentation of the 95 summaries the Coroner will
adjourn his jury without asking them to return any verdict.

In the event that the Director of Public Prosecutions then subsequently
instigates criminal proceedings against any individual or organization or
any individual instigates criminal proceedings if the D.D.P. decides not to
proceed then it is likely (but not certain) that the Coroner will adopt the
decision of the Crown Court Jury and make a formal finding in accordance
with it i.e. if a conviction for manslaughter was returned then he would
adopt that verdict for his own Inquests and he would not therefore need to
recall his jury. If on the other hand no criminal proceedings were brought
then H.M. Coroner would reconvene his jury following the announcement by the
D.D.P. of his intention not to pursue the matter and he would receive
evidence of a generic nature as to what happened in and around the stadium
on the 15th April and invite the jury to return whatever verdict appeared
appropriate in the circumstances. If this was to be the case then officers
from West Midlands Police, club officers etc would have to give evidence and
this part of the Inquest would be "high key" and would almost certainly be
adverserial and controversial.

These hearings which H.M. Coroner proposes holding are intended to be an
exercise in distributing information to you about precisely what happened to
each of the 95 fans who died and is not an attempt to discover why the
disaster occurred or who is to blame.

The hearings will take place during the period 18th April to 4th May 1990
inclusive at the Medico-Legal Centre, Sheffield and as soon as the timetable
for the hearings is known I will get back to you and let yo know when your
own personal Inquest will be heard.

There is of course no obligation on you to attend the hearing, I will dicuss
this with you in more detail when I have your summary and the timetable.

In som^            my clients will have queries either on the contents ofthe
Post-Mortem Report or on the summary itself and a procedure has been agreed
for dealing with those queries and this is again is something which I will
explain in more detail when I see you or talk to you following receipt of
the summary.

 Before Dr. Popper begins dealing with the 95 individual Inquests on the 19th
 April he will receive some generic evidence on Wednesday the 18th April.
The first witness is likely to be Dr. Forest. He will formally present the
94 blood alcohol level Reports which were prepared (no sample was taken from
one very young fan) and he will explain the basis of the work he did.   This
will have the effect of formally bringing into public record his Reports, we
hope to be able to obtain copies of the blood alcohol level Report for each
fan in advance and we do not anticipate that there will be any real issue
over the blood alcohol level present in any individual deceased.

A senior police officer will then give evidence to explain certain terms and
expressions used in the summaries and on the "flow charts" and again we do
not anticipate that his evidence would be controversial in any way.

It is then proposed to call Professor Usher to given an overview of the
pathology of the types of injuries which were sustained. This will again be
evidence of a general nature and is unlikely to make reference to any
individual and will for example explain what happens to the human body when
it is compressed due to pressure and unable to absorb oxygen ... his

evidence is likely to be distressing to families but will hopefully clear up
much anxiety and show that many fans simply "went to sleep" without any
great discomfort because of lack of oxygen.

Finally, H.M. Coroner may call such further evidence of a generic nature as
he feels appropriate as the 18th April approaches.

When I see you following receipt of your summary we will discuss whether you
want to be present when it is presented, Dr. Popper has already indicated
that any family who have given notice of their wish to     be    present butwho
are not at Court when their Inquest is called will have the Inquest delaid
pending their late arrival, once these Inquests start to run the timetable
must strictly adhered to if everyone is to be satisfied.

I am not able to tell you at the moment when I will receive your summary;
they are not all prepared as yet but you may rest assured that as sotfn as
they come in I will be in touch with you immediately.

For my part I believe this move H.M. Coroner to give you information is to
be applauded and I have taken the liberty of telling him that already. The
Coroner is under no obligation to act in this way and I believe that his
stated intention to assist families in any way he          can   by providingthis
information is entirely genuine and I hope that you accept this move on his
behalf in the way in which I believe it is intended.

At the meeting on Tuesday Dr. Popper was at great pains to stress that he
has no "inside information" about the intentions of the D.D.P. as regards
criminal proceedings and he stressed that his motives in re-opening the
Inquests at this stage were directed only at supplying information to
families.
Although the primary intention of Dr. Popper is to give you information has
to how your loved one died one of the beneficial side effects of my
receiving this summary very shortly will be that I will be in a better
position to        the pre-death terror/pre-death pain and suffering element
of the civil claim with which I am dealing and I will cover this with you in
more detail when I see you.

If there are any significant changes in the information set out above I will
get back to you, in the meantime I am waiting for your summary to arrive and
when it does I will be in touch with you again immediately.

Sheffield Coroners Court                                         24/4/90

            INQUEST INTO DEATH OB’ VICTORIA JANE HICKS

Questions and matters arising from "Summaries" and evidence todate.

Q's to Dr. Denmark - Autopsy

1.   External examination- "There are needle marks in the right and
     left cubital fossa."

For the record can Dr. Denmark confirm that these are the result
of the adrenelin/ others substances administered by the Northern
General Staff during the resusitation attempt.

     "some bloodstained fluid is escaping from the right side of
     the mouth"

can Dr. Denmark comment as to wether this is "normal" and possible
cause /effect.

2.   Pleural cavities- "there is a haemothorax (i.e.:- blood)
     approx 500mls. This apparently has come from some tearing of
     the spinal branches of the aorta."

can Dr. Denmark comment on the circumstances that could lead to an
injury of this type & and had resusitation been successful would
Victoria have survived/ suffered further.

3.   Pancreas- "shows some bruising around the head"

can Dr. Denmark please comment on possible cause and effect.

4.General questions -

a) Would attempts at fibrilation on Saturday leave indications that
would be visible at post-mortem and did Victoria's body show such
signs.

b) in Dr. Denmarks opinion,and based purely on his experience and
general impression of her body at post-mortem, did Victoria suffer
more, or the same than is the average one could expect under the
circumstances.

Statement & Q's to Dr. Wardrope

Dr. Wardrope, Mr Hicks as you may already be aware,accompanied
Victoria to the Northern General Hospital and was present at the
initial "treatment" in casualty. He also heard at the opening day
of the generic evidence that no notes exist regarding Victoria's
treatment.

Mr & Mrs Hicks wish to state publicly and for the record that
whilst this is regrettable and should not have happened they agree
with your comments on the opening day that priority was given to
patient care &  Mr.Hicks reiterates his opinion that the medical
staff appeared to be "flat out", in control, and doing all that
they could in extremely difficult circumstances.
Please relay their gratitude to all concerned.

Having stated the foregoing two questions require to be cleared
up:-

1.Could Dr. Wardrope confirm that the needle marks refferred to in
the post-mortem were a result of the resusitation attempt.

2. Could Dr.Wardrope confirm wether fibrilation was attempted or
not. and if not why not.

Q & statement to D e t .Sgt Me Combie.

.1. Having considered the various statements that exist regarding
timing of any initial treatment, is it your opinion that Victoria
recieved resuscitation attempts at the earliest practical time.

Sgt.Me Combie, Mr & Mrs Hicks wish to place on public record their
gratitude to yourself, Sgt.Appleton and indeed the other West
Midlands Officers for the care and consideration you have shown
them during your investigations.

Q for Dr. Popper

1 . Further to your statement during the opening session we
understand that it is normal practise to do "ethanol blood tests"
that reveal any foreign substance in the blood.

a)Could you explain why you chose blood alcohol levels only.

b)Can you give an assurance that this was your descision entirely
and that no police pressure was involved.

2)We accept Dr. Poppers statement that it was neccessary to "have
a system" in the identification process but in the light of our
experience with Victoria's body being removed back to the Ground
could he try to ensure that in any future incident a body
unequivically identified by a close relative is left in peace at
the hospital mortuary.

           INQUEST INTO THE DEATH OF SARAH LOUISE HICKS


Questions and matters arising.

Q'S for DR. Slater - Pathologist.

1) When Jenni cuddled Sarah at the gymnasium at 9.30pm, after some
hours wearing only a light teeshirt, jeans and barefoot, she felt
at normal body temperature. Could you give an explanation and/or
comment.

2) When Sarah's body was recieved home, we noticed her hands from
the wrist down were very purple/black. Could you give an opinion
as to possible cause or if this is attributable to Sarah's attempts
to support Victoria from 2.45pm. when she was seen to be
unconscious.

3)We heard at the opening session that approximately 4 -6 minutes
after the final crush people would have lost consiousness.
Presumably as the girls remained consious for some period there was
intermittant crushing below the level needed for loss of faculties
does this mean that they "suffered" pain during this period.

Q for S g t . McCombie

1) At the gymnasium DC's Greaves and Maddox were advised "by an
unidentified member of a medical team" that Sarah was beyond help.
Despite the actual diagnosis / result how can we be assured that
professional advice was being given.

OCCUPATION:      POL PC1927



          I am Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police presently

          stationed at Rotherham.

         At 8.30 am (0830) on Saturday 15th April, 1989 (150489) I paraded

         on duty at Main Street Police station, Rotherham, for duties in

         connection with the FA cup semi-final to be played at Hillsborough

         Foctball Ground, Sheffield between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest
         foc-tball clubs.

         We were transported to the ground by coach where at 10.00 am (1000 )

         I vwas briefed along with the rest of my serial No 39 and the

         other Officers on duty.      My serials duties prior to the^match were to

         be on Halifax Road to await the arrival of the Liverpool supporters
         coaches.

         Sergeant DOYLE was in charge of the serial and responsible to

         Inspector MEEK-

        After the briefing we made our way to Claywheels Lane to' await the

        arrival o£ .the Liverpool coaches.     Fran Claywheels Lane we were then

        deployed along Halifax Road meeting the coaches which were to be

        parked there.      We were deployed in pairs, I myself being with FC2662
        SHIEL.

        We were positioned on the leftside of Halifax Road when travelling

        awsy frctn Sheffield opposite the Mobil Garage.

        It was our intention to search the supporters as they left the

        to ensure they had no weapons or articles to cause danger or harm and




                                                                                                            1 9

        that all alcohol should be left on the coaches.                           J)0C / & / &

        The coaches were parked facing away from the ground the first being

        the furthest away.     Randan searches were made of the supporters as

        they left their coaches and we gradually made our way down Halifax

        Road towards the ground.

        As a coach arrived near to a Workingman's Club on Halifax Road it was

        noticed that diesel fuel was leaking from underneath and so the driver

       was informed and the Fire Service contacted to attend and make the

       spilied fuel safe.     PC SHIEL and myself remained with the coach until

        this was done.

       PC SHEHj and myself then walked down Halifax Road to rejoin our serial

       at Claywheels Lane.     As we walked down the road it could be seen that

       large numbers of empty beer and lager cans had been left on the

       pavements and walls by supporters who were making their way towards

       the ground.     Most of the supporters who I saw walking towards the

       grcund were at tliis time good natured but very noisy.       *

       PC SHEIL and I made our way to Claywheels Lane to be placed on stand­

       by until needed.    As we joined the remainder of our serial at

       Claywheels Lane we were instructed by Sgt DOYLE that we were required

      to attend at the Leppings Lane end of the football ground.

      We made our way to the ground and were immediately deployed in a

      cordon to prevent further fans from entering the ground.

      At approximately 3.10 pn (1510) I was instructed by Sgt DOYLE to

      make ny way into the ground to give further assistance to the Officers

      already inside.     At this time I was unaware of the situation inside

      the ground and fully expected to meet some type of public order

      situation.

      Upcn entering the ground I could see a number of fans leaving the West

      Stand via the tunnel.     I immediately ran into the tunnel and saw a

         nunber of injured persons on the ground.       I approached a youth who I

         rrcv know was Phillip HAMMDND 13 yrs bn 8.12.75 (08121975) o
                                                , He was laid on the ground and

         appeared to be unconscious.      I then picked him up and carried him from

         the- tunnel.   As I made my way from the tunnel I was joined by PC SHIEL

         whc- assisted ms in getting through the crowd who were very hostile

         and abusive.

         I placed the young boy in the rear of a South Yorkshire ambulance.         We

         then started to attempt to revive the boy with the assistance of an

         ambulance wcman.    We cleared his airways and performed heart massage

         on him and were able to re-start his heart.      A pulse could then be

         felt and so PC SHIEL left the ambulance to find oxygen J!or the bqy as

         their unit was alreadjTbeing used outside.       PC SHIEL then returned

         with oxygen, which he had got from a nearfay Fire Engine.      One of the

         ambulance's own crew then returned and we continued to work on the

         boy.     It was then decided that the boy should be taken to hospital but

         the driver with the keys could not be found.       PC SHIEL then found the ‘

         driver and took the keys frctn him.      We then decided that ws should

         take the ambulance ourselves to the hospital and so PC SHIEL drove the

         ambulance whilst the ambulance man and myself continued to work on the

         bqy.

         Vfe then picked up a Officer from Sheffield who knew the location of

         the Hospital and made o u r way to the Casualty Dept of the Northern

         General.
         On arrival at the hospital we took the boy Philip HAMM3ND into the

         Casualty Dept where I assisted the hospital staff.      After about 20

         minutes the doctor decided that we could do no more for him as vre

         could not gain any pulse or signs of life.      I then took the body to

         the plaster room which was teitig used as a tangGraiy mortuary.

   C      daughters had been killed and that he believed that one of them was

          inside the plaster room.        He asked if I could find out if she was

          there.        He described his daughter to me and what she was wearing.        I

          checked inside the plaster room ard saw a young teenage gir^ w h o

          fitted the description. J I infonned tba roan of what the girl was

          wearing and also showed him a watch belonging to the girl.             Ftan the

          description I gave him and fron the watch he was certain that it was

          hie daughter and asked to be allowed to see her.        I told him that at

          that nranent it wa$ not advisable and asked him to wait a short while.

          He was obviously very mad at me for not letting him in at that instant

          but I felt that' due to the state of his daughter's body ftnd the fact

          that other bodies were also present that any identification should not

          be done there and then.        I informed a Police Inspector who was present

          at the time of what had happened and he asked a Police toman to look

          after the man.        I then returned to the Casualty Department to give

          further assistance to the Hospital staff.

          At approximately 5.30 pm (1730) I returned to Hillsborough football

          ground where I rejoined my serial.

          At 7.00 pm (1900) I returned to the Northern General Hospital with

          PC SHIEL and attended at the mortuary where we labelled eleven bodies

          prior to their removal to the gymnasium at Hillsborough.          The body of

          the young boy Philip HAMMDND who I had dealt with earlier being one of

          the eleven.       I then returned to Hillsborough with the bodies.

         At 3.45 am (0345) on Sunday 16th April, 1989 (160489) I saw a Mr

          Brian HAMMDND                                         the uncle of the

          deceased Philip HAMM3ND.       Mr HAMMDND identified the body to me and

          details for the form <22* 18 Sudden Death report were then obtained.

           HAKMDND to the Medico Legal Centre at Sheffield where the body was

           harded over to the reception team.             I then returned to Main Street

           Police Station Rotherham to go off duty at 6.00 am (0600).

           I felt that the mood of the Liverpool supporters prior to the match

           was generally good at the location where I was on duty (Halifax Road).

           They had obviously been drinking on their way to Sheffield and also

           once they had arrived.

                On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I was on duty at Hillsborough

                Football ground Sheffield, South Yorkshire as a member of serial 39.

                After briefing at the Football Ground I attend along with the rest of

                my serial on Halifax Road, Sheffield, our duties were to meet the

                Liverpool Supporters as they left their coaches and direct them to

                the ground.             We ware instructed to search them and ensure that they

                left any banners or bottles and cans either on the coaches or disposed

                of them prior to entering the ground.

                At approximately 3.00pm (1500) all coaches had arrived on Halifax

                Road and together with PC 2662 SHIEL we made our way towards

            Claywheels Lane.                      On our way down Halifax Road we could see that the

            sices of the road and pavement were littered with empty beer and

                lacer c a n s .

            At 3.05pm (1505) that same date our serial number 39 was deployed

            alcng with others to the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough Football

            Ground.             On arrival at the ground at 3.10pm (1510) we were intially

           deployed outside forming a cordon keeping Liverpool Supporters away

           from the gates. After a few minutes we were directed by our serial

           sergeant Sgt DOYLE to enter the ground and assist other officers at

           this time.           We had no idea of what was happening other than what

           appeared to be crowd trouble.

           Upcn entering the ground I could see a number of fans leaving the

           Vfest Stand via the tunnel.             I ran into the tunnel and saw a number of

           injured persons on the ground inside the tunnel at the end

           inwediately before the terracing I approached a youth who was laid

           unattended on the ground who I new to be Philip HAMMOND 13 yrs

           He appeared to be unconscious and so I carried him from the tunnel

           and was then met and assisted by PC2662 SHIEL,                        The youth as I have

           said appeared unconscious ard had bruising above his right eye*                                 We

           forced our way through the supporters who were milling about in the

           turjiel and at the rear of the stand and placed him in the rear of the

           ambulance where together with an ambulance woman we attempted to

           revive him. We cleared his airways and performed heart massage and

           were able to restart the heart.                   A pulse could be felt in his neck..

           Oxygen was then fetched to the ambulance as its unit was being used

           outside frcro a fixe engine.            Another member of the ambulance crew

           returned and we continued to work on Philip HAMMOND . After a few

           minutes we decided that he should be taken to hospital and so PC2662

           SHIEL went to find the ambulance driver.                       The driver was working on

           another injured parson ard so PC2662 SHIEL took the vehicle keys and

           drove to the General Hospial. On arrival we took Phillip HAMMOND into

           the- casualty dept where I assisted the hospital staff.                           After

           approximately 20 minutes the doctor decided that we could do no none

           for him and we stopped working on him.                     I then conveyed his body to

                    then handed the body to the police Officers at the plaster room.                         I

                    then returned to the casualty department and assisted the staff with

                other injured persons.                  I then returned to the ground at approximately

                    5.30pm (1730).

                At 7* 00pm (1900) that same date I returned to the Northern General

                Hospital in company with PC2662 SHIEL and there attended at the

                hospital mortuary where we labelled 11 bodies prior to their removal

                to Hillsborough Football Ground.                          I then travelled to Hillsborough

                with the body of the deceased Philip HAMMOND.

                Upcn arrival at'Hillsborough I conpleted the form GEN 18 (Sudden

                death report)                as far as possible at that time and awaited arrival of

                the relatives of the deceased for formal identification.

                At 3.45am (0345) on Sunday 16th April 1989 (160489) I saw the

                deceased's Uncle Brian HAMMOND c                                                         Ln the

           At 0800 hrs Saturday 15th April, 1989 (150489) I paraded at my regular

          •Station to canwence duty in connection with the Hillsborough football

           semi final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.                     I was assigned to

           Serial 39, the Supervisory Officers being Inspector Mfeek & Sgt

           Doyle.     I was working with a PC1927 Taylor.



           Our basic duty was to await the arrival of coaches and check the

           supporters in Halifax Rd.           During the course of our duty, I do not

           recollect the time but it was somewhere in the region of 1430 hrs, PC

           Taylor and myself w r e delayed with a coach that was leaking fuel, our

           owr. serial had carried on with the other coaches as they arrived.



           We retained with that coach until the Fire Brigade arrived and took

           over.     PC Taylor and myself then made our way down Halifax Rd towards

           Claywheels Ln, as we did so 1 noticed large numbers of alcohol cans

           empty glasses on the pavement and the wall tops.                    The supporters X had

           s e e n , I n o ti c e d that a l a r g e num ber o f them hetd b e e n d r in k in g an d were

           in high spirits.

           At Claywheels Ln we again joined serial 39         and as a result of a radio

           message I along with other officers were instructed to attend lappings

           Ln stand of the ground.        I was not aware of the       reason and againIdo

            not recollect the time but it was in the region            of 1500 hrs.     PC

            Taylor and myself entered the ground via Gate C            and made our way

            towards the West stand.       There were an awful lot of fans caning fran

            the direction of the tunnel, and also a lot of fans in the concourse

            area.       I saw that there were a lot of people 'obviously distressed and

            pec pie in various positions on the ground being attended to.



            I v,as still totally unaware what was going on.        I continued to walk

           "towards the tunnel, PC Taylor was just ahead of me and arrived at the

            tunnel before roe, just as I approached the tunnel I saw that PC

            Taylor was carrying a small boy of approximately 14 yrs.         lliis youth

            has since been identified as Philip Hammond 13 yrs




            It was quite apparent that this young boy was seriously injured due to

            the mass of people in this area I assisted PC Taylor to carry the

            youth and to try to make a free passageway to walk into        lappings Ln
            where we then placed him into the rear of a S Yorkshire Airbulance,

            here attempts were made to revive the youth by PC Taylor and an

            ambulance woman who had come to assist us from another ambulance* as

            the crew of the. one we were in were not available.        It was necessary

            to administer oxygen to this youth, so I left the ambulance and

            obtained an oxygen revival kit fron nearby Fire Service personnel.               A

            shcrt time later the ambulancewoman,         I am not able to identify her at

            all wag relieved by the actual crew member of the ambulance we were in.

           Due to the seriousness of the youth's condition it was necessary that

           he received hospital treatment.                    The driver of this ambulance was

           encaged in resuscitating another fan and therefore I took upon myself

           to drive the ambulance myself whilst the other half of the ambulance

           crew retained in the rear of the ambulance with PC Taylor.                              I was not

           aware of the location of the Northern General Hospital and therefore

           picked up another Officer near to Penistone Rd and the Spion Kop end,

           I have no idea who this Officer was.                      On arrival at the Northern

           General Hospital we transported the youth to the Accident and

           Emergency department, where he was admitted.                         PC •Baylor remained with

           ^the youth and I returned to the ground with the ambulance man.                                 I

           carnot identify him either and the officer that had assisted with the

           directions.           I returned to the Leppings Ln end of the ground I have no

           recollection of time whatsoever I completely lost track of it

           altogether.           I joined the driver of the ambulance I was in at the

           entrance to Gate C, almost immediately three more casualties were

           plsced in the rear of the ambulance-                       I do not know the exact location

           these casualties were brought fran or who by and I cannot honestly say

           whether or not they were all male or a mixture of female casualties.



           When all three casualties were on board I again drove the antoilance to

           the Northern General Hospital, whilst the crew administered first aid

           in the rear of the ambulance.                    The crew were belonging to that

           particular ambulance only the driver did not acccnpany us on the first

           occasion.         These three casualties were also admitted to the accident

           a n d e m e rg e n c y d e p a r tm e n t.   A f t e r t h i s all three of u s r e tu r n e d to th e

           sane location and again three more casualties were placed in the rear

           of my ambulance, again my only participation here was driving the

            ' ambulance.         I made the trip back to the Northern General with the same

                crew markers and the sama procedure was carried out in relation to the

                casualties and again all these of us returned to the ground.         I then

                left the ambulance with the crew members.         I saw that Officers were

                forming a cordon near to the perimeter of the stadium between Gate A

                and the canal in order to prevent the fans and the public from seeing

                or interferring with any deceased person.         Whilst forming part of this

                cordon we suffered verbal abuse from the fans and threats towards

                ourselves and other officers.



                Once the area had been cleared of deceased persons, I recollect

                scrceone, but I don't know who saying that we were to go to the North

                Stand.       I followed the instruction it was here that I rejoined my

                serial and I saw that PC Taylor had returned from the hospital.          I

                still have no recollection of any tome.



                Whilst in the North Stand there was a short briefing from Senior

                Officers.        After this briefing PC Taylor and myself had a word with

                Insp Meek & Sgt Doyle re the youth Philip Hammond at the Northern

                General Hospital.          We were then told by than to go to the gymnasium to

                inform whoever was there what we had done that afternoon in relation

                to any bodies.



                On arrival at the gymnasium we saw a DI Charles who was frcro Rotherham

                CIDf as we knew, him personally vie went to speak, to him.       I spake to

                him and told him that there was a youth at the hospital.         As a result

                of this conversation we were instructed to attend the hospital,          we

                were told by DI Charles that there were other bodies at the hospital

                and that he was aware of a Casualty Bureau in existence.



                                                                                                           3

           and PC Taylor worked together checking the details on the white

           cards he would hand ne a label, I would then write the MG Nunfcer on

           the label and tie it to the large toe of the deceased.              As each body

           was labelled they were then put into an ambulance and as far as I am

               Arthur Horxocks.         In view of the fact that PC Taylor had been with

               HantnDnd throughout he accompanied him to the gymnasium and I in turn

               travelled with Horxocks.         On arrival at the gymnasium there were a

               nunber of bodies all lined up on the floor, as the body was laid down

               it was given the next consecutive number this being 9 2 , being

               allocated to HOrrocks arid Hanroond being 93.       I ccwpleted a Form Gen

                   18, which is Sudden Death report as far as possible.         I also put the

               No 92 on the same label as the NG Humber so that they v«uld correspond

               anc. I also put that same No on the sudden death report.

}                  I then went to another part of the gymnasium to wait until such time

               that we were required for any identification of our bodies.

              ~t^ter, possibly early hours of the morning/ I do not recall the time,

               but I may well have written it on the Gen 18 f I was introduced to a

                   I completed the Gen 18 with the personal details of the deceased and

                   the brother.   I then accompanied the body which was transported by

                   ambulance to the Medico Legal Centre, here the body was handed over to

            I era a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police/ stationed at

            Rotherham.

            At 8 am (0800), Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I paraded at Main

            Street Police Station to ccnroence duty in connection with the

            Hillsborough Football Match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest

            Football Clubs,

            Transport was provided to the ground and I was there assigned to

            Serial 39 which was deployed to Halifax Road to await the arrival of

            the Liverpool coaches and the supporters.          The Officers in charge of

            the- Serial were Inspector MEEK and Sergeant DOYLE.

            At 10 am (1000) we were briefed regarding the Policing of the football

            event by various Senior Officers in the North Stand of the ground.

            After this briefing, Inspector MEEK gave a shorter account of Serial

            39 and 40's duties for the day.       We then made our way to Claywheels

            Lane to await the a r r i v a l of the f i r s t Liverpool coach.     Frc*n

            Clsywheels Lane we were re-deployed to Halifax Road.               There we were

            deployed in pairs, myself working with PC 1927 TAYLOR in the area

            opposite the tfbbil garage on Halifax Road.         It was the intention to




                                                                                                                       2

            ensure that the football supporters had no articles which could be

            used as a weapon or cause danger, be taken into the ground and that

            any alcohol be left ort the coaches*

            The coaches were parked on Halifax Road facing away fttiu the ground/

            the first being parked the furthest away.          As the coaches ware being

            parked at my location randan searches were made of the alighting

            supporters.        As further coaches arrived/ we made our way down Halifax

            Road, keeping with the last coach to arrive.          On the arrival of one

            coach near to the Working Men's Club on Halifax Road, it was noticed

            that fuel was leaking front the vehicle and therefore the fixe bridge

            were requested.        Myself and PC TAYLOR remained with the coach until

  \         the. fire bridge had arrived and made the coach safe.

            1re then walked down Halifax Road towards Claywheels Lane and as we did

            so I noticed large numbers of alcohol cans, empty glasses on the

            pavement:-and the wall tops.       The supporters I had seen I did notice

            that a large number of them had been drinking and were in very high

            spirits.

            As we reached Claywheels Lane we again joined Serial 39, the intention

            to walk onto the Police garage, but due to a radio message fran ground

            control I was instructed with other Officers by Sergeant- DOYLE that we

            were required to attend at the Leppings Lane stand of the ground,

            although I was not aware of the reason.          We attended at that location

            iimediately where we joined a number of other Officers outside the

            grcund.
            I then entered the ground via the west Stand entrance together with PC

            TA5L0R where I saw a large number of fans leaving the West Stand

            Iterrace by the central tunnel joining other fans who were milling

            around in that area.       A number of people were laid on the ground
            obviously injured, being tendered to by Police Officers and fans

          alike.   Some of the fans were abusive towards myself and other

          Officers, whilst others were distressed and upset.

          I followed PC TAYLOR into the central tunnel where he picked up a

          young boy aged approximately 14 years who appeared seriously injured*

          PC TAYLOR made his way back out of the tunnel but due to the mass of

          pecple I had to assist him in clearing a way through onto lappings

          Lane where he was placed in the rear of a South Yorkshire ambulance

          where attempts were made to revive the boy with the assistance

          of an ambulance waran.    It was necessary for the boy to have oxygen

          arc. i fetched a oxygen revival kit fran the Fire Service personnel

          located nearby. ' The oxygen supplied with the equipment in th e _

          ambulance was already in use inside the stadium.         The ambulance woman

          was then relieved by an ambulance roan who was in fact a member of th e

          crew assigned to that vehicle.       Due to the seriousness of the b oy's

          injuries, it was necessary for me to convey the boy to the Northern

          General Hospital due to the fact that the driver was engaged in

          resuscitation of other fans.      PC TAYLOR and the ambulance crew

          ireatber m i m n e d in the rear attempting to revive the boy.          With the

          aic of another Officer, who was aware of the location of the Hospital,

          we transported the boy to the Accident and Emergency Department,

          where the boy was admit t e d . ______ ___ _______ ____ — —        -- ---------

          I then returned to the ground with the ambulance man whilst PC TAYLOR

          rerained with the boy.    I attended immediately at the lappings Lane

          end of the ground where I saw the ambulance driver.          On his

          instructions, three nore casualties were placed in the rear of the

          amfculance which I conveyed to the Northern General Hospital whilst the

          amtulance crew administered first aid in the rear.          On this journey
          and subsequent ones, I had a Police motorcycle escort to and from the

          hospital. I made a total of tivcee journeys to and fnctn the hospital,.

           conveying approximately seven people from the Leppings Lane end of the

           gixund. From the second journey onwards, the route to and from the

           Hospital was manned by Police Officers at all the junctions in order

           to allow a free passage to the location, ensuring the quickest

           travelling time.
           During the time I was driving the ambulance I was aware of a large

           nunber of fans standing in the roadway of Leppings Lane and walking

           awsy from the ground.        They were oblivious to any traffic and even

           thcugh the emergency blue lights were illuminated and the sirens were

           onj^ the fans did not appear to show any concern for their own safety

           or the urgency at which the ambulance was being used for.              They were

               reluctant to move off the road way until the last possible moment,
          I.

          Resulting in me having to slow down in order to avoid them.

           Once I was relieved of this duty, I attended in the area of the West

           Stend    where     I was with other Officers instructed to form a cordon near

               to the perirreter of the stadium in order to prevent the fans and

           public from seeing or interfering with the deceased.               Whilst stood

           there the fans shouted abuse and threats towards ourselves and other

           Officers nearby.        Once the deceased fans had been moved I attended at

           the North Stand where I rejoined my Serial and PC TAYLOR- who had

           returned fran the hospital.

          After a short briefing by Senior Officers, I returned to the Northern

          General     Hospital where I attended at the Mortuary where I labelled

          eleven of the deceased with the details available at the hospital.                 I

          returned to Hillsborough Football Stadium with the body of Arthur

 DATED: 090190


           Further to my s t a t e d dated 28th ttoveirfcer 1989 (281189) I have today

           been shown a number of photographic prints as detailed below, on which

           I can identify myself, amongst a party of Police Officers and

           civilians, assisting to carry the body of a man on an Advertising

           Hoarding.
                                                                                       He •
           Also shown on the sane photographs is my cousin

           is shown wearing a Liverpool PC sv^atshirt and has a full beard.

           I do not taiow the identity of the man shown on the photographs but

           understand from West Midlands Police that he is David RIMMER (4).

           I assisted to carry a number of people off the pitch but recall this

           man because I had seen him earlier in    Pen   4 ; he is the man I refer to

           in my original statement as quite tall, probably about six feet, hie

           hair was cut short with a fringe.
           The photographic prints on which I appear with this man are:-

         I have also viewed video tape and on tape (Ref MAP/9) (Exh                  ) at a

         sequence time reference 00-17.01.23 - 00*17.10.05 I can identify

         myself again shewn carrying the man I understand to be David RIMMER.

         I have been shown a mortuary photograph of David RUMMER (Ref                   )

         (Exh            ) and this is certainly one of the people that I carried

         off the pitch and is the same person I refer to as seeing earlier in

         Pen 4.

         I have indicated, on a plan of the Football Pitch, the approximate

         position at which X found the body of this man lying.             I have

         indicated the position with a blue dot and I have signed this plan

         (Ref IEB/1) (Exh             ).

         I recall assisting to place the mans body on a hoarding and with

                              and others carrying the body from the Leppings Lane

         end of the pitch to the Kop End, sane bodies I placed on the pitch by

         an arobularce scne in the tunnel leading to the gymnasium and sane were

         taken from me.      As to what happened to the body of the man I believe

         to be David RIMMER I cannot recall.

         I also recall a Police Officer, on his own, picking up the body of a



                                                                                                   63

          m     cousin                     and another two men whose identity I don't

          know.     The photograph shews us carrying the body of the boy I refer

          to in ny original statement.
          I have been shown a mortuary photograph of a Thomas Anthony HOWARD
          (1).     i believe this to be the boy I refer to the boy shown on the

          above mentioned photographic print.          The mortuary photograph

           (Ref          ) (Ex        ).
           I have indicated on a sketch plan of the pitch the approximate

          position at which I saw the policeman recover the body of this boy.

          The position is indicated by a blue dot.          I have signed this plan (Ref

           IEB/2) (Ex            ).
           I refer in ity original statement to the boy having a relative with

           him, an uncle or father.        I may have been mistaken over this or may

           have assumed that this person was a relative of the boy.

              I have been shown a photograph of the clothing worn by items Anthony

           HOWARD (1) on 15th April 1989 (150489) (Ref NA1) (Exh                     )•
           clothing is identicial to that w m by the boy shown on the above

           photograph (Ref PR6/1) (Exh            ) as I recall it.     I particularly

              r«narber the green anorak.
           Although I don't mention it in my o r i gin al statement I assisted, at

              one stage, to place the body of a girl in an Anfculance.          The girl was

              lying on the pitch, and I helped to place the body into the back of

              the anixilance.    Tte girls father was present and the gixls face was

DATED; 030£89



          I <=m a qualified mortuary technician and qualified in 1981 (000081) in

          Sheffield.   1 have worked at the Northern General Since 1981 (000081).
          On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I was at hate and as a result

         of the televison I became aware that there was something happening at
         the Hillsborough football ground.         I telephoned the Northern General

         Hospital to see if I was required.         I spoke with the telephone

         receptionist and as a result of what she said I decided to go to the
         hospital.

         I errived at the hospital at approximately 3.35 pm (1535) and went to
         casualty. I approached a matron whose name I don't know and she

         directed me to the orthopaedic plaster rocm which was being used as a
         temporary mortuary.

         As I entered the room I saw a number of bodies lying on trolleys
         tables and scxne weirs even on the floor — I can't be precise about how

         mar.y bodies were there.   There were no other persons present.
         1 came out of the rocm and approached a police officer, I think he was
         the police liaison officer.      I introduced myself and then           him if
         f c h w a s anyone who could   assist   me to document the bodies and


                                                                                                   36

          strip than.         I am not authorised to carry out this procedure without
          the presence of a police officer.

          Si* police officers were given the job of assisting me.                                One of the

          police officers a young fanale was placed on the door to stop
          unauthorised entry.
          Itocether with the police officers, we started to document and strip

          each body.        A female officer made a record of the personal property

          anc a full description of each body, including approximate age, height
          and distinguishing mark.                The personal property was kept with the
          patients and put into a brown envelope and mrked with the major
          disaster plan number.

          Once the system was running effectively, I left the police officers to

          cor.tinue documenting and stripping the bodies.

          1 nade my way over to the hospital mortuary and opened up.                                 I
          cor.tacted                         an     unqualified mortuary technician, andasked
          her to come to the hospital to assist.                       I attempted to contact another

          technician, but without success,

         Mr Cliff LAMBOURNE, the Chief MLSO in histopathology, arrived at the
         hospital.        I assessed the space in the mortuary and asked Mr IAMBOURNE
         to assist in the hospital mortuary.                      Mr Stephen WESTBY who is an MLSO

         also arrived at the hospital and I asked him to assist in the mortuary.

         I tvas concerned that the bodies that had arrived at the mortuary over

         the weekend did not becane confused with the bodies arriving from
         Hillsborough.

         I *ent back to the plaster roam and continued to document and strip
         the bodies.         As the bodies were stripped, each was catalogued and

         documented as far as possible.                   I then asked the porters, whose names

        plaster room a leg of each body was marked in indelible ink with the
        major disaster plan number.     The clothing accompanied the bodies and

        the personal property, cash, jewellery etc remained with the police.
        This process continued until ail the bodies in the plaster roctn had
        been removed to the mortuary.     There was an additional body in a small

        rocm across frcm the plaster room.     This body was documented and

        stripped and then transferred to the mortuary.
        One of the bodies, a female who I now know to be one of the HICKS'

        gillsr was identified.     A second body had a casualty card with a name

        on it placed on his chest.     I do not know where the name on the card

        cane frcnt and I cannot remember at this stage what the name was.

        Tocether witt                 the hospital administrator, the police

        liaison officer and two (2) other police officers I went to the dining

        rocm which was being used by the relatives of the injured
        stcod on a table and read out a list of the injured persons at the

        hospital and a description of the bodies being held by the hospital
        together with any distinguishing marks on each body.

        Following the announcement a large number of people came towards
        myself and the police officers asking for further information.        We

        assisted as far as possible I went back to the mortuary and was

        acccnpanied by a police officer.     I was informed that some relatives

        were at the mortuary wanting to look at bodies with the view of

        identfying them.    There was no way that I would allow anyone to look

        at a body unless the description that they had given fitted the dead

        person.
        Upcn my arrival back at the mortuary I discovered that one of the
        HICKS' girls had been positively identified,
        A decision was made by someone to move the bodies frcm the mortuary to
        the Hillsborough ground.    I do not knew who made this decision bat

                                                                                           38

                  within a very short time it was reversed.               Approximately half an hour
                  later, received a telephone call from casualty to say that about six

                  (6) ambulances had arrived to take the bodies back to the ground.

                  I nade ray way across to casualty to try and find out what was
              happening.              By the tims I got there the ambulances had already been
              sort round to the mortuary. I spoke with the police liaison officer
              and he confirmed that the bodies were to be transferred to the
              foctbail ground on the Coroner's orders.

              I returned to the mortuary and informed the staff that the todies were
              to be removed.                There were a large number of people in the mortuary
              including ambulance drivers, police officers, nortuary staff and armp
              social workers who had arrived from the main part of the hospital.
              Three (3) or four (4) of t h e bodies were placed in the first

              ambulance, I can't remember t h e Major Disaster Plan number allocated
              to these bodies . I travelled in t h e ambulance with these bodies.

              Upcn arrival a senior police officer asked me where the police

             cor stables were.                  I said that I didn't know which officers he was

             talking about.                 He informed me that a number of police officers had
             been sent to the hospital to accompany one body each, to the ground.
             I said that I was not aware of those officers and attenpts were then

             mace to contact them by radio.                   Eventually they were contacted and
             three (3) or four (4) of them returned to the ground tx> take

             responsibility for the bodies that I had accompanied in the first
             ambulance.

             I would say that it was approximately 1 hour later that the next

            amtulance arrived with any of the bodies and they were accompanied by

            the police officers.                    As each body arrived I informed the officer of
            it's major disaster plan number which would have been written on the
            lec and that officer then became responsible as far as I was concerned
                                                                                                             39

            fox that body. Each body was accompanied with the property bag
            containing the clothing and MDP (Major Disaster Plan) records in

            several cases there was nothing or very little written on the notes.
            When all of the bodies had arrived at the ground which I believe was
            accund 9 pm (2100) nry girlfriend arrived and took roe back to the
            hospital.

            I vent to the mortuary and it was then that I found out that there was
            a tody still on the GITU waiting to be transferred to the ground.
            Arrangements were already in hand for this body to be collected by

            amfculance.   At no stage did I ever see that body. I was told by the

            staff that everything was in order and that there was little else that
            cot Id be done.   I therefore left the hospital and went home.      I
            firished work at 10 pn (2200).

DATED: 060689



           I am consultant in charge of the Accident and Emergency Department at

           the Northern General Hospital, Steffield.      My qualifications are

           M.E-.Ch-D. F.R.C.S. (Edinburgh) General Surgery and Accident and

           Emergency Medicine and Surgery, F.R.C.S. (England) General Surgery.

           Frcm my appointment as Consultant on the 1st May 1987 (010587) up

           until the 1st May 1989 (010589) I was sole Consultant in tlie .Accident

           anc Emergency Department and tliere fore first on call to the Senior

           House Officers.
           On Saturday the 15th April (150489) at approximately 1.00 pm (1300) I

           telephoned the Accident and Emergency Department at the Northern

           General Hospital to let than know I was going to be available on my

           lor.g range bleep as I was taking nty family to the park.           At

           approximately 1520 (1520) I was returning home in the car when nty long

           rarge bleep went off.   I was heme within a minute and ansv^red the

           telephone.   I spoke to Charge Nurse BA n Y   w !k   >   was at ttiat time Nurse

           in Charge of the Accident and Emergency Department.             He told me that

           he had received a message from the police saying that there was sane

           form of incident at Hillsborough and we were to expect scxne casualties.

         At that tijn* there was no indication that this was a major incident.

         I left hone immediately at 1523 (1523), arriving at the Northern

         General at 1533 (1533).
         On my arrival at the Nortliern General tlospital it was obvious that

         this was a serious incident, since there were already three ambulances

         at the ambulance entrance.         I inroediately ran into the department and

         confirmed with Charge Nurse BAITY that he had implanted the Hospital

         Major Incident Plan.      At that time there were three patients m the

         Resuscitation Roan undergoing cardio pulmonary resuscitation and some

         less seriously injured in the Accident Department.

         Preparations were wall under way to ready the department for a Major

          Incident but I would point out we received no adequate notification of

         the scale of this event.
         Alitost immediately a second wave of ambulances arrived.        These were

         carrying large numbers of seriously ill patients from t i n c i d e n t at

          Hillsborough Stadium.     Sane were having active cardio pulmonary

          resuscitation, being in a state of cardiac arrest-        Others were deeply

          unconscious.     Others were having severe fits.     At this time I

          attsnpted to sort the patients into various categories (TRIAGE), but I

          found nryself having to help with the treatment of tliese patients.

          As more staff arrived I was abl^^oncentrate on the triage and

          marjigsient role and by a b ^ t l 3 4 5 (1345)J^re «as adequate staff in
                                                                                           ?
          ths department and also the docvmantation triage point had been sot

          up, allowing the use of tt>e pre-planned Major Incident hospital

          notes. Also about this time the resuscitation area was becoming full

          and we were still receiving many seriously ill patients and about this

          point I took the decision to send patients who had no cardiac output

          direct to the mortuary.         Prior to this point patients with no cardiac

          outpuL who were having active caxdio pulmonary resuscitation had been

          ser.t to the Resuscitation Room to try and re-start ti>e heart and

          assist with their breathing.                                                 <

          I feel I must give this background since our documentation of the

          earlier treatment of many of the patients is not satisfactory, fcwt I

          wish to make it absolutely clear that the staff were stretched in

          trying to provide urgent life saving treatment to the huge nunfcer of             /

          pat ients.
          Thirteen patients were brought to the Northern General Hospital on

          that day and subsequently died.        Fran the medical records in my

          possession and also with the help of post mortem evidence provided by

          HM Coroner, I am able to give the following details of the treatment

          of these patients.

                       This young boy was brought in as a cardiac arrest.

                       Resuscitation resulted in return of normal cardiac output,

                       but lie did not breath on his own.    He was therefore

                        transferred to the General Intensive Care ynit and I believe

                       he died on tlie Intensive Care Unit three days later.

                       There is no definite documentary evidence in tlie medical

                       notes that Mr HAMMM) received resuscitation, but the post

                       mortem states that there were three E.C.G. electrodes

                        attached to hLs chest.
                        1 would interpret Uiis as it being probable he did enter the

                        Resuscitation Room of the Northern General

                        Hospital, but a cardiac tracing showed no cardiac activity

                        and in view of the large number of patients present at the

                     There is no documentary evidence in the hospital notes

                     to suggest that Mr EENNE1T received resuscitation.

                     However the post mortem reports shows there was a needle

                     injection mark on one of his arms which would indicate sons

                     attempts had been made at resuscitation.                      <

                      There is definite hospital and post nortan evidence

                      that Miss HICKS received intensive resuscitation efforts

                      after tei*g brought in in a state of caxdiac arrest but

                      unfortunately, these efforts were not successful.

                      There is definite evidence in the medical record and from the

                      'post Bcrtem report that Mr HARRISCM received intensive

                      resuscitation efforts.

           29.       Adam SPEARRITT
                      There is definite evidence in the medical notes that Mr

                      SFEARRITT was brought into the department in a state of

                      cardiac arrest and resuscitation attaints were initially

                      successful in re-starting his heart and he was transferred

                       to the intensive Care Unit.    However, shortly after his

                       adioission to tie Intensive Care Unit his heart stopped again

                       and could not be re-started.

                     There is no documsntary evidence in the hospital notes that

                     Mr O'NEIL received any treatment.        Howeverr post mortem

                     report states there was a needle placed in Mr O'NEIL'S arm

                     and it is therefore possible that Mr O'NEIL did have seme

                     attesnpt made at resuscitation.

          62.        Paul BRADEY
                     There is no definite documentary evidence in tlie tospital

                     notes nor any evidence from t)ie post mortem findings tliat

                     Mr BRADEY received any resuscitation.         1 think it likely that

                     lie was triaged as dead.

          63.        David THOMAS
                     There is no evidence in the hospital notes that Mr THOMAS

                      received resuscitation.      Similarly, there is no evidence in

                      the post nortem report and I think it likely that Mr MCMAS

                      was triaged as dead.

          64.        John GILHOOLEY
                     Altliough there is no definite medical record of Mr GIU100LEY

                      receiving resuscitation,        Tliere is definite post nortan

                      evidence of intensive resuscitation attempts.

          99.        Philip STEELE
                      There is no evidence in the medical record nor any evidence

                      from the post mortem findings that Mr STEELE received any

                      resuscitation.       I think it likely that he was triaged as

                      dead.

          1IS -      Arthur- HORROCKS
                      Tliere is no evidence in the medical record of airy

                      resuscitation attempts and there is no evidence in the post

                     think it likely that Mr HORROCKS was triaged as dead.

         In summary, there is definite evidence both from the hospital records

         anc post mortem reports that six patients received resuscitation

         attanpts,    In a further three patients there was sane evidence that

         the patients may have received same resuscitation attenpts.       In four

         patients there is no evidence of resuscitation *rsd it is likely that

         these patients were triaged to the mortuary on arrival at the Accident

         anc Emergency Department.
         I feel it jr*ay be helpful to give a brief sunroary of our experience of

         traumatic asphyxia.    Traumatic asphyxia is a fairly unccmron

         condition, normally occurring in sporadic cases, either in car

         accidents or heavy injury.     There are a number of well documented

         instances where large numbers of people have died in crowds as a

         result of traumatic asphyxia.     Such events are fortunately rare.     U*

         Northern General Hospital Occident and Bnergency Department admitted

          fifteen cases of severe traumatic asphyxia within a space of one hour

         on the 15th April (150489) and tills is in addition to the patients

         mentioned above.
         No patient admitted in a state of cardiac arrest has survived.

          Of the other fifteen patients who were admitted with cardiac output

          anc breathing albeit deeply unconscious or fitting, two patients have

          severe brain damage, three patients have significant brain damage and

          ter. patients have made good recoveries.   Those patients with the worse

          outcanes were those who were most severely affected clinically

          on admission.

 OCCUPATION:     CONSULTANT IN ACCIDENI*          EMERGENCE*



            janes WARDOPE will say as follows:-
            I am a Consultant in charge o£ the Accident & Eroargency Department at

            the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield.               X have teen a Consultant at

            the hospital since i Hay 1907 (010587), prior to that I held the post

            of Senior Registrar at tie Royal HailamsMre Hospital, Sheffield.                       I

            qualified in 19           any my qualifications are



            The Accident & Eniergency Department is quite a busy one.                   It had

            55,000 patients last year, of which 42,000 ware new patients.                     In

            terms of radical staffing, there are seven Senior House Officers, an

            Association Specialist (six sessions A & E, four sessions Fracture

             Clinic) and five GP Clinical Assistant Sessions.                 I am the first on

             call, except every other weekend when one of the Orthopaedic

             Consultants takes the on call duty.

             Saturday is usually a busy day for the Department, especially ta the

             afternoon.     On   Saturday,    15 Sprii (150489) there ^           two Bedical

             staff, of SHO grade, on duty and I was on call.                 I had teen into tlie

             Department at 10.00 am (1000) on the morning of the 15th (150489).

          We were just returning, and were about 200 yards frcm our hoi* in

          Crcsspool, when my bleep which I had been carrying went off.          I

          arrived home within about a minute and telephoned the hospital

          iimediately.    I spoke to Charge Nurse Batty, who indicated he had been

          notified of scrne sort of incident at Hillsborough and that the

          hospital was to stand by and to expect to receive seme crush injuries.

          He gave no indication of nunfcers or that a major incident had been

          called.    He indicated that no patients had yet arrived and fran the

          details he gave me I thought perhaps the hospital would receive half a

           dozen or so.    I knew the Department was fairly busy and I decided I

           shculd go in to help out, but I did not think it was a major

           emergency.

           I immediately left for the hospital in my car.        The time cm the car

           clcck, which is two minutes fast, was 3.25 pm (1525).        'Hie journey was

           very quick as tlie roads were quiet and I arrived at the hospital at 3.

           35 pn (1535), according to the car clock.        I parked my car in the

           Consultants' car park.      I started walking towards the Department, but

           as 1 approached the entrance X saw three ambulances and I began to run.

           I vas met at the door by charge Nurse BAITY wto informed roe three

           patients were undergoing resuscitation in the Resuscitation Roan wiiich

           is adjacent to the side entrance.         I asked him whether he had

           impleroanted the Major Disaster Plan and he replied he had.          It was

           obvious to me that it was necessary to implement the Major Disaster

           Plan.
            I vent into the Resuscitation Roan where there were three patients

            undergoing resuscitation.      One was a ten year old boy who was being

            attended by the Senior Paediatric House Officer.        I gather slie l*ad

            been called when the Department were alerted to expect a paediatric

            caidiac arrest.      A Senior House Officer from Rotherham, who had just

              been passing the hospital, was resuscitating another patient and one

              of *     SHOs «       w o r ^ g on th. third ^tient.                 I could see the staff

              were having trouble getting intravenous access on the child so I

              assisted with that.
              More ambulances arrived almost immediately.                         I   "eft        tle *ronl: d°°

               with Charge Nurse B W T Y to receive the injured, almost all of when,

               were dead or dying,            Soma were sent to the Resuscitation Rocn and I

               then went to the Resuscitation Boon myself to intubate with

               endotracheal tubes.            I cannot n w recall how many patients were in
#              that batch of arrivals.

               I then returned to the entrance and stayed there until about 5.00 pn,

               (1700), to triage patients as they arrived, and also to triage Doctors

               so that they could be assigned to appropriate duties.

               By about 3.45 pn (1545) a lot of staff had arrived in the Department

               arc the Resuscitation Boon was fairly well manned.                             1 allocated

                Doctors to the Resuscitation Fixm initially, and then into Ward 60

                which had been cleared and which was acting as the receiving ward.

                I realised the Resuscitation Bocm was becoming very full as almost all

                the first lot of casualties required resuscitation aqd I therefore

                sent one of the SICs, Mr DUNCAN, to telephone SYMAS Control and

                recuest cases be diverted to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

                By this     Uffi   >*di«a lecord Staff had i*pl«»ented                       the tagging systtn
                to identify        the casualties.          Because'     of   the volume       of patients
                arriving staff were unable bo use the coloured                          labels.
                At akout this t i m I started sending the dead on arrival direct to the

                plester Roan.          Previously, I had sent the whole batch of casualties,

                 including dead, into the Resu^itation Boon to aoanpt resuscitation

                 in view of their age.

         the Hillsborough football ground.        The request cane via   V

         X realised everyone was very busy and that we could not spar*

         sufficient staff to send a mobile team immediately and I decided it

         was nor* juuportant to retain the resources within the Department.

         However, by about 4.00 m         (1600) the position had eased such tiwat I

         was able to despatch two Doctors with an equipment box, m           an

         ambulance, to the football ground.        The staff who went were Dr

         DAVJDSCN, SHO, and an Anaesthetic Registrar.         The Department has a

         specially prepared box of equipment. for just such an emergency and

         this had been checked and re- stocked only two weeks earlier.            As it

         transpired, when the mobile team arrived at the ground there were

         sufficient medical staff already there and the Doctors were sent back

          to the hospital and only the equipment retained.

          By about tliis time I think I was notified the Royal Hallamshire

          Hospital were receiving about half tlie casualties.

         After 4.00 pm (1600) tte situation became more controlled and less *

          serious injuries were arriving in the Department.        Tt>ese were sent to

          the Physiotherapy Department which had been cleared to receive non­

          urgent casualties requiring minor treatment or rest or awaiting

          transport hone.     By about 4.30 pm (1630) the Department was becoming

          much quieter.     I asked Dr R ELGON, Consultant Qrthcpaedic Surgeon, and

          Dr D EDWARDS, Orthopaedic Registrar, to attend the non-urgent

          casualties in the PhysioUierapy Department.

          Dr Tim SHAW, Consultant Anaesthetist, was in charge of the

          Resuscitation Room.

          The last patient X remember receiving arrived at about 4.45 pn

          (1645).    He had fainted frtan tl>e exertion of carrying bodies out of

          the ground.

         received, altlough       I knew at one point that about   sixteen patients

         ware all undergoing resuscitation.          Hie Dapartment is set up for

         resuscitation patients and all the beds «=re being used.

         U * triage area * s established near the side entrance to the A * E

          Department.     In a major disaster the main entrance is closed and all

          casualties are brought into the side entrance and thus through the

          triage point.     Hie Resuscitation Room is immediately adjacent to the

          triage area in roan 23 and beyond that reams 18 (Treatment), 16

          (Ar.terocm), 14 (Plaster Room), 15 (Treatment Rocm), 57, 58 and 61

          (Examination/Treatment Kxms) and cubicles «ere used.          Any casualties

          whc did not require resuscitation were sent to the receiving ward,

          ward 60 or if they were minor casualties, to the Physiotherapy

          Department.     Only one patient required surgery - a laporotony.
          Alnost all the resuscitation patients requited intensive care and

          therefore were transferred from the resusication areas to either the

          General Intensive Treatment Unit or the Coronary Intensive Care Unit,

          in the initial ten minutes the Departiwnt was ovwtelned by the

          volume of patients requiring resuscitation.          I think this is due to

           three factors, naiiely the speed of extraction of casualties fron the

           site, the speed of transportation to the hospital in vie* of its

           prcxiinity to the football ground, and the nature of the injuries.

           I do not recall any desperate need of equipment.         I believe at one

           tine w    ran out of oxyge*         netera, bat these were provided very

           quickly by the Supplies D e p a r t s .     <Q» hospital does not have a CP

           Scanner and one of the ventilated casualties required a CT scan during

           the afternoon.     He was transferred to the Royal Ballainshixe lfc>spital,

           A further two patients were transferred during the night to the Hoyal

           Hallaroshire Hospital for CT scans.
           By about 5.30 pn (1730) the Department was alniwt clear of casualties.

          pliysiotherapy D e p a r t s .    The dead were transferred to the ncrtuary

          The Major Disaster Plan provides for patients to be labelled with

          appropriately coloured labels once they have been traiged, so thatf

           for example, tl»se requiring immediate resuscitation should receive a

           red label, those requiring urgent admission and surgery should receive

           a blue label, r^on-uxgent a green label and dead a white label,        in

           fact, because of the iped of arrival of the casualties in the fixst

           twenty minutes, it t o impossible for staff to use the coloured labels.

           This did not mate any material difference as staff were writing on to

           the labels the patients" destination, once triaged.

           evening.      I recall I was in the Control B o m when one woman arrived
           trying to find her husband and daughter.         I recall speaking to her and

           telling her that her husband had survived but that her daughter m s

            deed.    The families afpeared to be well marshalled on level C, which               — —

            is the floor below the A & E E^partment.        I was not too conscious of

            the presence of the press and media.        I think there were sane press

            outside the A & E Department but they seaned to keep well bock fxxm

            the arrival area.       By the following morning I was able to calculate

            thet ninety-three patients had been through the Department, of whom

            fifty-five were admissions twenty-seven discharges and twelve dead.

            Of the admissions fifteen were in intensive care, although by the

            following morning (tfonday) that figure had dropped to eleven.

            Seven patients had been transferred to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

        cause of this type of crush injury is fron a car falling on top of

           At 12.30pm (1230) on Saturday the 15th of April 1989 (150489), I

           commenced duty at the Sheffield Wednesday Football ground,

           Hillsborough, Sheffield.

           I was attached to Serial number 2 for my period of duty and this

           involved uniform foot patrol in the area of the South Stand.     Prior to

           commencing my duty I was present when a pre match briefing was given ‘

           to all the officers working that day.

           Prior to the match kick off I patrolled in the South stand and

           witnessed a steady flow of supporters entering the ground. The general

           mood of these fans were good humoured.

           On looking across to the West Stand I saw that the middle section was

           filled to capacity and the flanking pens was relativley empty.

           A short time after kick off, I responded to what appeared to be a

           public order situation.    I saw four or five supporters climbing over

           the track fence from the middle enclosure.   I went onto the track

           infront of the West Stand and attempted to stop a supporter running

           onto the pitch.   I immediately saw that he was in sane physical

           discomfort. When I looked closer at the front of the stand I was




                                                                                               •iZ

horrified to see people crushed against the barrier.

A number of officers were now on the track and there was obvious

confusion as to what action to take.

I then went through the south stand and made my way to the back of the

west stand.

As I ran to the rear of the middle enclosure tunnel I saw Tnsp SYKES

and I briefly explained the problem.   I noticed that there was no

commotion at the rear of the stand.

I then went down the tunnel and attempted to get people to evacuate

the stand.

The mood of the supporters was extremely hostile and it was clearly

noticable that many were drunk.

I eventually made my way to the front of the stand and saw a heap of

bodies to the right of the pen. I noticed that a barrier was broken

and bent in this area.

I grabbed hold of a young girl and with the assistance of Insp SYKES

carried her through the stand to the open enclosure at the rear of the

tunnel.

As we dragged this girl from the stand I was jostled and pushed by

supporters.

The young girls white top also pulled off „asu~she was carried through

the crowd.                             ^      **'^ S

At the rear of the stand mouth to mouth was administered to the girl

and the assistance of an ambulance crew sought.

An ambulance woman stated we were wasting our time as she was dead.      .

A number of other supporters were then dragged to the rear of the

stand and officers were desperately attempting to revive them.

After sane time I assisted officers to pull a second girl to the pitch

in front of the stand.   As officers dealt with her I ran to the Police
                                                                                 'Me   ?'/■

        roan and from the gym area.       I took an oxygen cylinder and mask I

        brought this back to the girl and attempted to resuscitate her with

        it.

        The girls father was present and he informed me that it was his

        daughter 'Vicky'.

        We placed the girl in an ambulance together with two male supporters.

        I desperately continued mouth to mouth as we travelled to the Northern

        Genearl Hospital.

        The girls father Mr Hicks was with me in the back of the ambulance and           .
                                                                                        aW

        I then searched and found Mr HICKS and told him his daughter was dead.

        A nurse from the hospital, then assisted Mr HICKS.

        I returned to the ground in a Police Transit van and after waiting

        with other officers in the north stand went off duty.

        At 09.45 pm on Saturday the 15th April 1989 I carmeneed duty at the

           Sheffield Wednesday football ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield.

        At this time I was acting as a member of Serial Number 2.Along with

        other officers I attended a briefing conducted by Chief

        Superintendent Duckenfield.

        My duties involved general foot patrol in the area of the lower South

        Stand and I was working in company with PC Pursley.

        A short time after kick off I responded to what I believed to be a

        public order situation in the area of the West Stand.

           I went and stood in front of the Middle Pen on the West Stand and saw

        that a large number of fans were crushed against the metal barriers. •

        A large number of Police appeared on the pitch in front of the stand

        and confusion as to the imnediate course of action endsued.        I then

        went through the South Stand and along with other officers approached

        the tunnel at the rear of the West Stand.

        I saw that there was calm at the rear of the stand and people didn't

        realise what was happening.

        I briefly liaised with Inspector Sykes and then together we went down

        the tunnel and struggled to force our way to the front of the stand.

        The mood of the fans was one of anger and a number appeared extremely

        drunk.

        Myself and Inspector Sykes carried a young girl from the front of the

        stand towards the open area at the rear of the stand.    Mouth to mouth

was then given to the girl until an ambulance crew arrived and stated

that she was dead.

A number of bodies were carried to the back of the stand and Police

Officers were assisting in any way they could.

Eventually I made my way back through the West Stand and onto the

pitch, assisting officers to carry another girl onto the pitch.

Whilst fire and Police Officers attempted to assist her I ran to the

gymnasium where I collected an oxygen cylinder and mask.       $T0*

I brought this to the girl and attempted to ressusitate her.Together

with the girls father Mr Hicks we put the girl 'Vicky' into an

ambulance and travelled to the Northern General Hospital. Mouth to

Mouth was administered throughout the journey to the hospital and then

on arrival the hospital medical staff took over.   After assisting a

doctor at the hospital I was told that Vicky was dead.

I then took her to the temporary mortuary at the hospital where I left

the body.    I then searched for and found Mr Hicks who was informed

about his daughters death.

I then returned to the gorund and after a short standby in the North

Stand went off duty.

        Thursday 6th July, 1989 (060789) I was shown a video tape Reference

         number (MAP 7) Exhibit Number (             ) by

        At this point I was engaged with the deceased No 89 VICTORIA JANE

        to pull her out . When I got her out I passed her over to the side

        fence where someone took her from me.        When I got out from the pen I

        went over to where she was lying.

        I have also viewed Map 1 time reference 15.27.06 Data Base.        I can

       The ambulance arrives and goes across the screen from right to left

        doing something with the oxygen bottle on the ground to a girl.            I

           Following the briefing at Hillsborough on the 15th of April 1989

           (150489), I was deployed to work duties at the rear of the West stand

           guarding the fences which had formed a sterile area in which the

           television crews and pass cars were kept.   Our duties in the serial 6,

           under DS 729 NORBURN were to prevent the fans from both clubs clashing

           and to avoid congestion in the area.

           At 13.30 hrs (1330) that date I recall being approached by a group of

           youths aged from 12 - 14 yrs who were badgering us, the Police for

           tickets.

           I was offered    50.00 pounds, the notes being pushed towards me, to

           take them into the ground.    I refused.

           As late as 13.50 hrs (1350) I was still being approached and asked for

           tickets for the Liverpool end to which I advised that they leave the

           area if they didn't have tickets.    Throughout this time fans for the

           Liverpool end were directed to their end of the ground, the access

           being via Parkside Rd, which I was able to point out frcxn my position.

           As the kick-off time neared, more and more fans arrived at the

           fencing, wanting to be let through but I had to tell them to go round.

           As their agitation grew so they began running round rather then taking

           their time.

           At 14.20 hrs (1420) I left my station to use the toilet in the

           ground.    As I looked into the ground, being interested in the number

           of fans in the ground, I recall that the Kop end looked full to
MARSHALL              ALAN                                               2


capacity, comparing it with the Leppings Lane end which was empty in

its wing areas and yet busy in the pen behind the net, often the place

that fills first for the goal view.

Approaching kick-off time accompanied by Police Constable 169

FILLINGHAM we informed other officers that the time set for our meal

had arrived and we would come back to the barriers after meal, at

15.30 (1530).

On reaching the area immediately at the rear of the standing

turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end we informed other officers on our

meal group what our intentions were, they replied' 'WE'VE BEEN RUN OFF

OUR FEET, WE'LL BE A WHILE YET'.

Police Constable FILLINGHAM and I then entered the ground at the rear

of the cantilever seeing some of the Liverpool fans urinating at the

rear of the stand and pointing out the toilets.   At approximately

15.03 (1503) I recall hearing a tannoy message to the effect 'WILL

THE FANS PLEASE GET OFF THE PITCH' fearing that there may be a pitch

invasion we ran into the second access tunnel into the stand and there

saw a number of people on the pitch at the rear of the Leppings Lane

Goal, the players were walking towards the centre of the pitch.     We

immediately entered the area around the perimeter track/ making our

way towards the rear of the goal.

Close behind the goal were what seemed to be dozens of fans and

Police.    I was still under the impression that an invasion had taken

place, however on nearing the scene I could see through gaps in the

crowd that up to a dozen people of ages ranging between 14-17 years.

These youngsters we squashed against the meshing, their colour ranged

from pale blue to almost purple, vomit and other body matter could be

seen coming from their mouths and noses, some of them having their

arms held aloft, which in turn were pressed against the mesh.     My
MARSHALL                ALAN                                                 3


first reaction was to say 'Fucking hell they're dead, this doesn't

happen at football matches this is Hillsborough'.

My feelings were of complete helplessness thinking that if only I

could move the mesh I could get somebody out.       I screamed until I was

horse, telling the fans massed behind the front two rows of crushed

fans to move back.     They seemed oblivious to my pleas, and continued

to climb forward as if their only escape was over the fence.        I

stood on the advertising hoardings, reaching over trying to pull the

fans over.     The gate into the pen which at this time was to my left

was being pulled as if to open it, the weight of bodies against it

though stopped that because the body weight 'belling out' the bottom

of the gate.

Despite pulling numerous fans over the top, an Officer carrying a loud

hailer shouted behind me, "COME ON LADS LETS GET THEM OUT"       the gate

was then opened but still we were unable to get to the fans, some of

the dead were blocking the gate, others were waist deep in people, the

weight and volume stopping egress.      The officer then shouted again

into the loud hailer, "GET IN THERE AND LETS GET THEM OUT". With PC

1535   FAIRCLOUGH and 169 FILLINGHAM I then entered the pen behind

the net. I was sickened, having to walk over the bodies' of

fans those alive and dead but knew I had to for the sake of others who

had fallen to the floor.       For what seemed an age I worked at the back

of the net ferrying the bodies to the fence which, a short time

earlier I had assisted to tear from the frame.      Body after body was

passed through, as we worked I heard the fans amassed in the upper

tier, the Leppings Lane stand, shouting, "YOU BASTARDS HAVE DONE

THIS       YOU MURDERING BLACK BASTARDS".    I said nothing but a

Liverpool fan at the side of me said, "WE'VE DONE THIS, WE'VE KILLED

OURSELVES JUST LIKE WE DID AT HEYSEL" he then began to threaten other
MARSHALL               ALAN


youths in the stand.     He was shouting at them but I told him to ignore

them.

After moving numerous bodies I helped an officer lift a young girl out

of the pile of bodies.    We walked to the fence with her and I jumped

onto the perimeter, carrying her in my arms towards an ambulance.

After leaving her on the grass for a short while a further officer

approached me holding an oxygen bottle, he said, Come on do you know

first aid...we can save this one I carried the girl to the rear of

an open ambulance placing her along the seats.    Almost imnediately

two others were placed in the van, one a youth being put on its

floor.   The ambulance then shut its doors and we set off at speed to

the N.G.H.           __ ___ _____ _________________ _________ ______

Throughout the journey we attempted to revive the girl using chest and

heart masseage, the mask of the oxygen being placed intermittently

over her mouth as we tried to pump air into her body.     The girl was

Victoria HICKS.     Her father was trying mouth to mouth after I had

cleared the vomit from her mouth.     The second girl in the ambulance

was I believe her older sister.                               :,

Upon arrival at the N.G.H. I carried the body of the girl into the

hospital and placed her on a wooden bench, the only free furniture in

turn I then carried the youth, my strength seemed that of ten, the

hospital was in chaos with bodies everywhere and medical staff

running about.     The thing I remember most though in the hospital was

the young girls father, his behaviour in the ambulance.       He was

shouting, 'YOU BASTARDS HAVE DONE THIS TO MY BABY, THIS IS THE

POLICE'S FAULT'.     I had just looked at a fellow officer.    Neither of

us could offer solace or say a thing.     I felt a numbness of disbelief.

On returning to Hillsborough I walked onto the pitch which was now a

mass of bodies, Police and people alike.     It was then that all I could
MARSHALL             ALAN                                                5


do was try to calm people down who were being almost hysterical.

As the crowd finally dispersed I re-entered the pen and saw that a

barrier had been bent to the floor and was twisted.   My thoughts were

why Hillsborough, this is one of the safest grounds in the country.      I

then picked up the scarves off the floor and placed them onto a

barrier.

        Further to my previous statement on 10 July 1989 (100789), I was shown

        a video tape, Reference Number MAP/7 (          ) Exhibit Number

         (        )                      of the West Midlands Police.

        At tape Reference Number 15.21.48.22. (Data Base) I can identify

        myself on the video, located in the centre bottom left.

        At this point I was engaged with the deceased NA 64, Sarah Louise

        HICKS.    I was engaged with a number of other Officers at this

        location, removing bodies from the front of the terrace.        I removed a

        body of a female who I now understand to be Sarah Louise IJICKS.      I

        passed the body through a hole in the perimeter fencing to another

        Officer who I am unable to identify.

        Later the same day, I gave first aid to another girl who I know to be

        Victoria HICKS. After giving first aid to this girl on the pitch, I

        travelled with her in the rear of a South Yorkshire ambulance to

        Northern General Hospital in Sheffield.

        I travelled in the ambulance with another Officer who I do not know,

        an ambulanceman, a wcman who I thought was a nurse and the father of

        the deceased, Mr Trevor HICKS.

        Throughout the journey, whilst trying to resuscitate the HICKS' girl,

       we were subject to verbal abuse from Mr HICKS.

OCCUPATION:     AMBULANCE OFFICER BATEMDOR



           1.        I ANTHONY JAMES EEWARDS will say: I was b o m on



                     I work as an ambulance man on day work.     I joined SYMAS in

                    September 1988 (000988).      I started part time and was

                     promoted to day work on 6th March 1989 (060389).     I had

                    previously been in the ambulance service in 1973 (000073)

                     in Liverpool and had received qualified status.     I had done

                     further training which lead to me being admitted as a Fellow

                    of the Ambulance Service Institute.     This is a qualification

                    above the normal standard but it is not a paramedics course

                    although it is an introduction to it. I left the service in >

                     1982 (000082) and went to Sheffield Polytechnic to <±3 social

                    studies.      I worked in adult education until I rejoined the

                    service.

                    On Thursday and Friday I worked a shift of 0800 (0800) hours

                    to 1630 (1630) hours.

                    On Saturday I was to work from 0900 (0900) hours to 1730

                    (1730) hours. I was with                 to is a qualified

                    ambulanceman and was acting as driver.

                    The first I remember about the Hillsborough incident is when

                    we were taking a patient to the Northern General Hospital.

                    We heard control telling a crew from Rotherham to go to the

                    gym at Hillsborough where they would be met by a station officer.
EDWARDS                ANTHONY    JAMES                                       2
                                                                                  3
           I thought that it would be some form of a fight going on.

           Our radio was on the day frequency which I think is channel

           4.   We stayed on the channel all the way through the day.

          We did change to ERC after.

6.         It was about 1510 (1510) to 1515 (1515) hours when we were on

          our way to the Northern General Hospital.        We arrived at

          Northern General about 5 minutes later.

          There were various messages ccming over the radio but I was

          concentrating on the patient in the ambulance.

          We took the patient into the hospital and it was sometime

          before 1530 (1530) hours when we got back to the ambulance

          and started to clean up.        We then gave the call to control

          that we were clear.     I made the call on channel 4 Control

          then told us to go to Hillsborough gym entrance where we

          would be met by an ambulance officer.       We did not know which

          side the gym entrance was on and I was going to use the

          radio to try and find out where the entrance was.       We went

          down to the traffic island on Herries Road which is about

          one and a half miles away.

          Control then gave a message to all mobiles.       They repeated

          that it was for all mobiles and said that they were to

          proceed to the gym entrance at Hillsborough as they had

          notification of seme fatalities.       I think this was around

          1530 (1530) hours.     We arrived at the ground at about

          1532 (1532) hours.

          There were no problems in approaching the ground until

          we reached the junction of Herries Road, South and

          Penistone Road.   There were two ambulances in front of us

          and a police officer was directing us to park behind them.




                                                                                  102
                                                                   ><r     io

EDWARDS                 ANIHONY   JAMES                                     f3


          A short time later, probably no more than a minute we were

          moved into the entrance while the next ambulance was sent to

          the further gate.       I saw              tanding outside the

          first entrance and point for us to go into it.      The police

          officer shouted to us that if we went to the second entrance

          then we would be able to get out via the first entrance.

          DALE said no and that he wanted us to go into the first

          entrance.     We did so.   We were met by Mr. HOPKINS the

          Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer.      Mr. HIGGINS was also

          there.     HIGGINS told us to drive up behind an ambulance

          which was already parked and almost at the same time HOPKINS

          told us to go on to the field.      At this stage there were

          rows of police with vans and stretchers ccraing out of the

          entrance on to the pitch.       It was clear that there were dead

          bodies on at least two of the stretchers.      I would say the

          time was about 1535 (1535) hours.

7.        We were stopped by a police officer at the entrance to the

          corridor to the pitch.      The officer at the front of the

          ambulance said that we could not get through Spectators were

          shouting at us about a body on a stretcher.      We stopped and

          Hopkins came up to the ambulance and opened the door.       I

          said that the police officer said that we could not go

          through and he replied that he wanted us on the pitch

          immediately.     He said that there were casualties at the far

          end of the ground and he needed us on the pitch and that we

          were not to stop for anyone until we got to the far end of

          the ground.     He told us to put our two tones on and go

          through.     We did as we were told and went past the

          policemen.     It was slow progress getting on to the pitch but




                                                                                 103
EDWARDS               ANTHONY   JAMES


          we certainly did not get stuck.     On the pitch we saw five

          to six boards being used as stretchers with bodies there on

          being carried by fans.   We drove past them while they were

          screaming at us to stop.      The St. John's ambulance was

          leaving the pitch as we came through the entrance.       It

          waited until we were out of the way before going off the

          pitch.   We were the only ambulance on the pitch by this

          stage.   We drove up to the 18 yard box in front of the west

          stand.   There were people everywhere. tty driver was looking

          for an officer but we could not find one anywhere.      There

          were fans bashing on the ambulance wanting us to stop and

          help their friends.    We were approached by a woman and she
                                                                             1
          shouted through the window and said that she had

          resuscitated a casualty.      I got out of the vehicle with a          /?g'r V'

          bag, mask and airways, and went to a body which was lying in

          front of the goal in the 18 yard area.      Someone was giving

          mouth to mouth resuscitation.      I noticed the colour of the

          patient and was doubtful whether the patient had in fact

          been revived.   All the time there were people shouting at me

          for oxygen and all I could remember shouting was 'one at a

          time'. I knelt down over a male casualty and someone

          deliberately kicked me in the back and said 'what about my

          daughter' or 'what about his daughter.' I continued to look

          after the boy on the floor.      I decided that we needed to

          move him.   I told the people around me to pick him up and I

          shouted to someone to bring a girl that I had also briefly

          seen.    I would say it was now about 1540 (1540) hours.       I

          looked for my driver and he had driven over to the other

          side of the goal towards the comer flag.

          We carried the bodies over to the ambulance and I was being

          followed by people carrying other bodies.       When I got to the

          ambulance I saw that someone had already opened the back

          doors.   I asked a police officer to stay with me to look

          after me after I was kicked.     We put the young boy on the

          left hand side and the girl on the right hand side and

          someone else put another body on the floor down the middle.

          Then someone tried to get another person into the

          ambulance.     I shouted to the policeman to take the person

          off and he did so.

8.        When I turned round again the ambulance was packed with people

          and so I asked the police to clear the ambulance.           The doors

          were closed but I could hear people kicking the         back doors

          and wanting attention.      In the ambulance there were now three

          bodies, a nurse, two ^blicemen, two spectators, my driver and

          me.   One of the spectators was trying to revive the young boy.

          The nurse was frcm Nottingham.     She had been a spectator who

          had volunteered to help during the chaos on the pitch.

          She was using a bag and mask correctly.     The other spectator

          was holding the head of the girl.     I t   o   l   d   p    o    get

          going.          put on the lights and horns and drove off the

          pitch.   I have no idea what time it was by now.        I assume

          that the nan on the floor was dead.     I tended to the girl

          and showed how to do mouth to mouth resuscitation while the

          spectator did cardiac compressions.     I was very upset by

          this stage.     I cannot remember anything about getting out of

          the ground and I do not know what time it was. I remember

          nothing of the journey up to the Northern General Hospital.

          We took the three bodies into casualty and I assisted

          the doctor for a few minutes.     We then loaded trolleys back

          on to the ambulance.      I asked the spectator nurse to cone

          back with us and she agreed.     I cannot remember any

          instructions as to what we were to do next.     We drove back

          down to the ground and I could hear conversations on the

          radio to do with Hillsborough but I was not really taking

          than in.

10.       There were no problems in the approach to the ground, with

          police cars everywhere.     This time we went through the

          second entrance.     There were a couple of ambulances ahead

          of us.     I also saw a West Yorkshire ambulance.   I said to

                         that I would report to an officer to see what

          wanted to be done.      I went to an ambulance officer in the

          yard although I do not know his name.     He said that

                   3ras to stay with his vehicle and that I was to help

          as much as I could.      I went back to the ambulance to tell

                  to stay with his vehicle but discovered that he had

          gone.     I went to the next ambulance and helped myself to

          a first aid box. Just then a casualty on a trolley was

          brought up.     He appeared asthmatic and semi-conscious.

          I put him on the second ambulance.     Then the attendant on

          the second ambulance                 arrived with another

          casualty.     Once they were loaded, that ambulance set off

          to the hospital.

11.       I then met another officer whan I did not know.     He told me

          casualties out and pointed towards the gym.     I did not

          realise before this that the casualties were in the gym.

          I went into the gym and met Station Officer HIGGINS.        He

          said that I was to assist priorities.     I then helped with




                                                                                 106
EDWARDS                 AOTHONY   JAMES


          trolleys and directed arriving ambulance men to priority

          casualties.     Each time I loaded a priority onto a trolley

          I went back to the senior officer in the yard to tell him

          what I had done and asked for more instructions.       He would

          then tell me to go looking for priorities again.

12 .      At one stage I offered to be a runner because there appeared

          to be no carmunication system between the officers at the

          ground as the radios were not working.       Within a short space

          of time we did not need trolleys and were onto the walking

          wounded.

          By this time I felt exhausted and explained to Station Officer

          HIGGINS that I had been kicked.

          He told me that I had to go to casualty.        I did not want

          to.   He said that there was a vehicle going to

          Hallamshire Hospital and said that I should go with it.

13.       I was at the Hallamshire for about 20 minutes.

          then arrived with seme doctors who were needed at casualty.

          It was quite by accident that we met up at the Hallamshire.

14.       The control officer on the radio told us to have a drink

          at the Hallamshire.      We did so and we took two, transfers

          to King Edward Hospital.        We finished at King Edwards at

          about 1900 (1900) and then control told us that we were

          finished.

          We went back to the station, cleaned the ambulance and went

          off shift.

          I was not aware that there was any Hillsborough plan or of

          the role that the gym was to play in it.        I did not

          realise that the gym was the casualty clearing centre or the

          temporary mortuary until I was told by one of the officers.




                                                                              107

           Further to my previous statement dated the 7th May 1989 (070589) I

           have today been seen by Inspector LAYTON of the West Midlands Police

           in respect of several aspects of the Hillsborough Inquiry.

           On page four of that statement I referred to an ihcident when I was

           kicked by somebody as I was kneeling down over a male casualty.

           I was actually kicked on my left hand side by my rib cage, but with

           the people crowded around me and with so much going on, I was not

           aware of who had actually done it.

           I also made reference to a comment which I believed I had heard in

           relation to somebodies daughter.

           I would like to clarify that comment by saying that I cannot be sure

           at all if the reference was made to my daughter or his daughter.

           I have given the matter some thought and I would like to say that I do

           not wish to make an official complaint of assault in relation to that

           particular incident.

           It is not the first time I have been assualted in the course of my

           job.     I understand the reasons, even if I don't agree with them, and

           in this case I feel that, that should be the end of the matter.




                                                                                          1

        In any event the assault as such did not prevent me from continuing my

        work.     I only went to hospital because I was told to and I only

        suffered a reddening of the skin, as a reuslt of the kick.

               I am a qualified doctor iry qualifications are MBBS I qualified in 1985

               (000085) at the London Hospital.

               I have worked at the Northern General Hospital for the past eighteen

            months.    On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) it was my working

            weekend and I was at the Northern General Hospital.     At approximately

               15.05/15.10 (1505/1510) hours that afternoon, I received a telephone

            call from John DUNCAN who is a Senior registrar at the Northern

            General Hospital and he stated that he was at home watching the TV and

            that something was occurring at the Hillsborough football ground.        He
w
            went on to say that there were ambulances present and to expect

            patients at the hospital.

            As a result of this call I made my way to casualty to see if I could

            obtain any further details.     I spoke with Charge Nurse BAITY but he

            was unable to provide me with further details I ensured that the staff

            on the general surgical wards and in theatre were aware and that their

            services may be required and then I made my way back to casualty.

            Upon my return I contacted switchboard and informed them that we had a

            major incident and asked them to contact Mr DUNCAN and Mr MCSHANE
CALDER                 JOHN   SINCLAIR                                3 2/ 2


 (Registrar) I believe that this was done.

By this time the first patients were arriving by ambulance. The first

patient that I had any dealings with was a white male, aged in his

late teens.    He appeared to be approximately 5'10 tall (5'10), of

medium build and had short dark brown hair.    I am unable to recall

what he was wearing, I think he had a pair of jeans on and that his

top clothing had already been removed.    He was in the resuscitation

roan when I first made contact and to the best of my recollection

there was a staff nurse from casualty whose name I do not know, with

the patient.    The youth was cyanosed but there were no obvious

external injuries.    He was having difficulty breathing.

He had small pupils but they were reactive to light.     I intubated the

patient and together with the nurse we ventilated him.      In a short

time his colour returned to normal.

I re-examined the patient who was still unconscious and could not find

any obvious major abdominal or chest injuries.     The patient appeared

stable and in view of this and the fact that I was required to assist

with other patients I left the nurse, who had been assisting me, to

continue ventilating the patient.    As far as I am aware this patient

lived, I would certainly have expected him to.

The next person I assisted was a young female, I now know that this

patient was Victoria HICKS.    She was brought into the room where I was

dealing with the patient I have described above.    I remember she was

accompanied by a young man who I believe was wearing a Liverpool

shirt, he was definately a football supporter and an ambulanceman or

policeman.    The supporter appeared distressed and was calling for a

doctor to assist.

The female was not breathing her face was purple, her pupils were

fixed and dilated, and I recall that she had vcmit in her mouth.

There was a staff nurse present whose name I do not know.     I intubated

the patient.     There was no ambu-bag immediately available so I blew

down the tube and vomit came back up the tube and her lungs did not

appear to expand.    We sucked out the tube and then connected it to an

ambu-bag and whilst the staff nurse manually ventilated the patient I

inserted an IV line into her arm and adminstered adrenaline.     I think

that a cardiac monitor had been attached and there were no signs of

cardiac activity.    The patient was still deeply cyanosed with fixed

dilated pupils.     I do recall giving the patient some intra cardiac

adrenaline but there was still no response.    After approximately ten

to fifteen minutes, I made the decision to stop treatment.     I then

moved on to other patients to see if I could be of assistance.     I did

not have any further dealings with Victoria HICKS.

I recall that I moved on to two or three other patients to see if I

could help but all of them had sufficient medical staff with them and

appeared to be receiving adequate treatment.     I cannot describe any of

the above patients or their condition.    By this time the place was

chaotic.

The next patient that I had specific dealings with was a young white

male, aged approximately fourteen/fifteen years of age. 'He was

brought into the clean theatre on an ambulance stretcher.    I can't

remember who carried the patient into the hospital.    Martin McSHANE,

John DUNCAN and I approached the patient I immediately saw that he was

not breathing and that he was cyanosed.    I started to put a cannula

into his arm but before I had finished John DUNCAN certified the

patient dead and instructed me not to proceed.

As previously stated the patient was a white male aged fourteen to

fifteen years.    He had short dark hair and was of very slim build I

cannot recall what clothing he was wearing.

        I have been shown some photographs by WPS APPLETON on todays date,

        16.10.89 (161089) and from the photographs shown I would say that the

        photograph bearing the print number eighty two (Philip STEELE) is the

        best resemblance to the patient that I am referring to.

        Once the patient had been certified dead by John DUNCAN I had no

        further dealings with the patient.

        I moved on and assisted with several other patients including seme in

        ITU but to the best of my knowledge rone of these people died.

        At the beginning of my statement I refer to the first patient that I

        dealt with whom I believe lived to be in the resuscitation room, I

        now believe that this patient was in fact in clean theatre. He was

        definately in the same room that Victoria HICKS received her treatment

        in.

               On Saturday 15th April (150489) this year              I   went to           Hillsborough to

               watch Liverpool play Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup Soni Final,

               infact   I   went to the same game last year(000088).                I       went on the

               Saturday with three friends of mine, they are

                                             we travelled up in                we went over the

               Pennines, the same route as last year missing the M62, we left my

               house at eleven o'clock (1100) in the morning i                  n             a   n       d

               we didn't stop until we got to Sheffield, the only hold up we

               encountered on the way was one in Stockport where we were held up in

               traffic for five or ten minutes.

               We stopped on the outskirts of Sheffield at a pub for a drink, infact

               again it was the same pub we stopped at last year.                       I    can't remember

               the name of the pub, but             I   know there was a cricket pitch next to it,

               it could have been called the Porterhouse, or one of those Porterhouse

               steak houses, we got there at about half past one to quarter to two

               (1330 - 1345).            I   had three pints at the pub and we left at about

               twenty to twenty five past two (1420 - 1425), we knew where we were as
                                                                 7>oc3f/
MCCAFFREY              PAUL                                              /2


we did exactly the same last year.

We drove down toward the ground and parked the car in the same area as

we parked last year, but I can't remember the name of the road we

parked in, but it had sandstone wall on one side and houses on the

other, I forgot to mention that as we were leaving the pub four or

five football fans were just going in.

We walked from the car down the hill towards the ground, two of us had

got tickets for the west stand and me e            had tickets for the

terraces, up and till now it was just like last years game.     When I

got to the gates of the Leppings Lane end it was about quarter to

three (1445) and I was shocked to see the amount ofpeople trying to

get in, unlike last year there was no order,no queuing or anything, it

was just a mass of people, there weresome policemen on horseback

trying their best to do what they could to get some order, I think

there were three of than, but they didn't have a chance to be honest.

At this time I was with       , the other t w o __________________ had left

us to go to the West Stand.   I was just standing in the mass of

people, the turnstiles were some twenty five to thirty yards away at

least, and by this time there were quite a few more people     behind us

and others arriving all the time.     I saw a policeman infront of me in

the crowd, he was wearing a flat cap and had a walkie-talkie.      He

looked as though he was trying to make his way towards the policemen

on horseback but he didn't have much chance, he was getting pushed

and shoved like the rest of us.     I could also see some policemens

helmets there could have been about half a dozen, these were over by

the turnstiles that I wanted to go in.    Last year it was totally

different, I arrived about the same time but there was a couple of

queues stretching back onto the footpath by the road and I managed to

get in quite easily.    As I was standing there I said to          "We're
MCCAFFREY              PAUL                                    2>or 2 4    /


not going to get in here before the kick off".       I didn't look at my

watch but you knew we would miss the beginning.

        said to me lets follow those, there were some people just

infront of         tnd to the side, climbing over the railings that

take you to the side of the river, we followed them and climbed over

and there were also others following us, we managed to walk along side

the river quite easily, and it was our intention to climb back over

the railings by the turnstiles to hopefully get in quicker, so as not

to miss the beginning of the game.

When I got near the turnstiles which I could see through the fence, I

saw there was a gate open and I could see people walking through into

the ground, they weren't pouring through they were walking through as

though there was some-body official on the other side, I got through a

hole in the fence and walked through the gate witl-_______     I was

expecting somebody there to collect m y ticket, but there was no one

about, at this time m y immediate thought was that the gate had been

opened by some fans, anyway I just carried on and walked with

towards the tunnel which takes you through to the terraces behind the

goal.

The walk from the open gate to the tunnel was no problem', there

was no pushing or anything.       I walked into the tunnel there were no

signs of any police or stewards about, and about half way down the

tunnel we both stopped for a pee, infact where we stopped was a gap

inbetween others who were urinating.      There were peope urinating both

sides of the tunnel and from what I could see the whole length of the

tunnel as well.    I have been to this ground several times and I still

don't know where the toilet is.      After I finished m y pee, I walked

towards the ground, it was m y intention to stand where I did last year,

right behind the goals.       When I got to the end of the tunnel there was
MCCAFFREY              PAUL                                2)0 c 2 f j 4
no signs of any police or stewards and I saw Alan HANSEN on the pitch

which surprised me, the game hadn't yet kicked off.    I pushed my way

through a few people to get to where I wanted to stand, anc            said

to me "It's choca in here, why do we want to come in here".    I told

him it would quieten down.          was behind me and I was leading the

way.   Then a surge came and I was pushed forward.    I thought at first

it was just like a normal surge which I have been in numerous times at

home games, and I was expecting the crowd to go back, but they didn't.

It just increased and the pressure got worse.    I was just moving

forward, I couldn't help it, and I was pushed up against a crash

barrier.    Because of the pressure on me against the barrier I had to

move and both of us,          first, managed to get down underneath the

barrier and in front of it.    A couple of others got under with us.      I

was standing up in front of the barrier and was still being crushed,

usually when you get in front it eases off, but it didn't.     It must

have been about a minute or so and I heard a cracking noise and felt

something hit me on the legs, but I don't know if it was the barrier

or a person.    People behind me must have fell face down because I

could feel them grabbing at my legs.    I was still being pushed and

crushed.    By this time I could feel myself walking on pdople, and it

got to the stage where you just couldn't go any further.     There was

somebody in arms distance of my right arm and I tried to pull them up

but by this time I was weak and out of breath and I couldn't move him.

I grabbed hold of his collar, he was a young boy aged about 10 to 14

years with blond air and wearing a white top.    He never spoke to me,

he just disappeared under other people.     I was a bit light headed

myself and I remembei         saying he was weak and I told him to just

keep breathing.    After that I was stuck and there was no movement

either way.    It seemed like a long time, but it might have been just
MCCAFFREY               PAUL                                   2X>csf! 5

minutes.     Fortunately I was standing up.   People were screaming, and I

could feel people pulling my hair.      I saw the gate at the front open

and I saw a few get out ontothe pitch, then it was closed by the

police.     The police who closed it stayed with it, they didn't walk

away.     At this time I didn't know if the game had finished or not, I

was about six (6'0) to seven (7'0) feet away fromthe perimeter fence,

and I remember shouting for help to get me out.      Eventually I don't

know how long, a tall bloke with fair hair, wearing a black and white

jumper and black trousers managed to pull me out, he was behind me. By

this time there were gaps behind him, and it was clearing.      There

were bodies all around me either dead or unconscious.      I wouldn't like

to say how many but at least over twenty.      I started to help the

others then,     I carried out the body of a girl that was lying just to

the left of where I had been.      I carried her out with a policeman to

behind us where there was more space.      On seeing a photograph the

next day or Monday, I recognised the girl I carried with the policeman

as being a girl called Sarah HICKS.

After I had carried the girl with the policeman, I went back to help

other people and I was helping pick them up and get them over the

fence into the section on our right (pen 2).      I assisted with at least

six or seven people over the fence.      I then sat down because I was

feeling light headed again.      A policeman came up to me and asked me if

I was alright, and I told him I'd be o.k.      I sat there for a bit

longer, talking to a lad by the side of me who had hurt his leg.         I

helped carry him onto the pitch with a policeman.      Then I started

looking for my mate            :or about twenty minutes, I couldn't find

him so I went back into pen 3 through the open gate and walked back

through the tunnel and made my way back up to the car.      When I got

back to the car the other three were there, it would have been about

       twenty to quarter to five (1640) - (1645).     A woman from over   the road

       came over with a cup of tea for us and let us use the phone.       The

        following Monday I saw a picture in the Mirror and I saw           In the

       picture, and I also saw myself.     It shows you exactly where I   was in

       the terraces.

       Last year I was stopped by the police on the bridge in Leppings Lane

       and asked if I had a ticket, there were also stewards on the entrance

        to the tunnel last year,    Last year the police were getting everybody

        into orderly queues, which helped.   Unfortunately this year there

       weren't enough police outside the Leppings Lane entrances, and I would

        also say that if the segregation fences were removed allowing people

        to move sideways I don't think you would have got a crush at all, you

        would have got the people in.

           In addition to the Questionnaire (QSL225) I initially furnished to the

           West Midlands Police, I can assist with the following information

           after entering the Hillsborough ground via the tunnel.   I turned right

           into the pen which I understand is identifiable as Pen 3.   Myself and

                        made our way into the pen, the time must have been about

           ten to three (1450), it was packed solid with people, the only way of ,

           moving was with the crowd, as a result of this we kept moving forward

           and subsequently came up against a crush barrier, this barrier I can

           say was the one that eventually snapped, the pressure was

           indescribable.   I was experiencing shortage of breath, the initial

           reaction was panic and then a prescence of mind to try and get out of

           the situation you were in, but this was virtually impossible, I lost

           all track of time so how long I suffered this I've no idea, I

           recollect that there was a surge forward and almost immediately a

           release of pressure from behind in this moment        and I shot

           underneath this barrier and came out directly in front of it.     The

           match had not started at this point but the players were on the pitch

           having the kick about.

The pressure was lighter once I had got away fran the barrier, it was

still a heavy crush situation but not as bad as behind the barrier.     I

realised things were not normal, I went to last years match and it was

nothing like this situation.   There were people screaming from behind,

we tried to assist seme of the fans that were against the barrier by

holding the person behind them back to give sufficient rocm for that

person to drop down under the barrier, this worked a couple of times.

I can give no times whatsoever.   I was aware that the match had kicked

off by this time but had not seen it.   Somewhere along the line I

recollect that there were people underfoot being trampled on.    I

heard a loud crack and something hit me on my left leg, there was an

instant surge of people and although I was moved forward it wasn't by

a great deal because of the volume of people in front.   I had a good

idea that the crack I heard was the barrier snapping and actually

commented tq_______ hat the barrier had snapped, consequently when it

did snap, people fell over that were directly against it.   I therefore

assume that the people who fell forward after, came over the top of

them.

There were people falling all around you but there was very little

that you could do to assist, I had one arm free but couldn't do a lot.

I was obviously aware that people were being pulled out from behind

either into the stands or going back through the tunnel, it took sane

time for the penny to drop and realise that the pen was becoming more

spacious and you could actually move.   Where I was there were quite a

few bodies lying on the floor, I would say there were in excess of 20

people lying on the floor, it would be an impossibility for me to say

whether all of than were dead although it became apparent when I began

to assist to take than out that some were semi-conscious. We helped

to lift these persons into the adjoining pen which is identifiable as

Pen 2.   I cannot describe any of these persons at all.    I do

recollect that prior to the barrier snapping there was a youth just in

front of me and to my right, when I got pushed forward, I noticed his

head by my waist, I don't think that was his actual height so it would

be safe to say that he had fallen, he wasn't answering when I was

shouting at him so I don't know what condition he was in, I grabbed

hold of his shirt collar and tried to lift him, within minutes the

barrier snapped and I lost him.    I would describe him as possibly

being under 15 years of age, he had blond fair hair, short and spiked

on the top he was wearing a white sports shirt similar to a "Lacoste"

shirt with the soft collar.     I cannot describe him further.

Whilst assisting with the people over the fences.     The only person I

can identify was that of Sarah HICKS, I can identify her

by seeing her photograph in the paper the next day.     I saw her lying

to the left of the barrier and maybe 10 - 12 feet (10'00)

(12'00) forward.   She was lying on her back, I was trying to lift her

when a male police officer who I cannot identify came over to help

me, together we carried her out through the perimeter gate and onto

the pitch by the track at this point there were a lot of police

officers by the gate, I was struggling to hold her and another police

officer came to assist and took her off me and set her down on the

pitch near to the goal I think.     I went back onto the terraces.    I

recollect that Sarah HICKS was wearing a white top and jeans, she had

quite fair hair, shoulder length and she was slightly built.      I do not

recollect the Sunday paper that I saw the picture but it was

definitely her.                                                           ^

Once back on the terraces I continued to help a lot of people to pick

up the bodies that were remaining.     I had became separated frcm_______

       didn't find him so I went back onto the terraces and made my way back

        through the tunnel and back to the car, where I met up with

        I was wearing a crew neck sweater, it was a dark green at the top to

       the middle and navy blue at the bottom and I think the sleeves were

        half and half as well and blue denim jeans and white training shoes.

                        According to Mr. Jeffrey Rex, another spectator, who
                        was also in enclosure 3, by 1455 hours the crush in
                        that pen was so severe he was unable to move at all.
                        He says he saw the two girls and could see that Sarah
                        was holding up Victoria who appeared unconscious.

                        Mr. Leslie Tudor was standing in enclosure 3 and saw
                        Victoria and Sarah some two feet in front of him.    He
                B       says that after the two teams came o n t o the pitch
                        there was pressure from the crowd behind which caused
                        him to be pushed forwards.   He then realised that
                        Vicky and Sarah were now positioned some three or four
                        people behind him.   Mr. Tudor describes how the
                        crushing continued in enclosure 3.

                        Mr. Paul McCaffrey was also subjected to crushing in
                        enclosure 3, having entered there at about 1450.    He
                        says he heard a crack which he believes was a crush
                        barrier snapping and then saw people falling over.
                        Once he was in a position' to do so Mr. McCaffrey began
                        to assist people out of the enclosure.    He says he saw
                        a girl he now knows to be Sarah lying in pen 3 on her
                        back.
                D
                        Sarah was carried out of the enclosure by Police
                        Constable Alan Marshall via a hole in the perimeter
                        fence where she was handed to two off-duty Lincolnshire
                        Police Officers.   These were Detective Constable James
                        Greaves and Detective Constable Fred Maddox.

                        Sarah was placed on the pitch where DC Greaves
                    E   commenced mouth to mouth resuscitation whilst DC Maddox
                        carried out heart massage.

                        These two officers were joined in their resuscitation
                        attempts by firstly an off-duty ambulance man, Mr.
                        Andrew Lawson and secondly, Dr. Colin Flenley., who was
                        also a spectator at the ground.    Mr. Hicks also
                        fought desperately to revive Sarah but by now had to
                        make a critical decision.   He knew that Sarah was
                        receiving treatment from a group of people, of which
                        one in particular was competent.   Mr. Hicks now knows
                        this man to be Dr. Flenley.   Mr. Hicks went in the
                        ambulance with Vicky, as you will hear shortly.

                        At approximately 1538 Sarah was pi aced on a temporary
                        stretcher and carried across the p itch by Detective
                        Constables Greaves and Maddox and other persons to the
                        entrance of the gymnasium where a temporary mortuary
                        had been set up.   There the offic ers continued in
                        their attempt to resuscitate Sarah     They were then
                        joined by an as yet unidentified m ember of a medical
                        team who stated that the girl was beyond help.

               My name is James Russell GREAVES.     I am a Detective Constable,

               presently stationed at Lincoln Police Station.

               On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I attended Hillsborough Football

               Ground with a view to watching Liverpool football club playing

               Nottingham Forest.    I was picked up at my home address at 10.20 am

               (1020) by DC MADDOX from Grantham CID, in his private car.     We

               collected DC DAWSON and DC WILKINSON from Lincoln.     Also present

               were DC LOCKETT, his brothers, Christopher and Grant LOCKETT, and

               Christopher's wife, Karen.     We left Lincoln in two cars at about 10.40

^              am (1040) and travelled to Sheffield via the A57.     All persons are

               Liverpool supporters.     I had four tickets for South Stand which had

               been purchased by DC MADDOX in Sheffield.     We had paid the face value

               for the tickets, ie     10.   I think POL DC LOCKETT had tickets for the

               terrace area. On approaching Sheffield city centre, the traffic flow

               was heavy and it was mainly cars containing Nottingham Forest

               supporters.   We drove through the city and parked outside the Queens

               Ground Public House in Langsett Road.     We all went into the pub and

               the time was around twelve noon (1200).     We left the pub at about 1.15
GREAVES                JAMES   RUSSELL                        jfiO-CJ'/j2

pm (1315) to make our way to the ground.      DC LOCKETT, Christopher

LOCKETT, Karen LOCKETT and DC DAWSON, had left a short time before

myself, DC MADDOX, DC WILKINSON and Grant LOCKETT.

The four of us in our group walked down to the ground, stopping on

the way for something to eat in a fish and chip shop.     The pavements

were crowded on approaching the ground, mainly by Nottingham Forest

supporters.    Everyone was in good humour and there were no signs of

any trouble.   We arrived at the ground at about 1.45 pm (1345).     We

walked through the main entrance of North Road and made our way to

the main entrance of the south stand.     We were held up by the arrival

of the Nottingham Forest Players' Coach and stood and watched the

players get off the coach and enter the ground.     We entered the ground

via gate marked 'E'. There were no queues at that gate.      We made our

way to our seats via gangway 13.    My seat number was 23 row NN.    There

were stewards inside the South Stand and everything was running

smoothly and in an orderly fashion.      We sat together in the four seats

next to one another.    At this time it would be about 1.50 pm (1350).

I had been to the same semi-final match last year and had also gone to

the Sheffield Wednesday vs Liverpool match at Hillsborough earlier

this season.    On that occasion, I had stood on the terratcing at the

Leppings Lane end.     When I sat down I noticed straight away that the

centre section of the terracing behind the goal at the Leppings Lane

end was very full.     I could see that there was spaces on the terracing

on the side section nearest to where I was sat.      I spoke to DC

MADDOX about this and we then noticed that people, mainly youngsters,

were climbing over the dividing fence from the side section nearest to

us into the centre section.     I think this was because most of the

singing for Liverpool was caning from lads in the centre section.       We

then noticed that two lads in the centre section were climbing up
GREAVES                JAMES    RUSSELL                                 3?/
either onto people's shoulders or the barriers and then diving

backwards into the crowd.      This was being done in a good humoured way,

or appeared so from where we were sat.      I noticed that the police

observation post was just to my left and slightly backwards from

where I was sat.    I saw the post was manned.     I then saw a young lad

about twelve to thirteen years, carrying what appeared to be a

carrier bag, being chased by the police around the perimeter area

from the direction of the West Stand.     The lad climbed over the wall

to our left and disappeared from view.     The Police Officers stood on

the perimeter area below us and were trying to communicate with the

police observation post with a personal radio with no success.      We

assumed the lad had climbed over the wall or stolen something.

A Policeman and Policewanan then climbed onto a dividing wall at the

end of the South Stand and edged their way up to the observation box

and banged on the window and shouted to the officers inside.       DC

MADDOX and myself talked about this and the fact that the radios may

not have been working in that part of the ground.      The two teams then

came out for a warm up period on the pitch.      The centre section was

getting more and more crowded and I commented on this to DC MADDOX

and we were continually looking into that area trying to'see the other

four members of our party.     The players left the pitch at about 2.45

pm (1445).    We then saw that the crowding was such in the centre

section that people were climbing over the front fencing onto the

pitch.    We thought, at this stage, it was overcrowding or fans

fighting amongst themselves.     I then saw Christopher LOCKETT walk from

the centre section area along the pitch perimeter and then go through

the gate into the terrace area nearest to the South Stand.      He looked

very distressed and, at that stage, because he was alone, we thought

that the others had not managed to get in.       I then saw Karen LOCKETT
GREAVES                JAMES   RUSSELL                       J)$C 'S?j 4
making her way from the fence of the centre section, again towards the

South Stand.    Her arm was bandaged, and it appeared she had received

some form of first aid.     Christopher LOCKETT then came out of the side

section and went to Karen and they made their way to the players'

tunnel.   I think several minutes before the match started, there was a

rush of people from the rear of the West Stand, through onto the

terracing.     The side section nearest us filled up very quickly and I

noticed movement in the centre section as if even more people were

forcing their way in at the back.

People in the centre section appeared to be moving forwards but not

returning back to where they had once stood.    The match kicked off,

people were still earning over the fence of the centre section.    It was

still unclear why this was.     After about five minutes, a young lad was

carried from the centre section area and placed on the perimeter track,

below where we were sat, by a Police Officer, a uniform PC.     The lad

would be about twelve years old with blond hair and was unconscious.

The lad was given mouth to mouth and, after several minutes, was

removed by a medical team.     We then noticed that a large number of

people were climbing over from the centre section over the perimeter

fencing and standing behind the goal.     There were uniform officers

stood at the fencing and I think it was at this point that people

started coming through the gates in the fencing in the centre section.

It was obvious that the game had to be stopped as people were

encroaching on to the pitch.     I saw a Senior Police Officer run up to

the linesman on the South Stand side and speak to him.    The linesman

did not seem to take much notice and carried on with the game.     I then

saw another Senior Police Officer, run from the direction of the West

Stand onto the pitch, speak to the referee and the game was stopped.

I then saw DC DAWSON running towards the South Stand on the pitch.
GREAVES                 JAMES    RUSSELL                         J)@C3>7j
He began screaming and shouting at us that he needed help because he

couldn't find DC LOCKETT.       He was very distressed.   His clothing

was ripped.    Myself and DC MADDOX went down onto the pitch.

DC DAWSON told us that he thought DC LOCKETT may have been injured.

I left DC DAWSON with DC WILKINSON and Grant LOCKETT, then I

immediately ran, with DC MADDOX, towards the centre section behind

the goal.     I climbed up the fencing and looked over. I saw a large

number of bodies lying on the terracing below the fence.       All the

bodies I could see appeared to be below the barriers which were

twisted and damaged.     I could see people were still trapped and alive

under seme of the bodies and these people were being helped out by

other fans. I leant over the top of the fencing and tried to lift a

man out who was trapped by his legs.       I was unable to lift him because

of the spikes on the top of the fencing.       I let go of the man and

then bent the spikes over and, again tried to lift him but he was

too heavy.    The man was then assisted by someone on the terracing.

I saw that DC MADDOX was trying to get through the gate frc*n the

perimeter onto the terracing but was unable to do so because of

people coning out and trying to get bodies out.

I stood on the fencing and looked slowly amongst the bodies trying to

make out whether DC LOCKETT was amongst them.       I counted about

thirty but could not see DC LOCKETT.       I then noticed DC MADDOX

was shouting at me and that DC LOCKETT was stood leaning over a

barrier at the top of the terracing.       I shouted to him and he

eventually replied that he was alright.

We then ran back to the South Stand and shouted to the others that

DC LOCKETT was alive.    Myself and DC MADDOX then ran back to

the centre section to help the injured.

By this time the pitch area in front of the goal was crowded with
GREAVES                JAMES   RUSSELL                          J ’CX*   $ / / 6



injured and dead fans.    The uniform police were trying to pall the

fence down and many seemed in a shocked and dazed state.      We went to

the first gate in the fencing in the centre section.     The body of a

male, white, 5'10 (5'10), 28-35 years, light coloured hair, large

build, about 16 stone, with a beer gut, partially unclothed, wearing

bright green underpants, was passed through the gate.     Myself and

DC MADDOX carried the man onto the pitch and commenced attempts to

resuscitate him.     I carried out mouth to mouth and DC MADDOX

pumped his chest.    The man vendted, I continued but, despite the

lungs inflating, there was no signs of life.     We decided, after

several minutes, because there was no response and the colour of the

man, that it was a lost cause.    We left him on the pitch and ran back

to the gate in the fencing.    A young girl was passed out.     I would

describe her as being 15-16 years of age, white, with shoulder length

brown hair.    She was slim and wearing a white tee shirt and blue jeans.

Myself and DC MADDOX carried her onto the pitch and began

resuscitation.     The girl did not have a pulse.   I commenced mouth to

mouth and DC MADDOX worked on her chest.     She vomited and we

continued with the resuscitation.     A man began shouting at me - did I

know what I was doing - it was apparent it was her father and we had

placed her on the pitch next to her sister who also appeared dead.

The father was very distressed and was shouting for a doctor and

ambulance because of his two girls.      I continued resuscitation.      Her

chest was inflating but we could get no response.     Again, her father

approached me and I informed him I was trained and did know what I was

doing.    We were then joined by a man, approximately 45 years ofjage,

5'8 (5'08), athletic build, wearing a shirt and slacks.       He informed

us he was a doctor, asked us our first names and said we would stick

together as a medical team.     We continued mouth to mouth with the
GREAVES                 JAMES   RUSSELL                                 2    ?/


girl.     I was aware that the same sort of thing was taking place all

around me and the girl's father was still shouting for an ambulance.

I then noticed an ambulance driving round the perimeter in front of

the West Stand towards us.      The ambulance stopped.    There was a rush

towards the ambulance.     I continued giving the girl mouth to mouth.

I believe her sister was put in the ambulance.

We decided to put our girl in the ambulance and picked her up but the

ambulance drove off.

We then got a piece of wooden hoarding, placed the girl on it and ran

with her across the pitch to the entrance to the gym because we

thought more ambulances were there.        There were no ambulances so we

put the girl down and continued mouth to mouth for several minutes.

We were then approached by a medical team who examined the girl and

told us she was dead and beyond help.        We left the girl outside the

gym and myself, DC MADDOX and the doctor ran back down the pitch

to the centre section behind the goal.        It appeared all the bodies had

been removed and were lying on the pitch.        I believe we attempted to

resuscitate two further men, both did not respond, and I am unable to

describe them.     I then made my way back, with DC MADDOX, and went

in the gym which was being used as a first aid centre and mortuary.

We gave assistance to injured fans in the gym for some time and then

reported for duty to the Detective Inspector in the mortuary area.

Whilst in the mortuary, two Liverpool fans came in looking for the

young son.    They became aggressive and myself and DC MADDOX

calmed them down and removed them.        We were told that our assistance

was no longer required so we went back onto the pitch looking for the

others.    We found DC WILKINSON and went through the entrance we had

come in.     It was now about 5.15 pm (1715), we found DC LOCKETT and

DAWSON outside, who were both injured and in a very distressed
                                                                            /

state.    We made our way back to where we had left our car.    We walked

through a park and, as we did so, a small number of Liverpool and

Forest fans were fighting around us.     We got back to the car and we

drove back to Lincoln as we thought the hospitals at Sheffield would

be overcrowded.    We arrived at Lincoln County Hospital at about 7.00

pm (1900) and left DC's LOCKETT and DAWSON for treatment.      I was then

dropped off at my home address at 7.30 pn (1930).

My comments on what I saw of the incident at Hillsborough that day

are that it appears that it had been misjudged by the authorities for

the amount of people wishing to see the game.    Although it was the

same game as last year, no account appears to have been made to take

account of the success both teams have had this season.     The people

on the terracing were unable to move forward because of the fencing.

It appears the Police at the fencing were unaware of what was

happening.   When there was a rush of people onto the terraces there

appeared to be no-one controlling the entrances that I could see.

There was no-one trying to prevent fans climbing over from the side

sections into the centre section before the game started.      The

fences between the side section and the centre section prevented fans

moving to the sides as the crowds built up.     When a large number of

injured and dead fans were on the pitch there was very little first

aid equipment and staff and, as I said previously, only the one

ambulance appeared on the pitch where it was needed most.

I believe from photographs seen in the press that the young girl I

was involved with is Victoria HICKS.

            My name is Fred Maddox.    I am a Detective Constable currently

            stationed at Grantham Police Station.    I went to the football match

            between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on Saturday 15 April

            1989 (150489).   I do not support any particular team.    I went in a

            party of eight including myself in two cars.     I obtained four tickets

            for the South Stand from a                                for which I

            paid #10 per ticket, I understand the other tickets were initially

            tickets obtained by        LOCKETT.   The party consisted of myself,

            Russell GREAVES, Mark WILKINSON and Sean DAWSON,          LOCKETT.       They

            are all Police Officers.   Also in the party were Christopher and

            Karen Lockett and .        :younger brother Grant LOCKETT.

            I used my car and parked up Russell GREAVES at 10.25am (1025).      We

            went directly to Mark WILKINSON'S house in Lincoln where I picked Mark

            and Sean Dawson up.   Also at that address was        , Chris and Karen

            and her younger brother.   They went in another car driven by Chris and

            we left for Sheffield at 10.30am (1030).   We took it quite steady as

            Chris was driving a small Fiesta and did not know the way.    I took

            them through Sheffield to Hammerton Road and I think we parked our

cars on Langsett Road outside the Queens Ground Public House which is

near to Hammerton Road Police Station.     I think we got there at about

12 Midday (1200).     We popped into the pub and I drank three bacardi's

and cokes and I think we left at about 1.15pm (1315), that is myself,

Mark, Russell and Grant.     We had the four stand tickets. The other

four had left us earlier in the pub in order to swop their tickets at

the ground.     We agreed to meet them later after the match in the pub.

We walked down towards Hillsborough and bought seme chips along the

way.     We walked down to the main gates situated adjacent to Penistone

Road.     It was very crowded at this area but I put this down to the

fact that the Forest team coach had just arrived and was pulling into

the car park outside the South Stand.     I did not see a lot of

Policemen on the approach to the ground and in my mind there was a lot

of Liverpool and Nottingham Supporters about.     This is not something

out of the ordinary. I did see a few of the male supporters drinking

out of cans but not disorderly.     It was quite a friendly atmosphere

all round.     The sun was shining and everyone was anticipating a good

game.    After the team coach had left, the crowd around the South Stand

diminished somewhat, by the time we got to gate 'E' there was no

pressure at all.    We entered via the turnstile at gate 'E'.     I handed

my ticket over and was given the stub.     We turned to our right and was

shown by a steward where to go.     We went up gangway 'B' and another

steward pointed us in the direction of row 'NN'. We went to seat 22

and Russell was on one side of me Mark sat on the other side as did

Grant.    We had a good seat, we were positioned about forty yards from

the centre of the goal in front of the West Stand and about ten yards

to the right of the Police control box.    We took our seats and sat

down at about 13.45hrs (1345).     At that time the ground looked three

quarters full.     In fact I made canment that the Supporters in the
MADDOX                  FREDRICK                                   'M 2$}
Spion Kop end were all Liverpool but I was told that I had it wrong

and that the Liverpool Supporters had been allocated to the West

Stand.     At about 2.00pm (1400) it looked like the centre pens of the

West Stand were full.     The two pens either side appeared to be empty

by comparison.     There still appeared to be an obvious lack of

police prescence.     There were views expressed between Russell and

myself about the policing of the match, presumably as we had been at

the same match last year as I recall there appeared to be more high

profile policing.     It was a nice afternoon, the crowd around us, both

Liverpool and Nottingham Supporters, were very amenable and I remarked

on the pleasantness of the day.     I told Mark about the ground and how

it was a first class staduim for this event in comparison to others.

Around about 2.30pm (1430) there was even more people piled into the

centre sections of Leppings Lane End and there was even supporters

climbing over the fence from the quadrangles into the centre

section.     It was obviously overfull.   I saw two or three lads climb

the barriers in the centre pens with their backs to the pitch and

then dive backwards onto the heads of the supporters.     At about that

time I saw a young boy of about 14 yrs, being chased by a Policeman

and Policewoman from the area of the West Stand goal area.     He ran

along the cinder track into the c o m e r of the South Stand and ran

along the fence towards the Police control box.     The Policeman gave

chase and I think the young lad got over the fence to the other side.

The Policeman appeared to be in seme confusion as he couldn't

communicate with the control box and so he had to knock on the window

to the Police Control Box.     There seemed to be six or seven officers

in the Control Box and they appeared to be looking in the direction of

pens three and four.

I can then remember the players ccming onto the pitch at about
MADDOX                  FREDRICK                                 M
                                                                 "» 3?/
2.50pm (1450).    Just prior to this I seem to recall that Chris

LOCKETT came from behind the goal on the cinder track as if he had

been let out of the West Stand with a four other people.       He looked

dishevelled and his face appeared to be bruised.       I thought he'd been

fighting.    That was my first indication that the other few of our

party of eight had succeeded in exchanging their tickets.       Shortly

after he came out, the players came out.       By this time the Leppings

Lane End was full behind the goal and people began to climb out from

the back up into the seating area above.       I also saw a large number

of supporters cone round into the quadrangle between the West Stand

and the South Stand. They all came round together          as ifthey'd all

been let in at once.     The game got under way and people began climbing

over the perimeter fence from behind the goal.       At some stage I saw a

little boy carried by a Police Officer and another person and placed

on the grass directly in front of us.        It was obvious that the boy

appeared to be dying.     The constable and the person tried to revive

him with mouth to mouth and heart massage.       At first we thought they'd

succeeded.    A few minutes later they carried him away to the players

tunnel.     Then more supporters came through the gate behind the goal

but more came over the fence and came onto the grass and even onto

the pitch and collapsed. More Police came and to all intents and

purposes it appeared to me to be a public order situation.        I saw

Karen Lockett ccoie out onto the playing area.      I don't know if she

came over the fence or not.        I saw her walk towards the first gate

between the South and West Stand. She had her arm in a sling and she

was being assisted by Sean DAWSON.       She disappeared I don't know where

she went.    A uniformed Policeman ran up to the linesman and I thought

he was going to stop the game.       By now supporters were around the goal

and this was     taking your attention away from the game.    The linesman
MADDOX                  FREDRICK                                3&C    3ffJ   5


ran up to the halfway line and I think a conversation took place

between the two.     A senior officer in a flat cap went onto the pitch

and straight to the referee and called a halt to the game.      By this

time there was a line of Policemen, they were stood in the goal mouth

in front of the West Stand as if in readiness for a public order

situation.    People continued to come over the fences and the game was

stopped.     Sean DAWSON came up to the grass in front of us.   I believe

he had a rough idea of where our seats were.     He located us and

shouted "I can't find Julian." Russell and I decided we'd better

find Julian so I went down to the Steward at the top of gangway 8,

showed him my warrant card and told him I was an off duty police

officer.     Russell came with me and we then went over the wall at the

front of the South Stand onto the pitch.     I went straight to gate

number 3 and there was a line of policemen.     They had already begun to

pass bodies out along this line.     I went up to the gate and said

something to the effect that I was a police detective to the policeman.

I could see bodies piled up on each other about three deep in the

bottom two or three steps of the standing area in the West Stand.         I

could obviously see there was a major problem.     My first thought

though was to locate PC LOCKETT.

Russell jumped up onto the boarding and looked over the top of the

fence.     I looked at the faces of the bodies but I didn't see Julian

there.     I thought that perhaps he hadn't been involved and so I looked

up the banking and saw him standing two thirds of the way up the

terracing.    He was obviously totally disorientated.   I pointed him

out to Russell and he eventually acknowledged us and he indicated he

was alright. We then left that area and went back onto the pitch and

found Sean DAWSON.    We told him Julian was alright and everyone in our

party was safe.     Russell and Sean wanted to leave and find the others
MADDOX                  FREDRICK


but I told than that we had a job to do here and Russell and I would

go and help if we could and meet the others later. Russell and I went

back to the gate and I think we came across the body of a man aged

about 35 yrs, 16 stone in weight.     He had been put down by police

officers.    Russell gave him mouth to mouth and I gave him heart

massage.    He was quite obviously dead so we left him.   I think his

clothing had been pulled away, his shirt was up and his trousers down.

He had green pants on.     There was a lot of bodies on the pitch already

and numerous civilians were giving resuscitation and heart massage.

Russell and I went to the gate and the body of a 14-15 year old girl

was passed out and we carried her unwittingly to the body of her
                                                                                \Ji CTb C i-A.
sister who was being assisted by others and her father who was there
                                                                            \
irate and very distressed. Russell gave her mouth to mouth and I gave

her heart massage.

At one stage the father got very irate and panic set in, well in.

Another man came up who I understand was a medic of some sort.      I

don't know his name but he was 40-45 yrs, with grey hair and slightly

built with a grey jacket.     The girl we were trying to revive was 14-
                                                                                  V
15, brown hair (long), white tee shirt, blue jeans, no bra.    We spent

some time trying to revive her and an ambulance came from behind the

West Stand goal.     As it did approach it was very slow, hindered by the

bodies and the confusion and chaos.     I think it ran over the legs of

some dead people.     It pulled past us and I believe that they put the

other girl in.     The father of the girls was shouting for us to put our

girl in and as we picked her up the ambulance drove off.    The father

went with the ambulance. We got hold of an advertisement board, put

the girl on it and ran to the far comer, towards the gymnasium area.

When we got there, there were no ambulances.    We put her down and

continued trying to revive her, Russell mouth to mouth and myself
MADDOX                                FREDRICK


heart massage. Sometime later, a medic came with an oxygen cylinder

and ventilator. He gave her a little oxygen and checked her eyes with

a torch and told us we were wasting our time, go and find someone else

you can help.

The grey haired man who had joined us on the pitch said, "You are my                                                /

we'll work together."

We all ran back on the pitch to the goal mouth and I'm sure we tried

one more body who was male other than he was well dead.                                           It seemed

that all the bodies had been removed fron the terracing area in the

West Stand and were either being carried away or on the grass.

I think we then went back across the field to the gymnasium to see if

we could help in there.                    While we were in there we had an altercation

with two Liverpool supporters who had somehow been let in the

gymnasium which was being used as a mortuary.                                    They said they were

looking for a son or friend.                        I told them they shouldn't be in there

but, as they were already in there, we had to placate them and usher

them out.         I spoke with Detective Inspector TOWELL, Hammerton Rd CID,

who police the area.                   I offered him our services and asked if there

was anything we could do.                     Obviously there wasn't                    because it became

an administrative task, picking up the pieces, so we went to locate

our party.

We went back to the seats, spoke with a steward who told us they had

left the ground sometime ago and, as we were there, Mark WILKINSON came

up to us.         We went out the South Stand, out towards the Directors'

Entrance.

A lot of people were leaving at this time, it was now about 5.00 pm

(1700).       We turned and went back to the rear of the West Stand.                                           We

were turned away by Police Officers and so we returned back towards



                                                                                                                        74
MADDOX               FREDRICK                                   W C ltf *

the Directors' Entrance.    We met up with        LOCKETT and Sean

DAWSON at the back of the Directors' Entrance into the South Stand.

There were five of us at this stage.    Chris I/DCKETT and his wife,

Karen, and Grant had already left to go hone in Grimsby.

injuries to his leg and was in deep shock.    He'd had difficulty in

breathing and was in deep stock too.    I decided the best thing to do

was to get them to hospital but not in Sheffield as they were, no

doubt, full.   I decided to take them back to Lincoln.

We walked past the South Stand, a driver of a Rolls Royce asked us if

we wanted to sit in his car for a while to recover.      We spent 10

minutes there whilst the crowd thinned out a little.

We then walked out the main gates, turned right and walked through

the park towards Hillsborough town centre.    While we were going

through the park we saw a little trouble between the Nottingham and

Liverpool supporters..   I think Notts fans had picked a fight with a

couple of Liverpool lads.    We made our way back to the car, got in

the vehicle and drove to Lincoln Hospital at about 7.30 pm (1930).

M y observations in hindsight are that I couldn't see why one supporter

had to assist in the attempted recovery of injured people.

For m y mind, too many policemen stood about and let supporters try to

recover people and administer mouth to mouth and heart massage when

really it is policemen who are trained to do this.

           I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police presently

        stationed at Bentley Police Station situated within Doncaster Division.

        At 3.25pm (1525) on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I was on duty

        in Bentley Section when I was instructed to attend immediately with

        other Officers to Hillsborough Football Stadium, Hillsborough,

        Sheffield.

        At 3.50pm (1550) that same date I arrived at Hillsborough where I was

        directed to the gymnasium within the ground which had been converted

        into a temporary mortuary.    Once inside I saw a large number of

        bodies, male, female, young and old, laid out.    I immediately went to

        the body of a young female who I now know was that of Sarah Louise

        HICKS.    I felt for any sign of life but found none, however, the body

        was still quite warm.

        At 4.20pm (1620) that date, Dr BULL from the Royal Hallamshire

        arrived and pronounced the life of Sarah Louise HICKS extinct.

        On completion of the doctors examination, I carried out a search of

        the body and recovered the following property;

        1.    1 x Silver ring
         ™                    ™         “                             iv      3 t
         2. 1 x Gold heart shaped ring.

         3. 1 x 'Switch' make black wrist watch.

         4. 1 x Football ticket for Leppings Lane End.

         The deceased was wearing a white 'T' shirt, white bra, blue jeans,

         brown leather belt and black and grey woollen jumper.    She was not
         wearing any shoes or socks.

         I then commenced to complete as far as practicable a sudden death

         report, where at the same time the body was bagged and labelled to

         await formal identification.   Until that time I remained with the
         deceased.

         At 9.35pm (2135) that same date, I took the deceased to a specified

         location within the gymnasium where Mr Trevor HICKS of

                                             identified to me that the body of
         the young female was that of his daughter, Sarah Louise HICKS.   I

        then accompanied the deceased to the Medico Legal Centre, Sheffield,

        where she was handed over to the Mortuary Attendant's.

        On completion I returned to the gymnasium but took no further active

        part in any identification of any bodies.

  THE NEED FOR USING THE RECOVERY POSITION
  At any stage during recovery, the escape of saliva and of fluid from the
  stomach and nose usually takes place; this may be followed by retching and
  vomiting. To prevent inhalation of this fluid or vomit, the casualty should
  be carefully placed in the recovery position.


m THE METHOD OF TURNING A CASUALTY
M INTO THE RECOVERY POSITION
  To   turn a casualty when lying on his back into the recovery position:
  a.   Kneel beside the casualty.
  b.   Remove any spectacles.
  c.   Straighten the legs.
  d.   Place the near arm out at right angles to his body, elbow bent, palm
       uppermost.
  e.   Bring the far arm across the chest. Hold hand, palm outwards, against
       near cheek.
  f.   With your other hand, grasp far thigh. Pull knee up, keeping foot flat on
       ground.
  g.   Keeping his hand pressed against his cheek, pull at thigh to roll him
       towards you onto his side.
  h.   Tilt head back to keep airway open. Adjust hand under cheek, if
       necessary, to maintain position.
  i.   Adjust upper leg if necessary, so that hip and knee are bent at right
       angles.
  j.   Dial 999 for an ambulance.
  k.   Check breathing and pulse frequently.




  M odification
  It may not be possible to follow the above procedure where there are
  fractures to the upper or lower body, when the casualty is lying in a confined
  space or if it is not possible to use the bent limbs as props. In such cases the
  recovery position can be maintained by laying a rolled blanket down the
  front of the body. This method can also be used to transport a casualty on a
  stretcher in the recovery position.

    I am     the    father        of    the   late      Sarah       and Victoria          Hicks       who    unfortunately
^ ’■^re among the 95 people so tragically killed at Hillsborough.


    You     will    require          little   reminder        of     the    increasingly          acrimonious            rounds
    of    accusation        and        counter     accusation         that     abounded          in    the    media          until
    you had the good sense to issue your instruction to the police and request
    a general cessation.
    Despite        acute    provocation           and    at    times       great    personal          anquish,          my    wife
    and     I have     resisted          numerous        opportunities         to    fuel       that        deplorable         and
    unseemly        state       of     affairs,      preferring        to     assist       the    Taylor        Inquiry         in
    its difficult task - including being prepared to await the outcome before
    making detailed comment to the media.


    I write        to you        today    to request          your    comment       and    intervention            following
^        3 statement,       widely reported               in the media,            by South Yorkshire's Deputy
    Chief     Constable          Peter    Hayes      to    the      effect     that       "no    further       action          was
    required"        in      connection           with        the     actions       and        behaviour           of        Chief
    Superintendant David Duckenfield.
    I was under           the    impression        that    Lord Justice Taylor on                     the one hand and
    the internal Police Investigation by the West Midlands force on the other,
    would    draw     conclusions          when    and     only when         they had          concluded        their work
    and     had    time     to    deliberate.           Despite      the    careful        wording,          the   issue        of
    this statement by the Deputy Chief Constable pre-empts these findings!


    Words fail me when I try to convey to you the hurt and totally unneccessary
    anguish       this untimely statement has given my wife,                                   myself and presumably
    the     other    families.          Apart     from    the       crass    nature       of    this    action,          I find
    the need to issue such a statement at this time beyond contempt.
                                                                                                   hoc qt/z
                                                         2


One can only conclude that this is yet a further attempt by South Yorkshire
Police      to    divert    public       opinion        away    from   their       appalling        performance
both on the fatal day and subsequent to it.


Apart      from   obvious       offence    to     the    bereaved,      how      are    the   public       to view
this premature ''absolution" by the Deputy Chief Constable!
That a senior police officer - who by his own admission deliberately chose
to deceive his superiors (and others!) should not be disciplined is totally
incredible.
Even if one believes Chief Superintendant Duckenfield's reasons for lying
to the general public at the time,                      (and I am bound to say that I personally
      not!) there could have been no credible reason to have misled the Deputy
Chief Constable.


Is    it    purely      coincidence        that    this        provided     an     excuse     for    the     Chief
Constables silence during the lead-in /initial week of the Taylor Inquiry,
when the fans were able to give their views?
I trust      that       under    the    circumstances          you   will   understand my           fears     of   a
"whitewash"        at the       least and at the worst a deliberate attempt to "close
ranks” and distort the course of justice.


I regret.that Mr.Hayes’s insensitive and untimely public action has further
reduced my opinion of the South Yorkshire senior police.
It leaves me no alternative but to formally complain directly to yourself,
     J to ask you as the vanguard of a Government claiming to be                                     "committed
to    law and      order"       to make    an     unequivocal        statement         of   your    opinion    and
intended actions in the wake of this regrettable development.


I will await your urgent response during the course of today or tomorrow,
but    would      advise    that       should    I fail        to recieve     an       appropriate     response
I reserve         the    right    to    follow    Mr.Hayes       example      and      release      this    letter
to the media tomorrow evening.




Trevor Hicks.

 Dear Home Secretary,
                                       re:- Hillsborough Disaster


 Thank you for your courtesy in replying to my letter of the 7th so promptly
and for your personal expression of sympathy to my wife and I.


 I    was     pleased     to         recieve clarification                of        your     position      regarding
discipline,       however       your     letter          does    not    really       deal    with    the complaint
 I was      making.     Namely,       that        it was       totally    improper          of   the Deputy       Chief
Constable,       whilst        the    Inquiry       is     still    hearing         evidence       and    the    police
 internal       investigation          is     still        taking       place,       to     state     publicly      his
decision regarding further action against Chief Superintendant Duckenfield.


His      very   well    publicised           action       in    stating^ that          having       considered      the
matter       carefully,    subject           to    the    findings       of    the Inquiry          "it   is my view
that     no .further      action        is    required"          appears       to    be     at   great    divergance
from the position you claim in the last paragraph of your reply to me.


      view of the very poor              impression             that the police evidence has created
in    the minds        of the        public, I cannot            help     but    feel       that    the D.C.C.      has
quite       deliberately,       and     most       improperly,          "jumped      the gun"        in an      attempt
to counteract the poor showing of his senior officers at the Inquiry.


As the improper conduct of an officer of the rank of Deputy Chief Constable
is a matter for           you, I would welcome your comments and intentions on this
particular point and await your early reply.


                                              Yours FaLthfully

      Thank you for your further letter of 10 June.


      The responsibility for considering complaints and allegations
against police officers of the rank of Assistant Chief Constable
and above lies with the police authority for the area concerned,
in this case the South Yorkshire Police Authority, and not with
the Home Secretary.


      It would be wrong for me to become involved in any complaints
about the activities of officers of the South Yorkshire Police,
whatever their rank.     This is because if a police officer is
disciplined, he or she has a right of appeal to the Home
Secretary.     I can only be seen to be impartial in the hearing of
an appeal if I have not been previously involved in the case.

       COMPLAINT AGAINST POLICE

       In connection with your complaint against Mr Peter Hayes, Deputy
       Chief Constable of this Force, I have received a copy of your

       appointed K P D Cooper Esq, Assistant Chief Constable of
       Northamptonshire, to investigate the matter.

       COMPLAINT AGAINST POLICE - CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT D DUCKENFIELD

       By now you will have received notification from both the South Yorkshire
       Police and  the Police Complaints Authority that I have been appointed to
       investigate your complaint against police registered in a letter to the Home
       Secretary dated 7 June 1989.

       Can we arrange a mutually convenient time to meet, please, so that I can
       record those matters in statement form and then commence my enquiries?

       I expect that our diaries will be difficult to resolve for an early meeting,
       but I view this matter as a priority and, hopefully, we'll be able to
       rearrange my commitments.  Could I ask you to telephone me at your convenience
       please so the arrangements can be made?  Failing this, I would be happy to
       respond to any correspondence which indicates times and dates you would be
       available.

       Yours sincerely

            Dear Doug

           Re;       Police Compla ints

           Further to our brief telephone conversation, I confirm that I today
           met Assistant Chief Constable Cooper of the Northamptonshire Police
           and Captain Noel Taylor of the Police Complaints Authority. After
           extended discussion of the various protocols and legislation, they
           have taken the attached general statement.

           These will be discussed at a meeting tomorrow involving the West
           Midlands Police, I believe -South Yorkshire Police and the Police
           Complaints Authority.   The inference being that these complaints
           will be transfered to the West Midlands Investigation Team.    As
           background information, I also enclose earlier correspondence
           relating to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield plus correspondence
           of this week relating to Peter Wright.

           Please note my direct line telephone no. 0384 291309 if you require
           to reach me after 5.00 pm before your meeting.

           Best regards




           Trevor Hicks

duties relating to the staging of this football match.




 I am able to identify the following officers and I wish to make a formal

 complaint against them.




 1       Mr Walter Jackson

         Assistant Chief Constable

         South Yorkshire Police



         |*ly complaint against him is that he failed to take control of the

         disaster.




     2   Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield




     3   Superintendent Roger Marshall



     4    Superintendent Bernard Murray




     5    Superintendent Roger Greenwood




          It is my complaint that these officers




           (a)   Failed   to   prevent    a dangerous     build up of supporters      outside


                 of the gates.



           (b)   Failed   to    control    the     movement   of   supporters   subsequent   to

                 the opening of gate       *C '.



                                                                        Signed: Trevor Hicks




                                                                                         303290
                                                                               DoC 4-2j ^
              (c)   Failed   to   respond   to   the   developing   tragedy   and   were    slow

                    to effect a rescue operation.




          I have previously contacted South Yorkshire Police and they have recorded

          two matters of complaint.




              (a)   Incivility towards me by a Police: Inspector.




              (b)   My   treatment by a different Police      Inspector at the temporary

                    mortuary.

   I am writing on behalf of the Police Complaints Authority about the
   complaint you made about the tragic events at Hillsborough on 15
   April 1989 concerning officers of the South Yorkshire Police.   The
   enclosed note explains the independent role of the Authority in the
   complaints procedure and some of the factors which are weighed
   before a decision is made.

  Following the investigation into your complaints, and in accordance
  with procedures laid down, South Yorkshire Police have considered
  whether or not it would be appropriate to prefer disciplinary
  charges against any officer on duty that day, and have sent their
  recommendations to this Authority.

  We have now carefully considered their proposals and the Authority
  have used their statutory powers to direct that disciplinary
  charges be preferred against two officers.

  The Authority thought it right to give you this information to
  coincide with their press statement, but we will be writing to you
  again more fully concerning your own particular complaint in the
        future.   I am sorry that it has taken some time to conclude
  this part of the process but there is a statutory procedure laid
  down ^and we had to await the outcome of the inquest before we could
  consider the matter ourselves.

        Mr T Hicks

                                                      Our Ref:   COM 91/131/39

                                                         2 j f . September,     1991




                             A k    «A.c


                 recal1 that we wrote to you on 15 August 1990 and again on
       11 July 1991 after receiving the report of the investigation into your
       complaints about the conduct of officers of the South Yorkshire Police
       at Hillsborough in April 1989.      As you know, the Authority have
       considered the disciplinary aspects of the case and I enclose a
              • coPY °f the note which explains the independent role of the
       Authority in the complaints procedure and some of the factors which
       a^"e taken into account before a decision is reached.

       The aim of this letter is to explain to you the outcome of your
       specific complaints and which of those are the subject of disciplinary
       charges against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent
       Murray and which are not the subject of disciplinary charges.

       May I fi^st of all express my sincere sympathy at the tragic loss of
                 Y lctoria/ not only on my own behalf but also on behalf of
       the Authority.

    You complained that Superintendent Greenwood failed to prevent the
      I m         JfuPP°fters outside the gates but the investigation has
    established that his command responsibilities did not include the area
    of Leppings Lane outside the stadium.        You also complain that he
    tailed to control the movement of supporters after Gate 'C' had been
    opened and that he was slow to respond to the situation and effect a
             J h-e investi 9 ation established that he had no knowledge of
    Gate C being opened and, therefore, was unable to take any remedial
    action.  He was, in fact, the first senior officer to react to the
         tl°n .inD Pens 3 an.d 4 - Having failed to gain any response from
    the Control Box, Superintendent Greenwood acted on his own initiative
    to approach the referee and stop the match.      He then organised and
    directed groups of police officers in the rescue efforts.     You will
    appreciate that with the number of spectators involved and the limited
    exits available through which the police could relieve the pressure
                                                          J o C   4 Z ) /L



 the rescue operation was unavoidably laborious.        Superintendent
 Greenwood sent officers into Pens 3 and 4 to direct people back
 through the tunnel as soon as it was possible to do so.     His early
 arrival at the scene is confirmed by another officer and by the video
 recordings.

I turn now to your complaints against Superintendent Marshall
regarding his control of supporters in Leppings Lane and his failure
to control the movement of these supporters subsequent to the opening
of Gate 'C'.   Superintendent Marshall says that he requested traffic
to be stopped from entering Leppings Lane at 14.17 hours, and again
at 14.22 hours, before traffic was finally stopped shortly after 14.30
hours.   He took this decision for the safety of the many fans in
Leppings Lane. Because there were so many fans outside the ground he
thought the stands and terraces must still have ample capacity and
that if he could keep people moving they would all be in position by
the start of the match.     Superintendent Marshall pointed out that
unless a breach of public order was threatened he has no legal power
to prevent anyone from using a public thoroughfare.     The Authority
considered that from his perspective it was not unreasonable for
Superintendent Marshall to request Gate 'C' to be opened.    It is the
Authority's view that before granting permission to open that gate the
implications of doing so should have been considered and steps taken
to deal with the rush of fans that would ensue.

Once authority had been given for the opening of Gate 'C' and the
supporters had moved     into the stadium they had gone        out of
Superintendent Marshall's sight and his area of command. Due to   the
large number of people still outside Superintendent Marshall remained
in Leppings Lane but despatched some 30 of his officers into the
stadium.  He describes how when injured people began to be brought
from the West Stand he realised that a serious incident had' occurred
and he then commenced to deal with casualties and fatalities.      He
remained in that area directing operations until he was summoned to
the police control box between 16.00 hours and 16.15 hours when he
briefed Assistant Chief Constable Jackson.

The Authority have carefully studied all the available evidence
concerning the tragic events at Hillsborough and have concluded that
no disciplinary action should be taken against Superintendent
Greenwood and Superintendent Marshall.

You have made several complaints against Chief         Superintendent
Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray who were in      overall charge of
the police arrangements at the ground.     As I have   already told you,
the Authority .have directed - that disciplinary charges     should be A7
preferred against these two officers.     As far as the disciplinary
tribunal is concerned, it is the responsibility        of the Force to
arrange the hearing and they have informed me that the situation at
present is that one of the two officers has been certified medically
unfit.  So the South Yorkshire Police have not yet made the necessary
arrangements for the hearing.

I have spoken to the Assistant Chief Constable and asked him to fix
a date and make all possible progress in the meantime.

A copy of this letter has been sent to the Assistant Chief Constable
of South Yorkshire.

     OPEN LETTER - ISSUED BY FAX AT 11.00 AM - 23RD OCTOBER 1991


TO: MR RICHARD WELLS - CHIEF CONSTABLE,            SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE

       BRIGADIER POWNALL - POLICE COMPLAINTS AUTHORITY

       MR DAVID DUCKENFIELD

      MR BERNARD MURRAY



HILLSBOROUGH/POLICE DISCIPLINE

It    is   now   some months   since   the   Police   Complaints     Authority

instructed the South Yorkshire Police to instigate disciplinary

proceedings against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray in respect of

the Hillsborough Disaster on the 15th April 1989.



Nothing has, so far, happened - allegedly due to Mr Duckenfield's

incapacity on undisclosed sickness grounds.



Whilst we regret Mr Duckenfield's illness, the investigation of

the    Hillsborough     Disaster   remains    a   matter   for    deep   public

concern and it is totally unacceptable for the current stalemate

to continue.        The healing process      and the restoration of the

public's confidence in both the Police and the Judicial Process
                    *



can only begin when these matters are adequately dealt with.



On the 24th of October 1991 it will be 90 days since the 26th of

July, when Mr Duckenfield commenced sick leave.             He will then be

entitled to apply for early retirement on ill health grounds and

the disciplinary matters        relating     to him would        automatically

lapse.
                                                                       JO C   4 -zji5


Whilst acknowledging Mr Duckenfield's right to take this course

of action I implore him not to exercise this option but to grasp

the opportunity of clearing his name by:-



1.   Submitting himself for independent medical assessment.

2.   Allowing       the disciplinary   tribunals   to   proceed with   him

     being legally represented - thus sparing him the rigours of

     the tribunal, yet ensuring his interests are protected.



Similarly    I call upon the South Yorkshire Chief Constable Mr

Richard Wells and the Police Complaints Authority to immediately

begin the disciplinary proceedings involving Mr Murray.



As long ago as October 1989 the All-Party Home Affairs Committee

of MP's     fully    endorsed the retirement statement of the first

Chairman of the Police Authority, Sir Cecil Clothier QC, whp:-

a)   Castigated some Police Forces for delaying disciplinary

     proceedings and failing to prosecute them with vigour.

b)   Expressed concern over the ever-increasing number of cases

      involving officers who were allowed to retire, whilst they

     were under investigation.
                       >
     He called upon the Home Office to set up a Board to review

      all applications for medical retirements under these

      circumstances.

      Called for tougher action to be taken even when an

      Officer was found to be unfit and granted medical

      retirement.

      Called for time limits, to be introduced by the end of

      1989, to eliminate delays in disciplinary proceedings.
One can hardly expect myself, other members of the Hillsborough

families,   or   indeed   the   general   public   to   accept   indefinite

delays and/or this matter not being brought to a satisfactory

conclusion.



I implore all those concerned to prevent further distress and

acrimony by dealing with these outstanding matters immediately.

         PRESS RELEASE - TUESDAY 2 9TH OCTOBER 1991 - 5.3 0 PH


                       TO ALL EDITORS/PRODUCERS



             RE: HILLSBOROUGH - DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES




We are shocked and disappointed at Richard Wells        decision to
retire Mr David Duckenfield on ill-health grounds.

We have no alternative but to accept the independent medical
assessment and the inevitable result of that opinion.

However, we have a deep sense of injustice and that once again
matters have been left unaddressed.

Richard Wells said at the conclusion of the inquest "There are
no winners today" - we echo that sentiment that this is a sad day
for everyone.

    a)      Mr Duckenfield will have to live the rest of     his
             life with this matter hanging over him.

   b)       Many of the families are suffering similar
            medical and psychological conditions.  This
            will be a severe set back to their prospects
            of a speedy recovery.

   c)       The PCA, after a lengthy investigation,
            rejected some of our complaints against other
            officers.   However, they supported our complaints
            against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray by instructing
            the South Yorkshire Police to take disciplinary
            proceedings, despite the South Yorkshire Polices'
            protestation. We are therefore entitled to assume that
            the PCA share our concern and that of Lord Justice
            Taylor that the conduct of these officers, on the day,
            fell short of what can be reasonably expected.       It
            would appear these matters are not now to be addressed.

                                                          2 0 o



   d)    We hereby call upon Richard Wells to give us the
          unequivocal assurance that this decision will not
          affect the tribunal involving Mr Murray and that he
          will proceed forthwith as instructed by the Police
          Complaints Authority.

   e)    We thank the Chief Constable for his concern and
          understanding regarding our anger and dissatisfaction,
          and stress that this matter should never have arisen
          had Mr Peter Wright and Mr David Duckenfield done the
          decent thing and resigned forthwith when the totally
          damning Taylor Enquiry/Interim Report was published.

There will be the inevitable accusation of double standards - no
matter how hard the South Yorkshire Police attempt to deny or
skilfully gift wrap their decision - David Duckenfield's
retirement will further damage the beleaguered reputation of the
Police  in     Britain.   It will also set back the    bridge building
process between Merseyside and Sheffield and once again the
families of the innocent men, women and children who lost their
lives on that dreadful day are the victims of a totally unjust
system.

                                                 part of chief officers to place at least a portion of the blame on

                                                 that the police are only a reflection of s o c i e t y . N e v e r t h e l e s s w e have

           Mr and Mrs T Hicks




           Thank you for your letter of 2 June the contents of which I have noted,
           particularly the way in which you commend Sergeants McCombie and
           Appleton and their Inspector Matt Sawyers for their professional efforts
           in supporting you over these difficult times.

           I have thanked the officers personally on your behalf and also copied
           the letter to the Chief Constable, Mr Dear, who no doubt will write to
           you in due course.




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT         Sheffield

       Mervyn Jones has shown me your letter to him in which you were kind
       enough to congratulate our officers on the help that they were able to
       give you recently.

       This is of course a most distressing time for many people.  My own
       officers are affected by the situation, but of course their emotions are
       nothing compared with those experienced by you both.   In all the
       circumstances it was very kind of you to write and I know that those
       involved will take as much pleasure from reading your comments as I did.

       Please feel free to draw on us whenever you think we might be of
       assistance.  We would like to help.

      Can I add my own expressions of sympathy to the many others you will
      have already received.  I hope that with the passage of time the
      distressing aspects of the tragedies will be replaced in your minds with
      more pleasant and lasting memories of your daughters.

      With my very best regards.

Dear Mr Wright

Re:   Hillsborough Disaster

For some time now I have wrestled with the moral dilema of wishing
to commend one of your constables and yet find it extremely
difficult to write to yourself for reasons of which you are aware.

I wish to commend the actions of Pc.1926 (Peter John McGuiness) who
assisted myself with my two daughters on the pitch, accompanied
myself and Victoria to the Northern General Hospital and then had
the unfortunate task to confirm Victoria's de ath to me.

The work of the West Midlands Video Unit as also highlighted his
earlier involvement with Victoria within Pen 3. Despite the tragic
outcome, I wish to thank and commend Pc.McGuiness to you.

It is my belief that the officer, under extremely harrowing
conditions, did all he could to assist the attempt to save
Victoria, and did so in a professional and caring way.

Please pass this through to Pc McGuiness's line officers for action
as they see fit.

Yours faithfully




Trevor Hicks

 JUd~ /
I have received a report from Superintendent Ashton who, as you are aware,
was appointed to investigate the  complaints you made arising from the manner
in which you were dealt with by police officers in    separate incidents on
the tragic occasion of the Hillsborough Disaster.  I have been deeply touched
by reading Superintendent Ashton's detailed investigation.   I cannot help
but convey, once more, to you and your family, my heartfelt condolences
respecting your terrible loss.

The behaviour you describe of the ranking police officer who swore at you*
from the steps inside the ground   leaves much to be   desired. I am bound to
say that Superintendent Ashton's   enquiry failed to  establish the identity
of this officer but if it had done so I am satisfied that no adequate
explanation of this behaviour could be expected.   At the most charitable
one must suppose that this man completely failed to understand the situation.
I utterly deplore such conduct.

With regard to the second incident occurring near the gymnasium, the officer
has been traced, or to be precise an officer has volunteered himself as the
person to whom you refer.  He admits having a conversation with you,
preventing your unauthorised entrance and to speaking to you about matters
that caused understandable distress.  I am satisfied and, in the
circumstances, I hope you too will accept that there was no intention
whatsoever to be abrupt or unfeeling or to cause you distress although it
is clear that is what resulted.  The officer is deeply upset at the way it
affected both you and your wife.  He has asked me to convey his profound
regret and this I do.

I also wish to express on behalf of the Chief Constable and the Force similar
sentiments.  The depth of your feelings regarding the officer's attitude
has been firmly conveyed to him by Superintendent Ashton as you requested.




                                                             (Cont.
                                   -   2   -




I understand from Superintendent Ashton that he has discussed with you the
administrative considerations surrounding the categorising of complaints
against police and has explained 'informal resolution.'  I am minded to
regard your complaints as capable of being dealt with in this way but before
I come to a decision respecting this I should be grateful if you would
consider the manner in which your complaint has been dealt with during
Superintendent Ashton's investigation and indicate whether you are satisfied
with the outcome, please.

For the attention of Mr K S Anderson

Dear Mr Anderson

Re:   Police Complaints

Thank you for your letter of 17 January, please accept my apologies
for not having responded sooner to your earlier letter.

Having considered the circumstances carefully, I would advise that
my wife and I are prepared to have the two complaints referred to
in your    letter  of  16  November  1989   settled  by  "Informal
Resolution". Please make the necessary arrangements for these two
matters to be concluded forthwith.

May I take this opportunity, through you, to thank Superintendent
Ashton for his efforts and for the considerate way he handled this
difficult assignment.   Both he and his assistant were courteous
and considerate at all times and I would ask you to let them know
how grateful I was for that.

May I also take this opportunity of commending to you the two
ClI.D. officers who not only "saved the day" when I was having my
difficulties at the temporary mortuary, but I understand were
helpful in the investigation of my complaints.   I understand them
to be Detective Sergeant. David Buxton and Detectiv e Sergeant.
Dynes and I would be grateful if you would pass them my thanks for
their help at that most difficult time.

Many things were wr ong and could have been improved but these two
officers behaved in a professional and dignified manner with what
must have been a difficult situation for them also.

I now consider these two complaints closed and     look   forward   to
resolving the others in the fullness of time.

Yours faithfully

          Dear Mr Johnston

          Re:         Chief Constable Mr Peter Wright

          Further to our telephone conversation, I would strongly request
          that the South Yorkshire Police Authority accept Mr Wright's
          resignation on the grounds that his continuance as Chief Constable
          is no longer tenable.

          There are 4 main areas:

          1           He should fulfil the commitment he made on April 21st 1989 to
                      accept full responsibility for the action of his officers.

                              Ref:  Taylor Report para 278.
                              ...the main reason for the disaster was                                        the failure of
                              police control...

          2           Mr Wright    as  Chief  Constable     was responsible for
                       promoting the "officers in charge on the day" and as
                       cited by Lord Justice T a y l o r :-

                             Ref: Taylor Report para 280.
                             ...their handing of problems on the day nor their account
                             of it in evidence showed that the qualities of leadership
                             to be expected of their r a n k . ...

                              ...these represent a number of errors of judgement!

          3           The police case at the Inquiry was conducted in a manner
                       that was unrealistic and despicable. Not only was there
                      no expression of regret for the SYPA part, but they
                      persisted in attempting to blame "drunken fans and late
                      comers"

                             Ref: Taylor Report para 285.
                             ...such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety

                                                                       1

          as to whether lessons have been learned. It would have
          been more seemly and encouraging for the future if
          responsibility had been faced....

     As Chief Constable, instructions to Mr Woodward Q.C. was under
     Mr    Wright's stewardship   and  despite  insurance   company
     requirements, he should have faced his responsibility towards
     the Inquiry, and the feelings of the bereaved families and the
     inj u r e d .

     He himself went on record shortly after April 15th as "seeing
     no connection between opening the gate and the c r u s h i n g " .
     Again a complete error of judgement.  Indeed the behaviour of
     most of the senior officers at the Inquiry was lamentable.

          Ref: Taylor Report para 280.
          ......they were defensive and evasive witnesses...

          Ref: Taylor Report para 279.
          ...... for the most part, the quality of their evidence
          was inversely proportional to their rank.

4    During  the  final stages of    the Inquiry,   the need for
     disciplinary action has been denied, despite officers being
     moved sideways, and Mr Duckenfield suspended.  Even after the
     Taylor Interim Report was published, no acknowledgement of
     police responsibility has been made - indeed we are subjected
     to an accusation of unfairness by the Inquiry towards the
     police, (Mr Woodward Q.C. final submission).

I, as Chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, strongly
request the SYPA to accept Mr Wright's resignation as part of the
necessary resolution of the tragic events on April 1 5th at
Hillsborough.

I would repeat that we, the HFSG, would prefer to deal with these
matters in a private and considered way, but should the SYPA fail
to give our representation due importance,      we will have no
alternative but to initiate a full scale media exercise and will
naturally be petitioning the Home Secretary.

I would repeat Mr Wright's continuance as Chief Constable is not
acceptable and merely on the above his position is totally
untenable and we feel that the SYPA has no alternative but to
accept his resignation forthwith.

Yours faithfully



Trevor Hicks

Thank you for your letter of 21 August about the position of the
Chief C o n s t a b l e of South Yorkshire, Mr Peter Wright, a n d the
South Yorkshire Police Authority.

The decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority not to
accept Mr W r i g h t ’s offer of resignation is a matter for the
Authority alone.        There is no provision in police service
legislation for the Home Secretary to instruct or overrule them
on that.
 You aBked about the Home Secretary's powers under the Police Act
 1964.  There is a power under Section 29(1) of the Police Act
 1964 for the Secretary of State to require a police authority to
 exercise its power to call upon the chief constable to retire in
 the interests of efficiency.  (The Police A uthority’s power is m
 Section 5(4).)  However, the Home Secretary is not aware of any
 grounds which would justify his invoking Section 29(1) in this
 case.
 I know that the Home Secretary would want to express again his
 sympathy to all the families and relatives concerned for their
 great loss.




                                                            P RANSFORD (MS)

          PRESS RELEASE

          Re:  Resignation of Peter Wright, Chief Constable, South Yorkshire
          Police


         The Hillsborough Family Support Group who represent the families
         bereaved at Hillsborough, welcomes the belated resignation of Peter
         Wright from his position as Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
         Police.

         "The buck has finally stopped" and despite the South Yorkshire
         Police Authority's wish to present it otherwise, we are pleased
         that Wright has finally faced his corporate responsibility for the
         tragic events of 15 April 1989.

         He should have gone in August 1989 when he offered to resign but
         then did not.   His force was thoroughly condemned by the Taylor
         Interim Report - written by an eminent member of the judiciary Lord
         Justice Taylor and a fellow Chief Constable Brian Johnson, Chief
         Constable of Lancashire.

         Mr Wright and Sir John "Jack" Layden tried to evade their
         responsibilities then by claiming it was only an Interim Report.
         Taylor's final Report has correctly widened his severe criticism
         to include the other parties responsible either directly or
         indirectly for the disaster.

         He has not however reduced his criticism of the South Yorkshire
         Police, leaving Peter Wright as the chief officer, no option but
         to go.

         We do not accept the South Yorkshire Police Authority's Press
         Release/Statement that Mr Wright has been dedicated in "seeing his
         task t h r o u g h " .

         Taylor's Interim Report paragraph 278 concluded -

                         "... the main reason for the disaster was the
                         failure of police control."

In paragraph 280 he criticised the Senior Officers saying -

          "... neither their handling of problems on the
          day nor their account of it in evidence showed
          the qualities of leadership to be expected of
          their rank."


Taylor concluded his comment    on the police by highlighting his
fears that they w e r e still   evading the real issues when in
Paragraph 285 he said -

          "It   would  have   been  more  seemly   and
          encouraging for the future if responsibility
          had been faced."

We trust that by resigning, albeit to early retirement, Mr Wright
is finally fulfilling his offer to "take full responsibility for
his officers actions" on the day.

It will not allow him to evade any charges which may eminate from
the criminal investigation currently in hand with the West Midlands
Police.  An announcement is expected in April and we trust he will
be "brought to book" just as the P&O Directors in the Zeebrugge
case have been.

We are not aware of any outstanding disciplinary matters against
Mr Wright personally and do not believe he is using the "early
retirement" escape route referred to in the Police Complaints
Authority 1988 Annual Report (Paragraphs 2.17 and 2.18).

We feel that Sir John Layden as Chairman of the Police Authority
should also face up to his responsibilities and,follow Mr Wright's
example forthwith.

   4)He goes on to infer that Lord Justice Taylor was not aware of all of
   the facts   and "that there is a lot    of information that has not yet
   come out." He has therefore, by   his own  admission, failed  to do his
   job. If   he is aware of   information that is material to Lord Justice
   Taylor's conclusions he should have ensured it was placed before him.

   5 ) If, as Mr.Wright   claims,  this material   relates   to  drink then
   presumably it   is additional to that contained in the summary document
   produced by   Professor Usher  for Justice  Taylor ( the one withdrawn
   from circulation)   and to  the post  mortem reports,- in which case we
   shall be asking our lawyers to obtain details   of it   and to establish
   why this was with-held from us.

   6 )If, as  I suspect,   this   is merely   the   same   information, then
   Mr.Wright  is well   aware   that this   has   been   available   for many
   months.Clearly it cannot be "new" or "additional"to that considered by
   Taylor.
   Under these circumstances  his actions constitute a deliberate attempt
   to mislead- an offence under the discipline code or worse.

   7 )Mr.Wright claims   to accept  the findings  of The Taylor Report, and
   even calls it "a superb document".
   Yet he persists in claiming the primary conclusion    is wrong.  That is
   as clear   an example   of "double  standards" as one could ever see and
   serves to underline questions regarding what his motives are.


It is my complaint that in making   these  claims         now   and  publicly Mr.
Wright has  committed a  disgraceful act.  That this act is quite clearly
not what should be expected from  a Chief  O f f i c e r , that   it could effect
the Inquest's impartiality and finally it appears to be a blatant attempt
to distort the course of justice.

As stated earlier,in  view   of   Mr.  Wrights  rank  and  the  time cycles
involved I have forwarded    a copy   of this  letter (and the article) to
Captain Taylor at The Police    Complaints  Authority .for  their immediate
attention and action.

I appreciate   that  the  normal  protocols will need to be observed but
suggest that the 1st May deadline leaves little time for delay.

                               Yours Faithfully,




                                 Trevor Hicks.

Dear Dr Popper

Re;    Complaints against Mr Peter Wright

Thank you   for   your   letter   of   7   March   1990   for    which    I am most
grateful.

I did not expect or intend to solicit any comment from you, my
purpose in copying you in was purely to make you aware of the
circumstances.

I am generally concerned at Mr Wright's behaviour and will of
course deal wit h this through the South Yorkshire Police Authority
in the normal way. I am sure my views were evident to you from the
copy letter y ou received, and need no further elaboration.    What
action you wish to take is purely a matter for yourself and I
understand the extremely delicate situation that exists.

May I take this opportunity of thanking you for your time when we
visited Sheffield for the meeting and I very much appreciate both
on a personal level and in my capacity as Chairman of the Support
Group the fair and sensitive way that you are proposing to conduct
the Inquests.

It will not be an easy time for any of us, including yourself, your
staff and the Jurors but having sat through the meeting and met you
personally, I am convinced that you are doing everything possible
to minimise the distress and I would commend you for taking this
difficult but humane route.

Your

Dear Dr Popper
HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
On behalf of our Group I write to formally register our reservation upon
the Inquest Procedures past and future. In the light of recent events,
including Lord Justice Hiddens recent Liverpool High Court decisions, we
individually and collectively reserve our rights relating to the Inquest
into the deaths of our loved ones.
We co-operated with the arrangements made for the individual resumed but
 "interim" Inquests and that they would be "non-controversial" in nature,
due to the DPP/possible criminal proceedings.        We were advised to
consider them as predominantly an information exercise and .thus
reluctantly accepted a situation where selective and/or restricted
information was presented to the Jury and yourself - without cross
"examination and/or the right of challenge or reply.
Some families expressed openly their reservations regarding the accuracy
of the "Summary" and the degree to which it reflected the fuller
evidence fairly and accurately.     Under this "agreement" contentious
matters (both individual and collective) were not challenged vigorously,
in the belief they would be attended to elsewhere and/or another time.
Regretfully, we now find that such contentious matters as the "15-55
seconds of crushing prior to death" can be presented in another court as
"matters of fact" and influence matters accordingly.
We wish to record our intention, where individual families wish, to
exercise the right to full and thorough Inquests, with all relevant
information presented, all witnesses called and all contentious matters
dealt with in Open Court.
                                                             ycc 4\


Dr Popper                                             24 August 1990
The South Yorkshire Coroner

We would also seek your assurance that should this route become
necessary individual Inquests would be heard and the matters not merely
dispatched via a series of sample cases.
Your comments would be appreciated.

Mr T. Hicks,




22nd October 1990.


Dear Trevor,

There has recently been much discussion in the press and elsewhere about the
re-opening of the Inquests in Sheffield on 19th November 1990.    Until now
information about exactly what these new hearings will entail has been
piecemeal but I believe that I am now in possession of enough information to
be able to write to you and give you a fairly detailed report on what has
been going on and to tell you what is currently under consideration by H.M.
Coroner.
If I may back track a little may I remind you that the interim inquests held
in April and May this year dealt (as far as was possible) with the following
three questions

                     1.   WHO died.

                     2.   WHERE they died.

                     3.   WHEN they died.

Perhaps the most important question in the minds of many families was

                          WHY they died.

but the Coroner was of course unable to deal with this most important
question because of the constraints imposed upon him by the investigation
being undertaken by West Midland Police at the request of the Director of
Public Prosecutions into the question of criminal charges being brought
against an individual or organisation. That investigation now having been
completed and   a decision having been made by the D.P.P.            that no
prosecutions should be instigated the Coroner can now recall his jury and
re-open the inquests to determine the all important question of WHY.
                                                        Cont
                                                                    hoc <■

The way the Coroner should conduct this new hearing has been the subject of
a great deal of very careful thought and consideration by him, I have spoken
to Dr. Popper on a number of       occasions and offered both my own thoughts and
the thoughts expressed by many families and I know that he has taken on
board many of the things I have said to him.

A number of factors have emerged from our discussions ...     some decisions
have been made and others sire still to be made.

I can tell you something of the decisions which have already been made.

The first is that the hearings will probably begin on the 19th November in
the Town Hall, Sheffield.     Dr.   Popper will sit in the same room as that
occupied by Lord Justice Taylor during the public enquiry for at least the
first couple of days, if the numbers of people attending thereafter demand
that he should continue to sit there then he will do so but if the numbers
drop after the first day or two the hearing will then adjourn to the Medico
Legal Centre, Watery Street and will continue there unless the numbers
attending rise in which case Dr. Popper will go back to the Town Hall. The
present expectation is that he will have to sit in the Town Hall for the
first couple of days and the last day or so but this arrangement is
flexible.   Arrangements cire in hand for conference facilities between
Lawyers and Families and for accommodation for the press at both venues and
Dr.   Popper does not anticipate that there will be any difficulty in this
respect.

The second certainty (if anything can be regarded as certain) is that the
resumed hearings will be of a "generic" nature that is to say they will not
be directed at any specific individual but will be a detailed examination of
the events of the 15th April 1989 with a view to the Jury deciding WHY this
tragedy occurred.   Dr.    Popper has indicated that he will take evidence
dealing with the early part of the day i.e. the build up of traffic oh the
motor way approach to Sheffield and although he will deal with this in
fairly general terms the detail of the evidence he will receive will become
more intense as time progresses and he will take a great deal of evidence of
events between 2.30 and approximately 3.15 p.m. It is apparently not his
present intention to deal with events in detail beyond 3.15 p.m. because by
that time tragically most people who died had either lost their lives or
been removed from the ground and as his function is to find out WHY this
tragedy occurred he believes that most of the events dealing with that
question had occurred before 3.15 p.m.

The third matter which appears reasonably certain is that Dr. Popper will
call somewhere between ten and twenty supporters who were at the Leppings
Lane of the ground to give evidence personally. He has not told me who they
will be, I believe he may not have made up his mind about who he will
actually call. He has said that he wants to call anyone who can give
material information and he is not limiting this to those who were injured
or lost a member of their family or those who have previously given evidence
before Lord Justice Taylor. As soon as I know the names of the people he
intends to call I will get back to you if you wish but this is perhaps an
opportune moment to mention the two Questionnaires which sire enclosed with
this letter.    The first Questionnaire deals with the giving of evidence at
the generic inquest, would you please read it very carefully and let me have
it back (with any additional sheets of paper you may complete) by return.
Please see below for the reason for this urgent request. The second
Questionnaire also requires completion and immediate return for reasons
which are also set out below.
I understand from Dr. Popper that this generic hearing is likely to last up
to six weeks, if it last for less than that period then I will do all I can
to let you know which is to be the final day as I anticipate that you may
wish to be present to hear the verdict of the Jury and if it runs beyond six
weeks that will take us over the Christmas/New Year break and I will tell
you the day on which Dr. Pepper will resume the hearing as soon as I know
it.

Those questions which have not been decided may have become apparent to you
as you worked your way through the two Questionnaires but perhaps I could
now deal with those questions in a little more detail.

There sire possibly   three   separate   areas   for   Dr.   Popper to consider as
follows:-

     a.    The presentation    to him of Legal Submissions by the
           various parties involved.

     b.    The re-opening ofthe Interim Inquests todeal with
           questions which were not dealt with originally.

     c.    The main hearing.

Dr. Popper has indicated that he might be prepared to set aside a day (or
part of a day) to receive what he calls "legal submissions" put forward on
behalf of any party interested in this disaster prior to the re-opening of
the main hearing.     No final decision has been made about this, indeed no
decision has been made as to whether there sire any such submissions to be
made.   It is normal for such submissions to be made in the absence of the
Jury and if any party (including my Steering Committee) felt that such
submissions should be made they would probably be taken before the 19th
November. At present I have no indication that any submissions sire to be
made, If that situation changes I will get back to you.

My second Questionnaire deals with the second point. I have no doubt that
you will remember the parameters within which the interim inquests which
were heard in April and May were held. If you have any queries about those
parameters please do not hesitate to contact me. If you feel that you have
a question or point to make which would fall within those parameters and
which was either not dealt with at all or was not dealt with to your
satisfaction at the interim inquest then please let me know in writing in
association with the second Questionnaire by return as Dr.       Popper has
indicated that if there sire matters which should and could have been dealt
with at the interim inquests in relation to any particular individual who
lost his or her life then he would be prepared to consider re-opening that
particular inquest or inquests to deal with those matters.         He would
probably deal with these "odds and ends" as he calls than before the main
hearing begins but they would of course have to be dealt with in the
presence of the Jury. It is obviously imperative that if you wish to have
your particular inquest re-opened to deal with any outstanding point that I
know of the point you wish to make as soon as possible, by return would be
preferable but certainly by no later than Monday 29th October if I am to
raise this issue at the pre-inquest review which is to be held on 30th
October (see below).

Dr. Popper appears to have made no hard and fast decisions about how he
will deal with the "generic" hearing although he obviously has a general
outline in mind. In an effort to assist you and him the first Questionnaire
enclosed has been prepared, will you please read it very carefully and
return it without delay.     This generic hearing will of course be before a
Jury and if you have strong views about what evidence they       should hearthis
is your opportunity to tell me what you want   to be put before than andit is
only on the basis of what you tell me I can seek to persuade Dr. Popper.

As a result of my various conversations with Dr. Popper he has agreed to
hold what he is calling a Pre-Inquest Review at the Medico Legal Centre,
Watery Street, Sheffield at 2.00 p.m. on Tuesday 30th October. The main
purpose of this hearing is to allow Dr. Popper to tell the various Legal
Representatives of the Groups and Organisations who have an interest in the
resumed inquests what procedures etc he intends to adopt at the resumed
hearings and I will of course be attending that hearing with Mr T.R.A. King
of Counsel and I will of course report fully to you. As you probably know
the Family Support Group sire now instructing my Steering Committee directly
in connection with these resumed hearingsand it is the wish of the Group
that Mr King appears on the 19th November and subsequently to represent the
interests of those bereaved families who have agreed to contribute to the
cost of representation at the resumed hesiring. I am now therefore in the
position of wearing two hats I am looking after your personal interests and
I am of course a Member of the Committeewhich instructs Mr King on behalf
of the Hillsborough Family Support Group. I should perhaps make itclear at
this stage that my primary responsibility lies to you as a client and
thereafter to the Steering Committee as a Member of it and I sincerely hope
that my interests never conflict but if they do you can be assured that my
obligations to you will take precedence.

I must close now, if there is anything in this letter which causes you
concern or prompts a request for further information please do not hesitate
to give me a ring ... if you can not get hold of me please leave a message
with my Secretary and I will deal with your query or get back to you on the
telephone as quickly as possible.

Finally, can I urge you to deal with theenclosed Questionnaires by return,
if I am going to go to the Pre-Inquest Review next Tuesday with useful feed
back from you and other clients I need these Questionnaires back in the
office no later than this Friday afternoon at the very latest so that I can
collate the information and questions over the weekend and pass the details
to Mr King who will be in Sheffield with me next Tuesday.

Yours sincerely,

                               HILLSBOROUGH - 15 APRIL 1989

                           PATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE DISASTER




 My medical qualifications are MB, BS, FRC Path, DMJ (Clin et Path).                          I have been

 in active practice in Forensic Pathology for almost thirty years and have been

 Consultant Pathologist to the Home Office for South Yorkshire and the East

 Midlands for twenty-five of those years.                    During that time I have performed more

 than twenty-six thousand post mortem examinations for Her Majesty's coroners and

 have taken part in some seven hundred and sixty murder investigations.




I have been asked by Mr Mervyn JONES, Assistant Chief Constable of the West

Midlands Police in charge of the Hillsborough Enquiry Team, to provide a general

overview of the pathological aspects of the Hillsborough disaster in which some

ninety-five persons were killed on the afternoon of Saturday, 15 April, 1989,

during a cup semi-final match.




I took part in the investigation of the deaths myself, being present at the

request of Her Majesty's coroner at Hillsborough Stadium on the evening of 15

April, 1989, and at the Medico-Legal Centre on Sunday, 16 April and Monday, 17

April.   I personally carried out nineteen of the ninety-five post mortems.                            The

other examinations were carried out by teams of pathologists working five or six

at a time in the mortuary of the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre at Watery Street

 following the transfer of the bodies from the temporary mortuary in the
                      \




                                                                          2)0C 4 * )k

some thirteen bodies were taken to the mortuary of the Northern General Hospital

in Sheffield, but later they were removed from there and brought to the

Medico-Legal'Centre.        As far as I know, the only body autopsied at the Northern

General Hospital was that of a Lee NICHOL (body No 95), aged 14 years, who

survived, under treatment, until about 2 am on Tuesday, 18 April, and whose body

was f'§xjj©ined that same day by Dr Shirley HOLT, Consultant Pathologist at the

SEX

Of the ninety-five       dead, eighty-eight were males and seven were females, which,

in my view, merely       reflects the nature of the occasion.




AGE

Of the ninety-five       who died, the youngest was a 10 year old   boy and   theeldest   a

67    year old man.                                   „

     Thirty-eight persons (approximately 40%) were under 20 years of age

     Thirty-nine persons (41%) were between 20 and 29 years of age

     Twelve persons (13%) were between 30 and 39 years of age

     Three persons (3%) were between 40 and 49 years of age

  One person (1%) was between 50 and 59 years

  Two persons (2%) were between 60 and 69 years old.
            *

  Seventy-seven of the ninety-five (81%) dead were below 30 years of age.

Again, I imagine these figures probably reflect the composition of the average

soccer crowd.




CAUSE OF DEATH

In virtually every case, the cause of death was basically compression of the

chest wall - against the bodies of the persons immediately around the deceased

or against fixed structures such as the walls of the stadium and the crash

barriers.       In the vast majority of the cases, this pressure caused the condition

of traumatic or crush asphyxia - the two terms are synonymous.




Asphyxia pathologically means some mechanical obstruction to normal breathing.

That obstruction may be caused in a variety of ways - by a hand across the nose

and mouth (suffocation), by a ligature tightened around the neck

(strangulation), by a bolus of food which sticks in the airways (choking), or by
 a strong pressure upon the chest wall so that it becomes fixed and cannot move

 in and out to enable the person to draw breath.        Whatever the impedance to

 respiration, the result is similar.     The oxygen in the air cannot be drawn into

 the lungs and passed into the blood to be transported to the body tissues which

 require it for their normal function.     The deoxygenated blood in the tissues

 turns a dark colour, giving the victim's complexion a bluish or cyanotic hue.
                                                    /
 The heart begins to fail and the walls of the smallest vessels (capillaries)

 which are under pressure and themselves starved of oxygen, give way and allow

 spurts of red cells to pass into the surrounding tissues where they show as tiny

 pin-point haemorrhages (petechiae) in the loose skin around the eyes, on the

 forehead and behind the ears as well as on many of the internal organs.       Thus, a

 somewhat bloatd cyanotic appearance with external and internal petechiae arises.

 If the impediment to breathing is not removed in some four to six minutes -

 perhaps less if the victim is struggling and thus using up oxygen at a higher

 rate - then the brain cells cease to function, unconsciousness supervenes and

 ultimately the vital centres in the hind brain are damaged and die and then life

 is no longer possible.




Appearances such as these were seen in almost every person who died at

Hillsborough, and in all but nine cases death was attributed solely to traumatic

(or crush) asphyxia.      In one case (No 76) the force compressing the chest was

(perhaps momentarily) so great that the rear surface of the breast bone almost

touched the anterior surface of the spine, nipping and splitting the aorta

between them so that the man bled to death internally before he could be

asphyxiated.   In. only eight other cases (Nos 3, 27, 29, *8, 69,.91, 93 and 95)

were factors other than traumatic asphyxia thought to have even contributed to

the death, and in six of these eight, the contributory factor arose out of

trauma to the chest, neck or head.     In the remaining two cases (3 and 69) only,
                                                                            J   o   e    4   s ) j c   ,




  truly natural disease was believed to be a significant contributory factor in

  the death.




 INHALATION OF VOMIT

 In any form of asphyxia vomiting may occur before death and because of

 unconsciousness and the lack of the protective reflex mechanism, vomitus may be

 a s.Pll r 3 ted in to the luns s , greatly increasing the likelihood of death.         Mbst
                                                            si
 pathologists regard this vomiting as merely a facet o'f death from asphyxia and

 though recording it in their post mortem reports, do not dignify it with a

 separate heading in the cause of death.       This is my view and the one I have

 adopted in compiling the simple statistics for this report.         It has, however, to

 be said that for purely mechanical and obvious reasons, vomiting is more likely

 to occur if the stomach is distended with food and/or drink and is subjected to

hard external mechanical compression.       Vomiting is also more likely to occur in

 those persons intoxicated with alcohol.



OTHER INJURIES

In eighteen cases bones were broken - mostly ribs (thirteen cases), but in

addition the bones and/or cartilages of the larynx (voice box) were fractured' in

three cases (47, 51 and 81)       perhaps suggesting that the throat of these

persons had been trodden on accidentally ie that they were on the ground when

they sustained that injury.




In only two cases were long bones fractured.        In one of these cases (18), both

bones in a woman's forearm were broken and in one (11) a young boy's femur was

broken. • Both injuries could have occurred as the result o f ’accidental

trampling.
                                                                   d o c


In two cases impacts to the chest wall were so severe as to cause extensive

bruising to the underlying lungs, affecting the victim's ability to breathe and

in one of these the ribs were actually fractured and their ends tore the

underlying lung allowing air to escape from the lung into the chest

(pneumothorax) and seriously adversely affect the victim's breathing.




In one case damage to the nose with subsequent bleeding allowed the inhalation
                                                 /
of blood into the lungs and this was thought to be a^-significant factor in the

death.




As one would perhaps have suspected, a very high proportion of these bodies bore

superficial grazes and scratches - evidence of blunt impact against all manner

of solid objects such as walls, concrete flooring, barriers and fences. These

injuries are too numerous to be described or interpreted here and details should

be obtained in each individual case from the pathologist who actually performed

the post mortem (see above).




ALCOHOL

In discussing this matter, my impression is that the dead came mostly from the

front (ie near to the pitch) areas of the Leppings Lane end, from amongst

persons who had arrived early in order to get a good view and thus their blood

alcohols are not necessarily an indication of the alcoholic status of those who

arrived later and were pushing to get in at th$ Leppings Lane end of the ground.




No blood was taken from the victim who died last ie no 95, because of the
                                                                                   J
interval of time which had passed between the accident and his death.

No alcohol was found in the bodies of any of the seven female victims.

Of the remaining eighty-seven men and boys, fifty-one (58%) were shown to have
                                                                              2)oC

 nor more than 10 mg% in their blood, which is negligible, but fifteen had more

 than 80 mg% in their blood, which means they could not legally have driven a

car, and six had upwards of 120 mg% in their blood.             Six youths below the age   a   t


18, who were not legally allowed to drink, had taken drink, of which group one

boy, aged 17 years, had a blood alcohol of 141    a g % ,   whilst a 15 year old had a

blood alcohol of 56 mg%.




EYE HAEMORRHAGES                                            ~    '

I have been asked to comment on the proposition that a distinction can be made

in this case between those persons who died from traumatic asphyxia standing up

in the crowd and those dying from the same cause lying down.            The latter, it is

said, will have petechial haemorrhages in their eyes whilst the former will not.

I have seen a very large number of cases of traumatic asphyxia and I am certain
                            *


that no such distinction can be made - both groups will in all probability have

petechial haemorrhages in their eyes.




GENERAL COMMENT

The Hillsborough disaster occurred between 3 pm and 3.30 pm on Saturday, 15

April, 1989.    By 2 pm on Monday, 17 April, ie less than forty-eight hours later,

      ninety-four of the victims who were then dead had been examined post mortem

and had a blood sample taken for analysis, so that their bodies were ready for

release to relatives.    I believe that several factors were responsible for this

feat:-




 1.    The excellence of Her Majesty's Coroner's arrangements and organisation.

 2.    The immediate availability of the Football Club's gymnasium, sited just a

       few yards from the pitch.   This huge room was easily compartmentalised

       into three large chambers, each invisible from the others.          One was used
                                                                  jjw r

      as a mortuary for temporary body storage, one as a makeshift canteen anc

      the third as a reception area for relatives where they were greeted and

      assisted by padres of various denominations^. sociaL.workers and

      ancillaries.

3.    The fact that the victims' bodies were not fragmented nor greatly

     disfigured as might have happened in an explosion or an aircraft crash.

     This meant that the initial identification' was possible from polaroid

     photographs taken by the police, which made the identification process

     rapid and meant that relatives were generally required to view only one

     body and were spared the harrowing task of entering the main mortuary an<

     searching for their dead.

4.   The use of the facilities available at the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre

     the only building of its kind in the United Kingdom.     This meant that in

     one day it was possible for up to six teams of pathologists and their

     assistants to work simultaneously in excellent conditions with modern

     equipment so that they were able to perform seventy autopsies on Sunday

     alone.   This building was designed with an emergency facility to deal wit

     disaster involving up to one hundred bodies, and when the disaster

     arrived, the building worked well.     Sheffield City Council are to be

     congratulated on their provision of such a building.

                                FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY SERVICES

No Fault by the Emergency Services
   296. I say at the outset o f this chapter that no valid criticism can be made o f the response by the St John
Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS or by the Tire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any
criticism o f them. The only attack on SYMAS came from two Liverpool doctors. One claimed that ambulances
did not arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipment and that there was a lack o f triage. He was proved to be
wrong in all three respects. Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April when he said more
lives could have been saved if staff and equipment had arrived earlier. Apart from being proved wrong in fact
as to the times o f arrival o f ambulances, he conceded in evidence that it was not possible to say whether lives
could have been saved. His comments on television were irresponsible. The other doctor complained o f the
absence o f defibrillators. I am satisfied on overwhelming evidence that to attempt to use a defibrillator on the
pitch with people milling about would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk o f injury from the electric
charge

  297. 1 find that all three o f the emergency services named above responded promptly when alerted, that
they brought appropriate equipment and that their personnel operated efficiently.

  298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium, medical facilities capable o f dealing with a
major disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
equipment and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

  299. What is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid, for professional medical attention and for
ambulance attendance, together with a system o f co-ordination with the emergency services which will bring
them to the scene swiftly in whatever numbers are required. What will amount to an appropriate basic
provision for the future the equipment in a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and advice.

   300. On the day, there was no clear understanding between the Club and Dr Purcell as to his role. He
believed he was primarily there to attend to the players. The Club regarded him also as the “physician available
to attend at the first aid room if required”, as laid down in the Safety Certificate.

  301. There was insufficiently close co-operation between the police and the emergency services. It is clear
that SYMAS and the fire brigade should have been called earlier than they were. I lowcver, in view o f the nature
and extent o f the crushing, the time when police rescue began and the pathetically short period for which those
unable to breathe could survive, it is improbable that quicker recourse to the emergency services would have
saved more lives.

   302. Finally, there was evidence that an advertising board had to be knocked down at the north-east corner
o f the ground to allow an ambulance onto the pilch and that at the top o f the ramp leading to the pitch the
access for ambulances was inadequate. There was also evidence that the pre-match arrangement for
ambulances to use the two gates from Penistone Road at the north-east end o f the ground as in and out routes
was frustrated by the presence o f vehicles just inside the ground. In the event, none o f these matters affected
operations. The hoarding was quickly knocked down. The difficult access to the ramp was negotiated and
ambulances used one entrance satisfactorily by backing out when loaded.

“At no time at Hillsborough did I realise people had died in the tunnel” pi 15 Barry Bennett
file

“The last words I said were “It’s an absolute disgrace.” I meant the way we were allowed to
get so tightly packed and on the pitch the total lack or (sic) organisation and equipment after
disaster struck.”


*           Dr Michael Alexander Hutson

“I imagine that the reason for the apparent lack o f success in promoting spontaneous cardiac
activity or respiration, was due to too lengthy a delay between these vitalbodyfunctions and
commencement o f resuscitation       I noticed the presence o f some trained first aiders, possibly
o f the St John’s Ambulance, and many others who were helping, but not in any uniform.
Many were able to apply correct resuscitative techniques, others not.” p38 - Lee Nicol file.

“It is difficult to know how many lives might have been saved if the emergency response had
been more effective, but in my opinion on this occasion it was woefully inadequate.”
P39 David Benson file

*           Dr Matthew James Bull

The points which I feel are important are as follows:

1.          There were no calls via the public address system for medical and nursing staff to help.
            It was only after 10 minutes that I realised from the other end o f the ground that the
            situation was so grave.

2.          As far as I was aware, there were no aids for resuscitation, such as oxygen, airways, or
            suction device to clear vomit from the mouth.

3.          Assessment o f patients on the field, some o f whom may have been able to be
            resuscitated was hampered by a large number o f people, many o f them very agitated.”

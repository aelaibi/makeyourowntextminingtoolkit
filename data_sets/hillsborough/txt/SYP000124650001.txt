 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 INCIDENT           WAS    HANDLED,          AFTER       THE    MATCH       WAS       STOPPED?

 FIRSTLY,           PEOPLE       IN T H E     REST       OF    THE    GROUND          WEREN'T          INFORMED          OF   WHAT     HAD

 OCCURRED.           THE    NOTTS       FOREST          FANS    THOUGHT          WE    WERE       GOING       TO    INVADE       THE    PITCH    AND

 KNOW     WHAT       HAD    HAPPENED          (DUE       TO BAD       C O M M U N I C A T I O N ),      BUT    WHEN       THEY    REALISED       WHAT

 HAD     HAPPENED          THEY    ACTED          QUICKLY.

 I^fcLSO T H I N K         THAT    IF    THE       RAIL       CUTTER     HAD      BEEN       USED       EARLIER          ON   IT C O U L D   HAVE

COMING         INTO       VICINITY       OF       GROUND.

 I FEEL        THAT       THIS    MADE       IT    IMPOSSIBLE          FOR       THEM       TO    ENFORCE          ORDERLY       QUEUING.       THERE

            *

 COULD          CLEARLY             BE    SEEN    FROM    WHERE      I WAS      THAT   PENS    3    &   4 WERE   OVERCROWDED.     PENS

Dear Mr Bolton,
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
Twerton Park. Bath
The Chief Executive has asked me to thank you for your letter to him dated 6th
December. The County Council has noted your views.
The decision not to reduce the capacity of Twerton Park by 15% was taken bythe
Public Protection (Urgency) Sub-committee on 17th August 1989, at a meeting when
they also considered all the recommendations that Lord Justice Taylor had suggested
should be implemented before the start of the new football season. In the light of
your concern, it was considered appropriate to ask the full committee to review that
decision, but unfortunately it has not been possible to convene a meeting before
Christmas. Therefore, your letter will be considered at the next scheduled meeting
on 18th January 1990. In view of your concern, however, after consultation with
Senior Members of the Committee, it has been decided that before that meeting, the
members will make another of their periodic visits to Twerton Park during a match
to see for themselves all the latest improvements that have been made to the ground
and how they operate to ensure the safety of spectators.
I understand that since you wrote to us, there have been discussions between Mr
Beckett (our County Trading Standards Officer), the Association of County Councils
and Home Office Staff, as a result of which it has been demonstrated that this
Authority clearly understands its duties under the 1975 Act, and both comprehends
the "green guide" and enforces it in the manner intended by its authors. Our
members are familiar with both and will apply the guidelines strictly when
reconsidering whether the capacity of Twerton Park should be reduced.
I will be advising them, according with your letter, that the question' is entirely
a matter for their discretion; that recommendation 2(b) of Lord Justice Taylor's
interim report is only one of the factors that they should take into account; and
that they should give it the appropriate weight.
                                                                              Cont'd         /2
If Lord Justice Taylor's final report is available before 18th January, members'
attention will be drawn to any recommendation he makes on this matter.
I will tell you what members decide after the meeting.

Yours sincerely,




for Acting Director of Administration
and County Solicitor

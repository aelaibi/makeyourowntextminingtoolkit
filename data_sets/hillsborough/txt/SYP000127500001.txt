 STATES? I WAS AT THE GROUND LAST YEAR & IT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. I ARRIVED A1
 THE SAME TIME, ABOUT 1445 HRS & THIS YEAR I NOTICED THAT I COULDN’T SEE THE
 ENTRANCE TO THE NORTH STAND BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE. I ASKED A
 POLICEMAN WHERE THE ENTRANCE WAS & HE POINTED IT OUT, BUT HE TOLD ME IT WOULD
 BE BETTER TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES TO LET THE CROWD DIE DOWN, BUT I WAS ALREADY
 LATE.

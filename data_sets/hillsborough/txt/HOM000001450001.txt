              I am                                  a    3 i ngle         person      employed         by    Liverpool        City       Council

              at     the    above         address.

              On     Saturday,            I5th April            1989       ( 1 5 0 48 9 )    I attended         the    Hillsborough

              Football           Ground         Sheffield            to    se e m y     Football        Team Liverpool              play

              Nottingham              Forest        in    the    Challenge Cup                S em i    rinai.         I p u r c h a s e d the

              ticket           for    the m a t c h       a p p r o x i m a t e l y onew e e k      before       tne M a t c h .         Tne

               ticket          was    allocated           to me           because i am a Season Ticxet                       holder.            auG


               ticket          was    for       'S’ Section           stading and             I paid        £6 at A n f i e l d .         I

               travelled             to    tne m a t c h       from       Liverpool          by Minibus         in c o m p a n y    with        a

               group       of     friends,         and w i t h        a particular             friend who          also       had   a ticket

               for       the    same       stand,        Mr



               The       Minibus          did    no t    stop    on       rout e.       We    had      a couple        of    cans    of       beer

               each       to d r i n k      on    route        but    in no w a y w a s         anyone         under        the    influence

               of    alcohol.              The    roads        were       very     busy      but we      still      arrived         in

               Sheffield             at    approximately              2 .15      pm with       t ime     to spare.            Due    to       the

               fact        that      the    group        had    different            stand     t i c k e t s we     split         up along          the

               road        to   the g r o u n d -         I went          with                   straight         to    the       ground

arriving         at    approximately                   2 .3 0      pm.      The      route       from       th e    car      park      to

the     ground        had       a Police          presence            but      there were             no d i r e c t i o n s      or

escort.          I did          not    see       any    disorderly              behaviour             fighting          or

drunkensess            on       the way.           As we           approached             the    ground         it w a s        very

crowded        particularly                 the       entrance           off      Leppings        Lane         to     th e

turnstiles.                We     looked         for     the       signs       for      which     entrance            we were          to go

into.         The     entrance             was    Leppings            Lane        standing        Section           B w hich were

the     six     or    seven        turnstiles                to    the    right         sice     of     the     entrances             to    the

l ar ge     mass      in f r o n t         of    the     turnstiles               for     Section        B.     There        seerr.ed to

be    no    organisation               of       queues        by    Police         or    Stewards           to c o n t r o l      the

flow       of p e o p l e       into       the     turnstiles.              All      I could          see w e r e       about         t h r ee

mounted         Policemen             in a m o n g s t        the     crowd        by     the w r o u g h t         iron     gates.          We

joined        the     crowd        going         into        the      turnstiles.

As    we w e r e      in    the       crowd        it w a s        obvious         t ha t    it w a s       very       tign*.i.y p a c K e d

around        the      turnstiles               and    people         were        getting        pushed         and     sh ov ed .         The

Police        seemed        to b e         having        difficulty               controlling             the       crowd       and    I saw

a mounted            Policeman             just       behind        me    move       into       the     crowd        just       backing

into       people       knocking             them b a c kwards               or    sidewards.               This       obviously

made       people       very       angry         as     it    seemed         to    serve        no p u r p o s e       and merely

moved        people        ou t    of      the h o r s e s         way.      Some       people        did      shout       at    the

Policeman             however          t h e re w a s        no    show      of    aggression             or    violent

behavious             in a n y     way       towards            the p o l i c e      or     amongst         the      supporters

 themselves.                In     fact      under       the       circumstances                 I would        s ay      that    the

 crowd        tht     I saw behaved                ver y well            and      I s a w no          instances         of      violent

 or d r u n k e n      behaviour             outside            the      ground.

 At     a p p r o x i ma t e l y      2.50       — 2.55 p m        X managed            to r e a c h      the       tUj. ns t i i ss and

 go t      through         into       the o p e n       a r ea .      Just      behind          the    turnstiles            be tween

 them and            the    sta nd .            I waited          a few        seconds       for m y        friend         and      then w e

walked        away        from       the       turnstiles                  towards          the       only       visible        entrance

into    t he       standing             area.

This    turned            out      to     be    th e       tunnel           entrance             i nto      the     two       centre

standing           sections             of     th e    Leppings              Lane       end       stand.            As    we    walked

towards           the     tunnel          I looked               to m y      right          and       saw     the      concertina            gate

aroud        the    corner           to      the      right          of     the    turnstiles                 (as y o u        l oo k f r o m         the

outside           towards          the       turnstile               ar ea )      opened.              T he      gate     was     opened

fully        by    I think           a Steward              and        a Policeman                but       I ' m not         sure     excactly

who    opened           them       as     t hen       quite          a number           of       people          c ame    in    through           the

ooen    ga te.            I remember                saying            to m y      friend          something              like     "We've          just-

queued        up       t h e re    and       now      they've              let    them       in.”           We    t he n w a l k e d        through

the    tunnel           an d      straight            on        to go       to    the       terraces.               I did       no t      look

back    round           to     the      open        gate         then,       so       I cannot           say h o w        long       it     stayed

open.         However             it w a s      cefinately                  opened          to a l l o w         people        through           who

it w o u l d       appear          did       no t     have           there       tickets          c h ec k e d .         There were              no

Police        or       Stewards           around            the       tunnel          area       or    in     the      open     area        between

the    turnstiles                 and     the       tunnel            to d i r e c t        or    instruct             people        as     to

where        to go.            The      only        Police            or    Stewards             that       I saw w e r e         by      the

inside        of       the      turnstiles                 and       concertina             gate.           As we w e n t         through             the

t u n n el    the        f l o w of       people            were       moving          steadily             until        we    reached           the

terrace,           when         the     crowd was                quite       d en s e .      As       I walked           through          the

t u n n el    I could             see     the p i t c h ,             then       just       as y o u        r e a ch     the    terracing

there        is a d i v i d i n g            section             of    fencing          running             f r o m the m i d d l e          of       the

tu nn e l     to       th f e n c i n g        at      the       front       of       the    terracing.                Myself        a n d my

friend        went         to     the      right           of    the       dividing           fence         and went           into       this

section           of     the      ground           ( Pe n       3)    (T hr e e) .          This       was       approximately               2.55

pm and            I saw        the    players              warming          up.        I could           see      that        this     section

was     very        full        but     under          the w e i g h t           of    people          after        a minute           or    two w e

managed            to get         forward             to    the       front       of    this          s ec ti on .        At     this       point

became        very          frightened.                 I saw people                   climbing           over       the      tront            rences

 situation.                 I was       now        getting           more        and more            crushed against                  the

 barrier.          I shouted                 to    Jaques          to     try a n d         help me          but    he      j us t    c o u l d n ’t

 I concentrated                    on m y         breathing           and       I ’m      convinced            that        t hi s    stopped me

 from passing                 out.           At. this         t ime      I lost           sight        of m y       f r i e n d.     I didn't

 occasional              roar       of       the       crowd.

 Gradually              the p r e s s u r e            of    the    crowd         eased          off     a    l i t tl e    because             I

 could move              myself          a    little.              This     was           probably           sometime         after            the

front       or      side       because           I was           able       to     stand         up properly.                I then         saw a

pile      of      people           heaped        on       to p     of    each         other        probably           about       four      or

f i ve    deep where                they        had       obviously              fallen          and     had      been      crushed.              This

was      j us t     to m y         right        at     the       front        of      the       section         below       the    f e n c i ng .

I saw        straight              away        t hat      s o me    people            at    the       bottom         had    already         turned

passed         him      under        the        crash        barrier.                 We    pulled         a    second       man       from       the

describe            him      at     all.        He     also        seemed          to      be    oKay.

One man           we     pulled           out     was       possibly             dead        X think           he h a d     a grey        or      grey

It w a s        now      that        the        Police       finally             came        i nt o     the     pen     through         the       g at e

at     the      front         fence        and       they        took       charge           and      did what          they      could        to

help.        After          a couple             of m i n u t e s        I was          helped          up and went              through          the

open       gate        at     the     front          fence.             I saw          t hat     the m e s h         fencing       had      been

partly           r ipped.          I would           think         to a l l o w         people          to get        out     I was       quite

dazed        and had           become            separated              from my            friend

 friends            just       after        4 pm.           We     left          the    ground          through         the      tunnel        under

           I can        honestly         say      that       at    no    stage          of     developments               were

          there         any     signs      of     drunkeness             or       aggression               or v i o l e n t     behaviour           by      an^

           contributing              factor        to      the d i s a s t e r          was     the        fact    that       1 3 aw      the      g at e

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 .15    pm.     We were       not s u b j e c t e d to any travel                 delays

neither         did we    stop en         route     to the      stadium.          I parked my vehicle                  near

to a "B & G" s up er m a r k e t             to the south east              of the g r o u n d , about a mile

from      it.

L i ve r p o o l   suppo r t e r s      outside     drinking         alcohol      from g l a s s e s .        I could

i d e ntif y them as Liver pool                  supp o r t e r s    by their      scarves and b a n n e r s .                 j


also      saw at      least       two    of the Liv e r p o o l       suppo r t e r s    coaches        parked

outside         one of those            pubs.     As    I was       driving my own vehicle at                   the

time      I could not         pay very much a t t e n t i o n            to these        people        but    1 formed

the      imp re s s i o n that most          of them were merry.                  I am not able              to name

these      pubs and all            I can say        is that         one of them was          on the same             road

as    the S h e f f i e l d U n i te d ground.

Fr o m    our      parking    place we w a l k ed          towards       the H i l l s b o r o u g h    stadium,          as

I have       said,     and during          the time        it took to wal>: between the                       car and

the      ground      10-15 minutes           1 w i t n e s s e d a large/number            of N o t t i n g h a m

stadium.           They were         chanting and         singing and some were using                         foul

language w i t h in my earshot.

As we        passed by the         pub    I mentioned,            a white      male     of about 35 years,

came     out and j o k i n gl y said,             "That    bloke      has    sold more            beer    in that

s e s s i o n than he does all             year      round,"       or s o m ething along             these    lines.

This     i n dicated        to me the      large amount            of alcohol          the       local    public

houses        were    selling      before       the match.

N e a r er    to the      ground    X saw        a white y outh of about 2 0 - 2 2                  years, me d i u m

height and           build w ea r i n g    I     think a N o t t i n g h a m Forest FC hat,                 I cannot

say what          else    he was wearing,            run up to an d kick about                    three

a d v er ti si ng     boards m ou n t e d        on a     road     island which         is on       a road running

at the        back    of the stadium.              Two    p o licemen who            I cannot       describe       other

than to say they were                on foot and           in u n i f o r m wear i n g        helmets were

stood on the             island must       have w i t n e s s e d what         the y o u t h did one          officer

got    hold of him but a fter a few moments                            let him go free.                  I could not

say whether           these a dv e r t i s i n g     boards were          damaged.

We a r ri ve d at the t u r n s ti le s            to the S p i o n Kop end and at 2.2 0                     pm

e nt er ed the ground via this                    turnstile,         at whi ch the re we re no

queues.           I had no d if fi c u l t y       finding my e ntry             point       or m a t c h viewing

point.         I did not w it n e s s any            police       or s t e w a r d    d i r e c t i o n at the

turnstiles,           nor were      such       direc t i o n s    necessary.           There were          both

Po l ic e O f f i c e r s and s t e wards          evident at the            entry       point.I         surrendered

my ticket           at the turnstiles.               AT this       time     I did not see

any    other        gates    open other         than these.           I did not see any u n a u t h o r i s e d

entry        to the ground nor            did     I see alcohol           consumed w i t h i n the           ground

itself.           At no stage       did    I have        o c c a s i o n to go to the We^X S tand or

L ep p in gs      Lane    end of the       ground.                                           /

I took        up my m a t c h viewing           position         in the S p i o m K/Op at about 2.2 5                pm

an d did not          become a wa r e      of what        had fully         o c c u r r e d until        I returned

to my        car.

Ini t i a l l y     I thought      the    incident was a pitch                 invasion and did not

become a ware            that   it was     other      than that         until        about    three      thirty when

                I saw     injured being             ferr i e d across      ths-'pitch,

                was    the    lack   of    communi cati on'Vafa the ground               tannoy system.     This

                would     have    helped      had a n n o u n c em en ts    been made.

                We    eventually       left the ground at about 4.2 0                pm in response       to a    loud

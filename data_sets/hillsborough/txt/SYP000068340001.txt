I remained alone              with the a p p l i c a n c e and            received no further

instructions            from any      person.        I had been s t a t i o n a r y            for about

t hirty minutes,             which would          be about         4.0    pm     (1600),      when    certain

individuals           in the       groups    of spectators               leaving ins G r o u n d and wax kin

passed either             side     of my vehicle,          star t e d         shouting abus i v e          comments

such as,           "You fucking       bastard."       at me.             As     I looked      in my    rear--view

mirr o r s        I could see       certain       individuals            kicking     and thumping            the    side

of rnv applicance.                 1 then    saw one       individual             climb onto         the    front

bumper        of my a p p i i c a n c e    and   he neid onto             it by holding a handle

p osi t i o n e d under       the windscreen,,             He s t a r t e d thumping            the w i n d s c r e e n

with     his      right     fist    but    fortunately         the       scr e e n did not       break.         I wou!

I then saw two or                three     other    people         drag       this man from the             front    of

the applicance.               I do    not    know this man a n d                I would       describe       him as

si:-; foot,        stocky     build,       appro;-;. 30 years             of age,       with short          cropped

hair.         He was w e a r i n g a jumper          and jeans,               but was     not wear i n g      any

scarf        or   hat or a n y t h i n g    w ith w h i c h    1 could           identify him as            support in

I can say that whilst                   the    supporters,,         who m       I believe      to be Liverpool

supporters,             were    passing my vehicle and                  kicking and thumping                the

s i d e s , I feared           for my    safety and          in fact        I was      very f r i g h t e n e d    indsei

Du r i n g    the whole        of this        incident       I was      not     p hysically a s s a u l t e d       by

any    persons and as             previously          stated      1 r e m ained with my vehicle                    and     I

did not          have o c c a s i o n to      go   into    the G r o u n d      or    to deal     with any

we    left       the G r o u n d at about          5.30    pm    (1730).

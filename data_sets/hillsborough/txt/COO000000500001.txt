                        FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL AND SAFETY AT

      The Prime Minister has seen the exchange of correspondence
 between your Secretary of State and the Home Secretary on the
 nature of the licensing authority under the Bill. She agrees
 that Option C is the best way forward. She has noted that further
 work will be needed to define the nature of the authority, eg
 whether it is a quango to which both Ministers appoint members,
 or whether it is an extension of a Government Department, and
 awaits advice in due course.

      I am copying this letter to Colin Walters (Home Office),
 Stephen Catling (Lord President's Office), Nick Gibbons (Lord
 Privy Seal's Office), Murdo Maclean (Chief Whip's Office), Michael
 Saunders (Law Officers' Department), Philip Stamp (Mr Moynihan's
 Office), Carys Evans (Chief Secretary's Office) and to Sir Robin
 Butler.

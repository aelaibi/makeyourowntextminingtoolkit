 Dear P e t e r ,


 Thank you for the v i s i t by David Mould and y o u r s e l f .                   I hope you were
 re a sona bly r e a ss u re d by what you heard and saw.

 As promised, I a t t a c h a rough d r a f t of the l e t t e r I proposed sending to
 our seven member club s who have grounds d e sig n a te d under the 1975 A c t.
 P l e a s e fe e l f r e e to make any s u g g e s tio n s or a l t e r a t i o n s you deem
 appropriate.

 I am a l s o p re p a rin g a l i s t of b u i l d i n g work we have been obliged to
 c a r r y out          in the l a s t year or so, o s t e n s i v e l y on grounds of s a f e t y
 but for which we could see no j u s t i f i a b l e grounds. We tak e s a f e t y
 m a t t e r s extremely s e r i o u s l y a t Twickenham but in a number of m a t t e r s we
 seem to have been t r e a t e d unduly h a r s h l y .                 For example, we a r e now
 a d v ise d t h a t our new s tand and new s e a t i n g have to be evacuated w i t h i n
 f i v e minutes althou gh I know of no d i r e c t i v e to t h i s e f f e c t .                And, as
 I mentioned to you, th e RFU a lr e a d y s u b s c r ib e s approxim ately Llm. p . a .
 in terms of c o r p o r a t i o n t a x , VAT and corrmunity charge which is a
 c o n s i d e r a b l e burden for a n o n - p r o f i t d i s t r i b u t i n g s p o r t . We take a
 p r i d e in the f a c t t h a t we a r e s e l f - s u p p o r t i n g and we do not look to the
 Government for g r a n t s but i t seems g r o s s l y u n f a i r t h a t we should be
 p e n a l i s e d in t h i s way.

  Thank you again for your v i s i t                and I look forward to he aring from you
  re g a rd in g the d r a f t l e t t e r .


 Yours s i n c e r e l y ,



  S e c r e ta r y
When I w ro te to you on 26th A p r i l , I mentioned t h a t meeting had been
a rra n g e d w ith Home O f f i c e o f f i c i a l s on 23rd May when I would have the
o p p o r t u n i t y to d i s c u s s the e f f e c t of th e Taylor Report Recorrmendations
1-4, A ll Seated Grounds, on those c lu b s having grounds which were
d e s ig n a te d under th e 1975 A ct.

This meeting has now taken p la c e and am advised to inform you t h a t no
d e c i s i o n has yet been taken by th e Government c oncerning d e sig n a te d
grounds for s p o r t s o th e r than A s s o c i a t i o n F o o tb a ll and t h a t no a c t i o n
should t h e r e f o r e be taken u n t i l t h a t d e c i s i o n is reached.

I t is a p p r e c i a t e d by th e Heme O f f i c e t h a t c o nversio n to a l l s e a t i n g
would be d i f f i c u l t , expensive and alm ost c e r t a i n l y unnecessary in the
casâ‚¬. of rugby f o o t b a l l clubs but th e d e c i s i o n cannot be a n t i c i p a t e d .

In th e meantime, p l e a s e l e t me know i f you a r e placed under any
p r e s s u r e by local a u t h o r i t i e s to adopt t h e s e recorrmendations.

  Dear Mr Bone

   I write subsequent to receipt of your letter dated 30 October 1997.

   I have been endeavouring to discover the situation regarding M r Houldsworth’s
   statement.

   Unfortunately, at the solicitors dealing with this matter, the partner involved has died
   since the Inquest and the solicitor handling the case on behalf of the club has left.

   I have now spoken to a partner within the company and he advises me that they are
   prepared to delve back into the files should you think it absolutely necessary. This is,
   obviously, a very labour intensive job and if it is only a matter of procedure I wonder
   if you could let the matter rest. I will, o f course, be prepared to act on your
   instruction.

   I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

   Yours sincerely




                     LL

 REPORT CHAPTERS 5 AND 6




I attach a copy of Chapters 5 and 6 of your report, as just gone over by me, together with a
copy of the original version which Graham let me have before Christmas.

2.       The pencil marks on the original show where I am suggesting changes. I am
currently looking at the Appendices and working on the Summary (which I agreed I would do
a first draft of myself).               ;

3.       Also attached is a copy of a letter from Judge Elizabeth Steele, with yours to her. Her
letter is useful confirmation, but I donâ€™t think there is anything in it which calls for further
action. I am proposing to acknowledge briefly and politely - would you want me to do any
more than that?

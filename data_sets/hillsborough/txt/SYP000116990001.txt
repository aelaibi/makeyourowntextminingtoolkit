                            ;b r-i«? ing at Hill sborough football        ground at   10Q0 hours,   1


%             was detailed to Serial 31, under the supervision of Pojic® Sergeant

              2881 Pearson.            About   1030 hour*,    I took up my position at the

              roundabout junction of Lappings Lane,                Halifax Road, Berries Road and

              Penistone Road,           and worked with Police Constable 1239 Raybauld,

              outside the betting trffice at the roundabout.



              From this position we monitored the crowd who were mostly Liverpool

              supporters and all of them were                in good spirits.   On several

              occasions we were asked to recommend and give directions; to local

              public houses,           but the advice we gave was all       local public houses
 would     either be full or closed and suggested they give drinking a

jfriiss.    I was also aware of a large number of youths from 1330 hours

 onwards, who* were    ’t o u t i n g ’ for tickets to the game?   these we moved

 on and advised them to go away from the football ground.               A lot of

 the Liverpool     supporters were carrying cans of beer,          th»se w©r»

 stopped and advised to return the drink to their vehicles,                             of

 it, or if it was a small amount of drink-to drink it, as we wei»e not

 allowing them to go nearer the football          ground carrying or drinking

 alcohol,      I did not get any abuse,     in fact the crowd wer^ very good

 humoured and went along with my request.           The majority of thftsA

 youths sat on the wall at Laws Garage and shared the drink amongst

 other supporters,



 A>tjroximately 1400 hours, a couple of hundred supporters passed m y ^ ^

 locati^isi,, I presumed they were from the special train that s t o r e d at

 Wadsley iriw^e.and was surprised that there was: no Pol i c ^ ^ s e o r t .

 From this time o r W d s     the numbers of supporters gr?« tft thousands

 who were passing my l o n ^ i o n ,   walking along ttjjf^carriageway of

 Halifax Road,     causing traffibsproblems aj^the roundabout.           I have

 spent five years of my service a t N ^ Division and worked many

 football matches at Hi 1Isboro^fn and I w m         surprised that the

 Liverpool     supporters   comi'flg to the ground al d'ha Hal i fax Road were

 allowed to go wheraxThey wanted and did not have aNto 1 i ce escort from

 the coaches     ojrfked on Halifax Road.     At this time I r e m a n e d   to

 Pol i ce JJ^mstabl e Raybould that we may have a ’ rough time*         of r ^ a n d

 c<n*tfci well be fighting at the end of the match.



 Police Constable Raybould and myself continued to stop supports*^

 with alcohol or football       banners with sticks, and advised them,            but

 as 1500 hours approached,       Leppings Lane became full of Supporters,               1
would estimate a thousand entered Leppings Lane from Halifax Road

Just    prior to the game starting.



At 1300 hours, a serial who had been working on Herriet R o a d , n e a r       to

the bus depot, moved towards the Leppings Lane entrance,           and from the

radio wessagss    I overheard,    I believed they were having (jfob’itffls;,;

then an Inspector came past our location and told us to ,go to

Leppings Lane end to help.       When I reached the turnstiles at Leppings

Lane,    1 saw a large number of supporters who were shouting abuse at

the Police Officers there, and others who were crying and obviously

distraught?    at first    I thought the supporters were fighting,     but when

I got to the blue gates       (C), that open onto the lane at the back of

the stdnd,    I saw several    bodies in the lane opposite the&e gates,

 covered in Police anoraks and tunics, and         saw several more tsodies

 inside the gates?   I then helped other officers move these bodies from

 inside the gates to the lane outside?       then helped people who were

 injured from the holding area at the rear of Leppings Lane stand into

‘the   lane for treatment    by a man who stated he was a Bacttr from

Liverpool.     Whilst doing this, a youth came up to me and ask«?d for my

help; along with Police Constable       139 Langley I followed the youth to

the snack bar built       into Leppings Lane stand and helped a young

female with chest injuries.       As we carried her across the holding

area to the lane for treatment,       we shouted at supporters to clear

the way,   but were met with a b u s e , and had to force our way through

the supporters, who by now had grown in number to approximately a

thousand and were hampering Police efforts at this part of the

football ground.



Inspector Sykes took      control of the area at gates     (c )and organised

a serial   to act as a barrier to^shield the dead from the supporters
leaving the football ground.                 I was part of this serial and was

subjected to a lot of verbal abuse and one point had to ’fight* with

supporters who were leaving the ground obviously distraught.



Once the fire crews and ambulances arrived,                          and several';p«©'pie.'whd>'

...stated they were medical         staff,       the dead and injured &*$««»;'t©-->fe*-/:■

L a n e i n « t ruct.i ng us t© ransv© people away from Leppings Laf»« •*.©' the

ground c«uld b® cleared and to allow access to the Ambulance and

Fire Services,.           We were also instructed to remain calm, and not to

Arrest anydn® no matter how provoked we were.                              Whilst on this duty I

was '                    verbal abuse by the distraught Liverpool: S4ip o r t e r s ,

'who were ^blaftinf .th© Police for the incident.                          One man'actually,;

apologised t© roe for the behaviour of the Liverpool                            supporters and

When Leppings Lane cleared we were detailed to the No r t h Stand at

Hillsborough where w© were to re-form as sserial 31 with Police

Sergeant Pearson.            After a de-brief we were released to weal at

Claywheels Lane before returning to Doncaster,                             finishing *y duty at

2000 hours the same date*

would either be full or closed and suggested they give drinking a miss.                                  I

was    also aware of a large number of youths                from 1330 hours onwards, who

were 'touting* for tickets to the games; these we moved on and advised them

to go away from the football ground.               A lot of the Liverpool                supporters

were    carrying cans   of beer,    these were stopped and advised to return the

drink    to their vehicles,      dispose    of it,      or   if it was a small amount of

drink to drink it, as we were not allowing them to go nearer the football

ground carrying or drinking alcohol.              I did not get any abuse, in fact the

crowd were very good humoured and went along with my request.                         The majority

of these youths sat on the wall at Laws Garage and shared the drink amongst

other supporters.



Approximately 1400 hours a couple of hundred supporters passed my location,

I presumed they were from the special train that stopped at Wadsley Bridge.

From this time onwards the numbers of supporters grew to thousands who were

passing my location walking along the carriageway at Halifax Road causing

traffic    problems   at    the roundabout.        At   this    time        I remarked      to Police

Constable Raybould that we may have a rough time of it and there could well

be fighting at the end of the match.




Police    Constable   Raybould     and   myself    continued         to     stop   supporters        with

alcohol    or    football     banners    with   sticks,        and    advised       them,      but       as

1500 hours      approached,     Leppings    Lane     became          full     of   supporters,            I

S h e f f i e l d Central       Division,           I was      r e s p o nsible      for the        policing        of

In the October            of that year              I was      promoted         to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    and

In the M arch of             1982,     I took        up the       post      of D e t e c t i v e Superintendent-

the Min e r s      dispite,         I was      involved         in the     policing        of    picket       lines        in

Nottinghamshire,                Orgreave,         Doncaster        and B a r n s l e y and at times               took

So far as         both the        1987 and          1988 semi            finals are concerned,               I was

directly        responsible            for    the    planning and           liaison wit h the m an a g e m e n t

suppo r t e r s    to    prevent        c o n f r o n t a t i o n and    public     disorder.

C o n s i d e r a t i o n was    given to other methods                   of deployment,            but     on balance

it was      felt       that     this was       the most a p p r o p r i a t e       separation.

In c o n n e c t i o n w i t h    both the          semi    final       in 1987 and        1988,      this       policy

findings          the       previous       year     indicated that               some     officers

were     under         e m p loyed and        I was      conscious          of     the    need not      to    repeat       such

a situation                if that was        the    case and        if there were               no other      factor

w h i c h might            dictate    their       need for       this       future match.              The only other

action        I took         c oncerning         this matter         was        to m a i n t a i n   liaison

that Mr MURRAY was               exa m i n i n g     the m a n p o w e r    situation.

On the      day of the          semi      final,      Sat^rf'day 15- April            1989       ( 150489) , I had

no    role to      p lay     in the       operaj/'ian and was              policing my own D i v i s i o n al

Sa rnsley.

At a p p r o x i a m t e l y 3 . 3 0 pm    (1530)       that     day     I was      en    route     on the Ml

difficulties          at S h e f f i e l d      W e d n e s d a y Football       Ground.           The reporter            did

not     seem unduly          c o n cerned       and spoke of a delay                 in the m atch           due to a

pitch     invasion.           As my jour n e y          progressed,          it became           clear    from the

radio     reports        that    the      incident was more                serious       and there was             some

indic a t i o n of       possible         fatalities.           C alls      were     being made          for      doctors

to a t t e n d at the S t a d i u m and a short                   time      later     I heard an

appeal     for Police O ff i c e r s            to    respond to H a m m e r t o n Rd Police                   Station.

L.e p p i n g s lyn was     heavily       congested           by football           supporters           and a large

number ^ f         fire    er^gfines ■        I alighted           from the        car and began on foot

I spoke          briefly    to Chief          Ins pe ct o ^ W A R ING and           he    c o n firmed        that      he hat

little       or no d i f f i c u l t y at that          location and the                  crowds were             g r a dully

dispersing.

To g e t h e r    with S u p e r i n t e n d e n t MORDEW,          1 then turned            into       the      private

road     leading         to the    back       of the S o u t h S t a n d and on entering                         that area

thro u g h       the gates      I saw an area of               shee t e d       rails a d j ac e n t s        to the

riverside and noted a number                       of b o d i e s ^ l a i d out          in that        location.             I

was a p p r o a c h e d    by D e t e c t i v e   Ins pe g#o r W E B S T E R who            informed me               in fact

that     there were         eleven       bodies at that               location and he further                         informed

me    that       there were a further              74   in the Gymnasium.

Prior      to this        point    the mag n i t u d e        of    the s i t u a t i o n had        not      been known

playing area.

I noted that messages                   were    being       received on the              radio and were         being

dealt with             by the Control          S e r geant and PC and              in general        they   related

to o u tbreaks           of disorder        and      sporadic       fighting        in and ar o s m d the

Stadium.          My a t t e n t i o n was      p a r t i c u l a r l y drawn to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Superintendent             D U C K E N F I E L D and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t   M A R S H A L L and at some

point a t e l ephone            call     was    received and was a n s w e r e d              by Mr JACKSON.

From     the    nature      of the       conversation,            I formed         the    opinion that         it was

a call       from the Chief C o nstable.                     Mr J A C K S O N was a t t e m p t i n g    to ask

questions         of Mr D U C K E N F I E L D and Mr M A R S H A L L and             related them down the

telephone.              I remained       in the Control             R o o m and     listened to what            was

t aking      place      through      the m e s sages and noted that                      the main

communications             handset was          not      being    utilised,         but that       personal

Commanders         in the        form of S u p e r i n t e n d e n t   C H A P M A N at      the N o t t i n g h a m

side    of the s t a d i u m a n d Chief            Inspector W A R I N G at            the L e p p i n g s Ln area

of the Stadium.               It was      clear     that there was              some    disorder          and no

doubt as a c onsequence                  of the a t t i t u d e    of s u p p o r t e r s and        I i n structed

that    all    personnel          remain on duty and that                 the mobile            units,       named

Tango Units,          remain        ready and available.

Responses        were      given     to numerous         incidents        of fighting,              but     in the

fullness       of time        calm was        restored.

I recall that trains had left the area, as had coaches w h i c h were
released from their                 coach     parks     and whilst I have              no    real r e c o l l e c t i o n

in order and D e t e c t i v e           Chief    supa»rx ntendent A D D I S was                contro l l i n g        Che

M o r t u a r y aspect.          I spoke to a number of O f f i c e r s who were clearly in

noted that        the t e m p or a r y M o r t u a r y was        located        in the Gymnasium,                 w hich

was    separated          into    three     sections,       the    first        section       conta i n i n g      the

bodies,       the second s e c t i o n being             a relative          sterile         are a where Police

O f f i c e r s were a c c o m m o d a t e d and the        third       s e c t i o n had been set               up for

identification             purposes       and statement           taking        by CID O f f i c e r s       .     A

separate       section        had been        created for         identification               purposes and             this

was    adjac e n t    to a s e p a r a t e     office where            relatives        could view bodies                   in

relative       privacey.

I formed the          opin i o n      that a r r a n g e m e n t s were well           o r g a n i s e d and      that

temporary Mortuary                f a c i l i t i e s were well        in hand.         During        this       time    i.

                 did meet Det S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M c K A Y and noted                     that      he too was         in some

                way     distressed           fay the      events.

                Following            the visit         to the Gymnasium,               I checked the             remainder       of the

B eca u s e      of my kno w l e d g e       of t h a / i 981     <000081)        incident        by the        time     of

Superintendent              of the Division,               the    1981     <000081)        incident        did not

feature          in my    planning.             The   reasq/f was         that    I was aware           the     prob 1 em

had    been a d dressed            by the a d d i t i o n        of the       radial      fences       creating        the

then three             separate      pens.        l y was also        th e r e f o r e    not a subject            I would

have passed on to an y new raratch C o m m a n d e r coming to rnv Division.

F o l l o w i n g the semi finaijr in 1987 (000087) and 1988 <000088) de-briefs
                                     \ r
were     held,

The    de-brief          system      is as       follows,        firs t l y    once a serial            is stood down

the    serial          sergeant      is     required to complete a de-brief                           document.          This

document          known as a sheet               contains        i n f o r m a t i o n as to any        incidents

that    have       o c c u r r e d during        the o p e r a t i o n such as arrests,                 persons

injured,          use    of t r u n c h e o n    by Police O f f i c e r s        or any        course     of    conduct

outside          the    normal     scope        of the Operation.

The    de~-forief sheet            is then        immedi a t e l y     passed       by the S e r g e a n t       to the

logistics          team who        review        each de-brief            sheet     before       releasing         the

s e r ia I .

My own s u p e r v i s o r y officer              de— brief       then took         place       some    three      to four

days after             each semi       final.         It   is right        to say this           d e - brief     extended

to    include          representatives            of every D i v i s i o n        or D e p a r t m e n t   involved.

4t V           I can state             that     in both       1987         (00001        tnd in 1988        (000088)        the    de­

               briefs          did not d i s close -any s u g g e s t i o n              that   supporters         had been

               injured due             to o v e r c r o w d i n g     o r / rushing.        In addition,           I cannot        recal

               any other a g e n c y            reporting           t /    me   such a problem.

               As    regards          the    tunnel     being         closed      in 1988       (000083)        by Po l i c e Officer

               that      is the        sort    of    incident             I w ould   have   e x p ected     to have      been on a

               d e-brief         sheet,         I     was     not made aware          of thjp/proh 1 em          in 198 8    (000088)

               a nd as a result my                    planning            for 1989 (0^0089)        was    not    influenced.

              Other aspects                 of my    planning             did   ch^mge    because        of the    result     of    the

               1988      (000088)           de-brief        i n c l uding/the        removal      of Air        cover an d the

               removal          of one serial           from H i l l s b o r o u g h      precinct.

               It was          this    that    r e s ulted      isf my view that            1988    (0GQG8S)        was a success

              and formed a sound                      base     for        the 1989 (000089)        match.

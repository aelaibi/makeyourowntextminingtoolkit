through         the      t,ur nst i 3.e , I ha d                no    p r o b 1 em     in f i n d i n g     my    seat      once          i ns ide

the    g r o u n d as       each     of       the       blocks         were       lettered.            I witnessed              no

drinking           or a n y       disorder             between         entering           the    ground          and    the     match

s tart i n g .

I took        my    seat      at    about          2.40         pm    in the          North     Stand.           I wa s     seated

about      h al f     way     back       in the           stand and              about       level     with       the     penalty              spot

near    the        Leppings         Lane       end.             I noticed             that     the    area       behind        the        goal

appeared           overcrowded               and       t ha t    the     side         areas     were      half      empty.            I

actually           commented         on       this        to     one     of m y        friends.           They      even       remained

half    empty after                the       match        had        started,          within a        couple          of m i n u t e s         of

ones    and        twos     over     onto          the      track        around         the     pitch,       this       small         number

then     rapidly          became         a    tangled            rabble          of    people        climbing          over,      the          game

was    sti ll       in    progress            at       this      time,        the      Police        became       involved,               at

first      we      thought         it w a s        a    pitch         invasion,           I remember             seeing        on e       of    the

fans     run       onto     the     pitch and               speak        to B r u c e        Grobbelaar           and     then

I    saw a      policeman           run       on a n d          speak       to    the     referee         and     the     game        was

stopped,           even     at     this       t i m e we         s t il l     thought          it w a s     crowd       trouble            and

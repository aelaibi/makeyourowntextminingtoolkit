Our ref.        VH/JB                 Your ref




                LIVERPOOL       W                25th April, 1389

                Dear Mr.

                Detailed below for your information la a statement
                frora        1 who is known to the Probation Service,
                who was at Hillborough on Saturday, 15th April, 1989;

                    account of the events of Hillsborough on Saturday
                15th April, 1   9    8    9    "    .

                "At 11.15 a.m. I boarded the coach at Picton Clock Tower,
                W a v e r t r e e , with        The Journey was rather
                boring beoasue of tailbacks and traffic jams on the MS,
                fts we aproached Sheffield we were stopped about 2 miles
               ,away from the ground by Police, The Police boarded the coach
                and quickly searched for any drink on the coach* The coach then
                carried on towards the ground.
               At about 2.15 p. , the coach, narked about f mile away
               from the ground. Myself and         walked quickly towards
               the ground. As I remember, there was a lot of latecomers
               behind us. After a while we reached the ground and
               left me becasue he had a stand ticket. Is 1 looked
               towards the leppings Lane Turnstiles, there was about
               one - two thousand people queuing there, so 1 joined
               them. As I looked around in the disorganised q u e u e ,
               I noticed only about H policemen (one of them mounted
               on a horse) controlling the crowd. The crown was getting
               very impatient as the time was about 2.35 p.m. Eventually *
               I managed to force my way in through a turnstile, where the
               steward took my ticket and then returned the stub.
               I then slowly walked the tunnel leading towards the terrace.
               When I actually got on to the terrace the time was about
               2.^0 p-m. The terrace was capacity then, so' I positioned
               myself to the left of the goal in front of the bar, so I
               wouldn’t get crushed. The crush got worse and I was pushed
               and 1 banged <ny right knee on the bar. Then at about 2,50 p.m.
               people started to panic near the front.
                        2




Cont/,......


The game was kicked off, as soon as it v& s , people
started to climb over the railings at the front. The
crush now wag extremely bad. Then I heard from someone
that the gates outside had been opened, k fan who was already
on the pitch then ran on and tugged             I and pointed
behind the goal. The referee then stopped the gam as policemen
and women tried to ease the crush. Then I seen what appeared
to be someone dead or very badly injured being passed over
the railings* Bat there was panic everywhere so I stayed
where I was for about 5 mins until it teas calmer, I then
ran to the left of the goal and helped rip down the fence.

As X got out of the fence on to the pitch, I looked around
and to my horror, X seen dead, dying and injured people
everywhere. People crying and panicking as the police
did evety thing they could behind the goal.
Then 1 offered my hand in help behind the goal, but was
told bluntly by a Police officer to "Go away son, leave this
to us” . Go and help the injured".,* I then angered by his
reply, tore clown advertising boards with other fans
to use as stretchers I then walked around the ground
dazed and after no more could be done, walked towards
the coaches and phoned horae frc&n a shop opposite our coach.
1 then boarded the coach and found      H. Then after
a quick count, in which only 2 was missing, we returned
home shocked and numb- with daze,....... J*

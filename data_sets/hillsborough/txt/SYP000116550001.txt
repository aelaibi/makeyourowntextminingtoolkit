            On Saturday             15 A p r i l       1989,        I    commenced           d u t y at       9am       at W o m b w e l l    Police

            On   arrival          at    the     ground         I attended             a general              briefing,          in    the N o r t h

            went     with        the    serial,          and    also          serial       14,      Police         Sergeant          Crawford's

           Whilst        standing          on     the     terracing             Mr    White         pointed            out   the     layout        of       the

were      to    supervise            entry,          search        people          for     alcohol         and        other

contraband            (flags         et c).          On    completion              of    entry       the       serial           were       then

to    enter      the Leppirtgs                Lane        terrace        at    the       rear,       and       supervise              c r ow d

behaviour.              On     completion             of    the       game     we       went    to a s s i s t            in    the

clearing         of     th e    ground.               Mr     White        in   closing said               that         in a n ideal

situation            he w o u l d       have         used        our    tw o   s e r i a l s in the            terracing              to h e l p

locate         and    distribute              the     crowds          within        th e      enclosures.

The      serial       took      up      position           in f r o n t       of    the G a t e          "IB* a n d        Turnstyles

the      time    was     used        to      familiarise              ourselves            with      the       club officials,

and      other       facilities              that     were       present           in    the    area,          snack           bars,

programme            sellers         etc.

The      turnstiles            o p e n e d at        about       noon and           from       t h is     time        onward          there

was      a steady        trickle             of   fans      entering           the       ground.           The        great          majority

at    t hi s    time     had already                 been       searched           prior       to    entry           into       the

ground.          However,            there        was      no a n i m o s i t y         and    the       second           search

afforded         a    certain amount                  of    rapport           with       the    fans.               It w a s     noticeable

t ha t    all    the     people              entering           the    ground       at t hi s        t i me     were       h o ne st ,

d e c e n t people,          well d r e s s e d and well                behaved.                    One        or    two came

through         with     cans        of      ’pop*        but    they     quickly             dispersed              of    th is      in a

proper         manner        when       challenged.                On    two       occasions             I took           possession              of

items      that       I considered                unsuitable             for       use     in the         terracing,                 one    a

p air     of    sticks         from a banner,                   and     the    second          a stone              bottle,          but o nc e

collect         their        property after                 the       game.

This     reduced,             by    t w o , the       number          of    turnstiles                available.

As     the    t im e     progressed             I became             gradually             aware         of a       buiId-up         of

supporters              outside          the    ground.              Though          my    view       of      the     proceedings              w as

limited           to w h a t       I could       see       through          th e      turnstile.                 As    th e      crowds

built        up    I became          conscious             of       people       having          difficulty              in e n t e r i n g

through           the    turnstile.              Th e      crush       outside             was      such        that     the

turnstiles,              on    occasions,             were          unable       to       function            properly,           and

people        were       being       injured          in t he         turnstile             passage.                More      than       one

man     emerged          from       the    t u r n s t y 1e bent            double          and       I saw         one m a n

physically              sick.

From     these          people       entering           the         ground       1 began            to     understand             that

there        were       difficulties             outside             the    g r o u n d , and            it w a s      about        this

time     t h at      1 became            aware    of       people          banging,             shouting            outside         and many

appeared           to    be    kicking          and     banging            on    the       concertina               ga t e s .      Given

al l    this       information             I formed             the    opinion             t ha t     there         were      great

masses        of     people         outside,          although             I was          not    aware          of a n y      specific

di ffi c u i t y .

It w a s      about       this       time       that, a y o u t h           appeared             on      top     of    the w a l l        above

the     turnstiles.                 He    was    told       to       get    down,          but      he w a s        shouting         that

people        were       in d i f f i c u l t i e s        outside          the       ga te s .          He     attempted           to    gain

entry        to    the    ground,          but    I took             hold       of    him       and      ejected         him      through

Gate     *C *.          I did       not    use    Gate          8    because          I w as        aware        of a va st          number

of     people       outside.              On my       return          to    position             I saw          that     the      roof     and

surrounding              wall       were       literally             covered          with       supporters              who      had

c1 imbed          into    the       ground.           Some          were    endeavouring                   to    enter        the    g ro u n d ,

and     some       were       complaining             of    the       crush          outside,            and     others          were

brandishing              valid       entry       tickets.              It w a s           about       t h is     time      that      we    were

Inspector             began         helping             people         into     the       g r o u n d , a n d at         one    stage         the

turnstile             roof      was        literally               covered          with     spectators.                At     t h is     stage

I received              an     instruction                   from wh o m        1 know        not,        th a t     provided           these

spectators              had       tickets          t h e n we          should        admit        them.         The      persons          on the

roof     then         began           to    enter        the       ground.           The     majority           of      people       had

tickets           but      many        did       not.         Th e     persons        who     had       gained          access       then

began        to    pass        th e        unchecked           tickets          back       over        the     r o of    and     over      the

At    on e      stage        o ne      person who              was      attempting             to      gain access             came       into

my    grasp,          he     began          saying           " I ’ve    got     a    ticket.           I ’ve    got      a ticket",                he

also       s h o w e d me         a Merseyside                 Police         Warrant          C a r d,      the     n a me    on    it,       I

be 1 i eve                            Dr    similar.               I made       comment           to    him about             having       more

sense,          and     he     became            quite        angry         complaining             about       the      things         that

were       going        on     outside,            and        the      lack     of    professionalism                    on    the      part        of

South        Yorshire             Police.               As    he     passed         into     the       ground        I made         comment

to P o l i c e        Sergeant              Burns        t h at      he w a s       a Police           Officer.

I became           aware          of       a general            upsurge         in a c t i v i t y        both       inside         and

outside           the      g o u n d , and         that         people        were        still        climbing          in a n d       passing

unused          tickets           backwards.                  The      banging        on     the m e t a l         gate       increased,

when       I. s a w     on e      of       the    club        stewards          on    the      gate       go    to      the    opening

mechanism,              I looked             at    him and             he    said     "I'm        opening          this       gate,       I'll

take       responsibility"                       and     proceeded            to     open      the      concertina             gate.           I

did     not       see      who        assisted           in th e        opening.             As     the      crowds       entered             the

ground          I had        to       take       refuge         alongside            Turnstile            16.        Several         hundred

people          entered           the       ground,           and      I was        amazed        that       the     rush      stopped and

there        was      only        a    few       people         outside.             As     the     gates       were      being         closed

I looked           outside             and       sa w    t ha t      the     Mounted         Section           were      holding          a

A    l a r ge     number          of       those        admitted            through         Gate       *B * w e r e      hanging          around

been      opened,          several          minutes,           I heard a           cheer          within          the       ground,        and

I assumed            this      to      be    the    kick-off.               I continued                to w a t c h         people       enter-

through         the       turnstiles            when      I saw        the       gate       open again             and       a number           of

Police         Officers           rushed        into      the     ground,          saying          that          there       was    trouble

A    few moments             l a te r       Police       Sergeant           Burns       ordered             us    as a s e r i a l         to

enter        t he    terraced            area      at    the L e p p i n g s       Lane        end.          I entered             through

t he     centre          tunnel         under      the W e s t        Stand.           As    I passed             down       the    tu nn e l

1 was        met     by     various          groups       of    people           rushing          up    the       tunnel       carrying

injured         persons           to     th e     rear    of    t he       stand.           Some       of    the       spectators

were      very       angry        and       began       screaming           at    Police          Officers             saying       there's

people         dead       down      t h e r e (i sy i t * s y o u r         fault.           As    I wa s         making       my w a y

confronted               by a n g r y       fans    waving        tickets,             and     saying            "We've       never        been

checked,            these      tickets          are      unused,           y o u ’ve    let       too m a n y          in h e r e ,

removing            of    some      dead and            numerous           slightly          injured             persons       to       the

r ea r    of    the       main      stand.          1 then went               through          the       crowd and            on    to     the

pitch        in o r d e r      to       find    other       members           of m y        s e r ia l.

Whilst         making        my     way      through        the       crowd       I wa s       confronted               by a       ra n g e     of

were      asking          "What         time    w i ll    the     kick-off             be".

Whilst        at    the       entrance            to    the      tunnel        I saw          fans     in the W e s t             Stand

begin     to       rip h o a r d i n g s          from       above       the       terraced          a r e a.        The    fans        on    the

terrace        below          complained               that      they were           being          showered          with        debri,

b ut    I heard          someone            say    "Tell         the     press       we're          not    all       hooligans,

these     are       for       stretchers".

From     this       point        I coaxed              people       to       leave       the    ground,          but       m a n y we re

refusing           to    leave         without          refunds          for       unused       tickets.

I    later     reformed             w i t h my         serial,          and attended a                 debrief         in       the N o r t h

Stand,         It w a s        at      this       po i n t    1 made          my    point       to a S e n i o r           Officer           t h at

Gate     B had          been     opened,           apparently                without          Police       instruction.                  I

then accom pa ni ed                 Inspector               White       and Calvert             to     the a r e a         of     the

t u rnst i 1 e s .

Whilst        walking          through            the N o r t h         Stand       1 was       sickened             by the        number

of     empty       b ee r     c an s    and       spirit         bottles           that       had    been apparently

smuggled           into       the      ground.

In the        period          that      I wa s         engaged          on    searching             persons          I found        no

alcohol        at       all    but      as    the       t i me     approached             3pm       then    cans       and        bottles

began     to a p p e a r         on     the       floor       of    the       turnstile.               When      I    returned           to

the     scene       later        I was        confronted with                      quite       a quantity             of    empty        and

p art    empty          cans     in a n d         around         the     turnstile.

Prior     to a t t e n d i n g          the       debrief          we w e r e       standing           as a s e r i a l           alongside

t he    turnstile             when      I saw a s m a ll                group       of    people,          very       upset        walking

towards        the       e:<it..        A woman             said    "Get       rid       of    him,       please,          I ’m

trying        to    find my            husband".              I saw a y o u n g i s h               person       carrying           a

notebook.               I said         to    him       "Who      a re    you?"       He       said     " I ’m    from       the S t a r ,

I 'm o n l y       after       a story".                I told          him    to    leave          the    woman alone              as

she     was    obviously               distressed.                 He    went       towards          Police          Sergeant

Burns,        who       also     told        him       to    go a w a y .

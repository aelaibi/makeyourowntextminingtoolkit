1994 Update of the cabinet Office Civil Emergencies Book (COCEB)


1.   The purpose of this letter is to seek your personal support
in preparing material for this year's COCEB update.    I hope to
achieve the following timetable:
          Updated material to reach me by Friday 2 December.

          Revised edition of COCEB issued - February 1995.
2.   Departmental responsibilities for updating specific chapters
are set out in Annex A to the Introduction to COCEB. Please note
also paragraph 2 of the Introduction and particularly that the
departments listed in Annex A are responsible for consulting all
other departments with an interest in the subject covered; do not
forget the territorial departments, and ensure that their views
are included in the revised draft sent to me. I shall be happy
to help resolve any difficulties that arise. It is not helpful
for departments to send their comments on chapters that are the
responsibility of others to me direct. I have to check with the
responsible department to find out if the comments have been
considered and rejected or incorporated in some other way.      I
would prefer to have a revised chapter from the responsible
department and, if relevant, have my attention drawn to areas of
disagreement so that I can devote my efforts to resolving the
disagreements.
3.   As always I am happy to accept a photocopy of the current
chapter with new material in legible red ink manuscript. If this
is impracticable please sideline new material, preferably in red
ink, to assist me in my editorial duties.       One copy of each
revised chapter will suffice.    Please say if you believe any
particular chapter does not require updating this year.     Also
discuss with me if you wish new subjects to be included.
4.   Some of the chapters in Section I - Industrial Threats need
to be examined to see if such parts as 'Stoppages and Severity
in Recent Years'? 'Major Considerations arising from Recent
Stoppages' and the 'Effects of Stoppages' can be further
shortened. I believe it is reasonable in pursuit of brevity to
adopt a "non literary" style and list the main points that need
to be recorded to ensure lessons learned from past events are
readily available for the future.
5.    I would be particularly grateful for comments on the revised
'Memorandum for Chairmen of RECs' at the beginning of Section II
and those parts of Chapter I of Section III that were new for
1993.    I am also anxious to complete the updating of maps -
particularly those that are over-printed on out of date UK Land
Forces area maps - Home Defence Regions and both UK Civil Police
Boundary Maps. Will DH be able to provide maps showing revised
Regional Health Authority boundaries following recent changes or
is it too early? 48 copies of each map will be required.
6.   Please discuss with me as soon as possible any problems you
anticipate in carrying out this year's COCEB update.

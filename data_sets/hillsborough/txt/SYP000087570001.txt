22, and after this second briefing we commenced duties onJliddlewood

Rd.



In company wit        Long, we carried out a foot patrol between Crofton

Ave and Catch Bar Ln,        All of the off licences within this stretch of

road were closed.      Throughout the day, we had continuous enquiries

with regard to locations of public houses or off licences from

Liverpool supporters.



At 1430hrjr w e took up a p o r t i o n towards the Catch Bar Ln end where a

stream^jff supporters camar down the hill and headed towards the ground.

This continued until      U&QQ hrs, and it was obvious that the majority of

the Liverpool fans M e r e   drunk.



All of the serials in the area were then instructed to return to the

Leppings Ln end of the ground, where there was trouble with fans.

Upon arriving there the majority of fans had entered the ground and

there was a large contingent of Police Officers.           I remained at the

gate for approximately ten mi'fmtes, before entering and giving f i rst

aid and resuscitation to % n s        at the rear of the West Stand.     I was

then moved with other        ficers to the area at     fe rear of the Police

Control   room, where we kept an open p a s s a g e ^ o r all emergency vehicles



I remained there until the de b j r i e f in g , and return journey to

Doncaster, where I stood down at 1945 hrs.

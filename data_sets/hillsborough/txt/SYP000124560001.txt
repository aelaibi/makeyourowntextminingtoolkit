 A TTENDED LAST YEAR'S SEMI-FINAL AT HILLSBOROUGH.      NO PROBLEMS GETTING INTO THE

 GROUND. TRAVELLED BY A TRAIN FOOTBALL SPECIAL. SEEMED TO BE MORE POLICE.       HELD

 UP BY POLICE AT STATION.       EVERYONE SEARCHED AND MARCHED BY POLICE DOWN TO THE

 LEPPINGS LANE END. AT HALF-TIME DOZENS OF LADS HAD CLIMBED UP FROM THE
                                                                             PAGE 10

 TERRACES ONTO THE STANDS BECAUSE IT WAS THAT FULL. THE PUBS HAD BEEN CLOSED

 LAST YEAR. THIS YEAR WAS APPROACHED BY A COUPLE OF THE LADS AT LEPPINGS LANE

 ASKING IF HAD ANY SPARE TICKETS. EVERYONE WAS IN A SMASHING H U M O U R , LOOKING

 FORWARD TO THE MATCH.

 FROM MY VIEWING POINT THIS YEAR I COULD SEE THAT THE SIDE PENS WERE ONLY HALF

 FULL. NOT AWARE OF ACCESS FROM PENS 3 8> 4 INTO THE SIDE PENS.

 NO IMMEDIATE COMMITMENTS.

  NO.

  Q53

  DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

  INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,     A F T E R J m E MATCH WAS STOPPED?

  YES. THE PUBLIC ADDRESS jy^STEM WAS USED TO REPEAT THE MESSAGE,              "WILL THE

  L ^ E R P O O L SUPPORTERS fj^EASE LEAVE THE PITCH". THIS ANNOYED ME BECAUSE THEY

  HAD NOWHERE TO GO.

  IT WAS POINTLESS THE POLICE ASKING THE CROWD TO MOVE BACK BECAUSE THEY COULD

  NOT.

  THE ONLY WAY TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE WAS         FOR THE FANS TO       GO ONTO THE PITCH

I AND THIS WAS DELAYED FOR VITAL MINUTES.

 I THINK THAT THE COACHES I SAW ARRIVING LATE WAS A MAJOR FACTOR.            WE WERE

 I SAW A LOT OF POLICEMEN COME       0 THE PITCH AND STAND THERE.     IT LOOKED

 LIKE ALL THEY WERE INTERESTED IN        CROWD CONTROL.     I THINK THEY SHOULD

 HAVE CHIPPED IN WITH PULLING AT THE FENCE WITH THE FANS TO GET THE CROWD

 OUT.

 Q53A

 DID YOU GO TO THE SAME MATCH LAST YEAR?

 NO.

 Q54

 INHERE      ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THAT LIVERPOOL, BEING A LARGE SUPPORTED CLUB, SHOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED

 WITH MORE TICKETS AND BEEN GIVEN THE LARGER END OF THE GROUND.

 I ALSO THINK THAT THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED TO CATER FOR THE LATE

 ARRIVALS.

 THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THROUGH THE TUNNEL AND INTO PENS 3 + 4 .

 I FEEL THAT THE FA WERE NOT WRONG IN CHOSING THE GROUND FOR THE SEMI FINAL.

       •VER,   I DO BELIEVE THAT THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS WERE TOTALLY WRONG,

 AND ALSO THE PLACING OF THE FANS         WERE WRONG.

 LIVERPOOL, HAVING AN AVERAGE GATE OF 39,OOO WERE            GIVEN THE SMALLER    END OF   THE

 GROUND WHILST FOREST WITH A GATE          SOMETHING LIKE 20,000   WERE ALLOCATED    A MUCH

 LARGER PROPORTION OF THE GROUND.

DEAR COLIN MOYNIHAN/MARGARET THATCHER/GRAHAM KELLY

DOUGLAS HURD/BERT MILLICHIP

I AM WRITING TO YOU IN COMPLAINT AND DISGUST ABOUT THE TRAGIC DAY SATURDAY

15TH APRIL 1989(130489),     WHEN THE EVENT OF THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION CUP SEMI

FINAL MATCH BETWEEN NOTTINGHAM F.C. AND LIVERPOOL F.C. TOOK PLACE AT

HILLSBOROUGH IN SHEFFIELD,      (HOME OF SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY F.C,)

MY NAME IS                  AND I SUPPORT LIVERPOOL,   I ATTENDED THIS "FOOTBALL

MATCH" AND WILL NEVER FORGET IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, ALL FOR THE WRONG

REASONS.     NONE OF JOHN BARNES FLASHES OF SKILL, NO SMOOTH ATTACKING

FOOTBALL BY NIGEL CLOUGH AND CO OR ANY PETER BEARDSLEY TRICKS, JUST THE

F^pjRES OF 93 DEAD LIVERPOOL FANS AND HUNDREDS INJURED, SOME OF WHO I KNOW,

ETCHED IN MY MEMORY.       I AM 15 AND ENJOY ATTENDING LIVERPOOL MATCHES   (HOME AND

AWAY) WITH MY FATHER.       I DETEST VIOLENCE, SO I AM NOT A WILD YOUTH WHO ATTENDS

MATCHES FOR A GOOD PUNCH UP, AS YOU MAY OF ASSUMED.         I HAVE ATTENDED OVER

100 MATCHES IN NEARLY 4 SEASONS SINCE 1985-86.         I TOOK A REAL INTEREST IN

LIVERPOOL,    (EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN A LONG-LIFE SUPPORTER OF THEM), SURPRISINGLY

ENOUGH AFTER THE BRUSSELS DISASTER, AND STARTED TO ATTEND MATCHES JUST AS

HUNDREDS OF FANS GAVE UP FOOTBALL.

I'M WRITING THIS LETTER JUST AFTER MATCH OF THE DAY ON THE NIGHT OF THE

15TH OF APRIL    (150400) AND I NEED NO EVIDENCE OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY FROM

T ^ P SUNDAY NEWSPAPERS.    THE BLAME FOR THE DEATHS CLEARLY IS SHARED BETWEEN THE

FA AND THE POLICE.     THE FA FOR GIVING FOREST MORE TICKETS AND THE KOP, THE

POLICE BECAUSE OF THEIR      INCOMPETENCE OF CONTROLLING THE FANS AT THE TURNSTILES

(B) AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END.       I CAN GIVE A HONEST ACCOUNT OF THE HAPPENINGS

BEFORE THE MATCH,    YOU CAN TAKE IT SERIOUS AND TAKE NOTE OF THE VIEWS OF A

NORMAL FAN ON THE DAY OR JUST IGNORE IT AND CARRY ON WITH YOUR JOB IN THE WAY

YOU SEE BEST.

OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES AND THE MAIN GATE WERE THOUSANDS OF LIVERPOOL

SUPPORTERS TRYING TO GAIN ENTRANCE TO SEE THE MATCH THROUGH TURNSTILES,        (NOTE

THIS, THEY WERE NOT TRYING TO KICK IN THE DOORS,       ALTHOUGH THEY DID TRY MUCH
                                                                               PAGE 10
                                                                               GSL2212

LATER ON).     THE 3 OR 4- POLICEMEN ON HORSEBACK ONLY GOT IN THE WAY AND CAUSED

UNREST,    THEY WERE DOTTED ABOUT ALL OVER THE PLACE DOING NOTHING.     THEY WERE

TRYING AS HARD AS THEY COULD, BUT WHEN ACTUALLY LOOKING INTO WHAT THEY WERE

DOING IT WAS NOTHING.     THEY WERE TRYING AS HARD AS THEY COULD, BUT WHEN

ACTUALLY LOOKING INTO WHAT THEY WERE DOING IT WAS NOTHING.       THEY SHOULD OF

BEEN IN SOMEKIND OF FORMATION ASSISTED BY PLENTY OF POLICE OFFICERS ON FOOT

PARTING THE CROWD INTO ORGANISED QUEUES AND STOPPING FANS WITHOUT TICKETS

CLIMBING OVER THE WALLS.     HUNDREDS OF THE FANS THERE NEVER HAD TICKETS AND

WERE PLANNING TO GAIN ENTRY ILLEGALLY.       IF THE QUEUES WERE ORGANISED THE

PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS WOULD OF BEEN TURNED AWAY, THEN THERE WOULD OF BEEN THE

R^p-IT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE INSIDE THE GROUND,     AND EVERYTHING WOULD OF GONE

SMOOTHLY.

I ATTEMPTED TO GET IN THROUGH THE CROWD BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLY,       I WAS SHOVED,

PUSHED AND FOUND IT MOST DIFFICULTY TO BREATH AND WAS FORCED TO MOVE TO AN

AREA OUT OF THE SO CALLED QUEUE SO I COULD REGAIN MY BREATH.       WHEN I C O U L D N ’T

BREATH I COULD FEEL MY CHEST BEING CRUSHED AND I DON'T MIND ADMITTING I

STARTED TO CRY THROUGH PAIN.     GOD KNOWS HOW IT FELT INSIDE THE GROUND WHERE

IT ALL HAPPENED.     I THEN REJOINED THE QUEUE MORE CLOSER THE TURNSTILES BUT

IT WAS U S E L E S S r A POLICE OFFICER THEN PULLED ME FROM THE CROWD ALONG WITH MY

FATHER AND TOdfr*>Ug TO THE BIG CLOSED GATES AND WE WERE THEN INFORMED THAT IF

W sP I t AYED HERE THE G(SM^ WOULD BE OPENED FOR A LIMITED AMOUNT OF FANS. WE
                                                      C-   C^_CTV\j<D I N
STOOD FOR A BIT AND THEN ISdE GATES WERE OPENED, I DARTED IN (I WAS THE FIRST

IN) AND BEHIND ME CAME A SURGEsQF ]FANS, UP TO THREE THOUSAND,     UP TO ONE

THOUSAND WITHOUT TICKETS.     LIKE ME AND MY FATHER THE ONES WITH TICKETS D I D N ’T

HAVE TO SHOW THEM OR GIVE UP H A L F .   ME AND MY FATHER STILL HAVE OUR FULL

TICKETS.

AT THIS POINT THE LIVERPOOL FANS COULD MAYBE TAKE A SMALL PORTION OF THE

BLAME FOR CHARGING IN LIKE THEY DID.       BUT WHEN FANS WITHOUT TICKETS SUDDENLY

SEE A BIG GAP LEADING TO THE TERRACES THEY ARE NOT GOING TO STAND ABOUT OR

STROLL IN, THEY ARE GOING TO RUN LIKE HELL TO GET IN AND SEE THEIR FAVORITE
                                                                                   PAGE 1-
                                                                                   QSL2212

TEAM PLAY.     SO NOW THERE IS A THOUSAND EXTRA FANS INSIDE THE GROUND.           FULL TO

THE BRIM, WHERE CAN THEY ALL GO?        THE ANSWER    IS NOWHERE.   YOU CAN'T FIT A

PARCEL THROUGH A LETTER BOX,      ITS IMPOSSIBLE THE PARCEL WOULD GET CRUSHED.             AND

THATS WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THE GROUND,        FORTUNATELY I WAS HIGHER UP WHERE I

WAS SAFE.

ALRIGHT THE POLICE DID THEIR JOB ONCE THEY SAW WHAT          WAS HAPPENING.     BUT THIS

SHOULD OF BEEN COMPLETELY AVOIDED BY MORE       POLICE ON THE OUTSIDE.         TO BE MORE

SPECIFIC THE IDOT WHO ORDERED THE GATES TO BE OPENED STARTED THE BALL

ROLLING.     INSTEAD HE SHOULD OF DELAYED THE KICK O F F , SENT MORE POLICE TO THE

AFFECTED AREA AND SLOWLY GOT THE FANS WITH TICKET INSIDE.

T^I.D.      CARD SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED BY THE GOVERNMENT WOULD CAUSE

A SLOW DOWN IN FANS GETTING INTO THE GROUND.           AND SOMETHING LIKE WHAT

HAPPENED OUTSIDE THE GROUND TODAY COULD HAPPEN AGAIN,           BECAUSE IF IT TAKES

1 MINUTE FOR ABOUT 5 FANS TO USE THEIR CARD THEN PAY AND THERE IS A 40,000

CROWD EXPECTED THEN THATS A LOT OF MINUTES,          IT THEN CAUSES DELAYS IN THE

KICK OFF AND HAVOC IN THE QUEUEING FANS.        BUT IF THIS I.D. CARD IDEA        ISN'T

PUT INTO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT MAY NOT DECIDED TO BACK OUR RETURN TO EUROPE

AND WE W O N ’T GET IN.   SO FOOTBALL IS IN A NO-WIN SITUATION.        THE HOOLIGANS

WHO WOULD BE BANNED FROM FOOTBALL MATCHES IF THE X.D. SCHEME WENT THROUGH

WOULD MOVE ONTO DARTS, SNOOKER OR CRICKET.           THIS MAY BE GOOD FOR FOOTBALL

B # NOT FOR SPORT 0 N THE W H O L E .

IT IS SUNDAY MORNING AND I HAVE JUST BEEN       TO LIVERPOOLS FOOTBALL        GROUND AND

HAVE LAYED FLOWERS DOWN IN THE KOP GOAL MOUTH FOR THE DEAD.           WHICH HAS RISEN

SINCE LAST NIGHT.     IF MORE POLICE WERE POSTED AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END NONE

OF THIS WOULD HAPPENED.      THE FOLLWOING QUESTIONS HAVE ARISEN.       HERE THEY AREA

WITH THE CORRECT ANSWERS.

1/ WHY WERE FOREST FANS ALLOCATED NEARLY 6,000 MORE TICKETS THAN LIVERPOOL

WHEN FOREST GET AN AVERAGE 25,000 PER MATCH AND LIVERPOOL 39,000?

ANSWER

SO THE POLICE COULD GET THE FOREST FANS AFTER THE MATCH STRAIGHT ONTO THE
                                                                                   PAGE 12
                                                                                   GSL2212

MOTORWAY AND HOME.     THIS WAY THE RIVAL FANS C O U L D N ’T MIX.    THIS IS WRONG,   THE

TEAM WITH THE BIGGEST FOLLOWING SHOULD GET THE HIGHER AMOUNT OF TICKETS.               LIKE

THE 1988 (000088) FA CUP SEMI FINAL BETWEEN LIVERPOOL AND WIMBLEDON.               IF MORE

TICKETS WERE GAVE TO LIVERPOOL THE BLACK MARKET W O U L D N ’T OF COME OUT ON TOP.

AS IT WAS WIMBLEDON FANS WERE MIXED WITH LIVERPOOL FANS.             SO RIVAL FANS CAN

MIX, EVEN COCKNEYS AND SCOUSERS ON SUCH A LARGE SCALE.

2) WHY WERE THE GATES OPENED AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END ALLOWING FANS WITH AND

WITHOUT TICKETS IN?

ANSWER

TO STOP FANS BEING CRUSHED AND HURT ON THE OUTSIDE.          BUT THIS REASON ISN’T

j^p-IFIED.    THE POLICE MUST OF KNOWN FANS WITHOUT TICKET WOULD GET IN TOO.

AND ONCE INSIDE ALL THE FANS WERE USHERED INTO TWO PENNED IN SECTIONS,

LEAVING ONE EITHER SIDE HALF EMPTY.       THE POLICEMEN AND OFFICIALS WHO WERE

RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOWING SO MANY SUPPORTERS IN SUCH A SMALL AREA WERE THE NEXT

STEP TO THE TRAGEDY AND SHOULD BE DEALT WITH SEVERLY.

3) WHY WERE THE POLICE OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS LANE END NOT ABLE TO CONTROL THE

CROWDS?

ANSWER

CONSIDERABLY MORE FANS TRAVELLED TO SHEFFIELD WITHOUT TICKETS THAN LAST SEASON

BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY WERE BEING CHEATED BY BEING LUMPED WITH THE SMALL END

A<Rn.     AND THE POLICE EXPECTED THE SAME AMOUNT AS LAST YEAR, WHICH THEY

WERE CORRECT TO THINK SO.      BUT WHEN THEY REALISED THERE WAS MORE, THEY SHOULD

OF REQUESTED MORE HELP.     AND I ’VE SAID THE POLICE ON HORSE WERE USELESS, BUT

I HAVE TO CRITICIZE ONE OF THEM, BECAUSE MY FATHER RECONGNISED ONE FROM

LIVERPOOL, WHO IS ON HORSE BACK OUTSIDE THE KOP         IN LIVERPOOL.     HE WAS

ASMISTIF IED WHAT TO DO AS THE REST.       I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE

FANS WERE NOT LATE FOR THE MATCH,      IT SAID ON THE TICKET TO BE INSIDE BY

2.45PM    (1445) ON THE TICKET.   AND PLENTY HAD ARRIVED ON TIME TO MEET THAT DEAD

LINE, BUT BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE DAY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

MY FINAL WORD IS THAT THIS LATEST SCAR ON THE FACE OF FOOTBALL AND THIS LATEST

 SCAR ON THE FACE OF FOOTBALL AND THE QUESTIONING OF SAFETY FOR THE FANS HAS

NOT CHANGED MY VIEWS ON FOOTBALL OR DETERED ME FROM ATTENDING MATCHES ON THE

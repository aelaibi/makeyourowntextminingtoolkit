    I am writing on behalf of the Police Complaints Authority about the
    complaint you made about the tragic events at Hillsborough on 15
    APril 1989 concerning officers of the South Yorkshire Police. The
    enclosed note explains the independent role of the Authority in the
    complaints procedure and some of the factors which are weighed
    before a decision is made.

    Following the investigation into your complaints/and in accordance
       *\procedures laid down, South Yorkshire Police have considered
    wnether or not it would be appropriate to prefer disciplinary
    charges against any officer on duty that day, and have sent their
    recommendations to this Authority.

    We have now carefully considered their proposals and the Authority
    have used their statutory powers to direct that disciplinary
    charges be preferred against two officers.

   The Authority thought it right to give you this information to
   coincide with their press statement, but we will be writing to you
   again more fully concerning your own particular complaint in the
        future* I am sorry that it has taken some time to conclude

       Thank you for your letter of 26 June, 1991 and for the various
       papers you enclosed. The Authority are also grateful to you and
       Mr Fell for coming to .our offices to discuss this matter.

       The Authority wish to assure you that we have given the most
       careful consideration to the representations made by yourself and
       Mr Fell.   We found these by far the most compelling arguments.
       Whilst we have considered Mr Sharp's letter of 16 May addressed to
       Mr Hayes, we did not feel it was altogether appropriate for the
       investigating officer to set out so fully his views on the
       disciplinary action to be taken.

       We have also taken into account the opinion provided by Mr Richard
       Payne.  It is our view that the extracts which he quotes and the
       opinions he expresses are selective and do not reflect some
       important points especially some of those made by the Coroner who
       on more than one occasion separates the question of unlawful
       killing from the question of neglect, for example, pages 8, 48, 54
       on 21 March, 1991 and page 31 on 26 March, 1991.

      Since otar meeting we have held a separate meeting at which the
      Chairman has fully rehearsed the arguments to be considered in
      deciding whether or not the Authority should direct that charges be
      preferred against any of the officers involved. We can assure you
      that we gave very serious consideration to all the points which you
      and Mr Fell raised. We are, of course, bound to set these against
      our duty to consider the complainants' allegations of "neglect of
      duty" as defined in the Regulations.    We considered the question
      strictly in the context of complaints by members of the public
      against individual police officers and in accordance with the
      procedures and guidance laid down.
The Authority have decided in accordance with Section 93(3) of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to direct that disciplinary
charges be preferred against Chief Superintendent Duekenfield and
Superintendent Murray as set out in our letter of 7 May, 1991 and
for the reasons explained in that letter.     We confirm that the
Authority do not consider it appropriate to prefer disciplinary
charges against any other officers.

The Authority hope that it will be possible to confine the
presentation of the case which is concerned solely with the
overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4 and Mr Duckenf ield's alleged
discreditable conduct to within a week and that the hearing can be
arranged for early October.

I would be grateful if you would inform me of the date of the
tribunal as soon as you are able to arrange it so that I m y
appoint two members from the Authority.

          charges be preferred against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
          Superintendent Murray as set out in our letter of 7 May, 1991 and
                   reasons explained in that letter.    We confirm that the
          Authority do not consider it appropriate to prefer disciplinary
          charges against any other officers.

          The Authority hope that it will be possible to confine the
          presentation of the case which is concerned solely with the
          overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4 and Mr DucKenf ield1s alleged
          discreditable conduct to within a week and that the hearing can be
          arranged for early October.

          1 would be grateful if you would inform ate of the date of the
          tribunal as soon as you are able to arrange it so that I »ay
          appoint two members from the Authority.

HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY 15 APRIL 1989

1.     In your letter of 7 May 1991 you set out your reason* for recommending,
       under Section 93(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 198^, that
       disciplinary charges be brought against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
       and Superintendent Murray. This followed from your consideration of my
       predecessor's memoranda respecting the report by Mr Sharp of his
       investigation into the complaints against police made against these and
       other officers. I note your agreement with the proposal that the evidence
       does not justify disciplinary proceedings being taken against the other
       officers.

2.     You will recall from earlier correspondence that my predecessor was anxious
       to make clear that his memoranda were based on a consideration of the
       evidence of the report as specified in Section 90(7) of the Act. He also,
       I feel, was anxious that it should be manifest that South Yorkshire Police
       was in no way seeking to influence or persuade the Authority in its
       deliberations, but on the contrary sought to show that the Force recognised
       the importance of being seen to accept the independent and impartial
       judgements of others as to the police performance on that fateful day.

3.     How that in accordance with Section 93(3) the appropriate stage in the
       statutory process has been reached when a broader based discussion should
       occur, I have sought to provide a full and reasoned body of material which
       I hope you will find pertinent to the issue and which includes evidence
       given at the inquests that may not previously have featured in your
       deliberations.  I note your resume of the factors which militate against
       disciplinary proceedings set out in paragraph 5 of your letter and that
       you have considered them in your deliberations. Nevertheless they remain
       significant end relevant and should be weighed together with this material.

4.   The material 1b twofold. Firstly, I have asked Mr Sharp to expand on the
     reasoning that led to his conclusions that were distilled In the
     recommendations of his report. This he has kindly done and I enclose a
     copy of his letter of 16 May 1991 in which he sets out the detailed
     reasoning which lay behind the recommendations and conclusions in his
     Complaints and Discipline reports in respect of Chief Superintendent
     Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray.  In addition he has made reference
     to the points and Issues raised by your letter.

5.   Secondly, I have sought counsel's advice and Mr Richard Payne has let me
     have his conclusions as set out in the copy of his opinion and accompanying
     appendices. You may recall that Mr Richard Payne represented the Chief
     Constable of South Yorkshire in the civil actions arising from the
     Hillsborough Disaster and at the inquests and eo has considerable detailed
     knowledge of the evidence that has been accumulated fro* all sides.

6.   I am sending a number of copies of these documents, together with the
     summing up of HM Coroner at the inquests for your use.   I hope you will
     agree that this extensive body of material and the expressed views of Mr
     Sharp and Mr Payne add to the sum total of useful information to be
     considered in arriving at a decision on these matters.  I have made
     considerable efforts to ensure that everything possible that might be done
     has been done.  If anything has been omitted that you would wish to have,
     please inform me and we will make every effort to assist further.

7.   If you feel that it would be helpful to meet and discuss these issues,
     I would be pleased to do so.

       Dear

       I write following your recent discussion with my colleague,
       Assistant Chief Constable, Graham Moore, about our reaction to
       your letter of 7 May concerning the disciplinary considerations
       arising from Mr Sharp's report of his investigation into the
       Hillsborough disaster.

       I understand that Mr Moore - who is currently away from the Force
       - told you it was hoped to give a full response in the near future
       and I am now able to inform you that this will be available to
       you on Friday 28 June 1991 or very soon thereafter.

       You will appreciate the enormous strain on the officers in
       question caused by their uncertainty as to our deliberations
       and the eventual outcome.

       In this situation, I ask please that when you receive our response
       as above, you reconsider your earlier request that we do not
       notify those officers against whom no charges are to be brought
       of that decision.    Naturally, we are anxious to let them know
       the outcome as soon as possible.

       Yours sincerely

             SUBJECT:       policy for disclosure of hillsborough material

              1.   This paper is submitted to enable policy decisions to be made
                   for dealing with any request that is received seeking material
                   connected with the Hillsborough Enquiry.

             SIZE OF PROBLEM

              2.   Currently the force has received some fifty requests for material.
                   This does not include possible requests to West Midlands which
                   may not have been forwarded. This does not include the
                    "Hillsborough Steering Committee" requests which have never been
                    specified. It does not include the requests for return of
                   material that was surrendered on condition of ultimate return
                    such as tickets.  It is believed that there are hundreds of these
                   conditional surrenders.

              3.   One may anticipate that once it becomes known that South Yorkshire
                   Police are releasing material further requests will be received.

             PROBLEM OF "OWNERSHIP"

              4.   It is a question never resolved as to the status of this material
                    which would make it appropriate for South Yorkshire Police to
                    release it. For example a request was received for the release
                    of a pathologist's report that might have been dealt with by
                    referring the requester to the pathologist or to HM Coroner.
                    Another example would be photographs taken by press cameramen.
                    Would South Yorkshire Police act correctly to release such
                   material?

             GENERAL PLAN

              5.   Once the problem of "ownership" is resolved the general plan would
                    be to seek to classify requests by type and have a disclosure
                    policy according to that classification. Then when a similar
                    request falling into that classification is received it can be
                    dealt with in accordance with the determined policy.

             PHILOSOPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
                                                                                            O
              6.   The legal position I wouldsu^pogg__is that there is no legal
                   requirement for SoutK^Yorkshire Police to disclose anything.

              7.   The choices of policy are:-
                                                 a. disclose nothing
                                                 b. disclose anything on request
                                                 c. disclose selectively

              8.   A policy of giving on request is attractive since it shows an
                   openness that will find favour publicly and will comply with the
                   wishes of the requester. The material is innocuous and current
                   numbers are small.


GEN/2
9.    At the other extreme a policy of non-disclosure has benefits in
       that it is less costly of resources, avoids nice judgements that
      might give rise to criticism and avoids embarrassment or argument
       in the event of the requested material not being found.

10.   Any disclosure might become part of a gathering of material that
      could form the basis of a book or a programme exposing differences
      with the "authorised version" of events revealed by the Taylor
      Enquiry or the Inquest. The chance of this occurring piecemeal
      is exceedingly remote but any disclosure may lead to access to
      researchers seeking exactly this objective.

11.   If not an "all or nothing" policy then disclosure will require
       decisions on merits of individual cases. This may lead to South
       Yorkshire Police arbitrating on matters of good taste for example
       a request for a photograph showing dead son's corpse in situ.
       Probably any souveniers will be marketable.

CLASSIFICATIONS CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED

12.   The classifications currently identified are:-

      C1   Request for copy of statement made by the requester. Such
           requests have been received in the past ostensibly for inquest
           or litigation purposes and have not been actioned.  It may
           be that the purpose has now passed. Probably none of those
           already received should be actioned unless fresh request is
           made.

      C2   Request for copy of statement made by someone other than the
           requester.

      C3   Request for copy of statement made by someone other than the
           requester when the maker has given consent for supply to the
           requester. Requests falling in both these categories have
           been received but like Cl the purpose may have passed.
           Probably none of those already received should be actioned
           unless fresh request is made.

      C4   Request for return of ticket handed over to West Midlands
           Enquiry.  Some requests by letter have been received that
           may relate to civil actions. Others arise from a form of
           receipt given by West Midlands at the time indicating the
           handover was conditional. There appear to be some hundreds
           of these. Probably none of those should be actioned unless
           fresh request is made.

      C5   Request for audio, photographic or video material. Requests
           have been received for photographs. There appear to be
           possible sub groups depending on the provenance of the
           material:-

           a.   South Yorkshire Police Material;
           b.   Media Material;
           c.   Fire and Ambulance Service Material;
           d.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Material;
           e.   Private Individual's Material;
           f.   West Midlands Police Material.
           Probably copyright considerations arise in relation to
           disclosure of any other than South Yorkshire Police Material
           and if a policy of disclosure finds favour then legal advice
           should be sought together with the approval of the "owner".
           Costs also arise as supply probably should be conditional
           on payment of fee. The administrative problems may be
           considerable in that if the requester does not have a
           reference for the photograph he wants it may be exceedingly
           difficult to trace.

      C6   Requests for expert evidence such as pathologists report.
           Probably the answer to the "ownership" problem would indicate
           that South Yorkshire Police should not disclose but refer the
           requester to the pathologist, etc.

      C7   Requests for material made by police officers. As far as is
           known no requests have been made by South Yorkshire Police
           officers who might feel they had grounds to sue the Chief
           Constable and would seek specific material to support their
           case.

DECISIONS REQUIRED

13.    The need for the following decisions to be made has been
       identified:-

       A - The "ownership problem" - needs legal advice as to status
           of this material

       B - "Philosophical problem" - needs to be a decision on the
            fundamental stance of the force, all?, nothing?, selective?

       C - If selective then decision needed on whether to release
           on past requests or only any fresh requests.

       D - If selective then decision needed on whether classification
           plan is appropriate after which more detailed work will be
           undertaken in relation to each identified classification
           to enable a specific disclosure policy to be made on each
           classification.

COMMENT

14.    Any policy of disclosure can be implemented.

15.    The easiest course to take is to disclose nothing. The
       justification of that course, if justification is needed, is
       harder to supply.

HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY


Brigadier Pownall telephoned at 4 50 pm today asking about the
time-scale for our response to his letter regarding Hillsborough.

I told him that the Investigating Officer, Mr Sharpe, had promised
us an authoritative response in the near future and that we wished
to send to the PCA a comprehensive and clear statement of our
position on the matter, and our reply should be available in
approximately two weeks time.    Any delay in settling the matter
was at the forefront of our minds and Brigadier Pownall assured
me that once he received our reply he would endeavour to reach
a decision within 3/4 days.

TO   :   Assistant Chief Constable (Complaints & Discipline P a te : 3 0 May 1991



         SUBJECT:       after the hillsborough investigation

         Further to our discussions today I felt it would be useful to set out
         intentions and circulate to all persons who have been involved in the
         various initiatives relating to the Hillsborough aftermath.

         If you are to be responsible for the Hillsborough material,with me   doing
         the necessary work involved, it is important that allinitiatives and
         decisions are made known to me that might effect the planning and
         implementation. I would ask that this policy operates forthwith.

         I believe that there are different types of material involved as follows

         A.    Documents of the Dear Enquiry

         B.     Material supporting the Dear Enquiry

         C.     Property of the deceased

         D.    Property collected at the scene, identifiable and unidentifiable

         E.    Documents of the Wain Enquiry

         F.    Material supporting the Wain Enquiry

         I believe A, B, C and D material is indexed using the "West Midlands"
         computer and E and F material is indexed using the "South Yorkshire"
         computer.

         1.    With the co-operation of West Midlands Police the plan is to bring
               material C and D to Hammerton Road, set it up in order, check it
               and accept it. Target time is week commencing 3 June 1991 with
               the work to be completed by 7 June 1991.

         2.    Transfer material E and F from Castle Green to Hammerton Road, set
               it up in order, check it and accept it. This will require approval
               decisions and appropriate hand over from the person presently
               responsible for it. The timing of this needs to be decided by the
               person currently controlling and accessing this material. Will
               you please discuss this with DCC to resolve the unknowns.

         3.    Obtain the "West Midlands" machine and data and set up so that the
               index is accessible from the VDU located in Complaints and
               Discipline. This work is currently being dealt with by Computer
               Section. Target time is now until 1 July 1991 when it should be
               finalised.

          4.   Once 3 is finalised with the co-operation of West Midlands Police,
                training of personnel in the use of the "West Midlands computer
                to be carried out.  It is anticipated this will take 5 days and
                the personnel involved would be Police Constable Greenaway and
               |               | There may be staff implications in such a proposal
                that need considering.
t




    5.   Once 3 and 4 are finalised with the co-operation of West Midlands
         Police, material A and B will be brought to Hammerton Road, set
         up in order, checked and accepted. Target for this is week
          commencing 8 July 1991 with work to be completed by 12 July 1991-

    6.   As soon as material is housed in Hammerton Road, from that date
          the alarm system protecting the area needs to operate.  Suggest
          keyholder for this should be officer in charge FI Control Room with
          the actual key housed in glass front holder (as with armoury key).

    Will you formally approve this plan please or indicate those areas that
    need modification.   I will then circulate to interested parties and liaise
    with West Midlands Police and others to secure implementation.

                                                                                          l a June 1988



      Dear Mrs. Wblff,


      At our recent meeting,          I agreed to write to you giving the Discipline office

      thoughts on ‘neglect of duty'.


      in   all neglect      charges,     the    presenting Officer must first prove             that a
      neglect has occurred and he must do so beyond reasonable doubt.                      The accused
      officer,      to negate the charge,         needs then only to show that he acted with
      good and sufficient cause,             but his standard of proof is on the balance of

      probability.


      Neglect falls into roughly two different departments ~ the first,                       where the
      officer clearly       fails or     refuses to       perform   a   particular    duty,     and    the
      second,     where he tries but,          through ineptitude,        fails to meet a required
      standard.         1 think that it is common ground between us that in the former
      discipline is always appropriate, whether it be informal or formal, depending
      on the seriousness of the circumstances.               The second is ®uch more complex and
      is   always      subject   to    the   overriding    principle     that   if   an   officer     acts
       reasonably and in good faith,             his actions will always be supported by the
      Commissioner.        It seems to us inappropriate that an officer should be charged
       with neglect when he is trying to perform a duty,                  albeit in an incompetent
       manner.         There may,     of course,     be other charges more appropriate if he
       exceeds his authority for example.

              This problem is rn^de more difficult by the fact that there is no list of what
              is and what          is not a police officer's                duty.         Many    judges have   tried to
              compile one but always end by saying *this is not an exhaustive list but a
              guide to the basic duties*.                          Because these duties          are so varied and the
              circumstances in which they occur inexhaustible,                                it is impossible to issue
              instructions to meet all eventualities.                       Many offences, for example, give the
              officer a power of arrest^                      Xn many oaooar ^ h ^ i s instij^cted that he should
              obtain a warrant after interviewing both parties^                           f    f>oes this not give him a
              discretion to decide the most appropriate course of action?                                Xf he attempts
              to lawfully arrest a man,                      and causes a riot,       his actions may be judged as
              ill-advised but they could hardly be                         said to be neglectful.            There   is a
              strong       argument        that       it   would   be   unlawful    for   the Commissioner      to issue
              instructions forbidding his officers to arrest where Parliament confers such
              powers.        He can issue guidelines,                   e.g. in a case of doubt, a warrant should
              be obtained, but 'should' in this context does not mean ’must'.


              One of the cornerstones of 'English policing' is the discretionary power of a
              constable.           The Chief Officer cannot fetter him unlawfully or lawfully to
              such an extent that he cannot perform his duty.                                 Bad judgements are made in
              all walks of life and they do not,                        to my knowledge, appear in any discipline
              or ethical code of practice-                         Neglect should be the result of the common
              accepted definition where an officer                        is idle or deliberately neglectful of

        Mrs. R. Wolff
        Police Complaints Authority

        LONDON
        SWl

                                                                   Your refs                 Our ref:


                                                                                                 ifl June 1983


        Dear Mrs. Wolff,


        At our recent meeting,            I agreed to write to you giving the Discipline office
        thoughts on ’neglect of duty'.


        In   all    neglect     charges,        the   Presenting     Officer must      first prove      that a
        neglect has occurred and he must do so beyond reasonable doubt.                           The accused
        officer,      to negate the charge,               needs then only to show that he acted with
        good and sufficient cause,                but his standard of proof is on the balance of
        probability.


        Neglect falls into roughly two different departments - the first,                            where the
        officer clearly         fails or        refuses to    perform    a     particular    duty,    and    the
        second,      where he tries but,              through ineptitude,        fails to meet a required
        standard.           I think that it is common ground between us that in the former
        discipline is always appropriate, whether it be informal or formal, depending
        on the seriousness of the circumstances.                    The second is much more complex and
        is   always        subject   to   the    overriding       principle     that   if   an   officer    acts
        reasonably and in good faith,                  his actions will always be supported by the
        Commissioner.         It seems to us inappropriate that an officer should be charged
        with neglect when he is trying to perform a duty,                        albeit in an incompetent
        manner.        There may,         of    course,     be other charges more appropriate if he
        exceeds his authority for example.

Dear Sir

DISCIPLINARY ACTION HILLSBOROUGH - CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT DAVID DUCKENFIELD
SUPERINTENDENT BERNARD MURRAY

Enclosed are the Instructions which I discussed with Mr Payne on the
telephone last week. It will be noted that the instructions are not
complete as I am waiting for a further letter from the Chief Constable of
Cumbria which it is expected will aid Counsel in his consideration. However
the documentation which Is available will enable Mr Payne to give some
initial thought to the Issues and it will also ensure we can arrange the
earliest possible conference once this final piece of information is
available. Just by way of confirmation I will telephone to arrange a
conference with Mr Payne when the letter from the Chief Constable of Cumbria
is received.

Yours faithfully




Stephen Walker

Instructing Solicitor acts in this case for Assistant Chief Constable

Mr Graham Moore of the South Yorkshire Police and Counsel is instructed on

his behalf.   As Assistant Chief Constable he is the disciplinary authority

for officers below the rank of Assistant Chief Constable having been

delegated that responsibility by the Chief Constable (See enclosure 1 and

Regulation 15 in particular).




These instructions are concerned with possible disciplinary proceedings

arising out of the Hillsborough Disaster, many aspects of which Counsel is

already well acquainted.    The police officers concerned are Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray of the South Yorkshire

Force.




Arising out of the disaster a number of public complaints were made against

a number of police officers including Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and

Superintendent Murray.     The complainants and the nature of their complaints

are detailed in schedules A and B of the complaints file for Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and the Complaints against Police form, page 1

of the file relating to Superintendent Murray (see enclosure 2 for both

files).




Those complaints were referred to the Chief Constable of West Midlands for

investigation under the terms of the Police Discipline Regulations 1985

(the discipline regulations) (enclosure 1) and his investigation was

supervised by the Police Complaints Authority under the provisions of S89




                                      - 2 -
of the Police & Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE).




On the retirement of Mr Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of West Midlands the

papers were passed to Mr Leslie Sharp, Chief Constable of Cumbria, to

complete the investigation.   For ease of reference he is referred to as the

Investigating Officer and the Police Complaints Authority, the PCA.




It will interest Counsel to know that once the Investigating Officer was

appointed and the PCA decided to supervise the investigation, neither ACC

Mr Anderson nor any of his subordinates took any further part in the

investigation.   The files only came back to Mr Anderson after the

investigation had been completed to enable him to consider what if any

charges should be levelled against any officer this being his responsibility

under Regulation 8 of the discipline regulations.    More about this later.




Only the Complaints and Discipline files associated with the investigation

into the complaints have been supplied to Counsel and this is for the sake

of brevity.   Other files including all the statements taken from witnesses

and considered as part of that investigation are available if Counsel wishes

to see them but at this juncture it is not felt that they will add anything

to Counsel's consideration of the issues.




When an investigation is completed the disciplinary authority, in this case

ACC Mr Anderson, is required to complete a memorandum to the PCA in

accordance with the provisions of s90(5) of PACE.    The memoranda touching

upon the complaints against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and

Superintendent Murray are attached as enclosure 3 together with a letter

of explanation dated 28 March 1991 from ACC Mr Stuart Anderson to the PCA.




                                    -   3   -
It is perhaps noteworthy here to mention that the contents of the memoranda

are based solely upon the evidence contained in the Investigating Officer's

report.     In other words because of the serious public interest involved in

these matters Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Anderson did not see fit to

put any further gloss on what could then be said to be a totally independent

investigation and report.     Counsel will see from the Complaints & Discipline

files that the Investigating Officer's conclusion is that no disciplinary

offence is made out against either officer.




After the memoranda had been submitted to the PCA there then transpired

correspondence between the Authority and ACC Mr Suart Anderson (enclosure

6(d).     Ultimately the PCA wrote on 7 May disagreeing with the view that no

discipline proceedings were justified against Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield or Superintendent Murray.         In this letter they explain why they

come to this view and identify four charges of neglect of duty and one of

discreditable conduct against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and one charge

of neglect of duty against Superinendent Murray.        These charges are laid

down in the Discipline Code for police officers below the rank of Assistant

Chief Constable and which is Schedule 1 to the Discipline Regulations

(enclosure 1).     Counsel will note that the letter is couched in terms of

recommendations to ACC Mr Graham Moore, who has now succeeded ACC Mr

Anderson, under the provisions of s93(l) of PACE.        The letter also provides

the necessary degree of consultation under s93(3) so that if the disciplinary

authority is still unwilling to prefer charges the PCA can direct him to

do so.     It is as part of this consultation process that Counsel is

instructed.




ACC Moore's first response to the letter of 7 May was to ask the




                                      -   4   -
Investigating Officer for his views.       These have been provided in some detail

in the letter of 16 May (enclosure 6(b) and in which the Investigating

Officer justifies his conclusions contained in the two reports.       It will

be noted that he is to consider the PCA's letter further in consultation

with an officer of the West Midlands Force who was an integral part of the

complaints investigation and a further response is awaited from him.       Mr

Sharp’s letter in itself requires no additional comment from instructing

solicitor but it may be helpful to Counsel to say a few things by way of

addendum.




When instructing solicitor spoke to Counsel a few days ago about the issues

Counsel asked to see a copy of the Coroner's summing up in the inquests into

the 95 deaths at Hillsborough and this is enclosure 5 to these instructions.

The Investigating Officer's reports do not include particular evidence or

views expressed at the inquests but clearly what took place there is relevant

because it can and should be used in any discipline proceedings which are

brought against any officer.




As Counsel has already said much of what happened at the inquests helped

in no small way to redeem a balance which had hitherto weighed heavily in

criticism of the actions of some officers at Hillsborough, not least being

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray.       Counsel will

I am sure remember much of what was said by the Coroner about these two

officers but a number of comments made by him are worthy of particular

mention and emphasis in connection with the justification for disciplinary

charges recommended by the PCA.




What follows is extracts from the Coroner's summing up and the page




                                       -   5   -
references are to the transcript at enclosure 5-




Thursday 21 March 1991

               I



At this point in the transcript the Coroner is discussing breach of duty

as one of the three gates, as he puts it, which the jury must pass through

before they can even consider recklessness as a constituent of unlawful

killing.




At Paragraph D/E he says "In an emergency the fact that in the event a wrong

decision is taken need not constitute a breach of duty provided that a

decision was not unreasonably taken in the circumstances which prevailed

and taking all of the aspects into account.




Page 97



Here the Coroner discusses the principle of "finding own level" as a policy

for dealing with the distribution of fans on a terrace and the Coroner makes

the point that no-one criticised this as a policy.




Page 99



The Coroner refers to a number of supporters making the statement that in

a big match they expect to be crowded, they expect to be crushed, they




                                    -   6   -
expected to be uncomfortable and that it will sort itself out once kick off

has taken place.

At Paragraphs E/F "All you can do is put yourself as near as you can into

the shoes of the people who were there on 15 April and say given that

situation was that a reasonable thing to do?     Would a reasonably skilled

officer have done the same?   All the evidence would seem - not all but

virtually all the evidence would   seem to point to that       direction,that      the

decision to open the gates was a   reasonable one in the       circumstances."




Page 42




Here the Coroner is dealing with the time when pens 3 and 4 became

overcrowded and relates this to the opening of Gate C.     He says at paragraphs

B-D "I'll try to look through some of these witnesses whom we had and in

summary although quite a lot of witnesses describe discomfort at an earlier

stage than what I am now going to tell you, the vast majority of the

witnesses in that pen (pen 4) indicated that they did not become distressed

until the players came on to the   pitch or after and in       fact whileI am      on

that subject that is exactly the   same in pen 3-"




Page 44




The Coroner then went on to discuss the evidence of Robert Knowles who went




                                     -   7   -
into pen 4 with two boys after gaining entrance to the ground through gate

C.   He describes how pen 4 was full but he didn't think that was in itself

unusual.     Indeed he worked his way down to the front and right at the front

there was a gap near the fencing which he was able to walk along almost

unimpeded.    Then at Page 45 the Coroner remarks on Knowles' evidence that

he was perfectly satisfied with his position when the players were already

on the pitch.




Page 55




When dealing with the question of monitoring pens and appreciating serious

overcrowding, the Coroner says that the distressing situation did not occur

until the players came on to the pitch or later or from there onwards.     He

also deals here with a number of witnesses who were reasonably happy in pen

3 right up to kick off and probably beyond.




Page 58




The Coroner says "So you had some people who even within this pen (3) and

even relatively late in the day had not appreciated the enormity of the

situation which was developing in front of their very eyes."




Page 66/67




The Coroner deals with the evidence of Mr Wright who was positioned in the

corner of the North West terrace almost opposite the police control box.

In his evidence Mr Wright said that as the match was in play he looked at

the Leppings Lane terrace and said, "Wish I was there."    Mr Wright's evidence
was that he would have been quite    content to   gointo that crowd at thetime

that he assessed it.   The Coroner   also deals with evidence from others

outside the Leppings Lane terrace, all of whom could see nothing seriously

untoward until at least kick off time.




Page 71




The Coroner deals here with evidence of BBC commentator John Motson who did

not describe pens 3 and 4 as being overcrowded.




Page 108




There is evidence that "Chief Superintendent Mole had selected his support

team and had allocated supervisory men to the different parts of the stadium.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield had the understanding from Mr Mole and

others that the plan which he was    operating and the operational order which

he was following was one which had been used in    the past, which was in

standard form and which had not presented any difficulties."




Pages 108-129




It would be impossible for instructing solicitor to do justice to this

section of the transcript by being selective.     These pages should be read

in their totality as an expression of the Coroner's views on the actions

of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield as operational commander, leading up

to and during the day of 15 April.




So far these instructions have dealt with the evidence and the extent to
which it is sufficient to found any disciplinary action against Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield or Superintendent Murray.    However Counsel is

also asked to address the legal as opposed to pure evidential issues which

are in part broached by Mr Sharp in his letter of 16 May.    Is neglect of

duty co-terminus with a criminal offence of say culpable malfeasance such

that the decision of the DPP (enclosure 6(c)) not to prosecute for any

criminal offence is relevant in deciding whether a disciplinary charge is

justified.   It is acknowledged as the PCA says in their letter of 10 April

(enclosure 6(d)) that such a decision of the DPP does not preclude fresh

consideration by the PCA but its relevance appears axiomatic.    In this regard

Counsel is referred to the Home Office Guidance (enclosure 4).




Paragraph 9.22 makes it clear that the burden of proof is the same as in

a criminal matter but at paragraph 9.3 the guidance states that for many

disciplinary offences the mental element necessary for a finding of guilt

is less than that for most criminal offences.   This begs the question what

degree of mens rea is required to secure a finding of guilt for neglect of

duty.   The views of the Investigating Officer expressed on the second page

of his letter of 16 May (enclosure 6(b)) are noteworthy in this respect.




It also must be said that to the knowledge of instructing solicitor the

standing of the guidance has never been tested and it does on the face of

it appear illogical to require the same standard of proof as in criminal

trials and not require the same degree of mens rea.    Is mens rea anything

but an absolute standard.




These are all questions which Counsel is asked to address in conference for

the following purpose.   The import of these instructions is to secure




                                   -   10   -
Counsel's opinion on whether the charges recommended by the PCA are in

reality supportable.   ACC Mr Moore has of course no principle objection to

taking disciplinary action against either officer and it may be the PCA will

direct him to do so but there is clear concern that the PCA's recommendations

fly so dramatically in the face of the Investigating Officer's views.




If Counsel's opinion is that the PCA's views are supportable disciplinary

proceedings will be taken as recommended.          If however Counsel is of the

opinion that they are not supportable either in law or on the evidence it

is anticipated Counsel will be asked to prepare a written opinion which will

be submitted by ACC Mr Moore to the PCA as part of the consultation process

under S93(3) PACE.



It will be self evident that the instructions are not complete since further

correspondence from the Investigating Officer is awaited.          However, the

 documentation which is available will enable Counsel to give some initial

 thought to the issues and it will also ensure we can arrange the earliest

 possible conference once that final piece of information is available.

   To       Assistant Chief Constable (Complaints & Discipline P at© : 3 0 May 1991



            SUBJECT:       after the hillsborough investigation

            Further to our discussions today I felt it would be useful to set out
            intentions and circulate to all persons who have been involved in the
            various initiatives relating to the Hillsborough aftermath.

            If you are to be responsible for the Hillsborough material, with me doing
            the necessary work involved, it is important that all initiatives and
            decisions are made known to me that might effect the planning and
            implementation.  I would ask that this policy operates forthwith.

            I believe that there are different types of material involved as follows:-

            A.   Documents of the Dear Enquiry

            B.   Material supporting the Dear Enquiry

            C.   Property of the deceased

            D.   Property collected at the scene, identifiable and unidentifiable

            E.   Documents of the Wain Enquiry

            F.   Material supporting the Wain Enquiry

            I believe A, B, C and D material is indexed using the "West Midlands"
            computer and E and F material is indexed using the "South Yorkshire"
            computer.

            1.   With the co-operation of West Midlands Police the plan is to bring
                 material C and D to Hammerton Road, set it up in order, check it
                  and accept it. Target time is week commencing 3 June 1991 with
                  the work to be completed by 7 June 1991-

            2.   Transfer material E and F from Castle Green to Hammerton Road, set
                  it up in order, check it and accept it. This will require approval
                  decisions and appropriate hand over from the person presently
                  responsible for it. The timing of this needs to be decided by the
                  person currently controlling and accessing this material. Will
                  you please discuss this with DCC to resolve the unknowns.

            3.   Obtain the "West Midlands" machine and data and set up so that the
                  index is accessible from the VDU located in Complaints and
                  Discipline. This work is currently being dealt with by Computer
                  Section. Target time is now until 1 July 1991 when it should be
                  finalised.

            4.   Once 3 is finalised with the co-operation of West Midlands Police,
                  training of personnel in the use of the "West Midlands computer
                  to be carried out.  It is anticipated this will take 5 days and
                  the personnel involved would be Police Constable Greenaway and
                                   There may be staff implications in such a proposal
                  that need considering.


GEN/2
5.   Once 3 and 4 are finalised with the co-operation of West Midlands
      Police, material A and B will be brought to Hammerton Road, set
      up in order, checked and accepted. Target for this is week
      commencing 8 July 1991 with work to be completed by 12 July 1991-

6.   As soon as material is housed in Hammerton Road, from that date
      the alarm system protecting the area needs to operate. Suggest
      keyholder for this should be officer in charge FI Control Room with
      the actual key housed in glass front holder (as with armoury key).

Will you formally approve this plan please or indicate those areas that
need modification.   I will then circulate to interested parties and liaise
with West Midlands Police and others to secure implementation.

   Dear Sir

   HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY

   Following our conversation on Wednesday 15 May 1991 and ray subsequent
   discussion with your Assistant Chief Constable Mr Moore, I have now
   authorised the West Midlands Computer Group to transfer the data base to
   the Bull 6 + machine as soon as possible.

   Once your contract with Bull is finalised, the machine will be ready for
   transportation to Sheffield and once assembled you will have immediate
   access to the data base.  In order to assist in the training of your
   nominated H.O.L.M.E.S. officers. I have placed Detective Superintendent
   Cobb and W/Detective Constable         on standby to visit your Force for
   two days to do that training.  If the  move takes place quickly they can
   be available from Tuesday 28 May 1991.

   In addition, I have authorised the release of all documentation relative
   to the Hillsborough enquiry.   This is presently stored at Furnival House
   and Police Constable         from the Hillsborough team is in the process
   of liaising with your officers on that aspect.

   For your information, Captain E N Taylor, Police Complaints Authority,
   did contact me last Friday 17 May 1991» to confirm there was no
   objection to the release of the data base.

   There is no objection if your H.O.L.M.E.S. nominated officers wish to
   contact Detective Superintendent Cobb direct.  He can be found at one of
   two numbers: either!            ]or

   If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

   To   :   Acting Chief Superintendent Fell                  Date: 9 May 1991



            SUBJECT:       hillsborough enquiry


            Last week, whilst you were on annual leave, Superintendent Parker
            telephoned to inform you of some procedural matters involving the database
            of the Hillsborough Enquiry which is held on our HOLMES-BULL computer,
            at present being used by the West Midlands Police. He told me that as
            the above equipment was to be returned to be used for the World Student
            Games by our own Force, the Hillsborough database had been copied to
            tape (in the HADS format) and that it was proposed to clean the computer's
            own disks.

            The intention was to allow the computer equipment to be used during the
            World Student Games and for the taped Hillsborough database to be
            re-input afterwards to allow our Department to access it for any possible
            civil or disciplinary reason thereafter.

            I have to tell you that the proposed course of action may not, due to
            the problematic system involved with the tape-out/tape-in facility on
            HADS, be ever achieved.  I have, after speaking to Assistant Chief
            Constable Mr Anderson, spoken to Detective Inspector Perkins at the
            Nachells Incident Room                and asked her not to clean the
            disks. The tape(s) had been taken, but the disks not cleared when I
            spoke to her on 3 May 1991- She said she would consult her superiors
            and re-contact us to confirm that the disks would not be cleaned.

            If they do clean the disks for a variety of reasons, I know it would
            not be possible to re-input the Hillsborough database, not without
            considerable trouble and not without it taking a very long time
            (especially the freetext database).

                    t that some agreement be reached about alternative ways of ensuing
                    grity and security of the Hillsborough database otherwise than
                     that data from the disks.

         Dear Mr Hayes

         HILLSBOROUGH 1989

         In response to our recent telephone conversation on 10 May 1991 I write to
         say that I have now had the opportunity to study the copy of the Police
         Complaints Authority letter of 7 May 1991.
                   »
         I have set out, in this letter,      the detailed reasoning which lay behind the
         recommendations and conclusions      in my Complaints and Discipline reports in
         respect of Chief Superintendent      Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray.   In
         addition, I have made reference      to the points and issues raised by the PCA
         in its letter.

         It cannot be argued that the PCA is not bound by the decisions of the
         Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the criminal conduct issues
         because the PCA has to consider whether or not the complaints are
         substantiated and whether disciplinary charges should be laid. However, it
         could be argued that if the evidence required to prove a criminal offence
         is identical to the evidence required to prove a disciplinary offence, and
         the decision of   the DPP is that  there is insufficient evidence to provethe
         criminal offence, then it follows that there will be insufficient evidence
         to prove the disciplinary offence.

         The PCA is of     the view that the ancient criminal offence of "culpable
         malfeasance" is   not coterminous    with "neglect of duty". That is to saythe
         least, arguable.   Every malfeasance or culpable non-feasance of an officer
         of justice, which includes a police officer, in respect of his office, is a
         misdemeanour at Common Law.     The case-law arises predominently from very
         old cases which arose out of failure to do things required to be done
         because of the accused’s office, (see CROWTHER s CASE (1593) Cro. Eliz. 654
         and R v WYAT (1705) 1 Salk 380). The cases indicate there is an offence of
         a public officer wilfully neglecting to perform a duty which he is bound to
         perform by common law or statute but the neglect has to be wilful and not
         merely inadvertent.    It has to be culpable in the sense of being without


                                                    1
u
    reasonable excuse or justification.     In this sense culpability is not
    restricted to corruption or dishonesty but has to be of such a degree the
    misconduct impugned is calculated to injure the public interest. It would
    be for the jury to decide whether the evidence revealed the necessary
    degree of culpability in performing a duty badly which would include
    •neglect of duty". (R v DYTHAM (1979) 2QB 722).

    It does not appear to be necessary to prove that by so doing, or not doing,
    the accused intended to gain some personal benefit or advantage but it may
    be that in appropriate cases, e.g. a Registrar, there must be a beneficiary
    to whose interest there has been no proper regard.

    From that it can be argued that the offence of "culpable malfeasance"
    requires proof of a degree of negligence or recklessness which is closely
    akin to "neglect of duty".    It is my view that the mental element required
    to prove "culpable malfeasance" is the same as for the disciplinary offence
    of "neglect of duty*.       In view of the DPP’s decision in respect of
    "culpable malfeasance" it would be quite wrong, in my view, to pursue
    disciplinary charges of "neglect of duty", particularly as the Inquest Jury
    brought in a verdict of "Accidental Death". The Inquest jury’s verdict of
    "accident" taken together with the DPP’s decision not to prosecute for
    "culpable malfeasance" is a powerful argument, in my view, for not pursuing
    disciplinary charges of "Neglect of Duty". It would appear that the PCA
    has taken cognisance of the fact that each case should be considered on its
    merits and has decided that in all the circumstances it is "fair and
    appropriate" to bring disciplinary proceedings.        I find this view a
    difficult one to support but should such proceedings follow then it would
    probably be appropriate for any accused officer to be served with a copy of
    the DPP.’s letter of decision, after consultation with the DPP.

    There can be no argument about the definition of "neglect of duty" which is
    clearly set out in Schedule 1 of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.
    The definition, I suggest, is one which rules out any suggestion that it is
    one of the disciplinary offences where the mental element necessary for a
    finding of guilt is less than that for most criminal offences. The offence
    requires proof of neglect, and it is at least arguable that it is not
    sufficient merely to show that the act or omission was caused through a
    lack of due care.

    The PCA, in its letter at paragraph 4, makes it clear that its
    deliberations have been centred upon the core of the issue, that is to say
    the overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4, but in paragraph 7 of the PCA letter it
    is recognised that there were "complex circumstances which may have
    contributed to the tragedy".    My view is that the core issues are too
    complex a matter to say that the tragedy would not have occurred had
    sensible and simple steps been taken to secure the safety of spectators.
    (Para 4 of PCA letter).    Hindsight is not appropriate, foresight is the
    issue.

    The passage of time      since 15 April 1989, of itself,        is not an
    overwhelmingly persuasive issue, but taken with the decision of the DPP and
    the verdict of the Coroner’s Jury it is certainly very persuasive.

    Similarly, the earlier hearings before Lord Justice Taylor should not be
    conclusive either to prosecute discipline charges or to discredit them. It
    should not be forgotten that those hearings were not based upon sworn


                                         2
testimony, whereas the Coroner’s Verdict of accident, was.        Vhat the
transcripts of the Inquest reveal is a matter for you, as are the words of
the Coroner and his Jury. I wonder if the PCA have had the opportunity to
study these transcripts, particularly those of Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray.   Those transcripts of evidence are
over and above my Investigating Officer’s report which received the PCA’s
certificate of satisfaction before the Inquests were concluded.         The
evidence given at the Inquest was probed thoroughly by skilled lawyers
representing the complainants so they must be relevant to any consideration
as to discipline.

Neither would I dismiss     so lightly the   detrimental effect   that the
extensive,  and often contradictory media coverage has had on the
possibility of a fair hearing for any accused officers.    It is the chance
of a "fair trial" which is important, more so than the anguish of the
accused officers or the morale and well-being of South Yorkshire Police.

Now to address the specific disciplinary offences proposed against Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield.

(i)      Neglect of Duty in that he failed to acquaint himself with the
         planning and problems related to the control of the semi-final.

         The only clue in the PCA letter as to how this offence   could be
         proved is at paragraph 6(a):-

         "Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, as the officer in overall
         command, failed     to address himself properly to the problems
       . involved in, and the plans for, crowd control even before the
         spectators arrived."

        My report at paragrapahs R22 to RA7 covers the aspects of written
        instructions available to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield before
        the event.    Paragraphs RA8 to R58 cover what he actually did
        before the event. Although I have not studied the transcripts of
        evidence given at the Inquests, I am of the view that Chief
        Superintendent Duckenfield did enough in his planning, orders and
        briefings to satisfy the requirements of the South Yorkshire
        Police Standing Instructions.     Time was short;    he was newly
        promoted into an area where Hillsborough events were prominent;
        to a considerable degree he had no reason not to take the well-
        tried and overtly successful South Yorkshire Police System as he
        found it; he received the best possible advice and followed it;
        and he knew that on the day he would have a very experienced team
        working with him with reserve resources available to deal with
        unforeseen contingencies. It is difficult to see how the proposed
        disciplinary offence could be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

(ii)    Neglect of Duty by failing to monitor crowd numbers in Pens 3 and
        A.

        I can add nothing to paragraphs R91 to R98 of my report. Given the
        facilities available to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield on the
        day he did not, and could not monitor the crowd numbers in the
        fateful pens.   The issue is linked to the question of whether he
        should have done so, an issue addressed at some length in my


                                    3
          report, and to the South Yorkshire Police policy of the day that
          the crowd would find its own level.

 (iii)    Neglect of Duty by failing to act when Pens 3 and 4 were obviously
          overcrowded.

          Paragraphs R103 to Rill consider this matter and the crucial
          question is whether or not Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was
          aware that Pens 3 and 4 were seriously overcrowded, in time for
          him to take action to alleviate it.      My report discusses this
          issue at some length and raises the problems there would be in
          trying to prove such an assertion.    The overcrowding might well
          have been obvious to others, but that begs the question.

 (iv)     Neglect of Duty by failing to control the movement of supporters
          subsequent to the opening of Gate C.

          In support of this charge I would refer you to paragraphs R142 to
          R143 of my report. There can be no doubt that the opening of Gate
          C vas a life-saving act; that having opened Gate C, Chief
          Superintendent Duckenfield monitored the situation inside the
          stadium;   that other important matters were competing for his
          attention;  and I draw your attention to paragraphs R147 to R156
          of my report.     Paragraphs R157 to R178 contain the arguments
          setting out the difficulties of proving the charge.


In so far as Superintendent Murray is concerned the PCA is proposing only
one disciplinary charge

(v)      - Neglect of Duty by failing to control the movement of supporters
           subsequent to the opening of Gate C.

          In support of that charge the PCA points out that because of Chief
          Superintendent Duckenfield’s recent promotion and appointment,
          Superintendent Murray had a special responsibility to assist and
          advise Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, particularly in view of
          Superintendent   Murray’s    greater   experience    of   policing
          Hillsborough.

         It is not absolutely clear but the PCA seems to be suggesting that
         it was right that Superintendent Murray should act on the orders
         of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield to give directions for Gate C
         to be opened, but he should have gone further by virtue of his
         greater experience, and given orders for police officers to be
         deployed to receive those spectators who entered the ground
         through the open Gate C.

         It seems that     the PCA takes the view that either Chief
         Superintendent Duckenfield, or Superintendent Murray, or both of
         them should have controlled the movement of spectators subsequent
         to the opening of Gate C.

         The question of individual and subordinate responsibility is
         considered in my Complaints and Discipline Report in respect of
         Superintendent Murray at paragraphs Rll to R14.   The paragraphs


                                     4
             which relate to this particular disciplinary charge are at R.28 to
             R.36, but particularly R43 to R55 and paragraphs R43 to R55 and
             paragraphs RS6 to R58.

             It could be argued that either the point of view of Chief
             Superintendent Duckenfield is taken, i.e. that he had to rely on
             the officers in the command structure using their discretion to
             act to the situation as they saw fit, or he should have given
             specific orders himself. If that be so, then it seems quite wrong
             that two senior officers should face a disciplinary charge arising
             from the same failure to act.   The police structure of individual
             discretion, responsibility and accountability suggests that if any
             officer is to be disciplined for this offence, it ought to be one
             or the other.


Finally,  I turn      to   the   proposal       to   discipline   Chief   Superintendent
Duckenfield for:-

(vi)        Discreditable Conduct by acting in a manner likely to bring
             discredit on the reputation of the force or the police service.

             The PCA feels that it is clear Mr Kelly, Mr Kirtin and Mr Mackrell
             were told by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield that Gate C had been
             forced and that there had been an inrush of Liverpool supporters.
             The PCA accepts there was a need to deter hostile reaction which
             might have impeded the rescue work, but this did not require the
             telling of any falsehoods.
        »

              The PCA suggests that the misleading explanation given by Chief
            • Superintendent Duckenfield to the persons named above, resulted in
              serious allegations being made against Liverpool supporters in
              general causing grave offence and distress.

             Paragraph R233 of my report in respect of Chief Superintendent
             Duckenfield addresses the point, and the paragraphs that follow
             indicate some of the possible defences (NOT mitigation) which
             Chief Superintendent Duckenfield could raise should he be called
             to answer the disciplinary charge.

            I am not aware of what was said about the matter at the Inquests,
            if the matter was raised at all.   Also I would draw attention to
            my Complaints and Discipline Report in respect of Mr Valter
            JACKSON,  then an Assistant Chief Constable,       where similar
            questions are addressed at paragraphs R47 to R50.  In that report
            there is an explanation as to how a misunderstanding could have
            arisen (paragraphs R53 to R62).  The report on Mr Jackson is with
            the South Yorkshire Police Authority because of the rank held by
            Mr Jackson at the time.

             In my report on Chief Superintendent Duckenfield paragraphs R240
             to R244 discuss the question specifically.

In conclusion, may I say that the PCA letter points out that it is concerned
solely with the evidence in respect of the matters subject of complaint, and
not with mitigation.   Although the Inquest transcripts may bring to light


                                            5
matters not covered in m y Complaints and Discipline Reports, the problems of
proving the disciplinary offences proposed by the PCA are formidable.

I hope that this letter will assist you with your considerations. All of
the information contained therein is covered in the Complaints and
Discipline Reports already submitted to you.

I shall be considering the PCA letter further in consultation with Detective
Chief Superintendent FOSTER of West Midlands Police and I will contact you
again in the near future.

          Dear Mr Hayes

          HILLSBOROUGH 1989

          In response to our recent telephone conversation on 10 May 1991 I write to
          say that I have now had the opportunity to study the copy of the Police
          Complaints Authority letter of 7 May 1991.

          I have set out, in this letter,       the detailed reasoning which lay behind the
          recommendations and conclusions       in my Complaints and Discipline reports in
          respect of Chief Superintendent       Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray.   In
          addition, I have made reference       to the points and issues raised by the PCA
          in its letter.

          It cannot be argued that the PCA is not bound by the decisions of the
          Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the criminal conduct issues
          because the PCA has to consider whether or not the complaints are
          substantiated and whether disciplinary charges should be laid. However, it
          could be argued that if the evidence required to prove a criminal offence
          is identical to the evidence required to prove a disciplinary offence, and
          the decision of   the DPP is that   there is insufficient evidence to provethe
          criminal offence, then it follows that there will be insufficient evidence
          to prove the disciplinary offence.

          The PCA is of    the view that the ancient criminal offence of "culpable
          malfeasance” is not coterminous     with "neglect of duty". That is to saythe
          least, arguable.  Every malfeasance or culpable non-feasance of an officer
          of justice, which includes a police officer, in respect of his office, is a
          misdemeanour at Common Law.    The case-law arises predominently from very
          old cases which arose out of failure to do things required to be done
          because of the accused’s office, (see CROWTHER s CASE (1593) Cro. Eliz. 654
          and R v WYAT (1705) 1 Salk 380). The cases indicate there is an offence of
          a public officer wilfully neglecting to perform a duty which he is bound to
          perform by common law or statute but the neglect has to be wilful and not
          merely inadvertent.   It has to be culpable in the sense of being without
reasonable excuse or justification.     In this sense culpability is not
restricted to corruption or dishonesty but has to be of such a degree the
misconduct impugned is calculated to injure the public interest. It would
be for the jury to decide whether the evidence revealed the necessary
degree of culpability in performing a duty badly which would include
"neglect of duty". (R v DYTHAM (1979) 2QB 722).

It does not appear to be necessary to prove that by so doing, or not doing,
the accused intended to gain some personal benefit or advantage but it may
be that in appropriate cases, e.g. a Registrar, there must be a beneficiary
to whose interest there has been no proper regard.

From that it can be argued that the offence of "culpable malfeasance
requires proof of a degree of negligence or recklessness which is closely
akin to "neglect of duty". It is my view that the mental element required
to prove "culpable malfeasance" is the same as for the disciplinary offence
of "neglect of duty".       In view of the DPP’s decision in respect of
"culpable malfeasance" it would be quite wrong, in my view, to pursue
disciplinary charges of "neglect of duty", particularly as the Inquest Jury
brought in a verdict of "Accidental Death". The Inquest jury’s verdict of
"accident" taken together with the DPP’s decision not to prosecute for
"culpable malfeasance" is a powerful argument, in my view, for not pursuing
disciplinary charges of "Neglect of Duty". It would appear that the PCA
has taken cognisance of the fact that each case should be considered on its
merits and has decided that in all the circumstances it is "fair and
appropriate" to bring disciplinary proceedings.        I find this view a
difficult one to support but should such proceedings follow then it would
probably be appropriate for any accused officer to be served with a copy of
the DPP.’s letter of decision, after consultation with the DPP.

There cam be no argument about the definition of "neglect of duty" which is
clearly set out in Schedule 1 of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.
The definition, I suggest, is one which rules out any suggestion that it is
one of the disciplinary offences where the mental element necessary for a
finding of guilt is less than that for most criminal offences. The offence
requires proof of neglect, and it is at least arguable that it is not
sufficient merely to show that the act or omission was caused through a
lack of due care.

The PCA, in its letter at paragraph 4, makes it clear that its
deliberations have been centred upon the core of the issue, that is to say
the overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4, but in paragraph 7 of the PCA letter it
is recognised that there were "complex circumstances which may have
contributed to the tragedy".    My view is that the core issues are too
complex a matter to say that the tragedy would not have occurred had
sensible and simple steps been taken to secure the safety of spectators.
(Para 4 of PCA letter).    Hindsight is not appropriate, foresight is the
issue.

 The passage of time since 15 April 1989, of itself,             is no^
 overwhelmingly persuasive issue, but taken with the decision of the DPP an
 the verdict of the Coroner’s Jury it is certainly very persuasive.

 Similarly, the earlier hearings before Lord Justice Taylor should not be
 conclusive either to prosecute discipline charges or to discredit them. It
 should not be forgotten that those hearings were not based upon sworn


                                      2
testimony, whereas the Coroner’s Verdict of accident, was.        What the
transcripts of the Inquest reveal is a matter for you, as are the words of
the Coroner and his Jury. I wonder if the PCA have had the opportunity to
study these transcripts, particularly those of Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray.   Those transcripts of evidence are
over and above my Investigating Officer’s report which received the PCA’s
certificate of satisfaction before the Inquests were concluded.         The
evidence given at the Inquest was probed thoroughly by skilled lawyers
representing the complainants so they must be relevant to any consideration
as to discipline.

Neither would I dismiss so lightly the detrimental effect that the
extensive, and often contradictory media coverage has had on the
possibility of a fair hearing for any accused officers.    It is the chance
of a "fair trial" which is important, more so than the anguish of the
accused officers or the morale and well-being of South Yorkshire Police.

Now to address the specific disciplinary offences proposed against Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield.

(i)      Neglect of Duty in that he failed to acquaint himself with the
         planning and problems related to the control of the semi-final.

         The only clue in the PCA letter as to how this offence could be
         proved is at paragraph 6(a):-

         "Chief Superintendent  Duckenfield, as theofficer   in overall
         command, failed to address himself properly to the problems
       , involved in, and the  plans for, crowd control even before the
         spectators arrived."

         My report at paragrapahs R22 to R47 covers the aspects of written
         instructions available to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield before
         the event.    Paragraphs R48 to R58 cover what he actually did
         before the event. Although I have not studied the transcripts of
         evidence given at the Inquests, I am of the view that Chief
         Superintendent Duckenfield did enough in his planning, orders and
         briefings to satisfy     the requirements of the South Yorkshire
         Police Standing Instructions.    Time was short;     he was newly
         promoted into an area where Hillsborough events were prominent;
         to a considerable degree he had no reason not to take the well-
         tried and overtly successful South Yorkshire Police System as he
         found it; he received the best possible advice and followed it;
         and he knew that on the day he would have a very experienced team
         working with him with reserve resources available to deal with
         unforeseen contingencies. It is difficult to see how the proposed
         disciplinary offence could be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

(ii)     Neglect of Duty by failing to monitor crowd numbers in Pens 3 and
         4.

         I can add nothing to paragraphs R91 to R98 of my report. Given the
         facilities available to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield on the
         day he did not, and could not monitor the crowd numbers in the
         fateful pens.   The issue is linked to the question of whether he
         should have done so, an issue addressed at some length in my


                                     3
          report, and to the South Yorkshire Police policy of the day that
          the crowd would find its own level.

 (iii)   Neglect of Duty by failing to act when Pens 3 and 4 were obviously
         overcrowded.

         Paragraphs R103 to Rill consider this matter and the crucial
         question is whether or not Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was
         aware that Pens 3 and 4 were seriously overcrowded, in time for
         him to take action to alleviate it.      Hy report discusses this
         issue at some length and raises the problems there would be in
         trying to prove such an assertion.    The overcrowding might well
         have been obvious to others, but that begs the question.

 (iv)     Neglect of Duty by failing to control the movement of supporters
          subsequent to the opening of Gate C.

          In support of this charge I would refer you to paragraphs R142 to
          R143 of my report. There can be no doubt that the opening of Gate
          C was a life-saving act; that having opened Gate C, Chief
          Superintendent Duckenfield monitored the situation inside the
          stadium;   that other important matters were competing for his
          attention;  and I draw your attention to paragraphs R147 to R156
          of my report.     Paragraphs R157 to R178 contain the arguments
          setting out the difficulties of proving the charge.


In so far as Superintendent Murray is concerned the PCA is proposing only
one disciplinary charge:-

(v)      - Neglect of Duty by failing to control the movement of supporters
           subsequent to the opening of Gate C.

          In support of that charge the PCA points out that because of Chief
          Superintendent Duckenfield*s recent promotion and appointment,
          Superintendent Murray had a special responsibility to assist and
          advise Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, particularly in view of
          Superintendent   Murray’s    greater   experience    of   policing
          Hillsborough.

          It is not absolutely clear but the PCA seems to be suggesting that
          it was right that Superintendent Murray should act on the orders
          of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield to give directions for Gate C
          to be opened, but he should have gone further by virtue of his
          greater experience, and given orders for police officers to be
          deployed to receive those spectators who entered the ground
          through the open Gate C.

          It seems that the PCA takes the view that either Chief
          Superintendent Duckenfield, or Superintendent Murray, or both of
          them should have controlled the movement of spectators subsequent
          to the opening of Gate C.

          The question of individual and subordinate responsibility is
          considered in my Complaints and Discipline Report in respect of
          Superintendent Murray at paragraphs Rll to R14.   The paragraphs
         which relate to this particular disciplinary charge are at R.28 to
         R.36, but particularly R43 to R55 and paragraphs R43 to R55 and
         paragraphs R56 to R58.

         It could be argued that either the point of view of Chief
         Superintendent Duckenfield is taken, i.e. that he had to rely on
         the officers in the command structure using their discretion to
         act to the situation as they saw fit, or he should have given
         specific orders himself. If that be so, then it seems quite wrong
         that two senior officers should face a disciplinary charge arising
         from the same failure to act. The police structure of individual
         discretion, responsibility and accountability suggests that if any
         officer is to be disciplined for this offence, it ought to be one
         or the other.


Finally, I turn     to   the   proposal   to   discipline   Chief   Superintendent
Duckenfield for:-

(vi)     Discreditable Conduct by acting in a manner likely to bring
          discredit on the reputation of the force or the police service.

         The PCA feels that it is clear Mr Kelly, Mr Kirtin and Mr Mackrell
         were told by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield that Gate C had been
         forced and that there had been an inrush of Liverpool supporters.
         The PCA accepts there was a need to deter hostile reaction which
         might have impeded the rescue work, but this did not require the
         telling of any falsehoods.

          The PCA suggests that the misleading explanation given by Chief
        . Superintendent Duckenfield to the persons named above, resulted in
          serious allegations being made against Liverpool supporters in
          general causing grave offence and distress.

          Paragraph R233 of my report in respect of Chief Superintendent
          Duckenfield addresses the point, and the paragraphs that follow
          indicate some of the possible defences (NOT mitigation) which
          Chief Superintendent Duckenfield could raise should he be called
          to answer the disciplinary charge.

          I am not aware of what was said about the matter at the Inquests,
          if the matter was raised at all. Also I would draw attention to
          my Complaints and Discipline Report in respect of Mr Walter
          JACKSON,  then an Assistant Chief Constable,       where similar
          questions are addressed at paragraphs R47 to R50.  In that report
          there is an explanation as to how a misunderstanding could have
          arisen (paragraphs R53 to R62).  The report on Mr Jackson is with
          the South Yorkshire Police Authority because of the rank held by
          Mr Jackson at the time.

          In my report on Chief Superintendent Duckenfield paragraphs R240
          to R244 discuss the question specifically.

In conclusion, may I say that the PCA letter points out that it is concerned
solely with the evidence in respect of the matters subject of complaint, and
not with mitigation.   Although the Inquest transcripts may bring to light

HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY 15 APRIL I989

Thank you for your letter of 7 May 1991 detailing your recommendations in
accordance with Section 93(1) Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 for
disciplinary charges being preferred against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
and Superintendent Murray arising out of the Hillsborough Tragedy.

You will be aware that I have only recently taken up this appointment   and
of necessity it will take some time for me to familiarise myself with   the
content of Mr Sharp's report.  In the meantime I have asked him if he   would
supply detailed reasons amplifying the recommendations of his report
concerning Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray    as a
result of your letter.

As discussed by telephone today I confirm our agreement that Mr Hayes, the
Deputy Chief Constable^is to tell all of the officers subject of the
investigation report that a letter has been received from the Authority, that
no final decision as to any disciplinary outcome has been taken and that there
is active discussion on these matters taking place between the Force and the
Authority.

I am anxious that these matters should be resolved with the minimum delay
and to that end will respond more fully as soon as possible.

HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY 15 APRIL I989

Thank you for your letter of 7 May 1991 detailing your recommendations in
accordance with Section 93(1) Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 for
disciplinary charges being preferred against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
and Superintendent Murray arising out of the Hillsborough Tragedy.

You will be aware that I have only recently taken up this appointment         and
of necessity it will take some time for me to familiarise myself with         the
content of Mr Sharp's report. In the meantime I have asked him if he          would
supply detailed reasons amplifying the recommendations of his report
concerning Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray         as a
result of your letter.

As discussed by telephone today I confirm our agreement that Mr Hayes, the
Deputy Chief Constable^is to tell all of the officers subject of the
investigation report that a letter has been received from the Authority, that
no final decision as to any disciplinary outcome has been taken and that there
is active discussion on these matters taking place between the Force and the
Authority.

I am anxious that these matters should be resolved with the minimum delay
and to that end will respond more fully as soon as possible.

                                      HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY
                                           15 APRIL, 1989
 1. The Authority have now com pleted a careful and detailed examination o f the report
 and the evidence relating to the individual complaints arising from the Hillsborough
 tragedy on 15 April, 1989. We have considered Mr Anderson's memoranda, submitted to
 us in accordance with the provisions of Section 90(5) of the Police and Criminal
 Evidence A ct, 1984, and his letter o f 10 April, 1991.   We have noted your force's
 proposals not to prefer disciplinary charges against any of the officers who are the
 subject o f complaint and your reasons for these proposals.   However, as I told Mr
 Anderson on the telephone, the Authority were disappointed that he did not explain
 your reasons more fully. We have also taken into account the views expressed by Mr
 Sharp, the investigating o fficer.

 2. Having considered the evidence relating to the complaints against Police Constable
 Smith, Police Constable Illingworth, Superintendent Marshall or Superintendent Green­
 wood we have concluded that the evidence in respect o f these four officers does not
 justify disciplinary proceedings and w e agree with your proposal.

 3.   We have also considered those complaints which have been laid against Chief
 Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray which allege that they were in
 'neglect of duty'. These complaints raise difficult issues. In reaching our conclusions
 we have borne in mind the decisions o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions as one
 factor amongst others. As you are aware we do not a ccep t that culpable m isfeasance
 and n eglect o f duty are coterminous nor that, even if they were, we would be bound (as
 far as discipline is concerned) by the decision o f the Director not to bring criminal
 prosecutions. We have, throughout, borne in mind the definition o f neglect o f duty set
 out in paragraph k o f Schedule 1 of The Police (Discipline) Regulations, 1985.
k.  The incident which gave rise to the tragedy at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15
April, 1989 would not have occurred had sensible and simple steps been taken to secure
the safety o f spectators in Pens 3 and k on the Leppings Lane Terraces. It is clear
that the basic cause o f the disaster was overcrowding in these pens.        We have
concentrated on this matter.

5. In reaching our decisions w e have taken into account various m atters which can be
advanced as arguments for taking no disciplinary action on the grounds that to take
such action would be unfair and/or oppressive. Amongst such m atters we refer briefly
to the following:

           a.   the passage o f time since 15 April, 1989;

           b. the various consequences arising from the earlier hearings
           before Lord Justice Taylor and the Coroner;

           c. the e f f e c t of the extensive media coverage o f the incident
           itself, m atters associated with it and the hearings referred to in
           b. above;

           d. the perception that if any officer is charged he may be seen
           as a scapegoat carrying the blame for the acts or omissions of
           others;

           e. the recent promotion o f Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
           the fa ct that he took over the match arrangements devised by
           so m e o n e e l s e and his b e li e f th a t th e plan had o p e r a te d
           successfully before;

           f. the anguish which both Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
           Superintendent Murray must have experienced as the result o f the
           tragic and unexpected events on 15 April, 1989, and

           g. the e f f e c t that disciplinary action against any officer would
           have on the morale and well-being o f the South              Yorkshire
           Police.

6. Despite these factors it cannot be denied that the police, under the control o f Chief
Superindent Duckenfield, assisted by Superintendent Murray, were de fa cto in control of
the ground at the relevant tim e and had responsibility for the sa fety of the spectators.
In the opinion o f this Authority there is sufficient evidence to support disciplinary
charges on the following grounds:

           a. Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, as the o fficer in overall
           command, failed to address himself properly to the problems
           involved in, and the plans for, crowd control even before the
           spectators arrived;

           b. failed to monitor the numbers o f spectators entering Pens 3
           and 4;
           c. failed to take any action when Pens 3 and 4 became obviously
           overcrowded;

           d.   a u th o r ised G ate 'C' to be o p en ed and, to g e t h e r w ith
           Superintendent Murray, failed to take any steps to control the
           movement o f those who entered the ground through this gate at a
           time when it was, or should have been, clear to both o f them
           that Pens 3 and 4 were, or were likely to becom e, overcrowded.

7. In the view of this Authority responsibility for the sa fety o f those in Pens 3 and 4
and blame for overcrowding in those pens should rest with those in the Police Control
Box from which the pens could be observed, the deployment o f police manpower could
be directed and the decision to open Gate 'C' was made with its attendant responsibil­
ity for controlling those who entered through it. The Authority are conscious of the
complex circum stances which may have contributed to the tragedy, but we do not
accep t that the fa ct that there may be others who are also in some way blameworthy,
should cause us to decide against the recommendation o f charges under the Regulations
if, as here, the evidence is available to support such charges. You will appreciate the
Authority are concerned solely with the evidence in respect o f the m atters which are
the subject o f complaint and not with mitigation which would only becom e relevant if a
breach o f discipline were to be proved against an o fficer who is the subject of a
charge.

8. For these reasons that the Authority have decided to recommend under Section
93(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence A ct 1984 that the following charges be
brought against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield:

           i* N eg lect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1 of
           the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
           acquaint himself with the planning and problems related to the
           control o f the sem i-final.

           ii* N eg lect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1 of
           the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
           monitor crowd numbers in Pens 3 and 4.

           iii* N eglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1
           of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
           act when Pens 3 and 4 were obviously overcrowded.

           iv. N eglect o f Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1
           of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
           control the m ovement o f supporters subsequent to the opening of
           Gate 'C'.

9. We have given separate attention to the degree of responsibility attributable to
Superindent Murray. We concluded that in view o f Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's
very recent appointment and promotion to his position as Divisional Commander,
Superintendent Murray had a special responsibility to assist and advise Chief Super­
intendent Duckenfield particularly in view o f Superintendent Murray's greater exper­
ience o f policing at Hillsborough. He was aware that authority had been given to open
Gate 'C'.
10. We therefore recommend under Section 93(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984 that Superintendent Murray also be charged with:

            N eglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) o f Schedule 1 of the
            Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to control
            the movement o f supporters subsequent to the opening o f Gate
            'C'.

11.    We have also carefully considered the allegation that Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield was deceitful and misled senior police officers and members o f the public.
We do not agree with the investigating officer's conclusions that this matter is not
substantiated. It is clear that Mr Kelly, Mr Kirtin and Mr Mackrell were told by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield that Gate 'C' had been forced, and that there had been an
in-rush o f Liverpool supporters. While we are aware that he did not wish to encourage
a hostile reaction which might impede rescue work we share the opinion o f Lord Justice
Taylor that this did not require anyone being told a falsehood.         This misleading
explanation led to serious allegations being made against Liverpool supporters in general
causing grave o ffen ce and distress.

12 We have, therefore, decided to recommend under Section 93(1) of the Police and
Criminal Evidence A ct 1984 that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield also be charged
with:

            Discreditable Conduct - contrary to paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of
            the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he acted in a
            manner likely to bring discredit on the reputation of the force or
            the police service.

13.   I would be grateful for your response to our recommendations as soon as possible.

14. If you accept the Authority's recommendations we shall be minded, in view of the
exceptional circum stances affectin g this case, to direct that the charges are heard by a
tribunal, in accordance with Section 94(2) o f the Police and Criminal Evidence A ct
1984.

15.   I would particularly request that you maintain the confidentiality^* o f this
correspondence until such tim e as the procedures laid down in the Act for determining
the disciplinary charges to be preferred have been com pleted. This will involve not
informing those against whom we are agreed that no charges should be preferred until
the whole m atter has been resolved between us.

Dear Brigadier Pownall

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

As you are aware I, amongst oth ers, have f i l e d complaints against Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield (and other         O ff ic er s) regarding events
surrounding the above d i s a s t e r .

I am well aware tha t the Chief Constable's recommendations for
d i s c i p l i n e have been forwarded to y o u r s e l f for consideration and an
announcement regarding your approval or otherwise i s expected soon.

You w i l l understand my concern when "previously r e l i a b l e sources" inform
me that arrangements for Mr Duckenfield in p a r t i c u l a r , are already
"agreed" and d e t a i l e d planning for implementation i s in hand.

My d is g us t at th es e in t e n t io n s i s only exceeded by the thought tha t the
i m p a r t ia li ty of the P o l ic e Complaints Authority and       indeed the whole
d i s c i p l i n e procedure, must be questioned i f th e s e leaks are to be
be li e v e d . Events over the past two years have taught me that rumour and
specu lation i s the currency of the media and local p o l i t i c s and I t r u s t
you w i l l accept t h i s l e t t e r i s not merely over rea cti on to j u s t another
"bit of gossip".

I w r it e to seek your immediate assurance that the P o l ic e Complaints
Authority w i l l make a t o t a l l y impartial assessment of the circumstances
including the evidence to the Taylor Enquiry and not be unduly swayed by
the recent Inquest v e r d i c t .       Even Dr Popper emphasised during his
summing up th at an "accidental death" v e r d ic t did not mean no one was to
blame or indeed that nothing had gone wrong.
Apart from the many other matters that can be c a l l e d in to question Mr
Duckenfield i s a s e l f confessed " t e l l e r of untruths".  While accepting
Mr Duckenfield should not be made a scapegoat t o s a t i s f y my or public
opinion I must s t r e s s t h i s alone bars him from return to p o l i c e s e r v i c e .
His re-instatement would damage the P o l i c e S e r v ic e 's (not only South
Yorkshire) reputation for honesty and i n t e g r i t y beyondcomprehension.

P o l ic e Complaints Authority Annual Reports have already commented on the
i n j u s t i c e that has been apparent when the "escape route" of earl y or i l l
health retirement has been made av a il a b le to Senior O ff ic ers fac ing
d i s c i p l i n a r y matters. I t r u s t you w il l a ls o maintain your p o s it io n and
ensure t h i s method i s not employed in t h i s ins ta n ce .

I appreciate that t h i s           l e t t e r could be contrived as an attempt to
in f lu e n c e your basic d e c is io n and while I am sure you w i l l not allow
t h i s , I have taken the l i b e r t y of sending a copy to the Chief Constable
of South Yorkshire to ensure no such a l l e g a t i o n can stand scr ut iny .

I await your comments and/or response and remain.

Dear

My police career terminates on the 5 May 1991 when I retire after almost 35
years police service and nothing has occupied my mind and that of many others
more since the 15 April 1989 than the Hillsborough Enquiry.  It has always been
my wish, as Disciplinary Authority for the South Yorkshire Police, and that
of the former Chief Constable Peter Wright that the events of that afternoon
be looked at externally and quite independently without any suggestion of
influence by the management of the force.

You will recall our meeting on the 18 October 1990 when I expressed those
principles quite firmly.   In my letter to you dated 28 March 1991 I outlined
how my recommendations contained on the memoranda were based solely on the PCA
supervised investigation report completed by Mr Leslie Sharp. My reason for
not proposing Disciplinary proceedings is that the evidence is insufficient
but I would not seek   to influence the decision of the PCA (Discipline) nor,
I believe, would theworld at large wish me to do so.     I think that is a most
vital consideration.

What I have done is submit a precise unbiased recommendation in each case.
I am sorry you feel that I have dealt with this matter summarily, that certainly
was not my intention, nor do I feel I have done so. My submissions were within
the spirit of Section 90(5) and I cannot believe that anything I might add to
what I have already said would affect your reasoning or decision.

However, if you feel that we might pursue this matter further by meeting, let
us do so promptly so  as to   minimise any further delay, a point again made on
the 18 October 1990.    I do  wish to be as helpful as Ican, so do not hesitate
to contact me at any time.

Yours

     On 2Sth March you sent us the memoranda in respect of the individual complaints
     relating to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.

     As I told you on the telephone I was disappointed that you had not set out more fully
     the reasons why you do not propose to prefer disciplinary charges against the o llic e r s
     complained about in accordance with Section 90(5) of the Police and Criminal Evidcncc
     A ct 1984. It seem s to/J^ su rp risin g that in a case o f such importance you have dealt
     with the m atter so summarily.

     You point out that         the Director o f Public Prosecutions has considered the possible
     criminal o ffen ce of     culpablc m alfeasance, and has indicated that there is insufficient
     evidence to warrant       criminal proceedings. You say that, sim ilarly there is insufficient
     evidence to warrant       disciplinary charges. J would make two points:

                  a. the disciplinary o ffen ce of n cglect o f duty is different from
                  that o f the very rare o ffen ce oi' culpable m alfeasance.        ^

                  b. the case o f Rhone and Madden makes it clear that a decision'll
                  by the Director o f Public Prosecutions not to prosecutc a policc
                  o f f i c e r who is the subject of complaint did not relieve the Board j
                  [as it then was] of the duty to make their own decision as to ;
                  whether disciplinary charges should be brought, although they were
                  entitled to have regard to the D irector's decision.          This same
                  point is made at paragraph .‘>.16 in Horne O ffice Guidance to Chief
                  O fficers on Complaints and Discipline Procedures.

It appears that you have not appreciated the discretion w e /h a v e in such cases. We
have an extrem ely difficult decision to make andjradjhojjeg for a more iully reasoned
explanation!

          a,    as to why you co n sid er th e e v id e n c e fa lls      sh o r t, and

          b. why no disciplinary charges should be prcf e r r e d , / W w e conclude
          that there is sufficient evidence to stand a reasonable chancc of
          proving the case at a disciplinary hearing.

I would therefore be grateful for^vour more detailed views on these matters. I am sure
you realise that the(ednsequencesjbf an incident such as Hillsborough cannot be ^treated
lightly.

      On 28th March you sent us the memoranda in respect of the individual complaints
      relating to the Hillsborough Stadiiiim disaster.

      As I told you on the telephone I was disappointed that you had not s e t out o w e felly

      complained about in accordance With Section 90(5) of the Police and Criminal Evidence
      A ct 1984. It seem s to us surprising that in a case o f such importance you have dealt
      with the m atter so summarily.

      You point out that            the Director o f Public Prosecutions has considered the possible
      criminal o ffen ce o f       culpable m alfeasance, and has indicated that there is insufficient
      evidence to warrant          criminal proceedings. You say that, similarly there is insufficient
      evidence to warrant          disciplinary charges. I would make tw o points:

                    a. the disciplinary o ffen ce o f n eglect o f duty is different from
                    that o f the very rare offen ce of culpable m alfeasance.

                    b. the case o f Rhone and Madden makes it clear that a detrisioh                           '
                    by the Director o f Public Prosecutions not to prosecute a police

It appears that you have not appreciated the discretion we have in such cases. We
have an extrem ely difficult decision to make and had hoped for a more fully reasoned
explanation:

          a.   as t o why you co n sid er th e e v id e n c e   f a ll s   sh o r t, and

          b. why no disciplinary charges should be preferred, if we conclude
          that there is su fficient evidence to stand a reasonable chance o f
          proving the case at a disciplinary hearing.

I would therefore be grateful for your more detailed view s on these m atters. I am sure
you realise that the consequences o f an incident such as Hillsborough cannot be treated
lightly.

Dear

My police career terminates on the 5 May 1991 when I retire after almost 35
years police service and nothing has occupied my mind and that of many others
more since the 15 April 1989 than the Hillsborough Enquiry.  It has always been
my wish, as Disciplinary Authority for the South Yorkshire Police, and that
of the former Chief Constable Peter Wright that the events of that afternoon
be looked at externally and quite independently without any suggestion of
influence by the management of the force.

You will recall our meeting on the 18 October 1990 when I expressed those
principles quite firmly. In my letter to you dated 28 March 1991 I outlined
how my recommendations contained on the memoranda were based solely on the PCA
supervised investigation report completed by Mr Leslie Sharp. My reason for
not proposing Disciplinary proceedings is that the evidence is insufficient
but I would not seek to influence the decision of the PCA (Discipline) nor,
I believe, would the world at large wish me to do so. I think that is a most
vital consideration.

What I have done is submit a precise unbiased recommendation in each case.
I am sorry you feel that I have dealt with this matter summarily, that certainly
was not my intention, nor do I feel I have done so. My submissions were within
the spirit of Section 90(5) and I cannot believe that anything I might add to
what I have already said would affect your reasoning or decision.

However, if you feel that we might pursue this matter further by meeting, let
us do so promptly so as to minimise any further delay, a point again made on
the 18 October 1990. I do wish to be as helpful as I can, so do not hesitate
to contact me at any time.

Yours

Dear

You will recall at our M e t i n g In London on 18 October 1990, when you, Gerry
Gillaan, Jane Hell1car and Colin Daulby were preaent we diacueaed the progreaa
of the Hillsboroufh file. Again, you will recall It was agreed that a very
early decision, within 48 hours, would be made following the submission by
myself of the relevant paper*.

Despite the loss to the Authority of (Jerry Glllaan, I am pleased that you were
abla to confir*, in our telephone conversation on Monday 25 March, that you
will endeavour to reach a decision with regard to the poaslblllty of
 disciplinary offences at the earliest possible tine. Indeed, your intention
 to ala for Friday 5 April la such welcoaed and if you can c o m to a decision
 prior to that date this would be even more helpful.

 I can inform you that the Inqueat came to an end today at 12.15 P®.      the
 Jury returned verdicts of accidental death in respect of each deceased. I
 conclude from that deciaion that no further evidence waa forthcoming which
 ■erlts a referral back to Mr Lealie Sharp, the investigating officer, for the
 collection of additional material, statements etc, to support criminal
 proceedings.

 The memoranda I encloae with this letter are baaed aolely upon the evidence
 preaented to m in the report of the aupervlaed investigation undertaken by
 Mr Lealie Sharp, the Chief Constable of Cumbria. You will aee that I have
 concluded that no diaclplinary action ia appropriate in reapect of any of the
 complainta against the six officers.

 I suspect that both the result of the Inquest and any decision that the PCA
 make will attract media attention, but, in accordance with your atatement on
 18 October 1990, I underatand that you will not take part in any television
 programme or press conference. You aaid you will only write to the complalnanta
 and prepare a statement for the media, aendlng ua coplea for our peruaal prior
 to release. An embargo will be placed on your preaa statement eo that there
 will be t i M for the officers to be informed before it becomea available to
 the media. These arrangements are very much appreciated and I thank you for
  them.

You will recall at our seating in London on 18 October 1990, when you, Gerry
Giliman, Jane Hellicar and Colin Daulby were present we discussed the progress
of the Hillsborough file. Again, you will recall it was agreed that a very
early decision, within 48 hours, would be made following the submission by
myself of the relevant papers.

Despite the loss to the Authority of (Jerry Gillman, I m pleased that you were
able to confirm, in our telephone conversation on Monday 25 March, that you
will endeavour to reach a decision with regard to the possibility of
disciplinary offencss at the earliest possible tine. Indeed, your intention
 to aim for Friday 5 April Is much welcomed and if you can come to a decision
 prior to that date this would be even more helpful.

I can inform you that the Inquest came to an end today at 12.15 pm, when the
Jury returned verdicts of accidental death in respect of each deceased. I
conclude from that decision that no further evidence was forthcoming which
merits a referral back to Mr Leslie Sharp, the investigating officer, for the
collection of additional material, statements etc, to support criminal
proceedings.

The memoranda I enclose with this letter are based solely upon the evidence
presented to me in the report of the supervised investigation undertaken by
Mr Leslie Sharp, the Chief Constable of Cumbria. You will see that I have
concluded that no disciplinary action Is appropriate in respect of any of the
complaints against the six officers.

I suspect that both the result of the Inquest and any decision that the PCA
make will attract media attention, but, in accordance with your statement on
18 October 1990, I understand that you will not take part in any television
programme or press conference. You said you will only write to the complainants
and prepare a statement for the media, sending us copies for our perusal prior
to release. An embargo will be placed on your press statement so that there
will be time for the officers to be informed before it becomes available to

 Mr Leslie Sharp, the Chief Constable of Cumbria. You will see that I have
 concluded that no disciplinary action is appropriate in respect of any of the
 coaplaint* against the six officers.

 I suspect that both the result of the Inquest and any decision that the PCA
 Bake will attract aedla attention, but, in accordance with your stateaent on
 18 October 1990, I understand that you will not take part in any television
 progranse or press conference. You said you will only write to the coaplainants
 and prepare a statement for the aedia, sending us copies for our perusal prior
 to release. An embargo will be placed on your press stateaent so that there
 will be tiae for the officers to be informed before it becomes available to
 the media. These arrangeaents are very auch appreciated and I thank you for
 thea.

    NOTES ON MEETING AT PCA ON 18.10.90

    Present

    PCA           Brigadier Pownall
                  Gerry Gillman
                   Jane Hellicar
                   Colin Daulby

    SYP           ACC Mr Anderson
                  A/Chief Supt Fell
                  A/Supt Drabble


     1.   After discussing at length   it was agreed that no decision could
          properly be made until the   conclusion of theinquests as  fresh
          evidence may come out.

     2.   It is intended that the decision on discipline should quickly
          follow the result unless substantial new evidence is given
          revealing possible criminal or discipline matters which have not
          already been encompassed by the investigation to date.

     3.   If that does happen the way forward will be for the investigating
          officer to consult with Noel Taylor as to whether further
          investigation is necessary in which case the decision would have
          to be delayed until any further report had been considered.

     4.   If no further investigation is required, we will do the necessary
          memos to the PCA immediately the result is known to enable them
          to swiftly reach their decision.

     5. To this end we and the PCA will read the file     so as to be prepared
         to react quickly as at (4).

     6. Consultation between us and the PCA will continue whilst the file
         is being read in the hope that the positions both adopt eventually
         are not too uncomfortable for each other.

     7. When the PCA have reached a decision they will do a full press
         release, write to the complainants, inform us and send us a copy
         prior to the release so the officers can be informed but with
         details embargoed until their statement is made.

     8.   PCA indicate that they will not hold a press conference or take
          part in television discussion programmes.

     9.   In the event of the decision being made that disciplinary action
          would ensue we would probably go for a tribunal because of the
          outstanding public interest.

    10. In the event of discipline the PCA will say virtually nothing
         to the press until the proceedings are complete.




                                       _   1 _
11.   The Brigadier expressed concern that the Coroner may request an
      early decision to free the officers from jeopardy so that they
      could be called to give evidence.

12.   Meeting concluded that even if such a decision was made it was
      unlikely that the officers’ legal advisers would allow them to
      give evidence as they would still be in jeopardy from
      (a) a private prosecution or (b) a verdict of unlawful killing.

13.   ACC informed meeting that the 'Jackson' file could cause problems
      if the Police Authority members, when they receive the report,
      were to disclose its contents to the media or other interested
      parties and that this could create difficulties when considering
      action against the other 6 officers.

14.   It was suggested that Mr Gillman might like to discuss this
      problem with Stephen Walker.   PCA felt they could not do so and
      ACC indicated he would.

15.   ACC emphasised that SYP wished that all our actions should
       indicate and demonstrate to the public our desire to ensure that
      a proper decision had been reached on the question of either
       criminal or disciplinary process and that we would do all in our
      power to facilitate such decision making.

    Dear

    You will recall at our meeting in London cm 18 October 1990, when you, Gerry
    Gil1m an, Jane Hellicar and Colin Daulby were present we discussed the progress
    of the Hillsborough file. Again, you will recall it was agreed that a very
    early decision, within 48 hours, would be made following the submission by
    myself of the relevant papers.

    Despite the loss to the Authority of Gerry Gillaan, I m pleased that you were
    able to confirm, in our telephone conversation on Monday 25 March, that you
    will endeavour to reach a decision with regard to the possibility of
     disciplinary offences at the earliest possible time. Indeed, your intention
     to aim for Friday 5 April is much welcomed and if you can come to a decision
     prior to that date this would be even more helpful.

     I can inform you that the Inquest came to an end today at 12.15 P®, **jen
     jury returned verdicts of accidental death in respect of each deceased. I
     conclude from that decision that no further evidence was forthcoming which
     merits a referral back to Mr Leslie Sharp, the investigating officer, for the
     collection of additional material, statements etc, to support criminal
     proceedings.

     The memoranda I enclose with this letter are based solely upon the evidence
     presented to me in the report of the supervised investigation undertaken by
     Mr Leslie Sharp, the Chief Constable of Cumbria. You will see that I
     concluded that no disciplinary action is appropriate in respect of any of the
     complaints against the six officers.

     I suspect that both the result of the Inquest and any decision that the PCA
     make will attract media attention, but, in accordance with your statement on
     18 October 1990, I understand that you will not take part in any television
     programme or press conference. You said you will only write to the complainants
     and prepare a statement for the media, sending us copies for our perusal prior
     to release. An embargo will be placed on your press statement so that there

MERITS OF COMPLAINT

Mr Hicks, his wife and their two daughters attended at Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club on 15 April 1989 for the match between Liverpool and Nottingham
Forest. The two girls were in standing area 3 and were tragically killed.

Mr Hicks makes three complaints of neglect of duty against Superintendent Murray

1)   That he failed to prevent a dangerous build up of supporters outside the
     gates.

2)   That he failed to control the movement of supporters subsequent to the opening
     of Gate C.

3)   That he failed to respond to the developing tragedy and was slow to effect
     a rescue operation.

Superintendent Murray denies that he neglected his duty.  In respect of the build
up he says that there was no way of foreseeing the large number of late arrivals,
that the control room was unable to see the extent of the build up and was reliant
on Superintendent Marshall and that they provided him with what he requested in
the way of reinforcements.  In respect of the movement of supporters subsequent
to the opening of the gate, such was the enormity of the life or death situation
outside, he admits that he gave no thought to the consequences, other than to
think that the fans would be absorbed and that the crowd would find its own level.
On this point the Investigating Officer considers that the direct responsibility
rests with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.  Superintendent Murray contends that
his response to the tragedy was effective, and the Investigating Officer says
in the report that it is clear that he made every effort to deal with the
situation.

REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

The file has been considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect
of the possible criminal offences of manslaughter and culpable malfeasance and
he has indicated that there is insufficient evidence to warrant criminal
proceedings. The same evidence as considered for culpable malfeasance applies
to the disciplinary offence of neglect of duty and the Assistant Chief Constable
(Complaints & Discipline) therefore considers that there is similarly insufficient
evidence to warrant disciplinary action for neglect of duty.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT

Mr Hicks, his wife and two daughters attended at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
on 15 April 1989 for the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest and the
two girls were tragically killed in the crushing in area 3-

Mr Hicks has made a number of allegations against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

1)   That he failed to prevent a dangerous build up of supporters
     outside the gates.

2)   That he failed to control the movement of supporters subsequent
     to the opening of Gate C.

3)   That he failed to respond to the developing tragedy and was slow
     to effect a rescue operation.

4)   That he was deceitful and intentionally misled senior police officers
     and members of the public regarding his command and control of officers
     on that day.

                               OR

5)   That he colluded with the Assistant Chief Constable to mislead the
     public over the opening of Gate C.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield acting on the advice of his legal representatives
declined to be interviewed during the course of this Enquiry. The Investigating
Officer has, therefore, relied on the evidence that he gave, whilst not under oath
to the Taylor enquiry, and other evidence resulting from his enquiries.

In respect of allegation 1) the Investigating Officer points out that the police
had taken various steps to prevent such an occurrence, perhaps the most important
being to request the fans to arrive early, the evidence indicating that the
Nottingham Forest fans heeded the request and did so. It is a fact that Liverpool
fans did arrive later in large numbers, resulting in a situation very different
from the previous year. As far as the allegation that he failed to control the
movement of supporters is concerned, the report makes the point that the opening
of the actual gate was presented to Mr Duckenfield as a life or death decision
and that, although it is correct that he did not make any arrangements for such
control the Investigating Officer considers it doubtful if it could be "proved
that he should have done." In respect of his response to the tragedy, once the
reality of what was happening had been identified, the report indicates "that it
was done to the best of the officer's ability given the information available and
the circumstances prevailing at the time." As far as complaint 4 is concerned,
the Investigating Officer is of the opinion that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
did mislead people but that the evidence indicates that it was not deliberate or
deceitful. It is, however, a fact that two gates were forced by the Liverpool fans
In respect of the suggestion of collusion with the Assistant Chief Constable, it
is apparent from the evidence that there was no such collusion.
REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

The file has been considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect
of the possible criminal offences of manslaughter and culpable malfeasance and
he has indicated that there is insufficient evidence to warrant criminal
proceedings. The same evidence which has been considered for culpable malfeasance
applies to the disciplinary offences of neglect of duty and the Assistant Chief
Constable (Complaints & Discipline) considers that there is similarly insufficient
evidence to warrant disciplinary actions for neglect of duty (allegations 1-3-)

In respect of the allegation that he intentionally misled people, the Investigating
Officer considers the complaint to be unsubstantiated and, for the final
allegation, that there is no evidence to support it. The Assistant Chief Constable
(Complaints & Discipline) agrees with the Investigating Officer in these matters.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT


Mrs McBrien's son attended at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on 15 April
1989 for the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest and was
tragically killed in the crush.

She has complained that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield should not have
opened the gates under any circumstances giving unlimited and uncontrolled
access into the ground by supporters.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield has asserted that he had no option but
to open the gates, a position with which Lord Justice Taylor agreed.



REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

The Investigating Officer considers the allegation to be unsubstantiated
a decision with which the Assistant Chief Constable (Complaints &
Discipline) agrees.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT

Mr Jones' son attended at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on 15 April
1989 for the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest and was
tragically killed in the crush.

Mr Jones has made a number of allegations against Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield:-

1)   That he failed to acquaint himself with the planning and problems
     related to the control of the semi-final.

2)   That he failed    to monitor crowd numbers packing into pens 3 and 4.

3)   That he failed    to act when it became obvious that pens 3 & 4 were
      over full when   he had an excellent viewpoint from the police box above
      the pens.

4.   That he failed to make provision for the fans coming through Gate C
     after he had given the order for the gate to be opened.

5.   That he failed    to act when it was obvious that people were in distress.

6.   That he attempted to mislead the Assistant Chief Constable and others,
      namely representatives of the clubs, the FA and the fans themselves,
      regarding the origin of the order for Gate C to be opened by inf erring
      that supporters had forced open the gate when he had, in fact, given
      the order to open the gate.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, acting on the advice of his legal
representatives, declined to be interviewed during the course of this
Enquiry. The Investigating Officer has therefore relied on the unsworn
evidence which he gave to the Taylor Enquiry and other evidence gleaned
during his enquiries.

In respect of the first allegation that he failed to acquaint himself with
the planning, Mr Duckenfield took over a plan based on the experiences of
the successfully run semi-final involving the same teams the previous year
and acquainted himself with it. As to failing to monitor areas 3 & 4, no
one, either police officer or club employee, realised that they were
seriously overcrowded until it was too late. The same applies to the
allegation that he failed to act when it became obvious that the areas were
over-full. The fourth allegation about failing to make arrangements to
receive the crowd following the opening of Gate C is undoubtedly correct.
However, the report indicates that he was dealing with a life or death
situation outside and whilst he made no arrangements the Investigating
Officer doubts if it could be "proved that he should have done." In respect
of the allegation that he failed to act when it was obvious people were
in distress, the fact is that the Control Box were aware that something
was happening and that senior officers were at the location but there is
no evidence that they knew what the nature of the incident was or that
people were in distress. Once they did realise the Major Incident Plan
was implemented. The final allegation that he attempted to mislead people
about the opening of Gate C, the Investigating Officer feels that Mr
Duckenfield did mislead people but that the evidence indicates it was not
deliberate nor deceitful and it is a fact that two gates were forced open
by the Liverpool fans.
REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE
The file has been considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions in
respect of the possible criminal offences of manslaughter and culpable
malfeasance and he has indicated that there is insufficient evidence to
warrant criminal proceedings.  The same evidence which has been considered
for culpable malfeasance equally applies to the disciplinary allegations
of neglect of duty and the Assistant Chief Constable (Complaints &
Discipline) considers that there is similarly insufficient evidence to
warrant disciplinary action in respect of allegations 1 - 5 *

As far as the allegation that he deliberately tried to mislead people, the
Investigating Officer is of the opinion that the complaint is not
substantiated and the Assistant Chief Constable (Complaints & Discipline)
agrees.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT

Mrs McBrien's son attended at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on 15 April
1989 for the semi-final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest and
was tragically killed in the crushing. Mrs McBrien complains of neglect
of duty by Superintendent Marshall in that:-

1)   He failed to prevent a build up of fans in the Leppings Lane area.

2)   He should not have requested Chief Superintendent Duckenfield to open
     the gates under any circumstances thereby giving unlimited and
     uncontrolled access to the ground by supporters.

Superintendent Marshall denies the allegations that he neglected his duty,
saying that the large number of late arrivals was so completely different
to the pattern of 1988 and could not have been predicted.  He further says
that the crowd was so large that without their co-operation, control was
impossible and that such co-operation was not forthcoming. As far as
opening the gates is concerned, he contends that he had no alternative,
a view supported by the Taylor Enquiry.


REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

The evidence in this case has been considered by the Director of Public
Prosecutions in respect of the possible criminal offences of manslaughter
and culpable malfeasance and he has indicated that there is insufficient '
evidence to warraijt criminal proceedings. The same facts considered for
the criminal offence of culpable malfeasance would form the basis of any
charge of neglect of duty and the Assistant Chief Constable (Complaints
& Discipline) also feels that there is insufficient evidence to warrant
disciplinary proceedings.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT

Mr Jones' son attended at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on 15 April
1989 for the semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
His son was tragically killed in the crushing. Mr Jones makes complaints
of neglect of duty against Superintendent Marshall in that:-

1)   He failed to control fans in the turnstile area.

2)   He failed to restrict the approach or to stop fans entering
     Leppings Lane.

Superintendent Marshall denies the allegations that he neglected his duty,
saying that the huge number of late arrivals and the crowd build up was
so much more than in 1988 and was not in any way foreseeable. He asserts
that without the co-operation of the crowd it was impossible, without a
large number of men, to control them and co-operation was not forthcoming.


REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

The evidence in this case has been considered by the Director of Public
Prosecutions in respect of the possible offences of manslaughter and
culpable malfeasance and has indicated that in his opinion there is
insufficient evidence to warrant proceedings. The same facts for the
culpable malfeasance would form the basis of any disciplinary offence of
neglect of duty and the Assistant Chief Constable (Complaints & Discipline)
also considers there to be insufficient evidence to warrant disciplinary
proceedings.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT

Mr Hicks, his wife, and two daughters attended at the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club on 15 April 1989 for the semi-final match between Liverpool
and Nottingham Forest. The two girls were in standing area 3 at the
Leppings Lane end and were tragically killed.

Mr Hicks makes 3 allegations of neglect of duty against Superintendent
Greenwood:

1)   That he failed to prevent a dangerous build up of supporters outside
     the gates.

2)   That he failed to control the movement of supporters subsequent to
     the opening of Gate C.

3)   That he failed to respond to the developing tragedy and was slow to
     effect a rescue operation.

Superintendent Greenwood denies the allegations, pointing out that he had
no responsibility for those supporters outside the gates. He says in a
written submission that he was unaware that Gate C had been opened and
could therefore not have taken steps to control them. He also states that
once he realised that there were problems he took what actions he could
by first of all trying to persuade fans to move back, then when he realised
they were still intent on watching the game he ran onto the pitch to stop
it and thereafter directed and organised groups in their rescue efforts.

REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

The evidence has been considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions
in respect of the criminal offences of manslaughter and culpable
malfeasance, and he has decided that there is insufficient evidence to
warrant any criminal proceedings. The evidence needed to substantiate
the disciplinary offence of neglect of duty is the same as that necessary
to prove the culpable malfeasance and the Assistant Chief Constable
(Complaints & Discipline) similarly considers that there is also
insufficient evidence to warrant discipline proceedings for neglect of
duty.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT

Mr Leigh is a Liverpool supporter who on 15 April 1 9 8 9 attended at
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to watch the semi-final between Liverpool
and Nottingham Forest. He had a ticket and entered area 4 at the Leppings
Lane terraces where he was injured in the crushing. He complains that
PC417 Illingworth, the officer responsible for the perimeter track gate
in area 4 was uncivil in that when fans were asking him to open the gate,
he mouthed words which appeared to say "shut up you dickheads" and that
he had neglected his duty by failing to open the gate sooner.

PC Illingworth, when interviewed, asserts that he was not uncivil and that
just as soon as he heard the first shout for help and realised that there
was a problem he opened the gate and started taking people out.


REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

This complaint has been considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions
in respect of possible offences of manslaughter or culpable malfeasance
and he decided that there was insufficient evidence to support proceedings.
The same evidence would have to be used to prove the disciplinary offence
of neglect of duty. The Assistant Chief Constable (Complaints &
Discipline) considers that similarly there is insufficient evidence to
support discipline proceedings.

As far as the incivility is concerned, Mr Leigh did not hear the officer
say anything, he has surmised that PC Illingworth was mouthing the words
complained of. The officer denies doing so and in the absence of any other
evidence the Assistant Chief Constable considers disciplinary action is
not sustainable.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT

Mr Hicks, together with his wife and two daughters, attended at Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club on 15 April 1989 for the semi-final match between
Liverpool and Nottingham      Forest. The two girs were in standing area 3
and were both tragically among the dead.  Mr Hicks makes three complaints
of neglect of duty against Superintendent Marshall in that:-

1)   He failed to prevent a dangerous build up of supporters
     outside the gates.

2)   He failed to control the movement of supporters after the opening of
     the gate.

3)   He failed to respond to the developing tragedy, being slow to effect
     a rescue operation.

Superintendent Marshall denies the allegations.  He asserts that the
problem of the build up was caused by people arriving later than they had
done the previous year, a change which he could not have foreseen and
which, when it happened, he did the only thing possible to prevent death
or injury outside by seeking to have the gates opened. He accepts that
he took no steps to control the movement of supporters after opening the
gates but states that because of the huge number of fans still outside
he believed that the areas set aside for Liverpool supporters must be
fairly empty and that he therefore did not anticipate any problem inside.
As for his response to the tragedy, Superintendent Marshall says that,
although in a state of shock, he did all that he could.

REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

The Director of Public Prosecutions has considered the evidence of this
case in respect of the possible criminal offences of manslaughter and
culpable malfeasance and has decided that there is insufficient evidence
to warrant proceedings. The same evidence for the culpable malfeasance
would form the basis of any disciplinary offence of neglect of duty and
the Assistant Chief Constable (Complaints & Discipline) also concludes
that there is insufficient evidence to warrant disciplinary proceedings.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT

Mr Spearitt is a Liverpool FC supporter who on 15 April 1989 attended at
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to watch the semi-final between Liverpool
and Nottingham Forest. He was accompanied by his son Adam and both had
tickets for the Leppings Lane terraces. They entered area 4 where he was
injured in the crush and Adam was tragically killed. He complains that
PC417 Illingworth, the officer responsible for the perimeter track gate
in area 4, neglected his duty by failing to open the gate sooner despite
his loud appeals to him to do so.

PC Illingworth on interview stated that as soon as he heard the first shout
for help and realised that there was a problem he opened the gate and
started taking people out.


REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

This complaint has been considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions
in respect of possible offences of manslaughter or culpable malfeasance
and he has decided that there is insufficient evidence to support
proceedings. The same evidence would have to be used in support of any
disciplinary offence of neglect of duty and the Assistant Chief Constable
(Complaints & Discipline) considers that, similarly, there is insufficient
evidence to support disciplinary proceedings.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT

The complainant attended the FA Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough, Sheffield
on 15 April 1 9 8 9 and was positioned in area 4 of the terracing immediately
before the crowd surge and crush. When the crush occurred he scaled the
fence separating areas 4 and 5 and made his way to area 5, in doing so he
sustained a fractured right ankle and was subsequently carried by spectators
onto the playing area. He alleges that whilst on the playing surface a
police officer said, "Get him off the fucking pitch." It seems likely that
if this was said, it was by one police officer to another, believing that
a pitch invasion was in progress.

It was further alleged that two police officers removed the complainant
from the pitch. This removal has variously been described as "rough"
"bundled" "thrown" and "dropped." What cannot be disputed is that if an
officer or officers believed the complainant to have been part of a pitch
invasion his removal from the playing surface would have been made with
a sense of urgency.   It is difficult to accept that this removal,
nothwithstanding his factured ankle, caused the complainant anything other
than minor discomfort.   Evidence exists to the effect that even after his
plight had been drawn to the attention of officers of St John's Ambulance,
he refused to be removed for treatment until after the football match had
been abandoned. Neither the complainant nor the witnesses can identify
the police officers allegedly involved in his removal from the playing
surface. The file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions
who is of the opinion that the evidence does not justify criminal
proceedings.


REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

It has not been possible to identify the officers allegedly responsible
for this incident, but in these circumstances the Assistant Chief Constable
(Complaints & Discipline) doubts if the "assault" amounted to an abuse of
authority or that the "incivility" was directed at Mr Leigh. He therefore
considers that disciplinary proceedings would not be appropriate even if
the officers were traced.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT

Mr Hendry is a Liverpool FC supporter who on 15 April 1 9 8 9 attended at
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to watch the semi-final game between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. After properly entering the ground,
handing in his ticket at the turnstile, he made his way into area 3 where
severe crushing occurred. He complains that PC1285 Smith who was on duty
at the perimeter gate for area 3 refused to open it, simply telling them
to move back and that PC Smith threw a fan who had climbed the fence back
into area 3.

PC Smith says that, when he realised that there was a problem, he caused
the gate to be opened and that before that he had been unaware of the cries
for help and for the gate to be opened, not identifying it as other than
the normal crowd noise. As far as throwing a fan back over the fence is
concerned, PC Smith says that would be physically impossible.


REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

The Investigating Officer is of the opinion that Mr Hendry has
misinterpreted the officer's actions and that his sequence of events is
confused. The Director of Public Prosecutions is of the opinion that there
is insufficient evidence for criminal proceedings for manslaughter or for
culpable malfeasance. The neglect of duty relies on that same evidence
and accordingly the Assistant Chief Constable (Complaints & Discipline)
considers that a similar decision applies to the disciplinary offence.

With regard to the disciplinary offence of abuse of authority, the officer
denies the allegation of pushing anyone over the fence. He does agree
that he pushed people out of the way of the open gate. The Investigating
Officer feels that understandably Mr Hendry is confused about exactly what
took place.  In the circumstances the Assistant Chief Constable considers
there to be insufficient evidence for disciplinary proceedings.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT

Mr Lackey is a Liverpool FC supporter who on 15 April 1 9 8 9 attended at
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to watch the semi-final game between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. He did not have a ticket but after the
outer gates were opened made his way to area 3 where severe crushing
occurred. He complains that PC1285 Smith who was on duty at the perimeter
gate for area 3 failed to open the gate quickly enough and that, once it
was opened, as a supporter went to go through it he pushed him back into
the crowd.

PC Smith contends that, when he realised that there was a problem he caused
the gate to be opened and that prior to that moment he had been unaware
of the cries for help from those being crushed, assuming it to be part
of the usual crowd noise. Once the gate was opened he was concerned for
those obviously injured people who were trapped at the gate and did push
fans back who were coming over the top of them and hampering the rescue
of those he considered to be most at risk.


REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

The Investigating Officer is of the opinion that Mr Lackey has
misinterpreted the officer's actions from his somewhat limited view in
the crush. The file has been considered by the Director of Public
Prosecutions who is of the opinion that there is insufficient evidence
to warrant criminal proceedings for manslaughter or for culpable
malfeasance. The proof for the disciplinary offence of neglect of duty
relies on the same evidence as that adduced when considering the criminal
matters and in view of the Director of Public Prosecutions' decision the
Assistant Chief Constable (Complaints & Discipline) is of the opinion that
there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceedings for neglect of duty.

As far as the allegation of abuse of authority is concerned, the Assistant
Chief Constable (Complaints & Discipline) considers there is insufficient
evidence to warrant disciplinary proceedings. He accepts that PC Smith
did push people out of the way but that this was done because the officer
considered them to be hampering the rescue of people trapped at the gate.
It may be that, with hindsight, it would have been better to have removed
them from the area altogether but in the heat of the moment PC Smith acted
as he did to try to save those who could not move and save themselves.
MERITS OF COMPLAINT

On 15 April 1 9 8 9 Mr Jones' son attended at Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club for the semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest and
was tragically killed in the crushing.

Mr Jones makes a number of allegations of neglect of duty against
Superintendent Greenwood.

1)   That he failed to send officers to the rear of areas 3 & 4 to relieve
     the pressure when he knew Gate C was being opened.

2)   That he failed to carry out his assigned duty by placing himself in
     a position by the players tunnel, whereas if he had used his eyes and
     radio he should have been aware of the dangerous situation and
     controlled his officers accordingly.

3)   That he failed to brief his officers adequately to monitor for
     overcrowding in relation to crowd safety.

4)   That he failed to organise the police officers in a way which would
     have helped bring about a successful rescue operation and was totally
     ineffective in mounting a rescue.

Having considered the complaints the Investigating Officer decided that
an alternative to No.3 could be disobedience to orders in that
Superintendent Greenwood disobeyed or neglected to carry out a lawful
written order by failing properly to brief his officers in accordance with
the South Yorkshire Police Standing Instructions for policing football
matches.

Superintendent Greenwood denies the allegations, stating that he was not
aware that Gate C had been opened and could therefore not respond to it.
In respect of his being at the players tunnel he makes the point that he
was responsible for the whole ground and he decided that this was the place
which most needed his attention. As far as being aware of the dangerous
situation, he says that many others in the ground did not realise what
the position actually was and that he was the first senior officer to react
to it, as is evidenced by his initial attempts to persuade the crowd to
move back followed by him stopping the match.  In relation to his briefing,
in his written submission he says he briefed properly and fully but that
(in any event) monitoring of the crowd was the responsibility of the
Control Box. His response to the alleged failure in respect of the rescue
is that he tried to get the fans to move back; when this failed he stopped
the game, then directed and organised groups in the rescue effort.

REASONS FOR NO DISCIPLINE

The evidence has been considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions
in respect of the criminal offences of manslaughter and culpable
malfeasance, and he has decided that there is insufficient evidence to
warrant any criminal proceedings. The evidence needed to substantiate
the disciplinary offence of neglect of duty is the same as that necessary
to prove the culpable malfeasance and the Assistant Chief Constable
(Complaints & Discipline) considers that there is also insufficient
evidence to warrant disciplinary proceedings for neglect of duty. The
Investigating Officer states that there is insufficient evidence to prove
any offence of disobedience to orders and the Assistant Chief Constable
(Complaints & Discipline) agrees with him.

    HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER REQUESTS FOR DISCLOSURE

    I felt I should acquaint you with the progreats we have made towards resolving
    the disclosure problem. You will recall that at our meting with Stephen
    Walker we decided to take counsel's advice. I enclose a copy of the advice
    given by Mr Stuart Sleeman and the related correspondence between Stephen
    Walker and this office respecting it* that is the letters of 5 and 9 November,
    our request for clarification of 16 November and the response of 19 November
    1990.

    Accordingly I am minded to follow the legal advice and determine not to approve
    the disclosure of any material certainly before the completion
    Of course, any direction of any court, including the inquest would be followed*

    It is to be anticipated that there will be a steady flow of requests for such
    material and we will need to consider the mechanisms by which decisions can
    be made in respect of each item raid its copying and supplying If appropriate.
    Do you have any thoughts on these issues please?

                STATEMENT BY THE DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE OF CHESHIRE, MR MERVyN JONES,
                             UPON COMPLETION OF THE HTT.T.HBO'ROUGH TOQOTHg



        "I   have    no     comment      to    make     about     the    verdicts.       The    inquiry      into    the
        circumstances surrounding the tragedy at Hillsborough has been exhaustive and
        comprehensive.          At    the height      of    the   investigation       nearly    500 West Midlands
        Police Officers were            involved.          Upon   completion     of   the bulk of      the work       in
        Summer 1989, this was reduced to a team of 62.                           From November 1990 onwards, a
        small    team      of   12    Officers    has      been   dedicated      to   supporting     Her     Majesty’s

        Coroner, Dr Stefan POPPER, for the Inquests.


        During the course of the inquiry as a whole,                        contact has been made with over
        13,000 people, over 5,000 statements having been taken, and 9,000 questionnaires

        completed.


        The product of these extensive investigations was made available to Lord Justice
        TAYLOR, the Director of Public Prosecutions,                       the Police Complaints Authority,

        and latterly to the Coroner.


        At   the    opening      of    the     investigation        I   stated    that   this    tragedy     would     be

        investigated thoroughly;               this ^e have done."

       Dear Stuart

       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
       REQUESTS FOR DISCLOSURE
      Thank you fo r your l e t t e r o f 16 November which I discusse d in some d e t a i l
      with Superintendent Fell l a s t Friday.                  So as not to co nfuse, my further
      comments are r e l a t e d to p a r t ic u l a r paragraphs in your l e t t e r and fo r ease o f
      r ef er ence th es e have been s u b - t i t l e d .

      Second Paragraph - Obligation to Disclose
      I can think o f no s i t u a t i o n s which might a r i s e to c re a te an o b l i g a t i o n to
      d i s c l o s e other than by order o f the cour t. As Stuart Sleeman poin ts out,
      there i s no o b l i g a t i o n in c i v i l proceedings to d i s c l o s e un til a f t e r the writ
      has been i s su e d . No c i v i l proceedings a f f e c t i n g any o f those who have so
      fa r requested information have been i n s t i t u t e d , t h er e fo r e no o b li g a t io n
      p r e s e n t ly e x i s t s .                                                             ------ ---------

      Third Paragraph - Civil Proceedings
      I am not aware o f any c i v i l proceedings p r e se n t ly underway in which
      d i s c l o s u r e would be required in the circumstances s e t out in paragraph 3 o f
      Mr Sleeman’ s ad vice. However, I think your question o f propr iety i s rather
      put the wrong way round. Propriety in my view i s not in qu es ti o n . I t would
      be proper i f you so choose to make any r e le v a n t information a v a i l a b l e to a
      pr o spect iv e party to c i v i l proceedings in advance, even though t h i s i s not
      o b l i g a t o r y . This i s on the ba sis th at most o f the information e i t h e r in
      your p o s se s sio n or control i s not public i n t e r e s t immune. The q u a l i f i c a t i o n
      to t h i s pr opo sition i s the documentation acquired                                   srier-ifir-all v      for
      complaints made by Messrs                                                                                       and

      acquired fo r th a t purpose and no other.
Fifth Paragraph - Makanjuola
I turn now to the Makanjuola case and the perceived confusion concerning
public i n t e r e s t immunity from d is c l o s u r e o f s tate ments/e videnc e acquired fo r
the purposes o f a complaints again st p o l i c e .

As you quite r i g h t l y point out, the is s u e s in the Makanjuola case were
considered by the court a f t e r the d i s c i p l i n a r y hearings but I do not
con side r t h i s to be o f any import. The p r i n c i p l e s enunciated in e a r l i e r
case law and confirmed in Makanjuola apply i r r e s p e c t i v e o f time.              If
statements have been taken fo r the purpose o f an i n v e s t i g a t i o n in to a
complaint, they are public i n t e r e s t immune. This includes the complainant’ s
own statement (a p a r t i c u l a r point decided by Makanjuola).

Many, i f not most complaints which are i n v e s t i g a t e d , w i l l have a crime
component but the case law supports the view th at where i t i s the complaint
which   dr iv e s the i n v e s t i g a t i o n , public i n t e r e s t immunity a p p li e s to
statements taken in the course o f i t .

Two statements from the Judgment o f L J Fox in the Court o f Appeal d e c is i o n
in B la ir Peach in 1986 are i l l u s t r a t i v e o f the way in which the courts t r e a t
complaints ag ain st p o l i c e in determining whether public i n t e r e s t immunity i s
a p p lic a b le .

The f i r s t quote was from Lord J Denning in the e a r l i e r case o f Neil son v
Laugharne when he d e a l t with the nature o f statements taken by p o l i c e in
th at c a se .           "Statements were taken on the ba sis th at they were to be used
f o r a p r iv ate i n v e s t i g a t i o n , to see i f the P o lic e had acted improperly in
any way, and i f they had acted improperly, to be used in criminal or
d i s c i p l i n a r y proceedings ag ains t the p o l i c e . " I t i s noteworthy th at in that
c a se , the complaints r e l a t e d to t r e s p a s s , damage to property, f a l s e a r r e s t ,
wrongful imprisonment and a s s a u l t ; th er e fo r e the i n v e s t i g a t i o n had t h i s
crime component.

L J Fox then went on to say in r e l a t i o n to Neil son v Laugharne "the present
case i s , in my view, e s s e n t i a l l y d i f f e r e n t in i t s nature. B la ir Peach had
died a v i o l e n t death. It was a matter o f public concern to e s t a b l i s h the
cause o f h is death and th at would have been sowhether there was a complaint
a g ain s t the p o l i c e or not."

That statement, i t seems to me, r e f l e c t s the p o s i t i o n in "Hillsborough" with
which you are p r e s e n t ly grappling. The d e c i s i o n to hold a j u d i c i a l enquiry
and subsequently a criminal i n v e s t i g a t i o n , was not taken because o f the
complaints ag ain st P o l i c e .   That i s why, in my opinion, the statements taken
in the course o f th ose             i n v e s t i g a t i o n s are not public i n t e r e s t immune,
d e s p i t e the f a c t th at they were to be used fo r the purposes o f the
complaints.

Let me tr y to exemplify t h i s by use o f another hypothetical s i t u a t i o n which
i s not wholly beyond the bounds o f p r o b a b i l i t y . I f a pr isoner d i e s in his
c e l l by hanging using a b e l t          from h i s tr o users there would be an
investigation.   I f a r e l a t i v e were subsequently to complain th a t t h i s b e l t
should have been removed by P o lic e when he was taken in to custody i t w i l l                           be
i n v e s t i g a t e d as a complaint under PACE.     But as such, i t would, in                           my
assessment, be subsumed in the much more s er io u s enquiry in to a death                                  in
p o l i c e c e l l s . Any statements taken in th a t connection would not, in                             my
opin ion, be public i n t e r e s t immune and th er e fo r e would be s u s c e p t i b l e                to
d i s c l o s u r e in any subsequent c i v i l proceedings.

Sixth Paragraph - Waiver of Public Interest Immunity
There i s no power to waive public i n t e r e s t immunity and I cannot find
anything in Stuart Sleeman’ s opinion which c o n f l i c t s with t h i s p r i n c i p l e .
There i s no doubt whatsoever in t h i s area.

I f there are any other points which a r i s e or you require                                    further
c l a r i f i c a t i o n , perhaps we can d is c u s s t h i s on the teleph on e. A l t e r n a t i v e l y ,
I would be happy to v i s i t Headquarters to d is c u s s the is s u e s fu rt he r with
you and/or Superintendent F e l l .

Dear

HHXsacaouca   disaster requests for m s c w a m *

I have now given detailed consideration to Counsel*s advice on the subject
of disclosure of material that case into existence in connection with the
Hillsborough disaster and note the advice as being against disclosure of any
material before the conclusion of the Inquest and subsequent disciplinary
enquiry unless there is a clear obligation to do so.

It has always been accepted that if disclosure is ordered toy any court,
including the Coroner's Court* disclosure would occur. How an obligation other
than by order of the Court could arise is not clear, It would be most helpful
if examples could be given of situations that might arise which would create
such an obligation.

I note the advice that in general nothing should be disclosed "unless civil
proceedings have been commenced and discovery is due to take place," Could
it be said that the circumstances set out to paragraph 3 of the advice exist
in relation to the present state of any of the civil proceedings arising from
the disaster? If the answer to this question is negative In what other
circumstances would disclosure be proper?

Almost every complaint is an allegation that crime has been committed by a
police officer and this is true with the Hillsborough Enquiry. It is in my
view a misconception to think of a complaint investigation as meaning an
investigation leading to possible disciplinary proceedings. The overwhelming
majority of complaint Investigations are crimiB&l enquiries which may result
in criminal or disciplinary proceedings.

It was generally thought in police circles that public interest immunity
encompassed all material that came into existence in the course of an
investigation into any complaint against police and that this notion was
unaffected by the possibility of the material being used in forthcoming
disciplinary proceedings. The Makanjoula complaint investigation you will
know had to do with a serious crime and was not confined to purely disciplinary
matters although the evidence was held to be subject of public interest
immunity. The Makanjoula ease was certainly after and not before the
disciplinary hearing.

It was thought that "no power of waiver of public interest Immunity exists,
either belonging to the force or to the individual making the statement. Any
disclosure (other than to prevent a miscarriage of Justice, to the Home
Secretary, to the Coroner or to the force’s legal advisers) could not occur
without the prior consent of the court." This thinking that the police have
no power to disclose now seems unsound for It has been put to me that this
conflicts with counsel’s advice. Is there any doubt In this area?

I should be grateful If you would consider these questions as quickly as
possible so that with the benefit of advice I can then assess the appropriate
courses of action in respect of each of the different requests for disclosure
received.

prejudice        the       subsequent               disciplinary             private          inquiry

I advise        that       they         should        not       be   disclosed          and    that     the

necessary        representations                      should         be m a d e     to the C o r o n e r

opposing        disclosure.                   It    is     impossible             for   me    to a d v i s e

if an y     such      representations                      will      succeed        without         seeing

the    documents           concerned               and     without         having       further

instructions             as    to       the    nature           of   the     prejudice          which

those     responsible               for       discipline             feel     might      occur.         I

suspect,      that       the       coroner          f a ced      with      such     representations

would     have      to     balance            the     question          of    prejudice          as a g a i n s t

the n e ed      for      a full          and       p r op e r    investigation               in p u b l i c

as    to the m a n n e r           in w h i c h       the       people       concerncd          met    t h eir

death.        He m i g h t         well       feci        compelled          to    order       disclosure

despite       the     risk         that       the     disciplinary                hearings       could        be

prejudiced.              Fortunately                 any    disciplinary                hearing       is h e l d

before      a discipline                  board       and       in    some    circumstances              before

the C h i e f     Constable               rather          than       a Jury       and    therefore          it     is

unlikely        that       any          adverse        publicity           attendant           upon     the

C o r o n e r ’s I n q u i s i t i o n        will        affect       the m i n d s      of    the

 Inquisition;                  some        further material                 was      obtained          to

 enable       the D P P          to c o n s i d e r        whether         any     criminal         charges

 were a p p r o p r i a t e          and      a limited           number         of s t a t e m e n t s               *

were      obtained             to c o n s i d e r      whether        there          had     been      any

mis-conduct               by    a Police Officer                  as a result,              of an

necessary           representations                   should         be m a d e        to    the C o r o n e r

opposing        disclosure.                    It    is    impossible             for       me    to a d v i s e

if any        such    representations                      will      succeed           without          seeing

the d o c u m e n t s      concerned                and    without          having          further

instructions              as    to       the    nature         of    the        prejudice           which

those     responsible                for       discipline            feel        might       occur.          I

su s p ec t    that       the       coroner          faced        w it h    such       representations

would     have       to    balance             the    question             of    prejudice            as a g a i n s t

the need        for       a full          and       proper        investigation                  in p u b l i c

as    to the m a n n e r            in w h i c h      the      people           concerncd           met     their

death.         He    might          well       feel       compelled             to o r d e r      disclosure

despite        the    risk          that       the    disciplinary                 hearings           could       be

prejudiced.               Fortunately                any       disciplinary              hearing           is h e l d

before        a discipline                 board         and    in    some       circumstances                before

the C h i e f       Constable              rather          than      a Jury        and      therefore            it    is

 unlikely       that       an y          adverse         publicity          attendant             upon      the

Coroner's           Inquisition                will        affect      the m i n d s         of      the

 Tribunal       concerncd.



 6.      If    and      when         I c an         help    further         p l ea s e      let me         know.

Dear

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER REQUESTS FOR DISCLOSURE

I have now given detailed consideration to Counsel's advice on the subject
of disclosure of material that cane into existence in connection with the
Hillsborough disaster and note the advice as being against disclosure of any
material before the conclusion of the Inquest and subsequent disciplinary
enquiry unless there is a clear obligation to do so.

It has always been accepted that if disclosure is ordered by any court,
including the Coroner's Court, disclosure would occur. How an obligation other
than by order of the Court could arise is not clear. It would be most helpful
if examples could be given of situations that might arise which would create
such an obligation.

I note the advice that in general nothing should be disclosed "unless civil
proceedings have been comenced and discovery is due to take place." Could
it be said that the circumstances set out in paragraph 3 of the advice exist
in relation to the present state of any of the civil proceedings arising from
the disaster? If the answer to this question is negative In what other
circumstances would disclosure be proper?

Almost every complaint is an allegation that crime has been committed by a
police officer and this is true with the Hillsborough Enquiry. It is in sy
view a misconception to think of a complaint investigation as meaning an
investigation leading to possible disciplinary proceedings. The overwhelming
majority of complaint investigations are criminal enquiries which may result
In criminal or disciplinary proceedings.
16 November 1990

It was generally thought in police circles that public interest immunity
encompassed all material that came into existence in the course of an
investigation into any complaint against police and that this notion was
unaffected by the possibility of the material being used in forthcoming
disciplinary proceedings. The Makanjoula complaint investigation you will
know had to do with a serious crime and was not confined to purely disciplinary
matters although the evidence was held to be subject of public Interest
immunity. The Makanjoula case was certainly after and not before the
disciplinary hearing.

It was thought that ”no power of waiver of public interest immunity exists,
either belonging to the force or to the individual making the statement. Any
disclosure (other than to prevent a miscarriage of justice, to the Home
Secretary, to the Coroner or to the force's legal advisers) could not occur
without the prior consent of the court." This thinking that the police have
no power to disclose now seems unsound for it has been put to me that this
conflicts with counsel's advice. Is there any doubt in this area?

I should be grateful if you would consider these questions as quickly as
possible so that with the benefit of advice I can then assess the appropriate
courses of action in respect of each of the different requests for disclosure
received.

       Dear Stuart

       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
       REQUESTS FOR DISCLOSURE

       Thank you fo r your l e t t e r o f 16 November which I discussed in some d e t a i l
       with Superintendent Fell l a s t Friday.                  So as not to confu se, my further
       comments are r e l a t e d to p a r t ic u l a r paragraphs in your l e t t e r and fo r ease o f
       reference t h e s e have been s u b - t i t l e d .

       Second Paragraph - Obligation to Disclose
       I can th ink o f no s i t u a t i o n s which might a r i s e to create an o b li g a t io n to
       d i s c l o s e oth er than by order o f the court. As Stuart Sleeman po in ts out,
       there i s no o b li g a t i o n in c i v i l proceedings to d i s c l o s e u n til a f t e r the writ
       has been is s u e d . No c i v i l proceedings a f f e c t i n g any o f th ose who have so
       fa r requested information have been i n s t i t u t e d , ther e fo r e no o b li g a tio n
       p r e se n tly e x i s t s .

       Third Paragraph - Civil Proceedings
       I am not aware o f any c i v i l proceedings p r e s e n t ly underway in which
       d i s c l o s u r e would be required in the circumstances s e t out in paragraph 3 o f
       Mr Sleeman’ s advic e. However, I think your question o f proprie ty i s rather
       put the wrong way round. Propriety in my view i s not in q u estio n . It would
       be proper i f you so choose to make any r elev a n t information a v a ila b le to a
       prospective party to c i v i l proceedings in advance, even though t h i s i s not
       o b li g a t o r y . This i s on the ba sis that most o f the information e i t h e r in
       your p o s s e s s io n or control i s not public i n t e r e s t immune. The q u a l i f i c a t i o n

       acquired for th a t purpose and no other.
Fifth Paragraph - Makanjuola
I turn now to the Makanjuola case and the perceived confu sion concerning
public i n t e r e s t immunity from d i s c l o s u r e o f statem e n ts/e v id e n c e acquired for
the purposes o f a complaints a g a inst p o l i c e .

As you qu ite r i g h t l y      poin t out, the i s s u e s in the Makanjuola case were
considered by the court          a f t e r the d i s c i p l i n a r y hearings but I do not
consid er t h i s to be        o f any import. The p r i n c i p l e s enunciated in e a r l i e r
case law and confirmed in Makanjuola apply i r r e s p e c t i v e o f              time.       If
statements have been taken fo r the purpose o f an i n v e s t i g a t i o n in to a
complaint, they are public i n t e r e s t immune. This inclu des the complainant’ s
own statement (a p a r tic u la r poin t decided by Makanjuola).

Many, i f not most complaints which are i n v e s t i g a t e d , wi l l have a crime
component but the case law supports the view that where i t i s the complaint
which   driv es the i n v e s t i g a t i o n , public i n t e r e s t immunity applies to
statements taken in the course o f i t .

Two statements from the Judgment o f L J Fox in the Court o f Appeal decision
in B lair Peach in 1986 are i l l u s t r a t i v e o f the way in which the courts tr e a t
complaints again st p o li c e in determining whether public i n t e r e s t immunity i s
a p p lic a b le .

The f i r s t quote was from Lord J Denning in the e a r l i e r case o f Neilson v
Laugharne when he d e a lt with the nature o f statements taken by p o li c e in
th a t case .            "Statements were taken on the basis that they were to be used
f o r a p riv ate i n v e s t i g a t i o n , to see i f the P o lice had    acted improperly in
any way, and i f they had acted improperly, to be used in criminal or
d i s c i p l i n a r y proceedings a g ain st the p o l i c e . " It i s noteworthy that in that
c a s e , the complaints r e l a te d to t r e s p a s s , damage to property, f a l s e a r re st,
wrongful imprisonment and a s s a u l t ; th er e fo r e the i n v e s t i g a t i o n had t h i s
crime component.

L J Fox then went on to say in r e l a t i o n to Neilson v Laugharne "the present
case i s , in my view, e s s e n t i a l l y d i f f e r e n t in i t s nature. B la ir Peach had
died a v i o l e n t death. It was a matter o f public concern t o e s t a b l i s h the
cause o f his death and th at would have been so whether there was a complaint
a gain st the p o l i c e or not."

That statement, i t seems to me, r e f l e c t s the p o s it io n in "Hillsborough"   with
which you are pr e se ntly gr appling. The d e c is i o n to hold a j u d i c i a l enquiry
and subsequently a criminal i n v e s t i g a t i o n , was not taken because o f the
complaints again st P o l ic e . That i s why, in my opinion, the statements taken
in the course o f th ose i n v e s t i g a t i o n s are not public i n t e r e s t immune,
d e s p i t e the f a c t that they were to be used for the purposes o f the
complaints.

Let me tr y to exemplify t h i s by use o f another hypothetical s i t u a t i o n which
i s not wholly beyond the bounds o f p r o b a b ilit y . I f a pris oner d i e s in his
c e l l by hanging using a b e l t from his tr ousers there would be an
i n v e s t i g a t i o n . I f a r e l a t i v e were subsequently to complain th a t t h i s b e lt
should have been removed by P o l i c e when he was taken into custody i t wi l l                      be
in v e s tig a te d as a complaint under PACE.       But as such, i t would, in                        my
assessment, be subsumed in the much more s e r io u s enquiry in t o a death                           in
p o l i c e c e l l s . Any statements taken in th at connection would not, in                         my
opin ion, be public i n t e r e s t immune and th e r e fo r e would be s u s c e p tib le             to
d is c lo s u r e in any subsequent c i v i l proceedings.

Sixth Paragraph - Waiver of Public Interest Immunity

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY INQUEST


At 3.30 pm on Monday 29 October 1990, I was visited by DCC Mervyn Jones and
Inspector Caroline Perkins, who has been the Office Manager for the Hillsborough
Inquiry.

Their visit was to update the Force on the Inquest which will commence on
19 November 1990, in the Main Council Chamber at the Town Hall, Sheffield.
The Inquest will continue until 19 December, when it will adjourn for the
Christmas and New Year period, and resume on 7 January 1991. Mr Jones expressed
the view that he expected it to run to February 1991, at least.

Should there be any bomb alarms or threats it would be the responsibility of
the South Yorkshire Police to deal with evacuation, etc, as would be the case
in the event of any alarm currently involving the Council Chamber.

He asked that two police officers be made available for the rear of the Chamber,
as was provided at the Lord Justice Taylor Inquiry.   Perhaps four officers would
be required in total to allow for rest periods.      A room will be provided for
their use but if they require drinks, etc, that would be a matter for the Force.

On 30 November the Coroner was intending to hold a pre-inquest Review with all
counsel concerned.  DCC Jones provided me with a list ofwitnesses and    asked
that all be provisionally warned to attend theInquest.      The officers would
then be warned as per normal Crown Court warnings, giving them as much time
as possible.

DCC Jones then went on to discuss the hand-over of all the material that had
been collected by the West Midlands Inquiry team, including the HOLMES Data
Base and the working kit. He expressed the view that it was in South Yorkshire's
interest to have the West Midland's 'paid off' before the end of March 1991,
as the Home Office funding was expected to terminate at the end of this Financial
Year.

Future inquiries would be unable to be managed without knowledge of the HOLMES
Data Base and the working practices involved in how to access the material.

I questioned how much material would need to be stored in South Yorkshire, and
DCC Jones undertook to carry out some sizing and assessment in order that we
can make the necessary arrangements to have a suitable room available for
reception at the conclusion of the Inquest.

Mr Jones further informed me that his team wouldstill be using  Furnival House,
and be resident there between 8.00 am and 8.00 pm Monday to Friday throughout
the Inquest.   Outside those hours the building will be subject to security by
1Securiguard' or a similar group.   That company would inform us should anyone
attempt to gain unlawful access.

 1.   After discussing at length     it was agreed that no decision could
      properly be made until the     conclusion of the inquests as fresh
      evidence may come out.

 2.   It is intended that the decision on discipline should quickly
      follow the result unless substantial new evidence is given
      revealing possible criminal or discipline matters which have not
      already been encompassed by the investigation to date.

 3.   If that does happen the way forward will be for the investigating
      officer to consult with Noel Taylor as to whether further
      investigation is necessary in which case the decision would have
      to be delayed until any further report had been considered.

 4.   If no further investigation is required, we will do the necessary
      memos to the PCA immediately the result is known to enable them
      to swiftly reach their decision.

 5.   To this end we and the PCA     will read the file so as to be   prepared
      to react quickly as at (4).

 6.   Consultation between us and the PCA will continue whilst the file
      is being read in the hope that the positions both adopt eventually
      are not too uncomfortable for each other.

 7.   When the PCA have reached a decision they will do a full press
      release, write to the complainants, inform us and send us a copy
      prior to the release so the officers can be informed but with
      details embargoed until their statement is made.

 8.   PCA indicate that they will not hold a press conference or take
      part in television discussion programmes.

 9.   In the event of the decision being made that disciplinary action
      would ensue we would probably go for a tribunal because of the
      outstanding public interest.

10.   In the event of discipline the PCA will say virtually nothing
       to the press until the proceedings are complete.

11.   The Brigadier expressed concern that the Coroner may request an
      early decision to free the officers from jeopardy so that they
      could be called to give evidence.

12.   Meeting concluded that even if such a decision was made it was
      unlikely that the officers' legal advisers would allow them to
      give evidence as they would still be in jeopardy from
      (a) a private prosecution or (b) a verdict of unlawful killing.

13.   ACC informed meeting that the 'Jackson' file could cause problems
      if the Police Authority members, when they receive the report,
      were to disclose its contents to the media or other interested
      parties and that this could create difficulties when considering
      action against the other 6 officers.

14.   It was suggested that Mr Gillman might like to discuss this
      problem with Stephen Walker. PCA felt they could not do so and
      ACC indicated he would.

15•   ACC emphasised that SYP wished that all our actions should
      indicate and demonstrate to the public our desire to ensure that
      a proper decision had been reached on the question of either
      criminal or disciplinary process and that we would do all in our
      power to facilitate such decision making.

 7.   When the PCA have reached a decision they will do a full press
       release, write to the complainants, inform us and send us a copy
       prior to the release so the officers can be informed but with
      details embargoed until their statement is made.

 8.   PCA indicate that they will not hold a press conference or take
      part in television discussion programmes.

 9.   In the event of the decision being made that disciplinary action
      would ensue we would probably go for a tribunal because of the
       outstanding public interest.

10.   In the event of discipline the PCA will say virtually nothing
      to the press until the proceedings are complete.

             11.   The Brigadier expressed concern that the Coroner may request an
                   early decision to free the officers from jeopardy so that they
                   could be called to give evidence.

             12.   Meeting concluded that even if such a decision was made it was
                   unlikely that the officers' legal advisers would allow them to
                   give evidence as they would still be in jeopardy from
                   (a) a private prosecution or (b) a verdict of unlawful killing.

             13.   ACC informed meeting that the 'Jackson' file could cause problems
                   if the Police Authority members, when they receive the report,
                   were to disclose its contents to the media or other interested
                   parties and that this could create difficulties when considering
                   action against the other 6 officers.

             14.   It was suggested that Mr Gillman might like to discuss this
                   problem with Stephen Walker.   PCA felt they could not do so and
                   ACC indicated he would.

             15.   ACC emphasised that SYP wished that all our actions should
                    indicate and demonstrate to the public our desire to ensure that
                    a proper decision had been reached on the question of either
                    criminal or disciplinary process and that we would do all in our
                   power to facilitate such decision making.

 1.   After discussing at length it was agreed that no decision could
      properly be made until the conclusion of the inquests as fresh
       evidence may come ou t .

 2.   It is intended that the decision on discipline should quickly
       follow the result unless substantial new evidence is given
       revealing possible criminal or discipline matters which have not
       already been encompassed by the investigation to date.

 3*   If that does happen the way forward will be for the investigating
       officer to consult with Noel Taylor as to whether further
       investigation is necessary in which case the decision would have
       to be delayed until any further report had been considered.

 4.   If no further investigation is required, we will do the necessary
      memos to the PCA immediately the result is known to enable them
       to swiftly reach their decision.

 5•   To this end we and the PCA will read the     file so as to be prepared
       to react quickly as at (4).

 6.   Consultation between us and the PCA will continue whilst the file
       is being read in the hope that the positions both adopt eventually
       are not too uncomfortable for each other.

 7*   When the PCA have reached a decision they will do a full press
      release, write to the complainants, inform us and send us a copy
      prior to the release so the officers can be informed but with
      details embargoed until their statement is made.

 8.   PCA indicate that they will not hold a press conference or take
      part in television discussion programmes.

 9.   In the event of the decision being made that disciplinary action
      would ensue we would probably go for a tribunal because of the           \/
      outstanding public interest.

10.   In the event of discipline the PCA will say virtually nothing
       to the press until the proceedings are complete.

                                     - 2 -


Later that same day Mr Dear and myself met with Lord Justice Taylor and
toured the ground. Lord Justice Taylor made it quite clear that Mr Dear was
working directly to him and the product of the investigation would be made
available to him.    At lunchtime that day, Her Majesty’s Coroner for South
Yorkshire (West), Dr S L Popper, attended at Police Headquarters, Snig Hill,
Sheffield, and spoke to Lord Justice Taylor and to myself.         Dr Popper
exchanged a few words about the disaster with Lord Justice Taylor and agreed
that he would co-operate with the Judge’s wishes. I interpreted this later to
Lord Justice Taylor that in gathering evidence for the investigation we would
do this both for the benefit of Lord Justice Taylor as well as Her Majesty’s
Coroner knowing that ultimately an Inquest would have to take place. Lord
Justice Taylor appreciated this point.

The remainder of that week following the disaster was consumed by me and my
West Midlands colleagues in taking over the investigation already in hand by the
South Yorkshire Police as well as preparing our own arrangements. The second
week following the disaster we deployed officers to various parts of the country
but in particular to Sheffield and Liverpool to start gathering the evidence.
The evidence took two basic forms. Firstly, where West Midlands Police officers
interviewed witnesses statements were taken under the provisions of the
Criminal Justice Act. Secondly, where South Yorkshire Police Officers were
concerned requests were made through the South Yorkshire Police Liaison
Officer for ’’recollections” to be provided on what had occurred by all those
who had been involved; there were no exceptions to this request. These ’’re­
collections" were not pre-fixed by any form of caution or warning, nor were
they collected under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act. A similar
request for ’’recollections’’ was also made to the Solicitors representing the
interests of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Eastwoods Engineers and
Sheffield City Council.

All this evidence was gathered over the following weeks and on 15 May 1989
Lord Justice Taylor opened his public hearing at the Town Hall in Sheffield.
We had already supplied him with the evidence that had been obtained;
however, we still continued to gather statements, recollections, as well as
documents. Lord Justice Taylor continued to hear oral evidence for 31 working
days and eventually on 4 August he published his Interim Report. By that
time we had registered on our computer 2,710 documents, 4,216 questionnaires
and 3,941 statements.

On 4 August 1989 Mr Peter Wright, who had had earlier sight of Lord Justice
Taylor’s Interim Report, announced that he had sent a copy of the report to
the Director of Public Prosecutions and asked him to consider whether there
were any criminal issues to be resolved. In making that announcement, Mr
Wright indicated to Mr Dear that he would like him to carry out a criminal
investigation if that was thought appropriate by the Director of Public
Prosecutions.

On 11 August 1989 Mr Dear and myself visited the office of the Director of
Public Prosecutions in London and met with Mr Christopher Newell, Assistant
Director. At this meeting Mr Newell made it quite clear that he believed a
criminal investigation should follow and that Mr Allan Green, the Director,
would agree.

                                                            I Continued
                                      - 3 -


Following that meeting Mr Dear wrote to Mr Wright indicating that we would
conduct a criminal investigation following Mr Wright’s previous request. It was
also indicated in that letter that we would continue to service the needs of Her
Majesty’s Coroner whilst carrying out the criminal investigation.

On formally taking up the criminal investigation, the appointment of Mr Dear as
Investigating Officer was formally ratified by the Police Complaints Authority
and Mr Noel Taylor was appointed as the Supervisor, the investigation being
defined as one suitable for direct supervision. Throughout that investigation
the Police Complaints Authority pursued a ’’hands on” supervisory role. On
behalf of Mr Dear I had regular meetings with Mr Taylor and followed his
instructions.
Consequently, we continued to gather evidence and over the coming months
after 4 August we registered a further 1,170 documents, 182 questionnaires and
1,411 statements.
A note of caution. These figures do not truly define the date before or after
the statement, the questionnaire or the document was obtained.               The
information indicates the date on which they were registered and therefore they
can only be treated as a guide. In order to understand the origin of the piece
of evidence and the timing of its collection each item would have to be examined
individually. I think you will agree that would be an inappropriate exercise to
embark upon at this stage.

We continued our criminal investigation work, keeping the Coroner fully
informed of our progress. On 30 March 1990 we concluded the file to the
Director of Public Prosecutions which was sent to him on that day.      At the
same time we supplied the Coroner with a copy of the statements which
supported the report but for obvious reasons, and at the Coroner’s request, we
did not supply him with any of the reports.

On moving to the criminal investigation in August of last year, Lord Justice
Taylor made it quite clear that the material that he had gathered but had not
used should be made available both to the Coroner as originally understood as
well as to the criminal investigation. At that time Mr Dear assumed all that
material to be part of the criminal investigation and as a consequence its
confidentiality was sustained. In addition, all the material that had been
supplied to Lord Justice Taylor was also retained as confidential, the only
material being made available publicly being the transcripts and the supporting
documents and video/photographic evidence which had been received in the
openness of the public hearings. As a consequence I continued to resist
applications from all manner of parties for copy material and the like. This
policy has been maintained throughout and is still operative until such time that
the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police decides what he wishes to do.

After the Director of Public Prosecutions had received the report the
investigating officers continued to prepare for the interviews of certain persons
who played a principal part in the events on the day. About the same time Mr
Dear left the West Midlands Police to take up an appointment as Her Majesty’s
Inspector of Constabulary. It was assumed that the new Chief Constable, Mr
Ronald Hadfield, would be able to take up the responsibility as Investigating
Officer. However, because Mr Hadfield had been at the match and had made a
statement of his observations it was quite rightly thought inappropriate that he
should take up this responsibility.
                                                             I Continued
                                      - 4 -


Consequently Mr Leslie Sharp, Chief Constable of Cumbria, was later invited
and accepted the responsibility as Investigating Officer.

The West Midlands Police team, under Mr Sharp's direction, eventually
interviewed certain key personnel about the circumstances of the disaster. The
product of those interviews was forwarded           to the Director of Public
Prosecutions as an Annex to the earlier report.

The Director of Public Prosecutions announced his decision not to take any
proceedings in the criminal courts on 30 August 1990.

After the announcement Mr Sharp, who had concluded the police discipline
investigations as well as the criminal investigations, prepared his reports for
South Yorkshire Police. It was decided at that time to send a copy of the
Director of Public Prosecutions’ report and the related discipline reports to the
delegated discipline authority in South Yorkshire, Mr Stewart Anderson. This
decision was actioned in early September after consideration had been given to
the Coroner’s concern that to pass the information at that time may cause
difficulties later. However, as you know, the file was passed to South
Yorkshire Police.
Up until this time I had continued a policy of non-disclosure based on the belief
that the usual practice would apply, i.e. that the Coroner would not like any
evidence to be released until such a time that the Inquests had returned their
verdicts. However, as a result of one of the ’’parties” to the disaster being
afforded that information (even though the audience within         that organisationis
extremely limited) he would not issue a direction to me to continue a policy of
non-disclosure. Consequently, there are no directions I can follow at the
present time which would prevent me from responding to requests for such
information. (I have already sent to you photocopies of those current and
earlier requests).
As I see it, and a view shared by Mr Sharp, the product of the investigation
was initially that of Lord Justice Taylor and Her Majesty’s Coroner. In early
August that product passed from Lord Justice Taylor to the Director of Public
Prosecutions for the c r im inal investigation with the continuing interest of the
Coroner. At the same time the Police Complaints Authority had a supervisory
responsibility but did not, as far as I can recollect, require any statements
specifically to be taken for their purposes. Indeed, all the information had
been gathered earlier and their role was specifically directed to ensure that this
information was properly analysed and presented.             However, the Police
Complaints Authority did have a responsibility for supervising who should be
interviewed, as far as police are concerned, about the disaster. Separately, it
was a decision of Mr Sharp that Mr Mackrell of Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club should be interviewed.
Finally, the product of all the investigations must belong to the Chief Constable
of South Yorkshire Police who was one of the original sponsors of the
investigation in April 1989 and followed through in August 1989. He is the
’’owner” of all the information and ultimately - perhaps after the Coroners
Inquests have concluded - will assume complete responsibility and possession of
all the information. It is a matter for him to decide whether he wishes to
respond to such requests at this time.
                                                             I Continued
                                       - 5 -

The only additional point I would like to add is to give you a definitive list of
everything contained within the product of the investigation. The following are
the broad categories of information collected. In deciding whether to accede to
a request, each, in my view, will have to be looked at on its own merits:

     (a)   Criminal Justice Act statements from witnesses taken for Lord Justice
           Taylor (LJT) and Her Majesty’s Coroner (HMC).

     (b) Documents seized on behalf of LJT/HMC.

     (c)   71 hours of video film received for LJT/HMC. (Most of the material
           is from the B B C and there are obvious copyright considerations).

     (d)   2,411 photographs drawn from the press, South Yorkshire Police and
           private sources obtained for LJT/HMC.     (There are also obvious
           copyright considerations).

     (e)   Recollections from witnesses not taken under caution or within the
           provisions of the Criminal Justice Act for LJT/HMC.

     (f)   Statements specifically obtained for H M Coroner for the purposes of
           continuity and death enquiries, etc.

     (g) Statements or transcripts of interviews under caution for the
         criminal/disciplinary investigation supervised by the Police Complaints
         Authority.

     (h) Video/audio recordings of the interviews at (g) above.

I trust this rather lengthy and complicated letter is of some assistance. I must
confess it has taken some unravelling to get to this particular point which you
might think has not taken your deliberations a great deal further. I would
therefore suggest that you make contact with me if you wish to discuss this
issue further.

You may also find it appropriate that we meet with Counsel to answer any
questions that he has specifically on this subject.

I look forward to hearing from you in due course. In the meantime I have
taken the liberty of forwarding a copy of this letter to Mr Stewart Anderson,
Mr Leslie Sharp, Mr Geoffrey Dear and Dr S L Popper.

 l   introduction


 Following the incident on 15 April 19S9, staff of the Health and Safety
 Executive visited Hillsborough Football Ground. The crush barriers in
 Pens 3 and 4 (central pen) , at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, were
 examined on 16 and 17 April 1989 and identified with a paint marker in
 accordance with a drawing supplied by Mr Paul Jackson, Sheffield
 Environmental Health Department. On each barrier the support locations
 were numbered sequentially from left to right when viewed from the pitch.

Barrier 124A appeared to have collapsed and a length of the horizontal
tube had become detached. This detached length of tube had been found on
the pitch in front of gate 3 in the perimeter fence at the Leppings Lane
end on 16 April 1989 by Dr Nicholson. It was kept in a secure place by
Club Officials and was placed in Pen 3 on 17 April 1989 so that it could
be examined in conjunction with the rest of the barrier. Subsequently on
17 April 1989 it was taken to the Sheffield Laboratory of the Health and
Safety Executive together with another small piece of tube found by Dr
Nicholson on 17 April 1989 (see 2.1, page 3 below).

On 24 April 1989 the damaged parts of barrier 124A, consisting of two
lengths of tube and two supports, were removed from Pen 3, under the
supervision of the authors of this report, and taken to the Sheffield
Laboratory of the Health and Safety Executive for metallurgical
assessment. The remainder of barrier 124A was removed by Mr P F Heyes
and HSE staff on 7 July 1989.

This report contains details of examinations performed both on site and
in the laboratory. The work vas carried out by the authors and by other
staff of HSE working on their instruction and under their general
supervision.

2 ON SITE EXAMINATION'

2.1 BARRIER 124A

Barrier 124A was located on the seventh, eighth and ninth steps of Pen 3
adjacent to Pen 2. The overall length of this barrier before collapse
vas estimated to be 7.5m including a tube overhang of 0.6m near the
radial fence adjacent to Pen 2. The horizontal distance from this
barrier to the perimeter fence at the front of Pen 3 was approximately
3.5m, and the distance of the tube end from the radial fence, separating
Pens 2 and 3, was 28mm. There were no other barriers between barrier
124A and the perimeter fence. A sketch of this barrier, showing our
opinion of its appearance before the incident, is shown in Figure 1.

The evidence suggested that, prior to the collapse, barrier 124A had
consisted of four vertical supports with a horizontal tube between them.
HSE staff numbered the supports 1,2,3 and 4, beginning at the end nearer
Pen 2.




                                 -1-
Each vertical support had consisted of two 1*nS'h J
angle, having a thickness of 6cm, inclined -t an angi        ,   6  ed
one another. During manufacture each front support leg
near the top to form a horizontal surface and had been j
?ear support leg by a triangular gusset plate. The latter h a d ^ b ' ^
rivetted to the two lengths of metal angle. The horizon
made from hollow circular section metal with an outside
60mm. An inverted U-shaped strap, approximately 50mm v i e ,   a
bolted to the top of each support, and this vas presumab y
retain the horizontal tube.

Figure 2 shows barrier 124a viewed from the pitch as it appeared on the
morning of 17 April 1989. The detached length of tube 1    a

the length of tube in contact with support 2 and the other ma

possible to locate this detached length of tube in the correc
position between supports 2 and 3. This detached length o tu *
been bent symmetrically about its mid-poir.t where the maximum deflection
was 133mm.

Support 4, shown in the foreground of Figure 1, had been moved forward
and twisted towards the front left-hand corner of Pen 3, vreved fro- the
pitch. The lower portion of the front leg had remained straight,
although by comparison with the front legs of other barriers, 1
appeared to have moved forward through an angle of 25 degrees
approximately. In so doing the front leg had broken away fro. the edge
of the concrete step in which it had been supported Se\eral p
detached concrete were observed nearby, two of which Hatched the
fracture on the step, shown in Figure 3. The upper portion of the from,
leg had suffered localised bending and it had been twisted mv ard s wi.h
respect to the other supports on this barrier.

The rear lee of support 4 had been deformed and kinked at the lower end
S a r thl Junction Slth a piece of reinforcing steel angle which had been
bolted on top of the original angle section. The latter had been thinned
by corrosion in the area where this deformation had occurred, pie re^r
leg also exhibited localised deformation and cracking in the vicin y
the lowest gusset plate attachment hole. The gusset plate appeared to be
relatively undeformed but had been moved inwards towards the other
supports. The tube retaining strap appeared to be intact and still
position.

 Support 3 had been deformed extensively and flattened so that it
 almost horizontal. The general direction of d e f o r m a t i o n was icow.:rds the
 front left-hand corner of the pen, viewed from the pitch At its lower
 end the front leg had been deformed adjacent to a piece of reinforcing
 anele, but both the latter and the surrounding concrete were
 undisturbed. The rear leg had been bent forward and the majority of the
 deformation had occurred at the junction with the concrete i'Jfh-dbeen
 step itself was intact. The gusset plate was undeformed but it h-d been
 torn from the upper part of the rear leg and moved ^ « d . The
 retaining the tube at support 3 had been straightened partially but the
 tube a ^ f a r e d to be captive at this position. A transverse
 the tube, in the vicinity of some tube wall corrosion, was visible under
 the strap.
 The length of tube in contact with support 3 had been bent by 200mm at
 midspan and it had a ragged fracture in a corroded region near the end
 further from support 3, i.e. the free end. The latter had presumably
 been located under the strap on support 4 before collapse occurred. The
 fracture in the tube corresponding with support 4 was partly transverse
 and partly longitudinal, the original manufactured end being deformed
 but not fractured. At some stage the tube had also been partially
 crushed at this location.

During the visit on 17 April, a small piece of metal, roughly
semi-circular in section, was found in Pen 3 by Dr C Nicholson amongst
the debris near gate 3 in the perimeter fence. The fracture on this
small piece matched that at the end of the tube corresponding to support
4. This end of the tube had apparently moved a distance of 1.4m in the
horizontal plane before coming to rest on the steps. In total, the
collapsed part of barrier 124A occupied an area measuring 4m along the
terrace and 1.6m down the terrace in Pen 3.

Supports 1 and 2 were free from damage and the length of tube between
them had not been deformed significantly. This length of tube contained
two circumferential welds positioned as follows when viewed from the
pitch side: one approximately 0.2m left from the strap on support 2; the
other 0.05m right from the strap on support 1. The tube had fractured
transversely under the strap on support 2 and a smaller diameter tube
insert was observed protruding a distance of 25mm from this fracture.
There vas evidence of considerable corrosion of the original tube under
this strap. The tube insert appeared to be approximately 150mm in total
length. The strap on support 2 had been velded to the tube on the left
side only. This vas the only location on barrier 124A where a strap had
been velded to the tube.

Support 1 had a piece of reinforcing angle attached to each foot and the
rear leg had been braced by an additional piece of angle acting as an
outrigger. Support 2 had a piece of reinforcir.s angle attached to the
front foot only with an outrigger on the rear leg.

2.2 OTHER BARRIERS IN PEN'S 3 AND 4

The remaining barriers in Pen 3 and those in Pen 4 vere examined. The
layout of all the barriers in Pens 3 and 4 is shovn schematically in
Figure 4. On each barrier the supports were numbered sequentially from
left to right as viewed from the pitch. Several barriers had been
fabricated with rectangular hollow section supports and these appeared
to be somewhat newer than the rest. Most of the old-style barriers had
been modified in some way, for example by reinforcing of the support
legs and welding of the horizontal tubes. Corrosion was evident at all
joints and intersections, and rust "jacking" had occurred at many of the
gusset plate/support leg junctions.

Most of the horizontal tubes on the older barriers were open-ended and
in two cases (barrier 125 near support 1 and barrier 128 near support 1)
holes in the tube vail, caused by corrosion ur.cer the support strap,
were clearly visible. An example of this is shcvn arrowed in Figure 5
which depicts the end of barrier 125 adjacent to barrier 124A in Pen 3.
The hole is approximately 25mm in diameter and its centre is 60mm from
the end of the tube.
2.3 EXCAVATION OF BARRIER 124A SUPPORTS 3 AND 4 ON 24 APRIL 1989

It vas agreed by the Inquiry that supports 3 and 4 on barrier 124A could
removed for laboratory examination. Three cylindrical cores, measuring
0.1m in diazeter and 0.4m in length, vere cut from the concrete steps at
positions specified by Mr C Pertee, a Principal Specialist Inspector in
the Technology Division of HSE, before excavation of the supports
commenced. Tr.ese cores, from steps 7, 8 and 9, vere identified by t e
letters P,Q and U respectively. After cutting, core P vas found to
contain a piece of the front foot from support 4 and core U vas found to
contain a piece of the rear foot of support 3.

It became apparent during excavation that each support leg had been
flattened and shaped to form a foot vhich had been positioned
horizontally in the ground and bolted to a base plate. The supports vere
freed by ur.screving, or grinding off the nuts in contact vith the feet
of the supports. In all cases the boundary between the support and the
concrete vas marked using yellov paint.

Vhen the front foot of support 4 vas exposed, considerable thinning and
loss of metal vas observed in the vicinity of the bend betveen the
upright and the foot. This area vas further veakened during core
drilling and the remaining ligament of metal, approximately 5mm vide and
0.8mm in thickness, became detached during removal of the Support. Part
of the front foot vas found to be in contact vith a reinforcing vire in
the concrete and a length of this vire vas removed for possible future
examination.

The pieces cf reinforcing angle, noted previously on the rear leg of
support 4 ar.d the front leg of support 3, vere observed to extend belov
the surface of the concrete to the bend at the start of the foot.

The length cf tube remaining in contact vith support 3 slipped out of
the strap curing lifting of the support. It vas apparent that this
length of tube had not been fixed intentionally to the strap and it had
been held temporarily in position by accumulated rust and debris only.

2.4 REMOVAL OF INTACT PART OF BARRIER 124A ON 7 JULY 1989

The feet of supports 1 and 2 vere excavated to a depth of 50mn
approximately and subsequently cut using an angle grinder. This
permitted both supports, and the length of tube betveen them, to be
removed in one piece.

    3.2 CONCRETE CORES

    The three cores are shown schematically in Figure 6. They were taken at
    different positions along the terrace but, for convenience, they are
    shown here in the same plane. Core P was extracted in three pieces: a
    cylindrical upper piece, approximately 85mm in length, which was
    composed of an upper layer (27mm in thickness) containing relatively
    fine aggregate, typically a few millimetres in section and a lower layer
    (52mm in thickness) containing coarser aggregate, typically 5-10mm in
    section; an irregular shaped intermediate piece, with a maximum length
    of 120mm, which contained the coarsest aggregate, typically 20-30mm in
    section, and bore an impression of a section of barrier support foot; a
    cylindrical low’er layer, 180mm in length also containing the coarsest
    aggregate (2G-30mm in section)

    Core Q was extracted in two cylindrical pieces: an upper piece,
    approximately 138mm in length, which was composed of an upper layer (23ir.ni

were location at the - o'clock and 8 o ’clock positions and their centres
would have been approximately 50mm from the open end of the tube at
support 4 before failure.

The extent of corrosion of tube 1/2 under the strap at support 2 was
disclosed when the strap was removed (Figure 12). Tube 1/2 was removed
subsequently from supports 1 and 2 to permit closer examination. This
revealed that two pieces of tube had been joined beneath support 2 by a
part circumferential veld which also served to join the strap to the
tube at this support. A 150mm long tubular insert (arrowed in Figure
12), with an outside diameter of 49mm and a wall thickness of 5mm, was
located inside the main tube at a position corresponding with support 2.
This reinforcement vas retained by means of a tack weld on the inside of
the main tube between support 2 and the adjacent circumferential weld in
the main tube, which had been noted on site. Hence, neglecting the
insert, the tube betveen supports 1 and 2 apparently consisted of three
pieces joined by: a circumferential near support 1; a circumferential
weld near support 2; a part circumferential weld beneath support 2.

An oval hole, shown in Figure 13 and measuring 35 x 15mm, was revealed
in the tube under the strap on support 1, at the 4 o'clock position when
viewed from the end nearer support 1. This hole had apparently been
formed by external corrosion of the tube under the strap.

A rolled-up newspaper vas found inside tube 2/3. This was part of a copy
of the "Yorkshire Telegraph & Star", dated Saturday 24 October 1931. A
piece of another nevpsper, "The Star" dated Saturday 26 September 1959,
vas found in tube 1/2. Various other itecs of debris were found
elsewhere in the lengths of tube.

3.3.2 Tube wall thickness measurements

The wall thickness of the tube at the fracture positions vas measured at
various locations around the circumference. The thickness range recorded
at each fracture is shovn below:

Support 2      0.4 to 4.4 mm

Support 3      1.6 to 4.5 mm

Support 4      1.1 to 4.5 mm (ignoringthe edges   of the   holes)

Measurements taken along the lengths of tube using anultrasonic
instrument showed that the wall thickness remote from the fractures was
in the range 3.2 to 4.9 mm. Corrosion was confined to regions about
70-75mm wide, centred on the support straps, and there were no areas of
pronounced thinning elsewhere. The ultrasonic thickness reading vas
5.0mm throughout the length of tube betveen the circumferential velds on
tube 1/2.

3.3.3 Microstructural examination

A transverse ring section vas cut from tube 3/4 at a distance of 65mm
from the fracture corresponding to support 3. Microexamination showed
that the tube had beer, canufactured from vrought iron and that it
contained a longitudinal, forged lap veld.
A microsection of a sample of paint removed from a similar position
shoved that the paint consisted of 13 coats plus an initial metal loaded
primer coat. The total thickness of these coats vas approximately 0.5 mm
Various microsections from tube 1/2 indicated that this length of tube
consisted of both vrought iron and lev carbon steel as follovs: the
length betveen the end nearer Pen 2 and the circumferential veld near
support 1 vas vrought iron; the length betveen the circumferential velds
vas lov carbon steel; the length ber-een the circumferential veld near
support 2 and the part circumferential veld beneath the strap on support
2 vas lov carbon steel; the length betveen the part circumferential
beneath the strap on support 2 and the fracture vas vrought iron.

3.3.4 Tensile tests

Tvo longitudinal tensile test pieces, identified as T343/1 and T343/2,
were machined from tube 3/4 near the end corresponding to support 3. Tvo
further longitudinal tensile test pieces, identified as T1221 and T1222,
vere machined from the central portion (lov carbon steel) of tube 1/2.
In order to minimize the effects of previous vork hardening, all test
pieces vere taken as near as possible to vhat vould have been the

3.3.5 Hardness testing

Hardness tests vere carried out on the ring microsection from tube 3/4
and on the microsections from tube 1/2 in accordance vith BS 427: Part
1:1961 (1981) "Method for Vickers hardness test: Testing of metals". The

3.4 SUPPORTS FROM BARRIER 124A

3 4.1 visual examination

Supports 1 and 2 had not been deformed. Supports 3 and 4 are shown after
excavation in Figures 14 and 15 respectively. Although the extent of the
deformation of supports 3 and 4 was noted on site (see section 2.1 of
this report) , a number of additional features became apparent in the
laboratory.

The legs of supports 3 and 4 had been corroded, particularly at the
Junctions with the concrete step and/or additional reinforcing angles.
At these locations the residual thickness was in the range 3.1mm to
5.9nm, compared with a nominal thickness of 6.3mm elsewhere. A
considerable amount of metal had been lost by corrosion from the
sub-surface region of the supports. For example, on the rear leg of
support 4 , a ligament of metal 8mm wide and 2mm in thickness was all
that remained of the original nominal 50 x 50mm angle section at a
distance of 150mm below the surface.

The front leg of support 3 and the rear leg of support 4 had been
reinforced with additional sections of steel angle. Both these
reinforcements spanned areas of corrosion on the sub-surface region of
the supports. In general on the collapsed supports, the most severe
sub-surface corrosion was located at a distance which varied from 50mm
to 170mm below the surface depending on which step the barrier had been
located.

3.4.2 Dimensions

In general, the width of the steel angle from which the support legs had
been, made was in the range 49 - 52mm and the thickness remote from
corroded regions was in the range 6.0 - 7.4 mm. In some above surface
regions of supports 3 and 4 the thickness of the angle had been reduced
by corrosion and buckling had occurred during collapse. This can been
seen in Figures 14 and 15 in which the thickness of the angle at the
positions indicated was:

           Support 3       (a)         4.6   to 5.9 mm
                           (b)         5.9   mm
           Support 4       (c)         1.5   mm
                           (d)         5.6   to 5.8 mm

The thickness of the steel angle in the sub-surface regions of supports
3 and 4 varied from zero, where through-thickness corrosion had
occurred, to 6.4mm.

3,4.3 Microexamination

Microsections were cut and prepared for examination from each of the
legs on supports 3 and 4 only. The following microstructures were
observed:

    Support 3   Front leg - 100% ferrite
                Rear leg - small amount of pearlite in ferrite in central
                            region: ferrite at edges.


                                 -9-                                        1
    Support 4   Both legs - small amount of pearlite in ferrite in central
                            region; ferrite at edges.

These microstructures were typical of low carbon or rimming steel.

3.4.4 Tensile tests

One tensile test piece was machined from each leg of support 3. The test
pieces were identified FL3 and RL3 and were tested in accordance with BS
18:1987 " Method for tensile testing of metals (including aerospace
materials)", and the following results were obtained:

                         ReH          Rm         A%

                       267 MPa      343 MPa      32
                       17.3 tsi     22.2 tsi

                       308 MPa      376 MPa      31
                       19.9 tsi     24.3 tsi

Both test pieces exhibited yield phenomenon and hence the upper yield
stress (ReH) was determined.

3.4.5 Hardness tests

Vickers hardness tests were carried out on the microsections taken from
the support legs. These tests vere conducted in accordance with BS 4
Part 1:1961 (1981) "Method for Vickers Hardness Test - Testing of
metals" and the following results were <


    Support 3    Front leg     105 - 109 HV
                 Rear leg      113 - 125 HV

    Support 4    Front leg     112 - 140 HV
                 Rear leg      121 - 141 HV

These results are typical of lew carbon steel.

4 ASSESSMENT

Barrier 124A had consisted originally of a horizontal tube and four
vertical supports. The barrier had failed apparently by partial collapse
and fracture of supports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the horizontal tube
at supports 2, 3 and 4. The length of tube which had been located
between supports 2 and 3 (tube 2/3) had been bent uniformly to give a
maximum permanent deflection of 133mm at midspan. The portion of the
tube which been located between supports 3 and 4 (tube 3/4) had been
bent uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 200mm at
midspan. Tubes 2/3 and 3/4 had been deformed in a horizontal plane
towards the pitch. Tube 1/2 and supports 1 and 2 had not been deformed.

Laboratory examination showed that most of the tube had been made^from
wrought iron and each support had been made from two lengths of steel
angle section joined at the top by a steel gusset plate.  Part of the
original wrought iron tube betveen supports 1 and 2 had been replaced at
some time by a 2m length of lov carbon steel. In addition, the tube had
been strengthened at support 2 by insertion of a internal tubular '
r e i n f o r c e m e n t . Thus tube 1/2 was probably stronger than the rest of the
tube and this may, in part, explain the lack of deformation in this
region. In addition, supports 1 and 2 had been strengthened by
reinforcement with angle section at three of the four feet and by
bracing of the rear legs with outriggers.

The tube fractures had occurred in areas which had been located under
the metal straps designed, presumably, to retain the tube. The tube wall
thickness, nominally 4.5mm, had been reduced significantly by external
corrosion under each strap. In some cases holes had been present in the
tube at these locations before collapse occurred. Corrosion here
appeared to be a highly localised phenomenon which was confined to a
distance of 30mm to 35mm either side of the centreline of the strap.

In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of ductile
failure of wrought iron in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. The
region of brittle fracture, noted in the tube near support 3, was the
last part of the tube to fracture at this location. The change in
fracture mode can be explained in terms of increased constraint as the
fracture entered thicker material and an increase in strain rate as the
fracture propagated round the tube. Both these factors would tend to
promote brittle fracture.

Corrosion at the tube/support junctions was predictable because liquid
would have been retained in crevices under the strap and the surface of
the tube under the strap had not been painted. At the open end of the
tube, near support 4, internal corrosion had also contributed to
deterioration of the tube since there was access for rainwater. Here the
tube wall had been perforated by corrosion under the strap at two
locations producing holes which we estimate would have been
approximately 10mm and 20mm in diameter before the collapse. The centres
of these holes would have been located approximately 50mm from the open
end of the tube at support 4. They would have resembled the hole in the
tube on barrier 125 (Figure 3) and, in our opinion, they would have been
readily visible to the naked eye.

The direction of collapse of supports 3 and 4 appeared to be towards the
front left-hand corner of Pen 3, as viewed from the pitch. For the most
part the supports had been buckled and bent at locations which had been
weakened by corrosion. Although there was considerable sub-surface
corrosion of these supports, this played no part in the collapse. The
concrete which broke away at the front foot of support 4 did so because
this support had been positioned along the riser of a step in the
terrace.

In all cases the most severe sub-surface corrosion on the feet of
supports 3 and 4 had been located near the lower end of the region of
concrete containing the coarser aggregate. One possible explanation for
this could be that the height of the terrace had been raised at some
stage and the sub-surface corrosion may have occurred at or near the
original junction between the support feet and the terrace. This would
have reduced the effective height of the barriers.
The use of vrought iron tube, and the method of tube fabrication,
suggests that barrier 124A was many years old. British Standards
governing the use of vrought iron tube were in use in the 1920s and
1930s but are now obsolescent. The discovery of dated sections of
newspaper in the tube indicates that parts of barrier 124a were at least
58 years old, although clearly this barrier had received several
modifications during its lifetime.

5 CONCLUSION’S

5.1 The tube on the collapsed part of barrier 124A had been made from
wrought iron.

5.2 The tube on the collapsed part of barrier 124a had fractured at
supports 2, 3 and 4 in regions where considerable localised corrosion
had occurred.

5.3 The legs of supports 3 and 4 on barrier 124A had been made from low
carbon steel angle section which had been corroded in some areas.

5.4 Two other barriers in Pens 3 and 4 contained tubes which had been
perforated by corrosion at support locations.

In our opinion,

5.5 The general direction of collapse of barrier 124a was towards the
lower left-hand corner of Pen 3, as viewed from the pitch.

5.6 Two holes, caused by corrosion, had been present in the tube of
barrier 124A at the junction with support 4 before the collapse
occurred and these would have been visible to the naked eye.

NOTE FOR FILE:


HILLSBOROUGH - INQUEST


Had a telephone conversation with Peter Metcalf this date.

He has received a letter from HM Coroner     asking   for   names   and addresses
of witnesses we may wish to call.

We agreed he will respond and make the following points:-

   a.   The Contribution Hearing is about to start in the High Court
        and important evidence of value to the Inquest will in all
        probability emerge there and will be notified.

   b.   Then outline our general stance that events outside the
        gates were of limited influence in terms of the actual
        deaths.  Turnstile signing and engineering factors are more
        important.

   c.   Emphasise the main points of                  statement.

   d.   Emphasise    the   police      view that    crowd   obduracy
        (non-co-operation) was of a most unusual degree and alcohol
        a far greater factor than the Taylor report states.


Peter Metcalf will ask HM Coroner to ask West Midlands, who have full access
to both used and unused statement and questionnaire material, to identify
the best non-police (independent) witnesses in this regard.

Peter Metcalf to fax letter once agreed.

Will speak again Monday next (1 October) to review latest position.

NOTE FOR FILE;


CONTRIBUTION HEARING - 2 OCTOBER 1990 - HIGH COURT, MANCHESTER


Attended a meeting this date chaired by Mr William Woodward QC, at his
Chambers in Nottingham.   Also present were Richard Payne, Barrister-at-law;
a junior barrister;     Peter Metcalf and Belinda Norcliffe (solicitors),
Hammond Suddards; Stephen Walker, Joint Secretariat; ________________ (chief
claims officer),              (area claims manager) and other officials from
Municipal Mutual Insurance Company.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the best way forward from the
point-of-view of the Contribution Hearing in the High Court in October.

Peter Metcalf spoke of having met the Judge earlier this date.      The Judge
made it clear that on his reading of the evidence available to him at this
time, he was of the view that the police were clearly negligent, especially
in view of the very clear view they had over the terraces and he was
surprised an out-of-court settlement had not been arrived at.       There was
no balancing comment from the Judge that he saw the other parties extensively
liable although clearly he does expect them to make a contribution.

In view of the above the point made by the lawyers was our stand must be
realistic - the police were to some degree negligent; we are pursuing
'contribution' ; the best way of doing this is to attack and not to adopt
a defensive stance;   and, the worst thing we can do is to try and defend
the absolute indefensible.     Furthermore, if we did try and be on the
defensive we would have a re-run of the Public Inquiry with a very negative
impact on the Force which will result.


Witnesses

A discussion followed on the use which might be made of the "at risk seven"
at the Hearing.

The fact they are all individually represented makes the situation somewhat
difficult in that any attempt at briefing as to the police case may be seen
as contradicting the advice given by their respective lawyers.

All have been approached and asked if they will give additional statements
expanding on their original statements and what they said at the Inquiry
as recorded in the transcripts.    Only Superintendent Murray has responded
and the rest are clearly reserving their defences.    Peter Metcalf made the
point that if called they may well try and vindicate themselves from earlier
criticism.
                                        - 2 -


The final decision was that none of the seven will be called.    With the
exception of Superintendent Murray we have no proofs of evidence and the
legal advice was it would be folly to call them without these.   They may
of course be called by the other side so the efforts to date to tell them
of likely questioning by way of supplying to them original statements,
transcripts, list of issues, David Phillips' and Brian Mole's reports, is
very sensible.

The police witnesses - in police terms - will now include

        Chief Superintendent Mole
        Inspector Bullas
        PC Smith (Liverpool Mounted)
        PC Finnegan
        Mr Herold ) now
        Mr Goslin ) retired
        Mr Phillips (DCC, Devon & Cornwall)




Adjournment

The question of applying to the Judge           for an adjournment of this Hearing
until after the Inquest was discussed.

It was decided not to do so for the reasons below:-

   a.    we     manage without the "at risk seven" officers;
   b.   we have absolutely no idea what they are likely to say;
   c.   as part of this they have refused to give proofs of             evidence in
         advance of the Contribution Hearing;
   d.   the possible outcomes at (i) the Inquest and (ii)               in   terms of
         discipline are unknown.

It may be that once these are known         the attitude of the witnesses could
be extremely negative.


Evidence

In terms   of   evidence the   following was discussed     from the Taylor Interim
Report:-

   Paragraph    55 - This was agreed.

   Paragraph    74 - Second sentence - the word "must"      is not agreed.

   Paragraph    75 - The barrier is thought     to have collapsed    circa     3.00pm
                     and this will be our stance.

   Paragraph    82 - The notion that initially no officer took effective charge
                      is not agreed as Superintendent Greenwood was there and
                      this is clearly shown on the video.
  Paragraph 166 - It   is   accepted  that   de  facto we                had  accepted
                  responsibility for control of the pens                and that this
                  would not be done by stewards.

  Paragraph 174 - In the first sentence the word "more" should read "less".

  Paragraph 181 - Stewards were also involved in closing the tunnel.

  Paragraph 197 - We now agree that in the crush most people had no control
                  over their movements.

  Paragraph 228 - Final sentence     -   we   agreed    that    other    actions   were
                  required.

  Paragraph 229 - Heading - we don't      agree   the    word   "blunder"    but   will
                  agree "mistake".

  Paragraph 230 - First sentence - we dispute the word "full" as there
                  is no spectator limit in the terraces nor any means of
                  counting them in - how was anybody supposed to calculate
                  fulness?

  Paragraph 246 - This was agreed.

  Paragraph 249 - The word "vital" is not agreed.


I reacted very strongly against any acceptance that the police had, even
de facto, accepted responsibility for monitoring the relevant pens if this
was assumed to mean counting in, checking for over crowding, taking remedial
action if this was likely or seen to have occurred, as this would have been
impossible.

The above reflects rather poorly a five hour meeting during which all those
concerned considered carefully the evidence available and how to present
it without on the one hand prejudicing the officers "at risk" and at the
same time to make sense of the Contribution Hearing at which we are the
plaintiffs.

                        PRESS RELEASE
              THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM DISASTER


  Following a lengthy and detailed investigation by the West Midlands

  Police and close consideration of Lord Justice Taylor's report, the

  Director of Public Prosecutions, Allan Green Q.C., has concluded that

  there is ao°evidence upon which a prosecution for manslaughter or any

  other criminal offence may be brought against the South Yorkshire Police,

  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Messrs Eastwood and Partners or

  Sheffield City Council in connection with the disaster at Hillsborough

  Football Stadium Sheffield on 15th April 1989.



  The Director has also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to

  justify the institution of proceedings against any officer in the South

  Yorkshire Police force or any other person for any offence.




EMBARGOED UNTIL 3PM 30TH AUGUST 1990

    NOTE

    Telephone message received from Mr Kennedy (DPPs Office) at 4.10pm
    on 30.8.90 - the word "insufficient" will replace the word "no" on
    the fourth line of the above press release.

           Dear Sir

           H I L L S B O R O U G H STADIUM DISASTER

           The Director of Public Prosecutions has n o w received from the West
           Midlands Police the final report in this criminal investigation together
           with substantial supporting evidence and documentation. Y o u will recall
           in August 1989 that the Director requested a full criminal investigation
           following publication of the Interim Report produced after the Public
           Enquiry conducted by Lord Justice Taylor into the circumstances
           surrounding the disaster at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield on 15th April
           1989.

           The most careful consideration has been given to all the evidence and
           documentation. T h e Director has decided that there is no evidence to
           justify any criminal proceedings being instituted against South Yorkshire
           Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Messrs Eastwood and Partners
           or Sheffield City Council in connection with the disaster at the
           Hillsborough Football Stadium Sheffield on 15th April 1989.

           The Director has also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to
           justify proceedings against any officer of the South Yorkshire Police or
           any other person for any offence.

           I a m sending a copy of this letter to you by FAX.

           I a m also sending copies to the investigating officer, Chief Constable
           Leslie Sharp, to the Coroner D r P opp e r and to the Police Complaints
           Authority. Copies will also be sent to solicitors representing the
           Hillsborough Steering Committee, the Sheffield City Council, Sheffield
           Wedn esda y Football Club and Messrs E as t w o o d and Partners.

I also enclose a copy of a press release to be issued by the C r o w n
Prosecution Service Press Office at 3.00pm today.

DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS' DECISION REGARDING
THE CRIMINAL ENQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



I am extremely glad that the Director has made his decision not least because
the uncertainty until now has caused some officers and their families a
great deal of distress.    The Director's decision is not a matter for self
congratulation on the part of the South Yorkshire Police although it brings
with it a measure of relief.

I am all too acutely aware of the 95 souls who lost their lives and of the
distress and grief of their families and friends.   Grief travels in many
guises and South Yorkshire Police has known - since Hillsborough - its own
particular form of suffering.

It is now for other proceedings to determine what were the mistakes and
failings which gave rise to the disaster.       The Inquest proceedings have
yet to be finalised, a Civil Hearing is pending and questions of internal
discipline have yet to be concluded.      So whilst the question of criminal
liability has been dealt with by the Director of Public Prosecutions there
are important issues still to be settled.

I am handicapped from commenting in more detail because of the pending civil
trial in which the South Yorkshire Police seek to recover a contribution
from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and Eastwood & Partners in respect
of the compensation which has been voluntarily agreed to be paid by South
Yorkshire Police to the bereaved and injured.

Dear

Since the tragedy at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989, representatives of
deceased and injured persons have been pursuing claims for compensation
against the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
the Local Authority and Eastwoods & Partners.

You will be aware that on 30 November 1989 the former Chief Constable
of the South Yorkshire Police, Peter Wright CBE, after appropriate legal
advice, agreed with the Force Insurers to settle claims against the South
Yorkshire  Police  out-of-court  and  without  making  any  admission  of
liability.

The legal representatives of the South Yorkshire Police are now seeking
to  sue  the  other parties    concerned  in  the  Hillsborough litigation
proceedings for the recovery of a proportion of the monies already paid
and to be paid.   This will be in the form of court proceedings known as
a 'Contribution Action' which is a trial at which will be determined the
degrees of liability of the various parties.    The hearing of this Action
is fixed to commence at Manchester on 2 October 1990.

It is not yet known which, if any, South Yorkshire Police officers may
be called as witnesses and, to a great extent, the trial may well be
largely concerned with legal arguments, the factual background being agreed
by reference to written statements and transcripts of evidence already
given to the Taylor Inquiry.     However, some officers may be called by
our representatives or by other parties concerned in the Action.         As
Plaintiff in this case our witnesses will be heard first and the relevant
period will most probably be the first three weeks in October.        It is
anticipated that officers who were involved at the Leppings Lane end of
the ground are the ones, if any, who are likely to be called.

You were involved in a supervisory capacity at the Leppings Lane end on
15 April 1989 and there is, therefore, a possibility that you may be called
to give evidence at the hearing.    With that in mind I would ask that you
avoid taking annual leave during October 1990.      In the event that you
have already planned a period of annual leave during October would you
please let the Incident Room at Force Headquarters, extension 3131, have
details.

Once the situation becomes   clearer   I will   notify you as to whether   your
attendance is required.

Yours sincerely
                                                 tto s j   S j

    STATEMENT OP CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE




 It has been decided by the Chief Constable of South
 Yorkshire and the South Yorkshire Police Authority,
 in conjunction with their insurers, Municipal Mutull
 Insurance, that those bereaved and injured in the
 tragic events at Hillsborough stadium on 15th April
 at the ground should not have to wait the outcome of
 a further lengthy hearing in 1990 before receiving
 compensation.


 In the circumstances, the Chief Constable, in
conjunction with his insurers, intends to open
negotiations with the aim of resolving all bona fide
claims against him for compensation arising out of
the Hillsborough disaster.


The other parties presently named as Defendants in
the civi.l proceedings arising out of the Hillsborough
tragedy, namely, Sheffield Wednesday F.C., Eastwood
and Partners and Sheffield City Council, have been
offered the opportunity of joining in the course of
action now taken on behalf of the South Yorkshire
Police, but have refused to do so.   it is the
.intention of the Chief Constable and his insurers to
pursue legal action against those parties to recover
moneys paid out to the claimants pursuant to today's

   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S interim
   report on last April's disaster at Hills­
  borough stadium, when 95 people died,
  placed the bulk of the blame squarely on
  the shoulders of South Yorkshire Police.
  Six m onths after the event, that verdict is
  bitterly disputed by rank and file officers

  to the force, and that the role of a large                                                                                                  A

     Last month, a group of officers who
  w ere am ong the 800 on duty for the semi
  final, gathered at Sheffield Police HQ to re­
 count their experiences to Police Federa­
 tion vice chairman Dick Coyles and our
  Parliamentary adviser, Michael Shersby,
 MP. Both men described the long meeting
 as 'distressing and disturbing'. Mr Coyles
 said; "I hope I never have to attend another
 like it. These men and w om en have been
 through a hellish experience and they are
 labouring under a terrible sense of in­
 justice."
     Nearly all the officers concerned have
 been counselled by a stress counsellor
 engaged by the force. All have been deeply
 affected by the horrors they w itnessed
 th at day. There is no doubt at all that their    gates as kick off time approached

                     DRAFT OF PROPOSED SUMMARY OF AGREED FACTS


Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was formed in 1867 and elected to the
Football League in 1892.  Sheffield Wednesday moved to their present ground at
Hillsborough in 1899. Rubbish was tipped at either end of the pitch to form
banking and a stand moved from their previous ground was erected on the site of
the present South Stand.  This was replaced in 1913 by the exisiting South
Stand, the Spion Kop being added in 1914, the North Stand in 1961 and the West
Stand in 1965 following the decision to stage a number of World Cup games at
the venue in 1966.

Since 1912 30 FA Cup Semi-Finals, 19 International and 3 World Cup matches have
been played at this venue.  In, addition the stadium has been used to stage
religious meetings, a basketball display, world class tennis and schools
display for the Queen in 1954. The record crowd for the ground is 72,841 in
1934.

Hillsborough Stadium was designated in 1979 under the safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975. An inter-agency group known as the ’Officer Working Party’ was set
up to monitor safety aspects of the stadium.  They met twice annually or such
shorter periods as were necessary.  It was comprised of the following
representatives:

1.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
2.   South Yorkshire Police
3.   South Yorkshire County Fire Service
4.   South Yorkshire County Council and later City of Sheffield
     Metropolitan District Council
5.   Consultant Engineers (Eastwood and Partners).

They would sometimes meet ’on site’ and discuss and approve alterations for
example, the removal of barrier 144 from enclosure 3 (this has been referred to
by many witnesses as Pen 3) in 1986.

The Leppings Lane End of the Ground has been the focus of attention throughout
the Inquiry. On 15 April 1989 this End was allocated to the Liverpool Football
Club Supporters and in order to gain entry into the ground, whether it be to a
seating or standing area, supporters first had to negotiate the ironperimeter
gates situated at the funnel entrance to the ground immediately before the
turnstiles.  These gates are set out in a bank of six double gates and are
situated across the mouth of the entrance into the ground from Leppings Lane.
They are made of wrought iron and painted blue.

Having negotiated these gates the supporters would enter a courtyard.  This
area is shaped like a funnel between the outer perimeter gates and turnstiles 1
to 16 and A - G. In normal league matches access can also be given to
turnstiles 19-22 and 23-28.  This was not so on 15 April 1989.

The courtyard is divided by a wall of metal construction running from the
perimeter gates to the brick wall of turnstile 16. There is also a metal
barrier running almost parallel to this from half way across the courtyard to
the wall adjoining turnstile G. The effect of this is to divide the courtyard
between the two banks of turnstile 1 to 16 and A to G and create a funnel for
people towards the appropriate turnstiles depending on which part of the ground
they wish to enter.

The wall of metal construction was built in 1985 to segregate home and away
supporters. At about'"the same' time proposals by Eastwood and Partners, which
would have achieved enclosures having their own turnstile entrances and
individual crowd capacities, were rejected by the Club.
                                       -   2 -

There are a total of 95 turnstiles at Hillsborough, 12 of which (Nos 77 - 88)
were not in use for reasons of segregation on 15 April 1989. Nottingham Forest
fans were allocated 60 and Liverpool the remaining 23 all from Leppings Lane.

The 23 turnstiles in Leppings Lane contained in two sections 1 to 16 and A to
G, are divided by the metal wall previously mentioned.  They were designed in
such a way that turnstiles 1 to 10 served the West side of the North Stand
seated area, 11 to 16 the West Stand seated area and A to G the West Stand
terraces.  In actual fact turnstiles 11 to 16 and A to G give access to the
same concourse area at the rear of the West Stand. Confusion was caused by the
turnstiles being signed from left to right A.C.B. The tickets given to
supporters added to the confusion and the generallayout once inside the iron
perimeter gates caused congestion if a supporter needed to get from turnstiles
A to G to 1 to 16 or vice versa.

As a result if a supporter went through the outer perimeter iron gates towards
turnstiles A-G and found he needed turnstiles 1-16 he would have to return
through the outer perimeter iron gates into Leppings Lane and then to the
correct turnstile.

Also in this area are three Exit Gates A, B and C. These Gates are large
concertina type metal gates measuring 4.064 metres (13’4") across and 2.184
metres (7’2") high, except ’B ’'gate which is 3.2 metres (lO’e") high.  They
were built in 1985 during modifications to the turnstiles and concourse area.
Both sides of the gates closed towards the centre and are operated from the
inside only they were painted blue and were capable of being locked and
bolted.  In each pair of gates one was fitted with a non-opening glass
observation panel at about eye level.

Looking from Leppings Lane Gate ’A ’ is situated to the left of turnstile 1 and
adjoins the outer perimeter wall of the ground running parallel to Vere Road.
Gate ’B ’ is at the end of the metal wall across the courtyard and between
turnstiles 16 and A. Gate ’C ’ is located to the right in the wall running
parallel with the River Don beyond turnstiles A to G.

Emergency Gate ’E ’ is a small concertina type gate opening from inside only and
located in the wall running parallel with the River Don, immediately before it
joins the side of the South Stand and behind the Police Control Box.

Beyond the turnstiles and behind the West Stand is a concourse area which is
divided into three sections.  Each of these sections serves a different part of
the West and North Stands and the West Terraces.  The three sections are
created by a metal fence and a brick wall.  There was no access from the
central concourse through the metal fence to the North Stand section but a
gate in the brick wall did give access throughout the standing terrace
concourse area.

Entrance through turnstiles 1-10 would only give access to the North concourse
area and thus the seated North Stand.

There were a total of six portacabins on the concourse at the rear of theWest
Stand. Of these, two serviced the turnstiles in the northern part of the
concourse at the rear of turnstiles 11-16. The portacabins were variously used
for selling programmes or souvenirs and in one case by the Police to store
property seized from supporters.   One of these portacabins was positioned
behind gate ’B ’ near to the brick wall giving access throughout the stand
terrace concourse area.

Having entered through one of the turnstiles A to G and on the southern part of
the concourse, supporters could either go to their left through the gate in the
wall and into the central concourse area giving access into enclosures 6 and 7
or up to the West Stand seating area; straight ahead into the tunnel and
enclosure 3 and 4; or round to the right and either up another access into the
seated area or alongside the West Stand into enclosure 1 and 2.
                                       -   3 -



That explained, the main sign for the standing areas, measuring 2.591 metres
(8’6") x .305 metres (1’) was immediately above the entrance to the tunnel and
comprised of the word ’STANDING’ in .18 metres (7") letter painted in blue on a
white background.  Positioned on both sides of this sign were the letters B + A
respectively.  In the normal course of events, following letter ’B ’ would take
supporters along the left hand side of the tunnel and into enclosure 4.
Likewise following the letter ’A ’ would take supporters up the right hand side
of the tunnel and into enclosure 3.

The only other sign on this concourse section indicating a standing area was a
small one at a height of 3.658 metres (12’) in letters .09 metres (3%") high on
a concrete pillar to the right supporting the West Stand.   This directs
supporters along the side of the Stand and into enclosures 1 and 2. No signs
existed on this part of the concourse to indicate that access to standing areas
in enclosures 6 and 7 could be, reached by going to the left through the gate in
the wall.

The tunnel is 22.17 metres (72’9") long and unlit.   It is located under the
seating area of the West Stand and is used primarily by supporters entering
through turnstiles A to G. Rising at first it then levels off briefly before
descending towards the terraces on a gradient of around 1 in 6.
The recommended gradient from the Green Guide is 1 in 1 0 . The tunnel was of
course built prior to the introduction of this Guide.

As the tunnel opens out on to the terrace a radial fence divides enclosure 3
and 4. Enclosure 3 is on the right and enclosure 4 on the left as you enter.
Short walls on either side extend out into the enclosures.  There are gates at
the tunnel concourse entrance capable of being closed.  In addition it is
possible to close off each enclosure (3 and 4) by a gate to each at the
enclosure end of the tunnel.

At the rear of the terraces and where the radial fences finish are gates which
provide access to those persons wishing to walk along the terraces.  Thus there
is unrestricted access to each enclosure if these gates are left open. Anyone
entering enclosures 3 and 4 and wishing to then enter enclosures 2 or 5 would
in effect have to take a couple of paces backwards to the rear of the pen and
walk alongside the real wall.

Running parallel to the goal line across the front of the West Stand seated
area, are the terraces with a total of 7 enclosures, numbered by their gates
from left to right as you look at them from the pitch, i.e. enclosure 1 is in
the South West Corner, immediately under the Police Control box and enclosure 7
is in the North West Corner.  Both corners are banked higher than the rest of
the terracing, with enclosure 5 being a sterile area or void, unused by
spectators.  The terracing gradient has been identified a$ between 1 in 4 and 1
in 4.5. on the West Terraces.

There are 3 rows of barriers on the terraces in enclosures 3 and 4 running
parellel with the goal line. The barriers are of two designs; those fitted by
Husband and Co., the previous engineers, and those fitted by Eastwood and
Partners the current engineers.  In 1986 barrier 144 was removed from enclosure
3 to facilitate easier crowd movements.  This has been the only significant
change in barrier configuration on the Leppings Lane terraces.

Perimeter fencing was installed in 1977. At the front of the terrace this
fence is 2.896 metres (9’6 ”) high, comprising of heavy gage metal wire
supported at intervals by metal posts set in concrete which in turn are
supported on the pitch side by metal frames. At the top of each of these
fences .381 metres (1’3”) of wire folds inwards. This is designed to make it
harder for fans to climb over the fence onto the perimeter track or the pitch.
The wire is welded to the metal supports for strength and rigidity.
                                      -   4 -

In each of the enclosures there is a numbered gate to the perimeter track which
is primarily designed for access to the enclosure in an emergency.  Eastwood
and Partners have measured the width of Gate 3 as 0.85 metres (2*9%") and Gate
4 as 0.83 metres (2’8%")between the gate posts.   These gates are smaller than
the Green Guide recommendation (1.1m) (3’7") but they were constructed before
this minimal width was suggested.

Originally the West Terrace was completely open. Radial fencing between the
perimeter fence and wall of the West stand, and which created three large
enclosures, was installed in 1981. Further radial fencing was added in 1985
dividing the large centre enclosures into what are now enclosures 3, 4 and the
void enclosure 5. This radial fencing is 1.68 metres (5’6") high and comprises
of blue painted metal bars and was erected at the request of the Police to
facilitate crowd control.  This was agreed by the Officer Working Party.
Enclosure 1 and 2 and 6 and 7, are not further subdivided by radial fences.  In
fact they are still the large enclosures as orginally created in 1981.

Schedule 2, Paragraph 3, of the Safety certificate specifies the number of
spectators admitted to the stadium. Part 1 of Schedule 3 details the number of
spectators permitted in various section of the ground, a figure which should
not be exceeded.   The relevant capacities are:-
                     West terrace         7,200
                     North West terrace   2,900
In late 1989 some 6 months after the disaster it was discovered that the
capacity for the North West Terrace was wrong having been calculated with the
wrong scale.   The result was that 2,900 was excessive.  The revised figure is
now 1,500.   The figure is based on an amended Certificate issued by Sheffield
City Council on the 24 November 1989.

In 1981 when the first radial fences were installed on the terraces, creating
the 3 large enclosures a crowd capacity of 2,200 was declared for the centre
enclosure by Dr EASTWOOD based on calculations in the 1976 Green Guide. When
this large enclosures was divided in 1985 into enclosures 3 and 4 and the void
5, Eastwood and Partners split the capacities as follows:- 1,200 into enclosure
3 and 1,000 for enclosure 4. These figures were included on a plan of
Eastwoods but the author of the figures has not been identifed.    These new
capacities were never referred, it seems, to the Council or the Club in order
that the Safety Certificate could be amended.    In any event the ability to
restrict those enclosures to those capacities   was not possible with the
turnstile system in operation..

It also appears that despite the introduction of these additional radial fences
which created the void enclosure 5, no amendment was considered to the overall
capacity of the West Terrace even though the barrier configuration remained the
same (until 1986).

Access to the West Stand which is all seating is by way of turnstiles 11 to 16
and A to G, using the staircases off the concourse.  The front of the West
Stand overlooks the terraces, giving seated spectators a view of the terraces.
The West Stand is divided by gangways for safety purposes. At the rear of the
West Stand is a refreshment kiosk.

The Police Control Box is situated in an elevated position in the South West
Corner of the ground overlooking the Leppings Lane Terraces, a distance of 35
meters (114’10") from gate 3 and 47.5 meters (lSS’lO") from Gate 4. The
control Box houses the Police Communications System and Video Monitors for the
five fully remote controlled cameras which are operated from this location.
There is also a facility for the Police to over-ride the ground tannoy system
usually operated by the disc jockey.

A Club Control Room is situated on the ground floor at the rear of the South
Stand, close to the players changing rooms.
                                      -   5 -

There is no view of the pitch from this room. The occupants monitor the entry
through the turnstiles around the ground, with a computer supplying ’print
outs’ for the ground management purposes.  The room also contains the TV
monitors from the various cameras located at turnstiles around the ground.
Recordings are made on a bank of 16 video recorders.  There is an ability to
monitor any one of the five C.C.T.V.s being operated by the Police from their
control box on request to them. A telephone connects the Police Control to the
Club Control Room.

In addition this Club Control room, acts as the main base station for the Club
personal radio scheme.  This radio system is used by Senior Stewards, Security
Officers and Management on a talk-through basis.

The Director’s Box is centrally situated overlooking the pitch in the upper
tier of the South Stand.  There is access to the board room, the office complex
below, the Nostalgia Bar and Steps Restaurant to the rear of the South Stand.

The current tannoy public address system was upgraded in 1988 and broadcasts to
locations in and around the ground, including the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
Capable of being directed selectively to areas of the ground the system is
operated from the South Stand near to the PoliceControl Box, by a Disc Jockey
employed by the Club. Normally used for Club announcements and musical
entertainment, the system can be over-ridden by the Police from their Ground
Control Box.

Situated to the right of the Police Control Box, when looking from the pitch
above the Finlux TV and video sign is an electronic clock. A board is also
located there being capable of displaying messages.

The Police Room is located under the North Stand adjacent to the First Aid
Room.  It is used as the detention and documentation room for persons arrested
or being ejected from the ground.

A first Aid Room is required under Schedule 2, Paragraph 8(1) of the Safety
Certificate.  This room, which was upgraded in 1979, is manned by the St John
Ambulance Brigade personnel during matches.  St. John Ambulance Staff advise
the Club on the purchase of equipment for the room which is located on the
ground floor at the rear of the North Stand alongside the Police room. A
gymnasium is situated at the rear of the North Stand.

A purpose built commentary box is located above the South Stand.

As previously mentioned, the Club have staged many large scale functions at
Hillsborough.  These can give some indication of the level of their experience
and that of the other agencies involved. That said, during the course of
enquiries in connection with the disaster evidence has emerged of crushing
involving supporters in the West Stand terracing at previous F.A. Cup Semi
Finals.

The Semi-Finals concerned are 1956, 1981, 1987 and 1988.

In 1956 a match was played between Birmingham City and Sunderland and took
place on 17 March 1956, where a surge of people caused crushing on the West
Stand terracing.

On 11 April 1981 a Semi-Final was held between Tottenham Hotspur and
Wolverhampton Wanderers.  This is the best document and the most serious of the
previous incidents.  Tottenham fans arrived late due to a combination of
difficulties on the Ml Motorway and local diversions.  There was crushing on
the Leppings Lane terraces and during this match.
                                      -   6 -

The Police and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club held discussions following
this incident and the evidence points to the later implementation of the radial
fences forming initially five large enclosures (the centre enclosure being
later divided into enclosures 3,4 and 5), being the action taken to prevent a
similar incident.

On 12 April 1987, a Semi Final between Leeds United and Coventry City was
played. Evidence from one supporter suggests there was overcrowding on the
Leppings Lane terraces.

In 1988 the Semi Final took place between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.
Evidence obtained suggested crushing occurred on the Leppings Lane terraces.
There is no evidence, however, to show the 1987 or 1988 incidents were brought
to the notice of the Police or Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

The Hillsborough Football Stadium was designated under the provisions of the
Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975, on 1 January 1979, the safety Certificate for
Hillsborough was issued by South Yorkshire County Councul on 21 December 1979,
on Sheffield Wednesday Football Club’s promotion to the Second Division.
Attached to the Certificate are a number of schedules.  Schedule 1 deals with
Interpretation; Schedule 2, the General Terms and Conditions; and Schedule 3,
Crowd Capacity and Safety Stewards.

South Yorkshire County Council, as the issuing authority, was responsible for
the administration and supervision of the certificate until their demise in
1986 when reponsibility was transferred to Sheffield City Council.  The Officer
Working Party, now called the Sheffield City Council Safety at Sports Grounds
Advisory Group, at the time of this disaster comprised of representatives from
Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Eastwood and
Partners, South Yorkshire Police, South Yorkshire Fire Brigade and South
Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

At the time the County Council transferred responsibilty for licensing to the
City Council, there was a prepared schedule of responsibilities under the
Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 in existence.  This document showed the
responsibilities of the County, Police, Fire Brigade and Building Control
Authority. According to correspondence this scheduule was adopted by the City
Council which meant they then assumed the former County and Building Control
functions.

In July 1987, these responsibilities were re-drawn by the City Council in draft
form in a document entitled ’Division of Responsibilities between Authorities’,
which proposed responsibilities being divided between the Building Surveyors
(Department of Land and Planning) and the Director of Environmental Health and
Consumer Services.
                     DRAFT OF PROPOSED SUMMARY OF AGREED FACTS


The present road network from Liverpool to Sheffield, has a motorway road
system around Manchester, which now provides a complete bypass to the south of
the City which was incomplete on 15 April 1989. At that time the M63 finished
at Portwood roundabout, to the east of Stockport at the junction with the
A560. The final part of the M63 providing the last link to the M67 at Denton
was not opened until 28 April 1989.

The recommended route published in the Liverpool Programme advised supporters
to follow the M62 east out of Liverpool, north of Manchester, across the
Pennines to Junction 42 of the Ml. It was then suggested that they travel
south on the Ml, leaving at Junction 35 for Sheffield.  Supporters who followed
that route did not report any great delays.

It is clear that many Liverpool supporters chose to follow the M62 or M56 east
of Liverpool, then joining the M63 to the west or south of Manchester.  This
motorway terminated to the east of Stockport and supporters were then required
to follow the A560 to Mottram in Longdendale, where they could join the A57
over Snake Pass to Sheffield.  Supporters who chose this route were the ones
subjected to long delays. However, some of the accuracy of this evidence has
to be viewed in the context that many people are confused as to their correct
location when they were delayed and also, they were frustrated by the hold-ups
and may have understandably felt the period of the delay to be longer than it
actually was.

M62, WEST OF JUNCTION 15 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

At 1106 hours a damage only road traffic accident occurred between a motor
cycle and a saloon car. The motorway, which at this point has four lanes, was
reduced by two lanes for only about 15 minutes. No reports of serious delays.

M62 JUNCTION 15 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

Between 0830 and 1345 hours, the   three lane    motorway at this point was reduced
by one lane, due to a third lane   closure for   essential central barrier
renovation.  During the closure,   traffic was   flowing slowly through the road
works and was only delayed for a   maximum of     10 minutes.

M62 BETWEEN   JUNCTIONS 21 & 22 BOTH CARRIAGEWAYS

Contraflow, two lanes in each direction.     Long termwork relating towidening
scheme. No serious delays reported.

M63 BETWEEN   JUNCTIONS 2 & 3 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

The three lane motorway at this point was reduced by one lane todirect       traffic
into a suitable configuration for approaching contraflow.

M63 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 3 & 6 BOTH CARRIAGEWAYS

Contraflow, two lanes in each direction. Long term work relating to widening
scheme. Long delays reported by supporters and coach drivers.

M63 END OF MOTORWAY PORTWOOD ROUNDABOUT

At that time the motorway terminated at a roundabout, at the junction with the
A560. Heavy congestion reported due to volume of traffic.   This delay varies
between a 1/2 hour and 1 hour 10 minutes between 1215 and 1325 hours.
                                      -   2 -




M67 END OF MOTORWAY MOTTRAM IN LONGENDALE

This is a traffic bottleneck caused purely by the combination of a heavy volume
of traffic and the road layout. At this location the motorway terminated into
a single lane carriageway, close to a crossroads controlled by traffic lights
in a small village centre.  The A560, which carried traffic from the M63, joins
the M67 at a rounabout at the terminus of the motorway,just  prior to this
point and this further contributes to the bottleneck.

As far as can be ascertained some 102 coaches containingLiverpool   supporters
travelled to Sheffield on 15 April 1989.

To evaluate the number of supporter who travelled to the ground in mini buses
and using their private vehicles is difficult, but all available parking within
a radius of approximately 1 1 / 2 miles from the ground was utilised.

Clearly the greater number of supporters travelled to the ground in this manner
and although traffic volume was heavy on all approach routes, traffic delays
were not a significant factor in the late arrival of fans.

A Map showing various routes from Liverpool to Sheffield and identifying
trouble spots is produced.

RAIL TRANSPORT

Two British Rail Stations were used for the transport of supporters, the
Midland and Wadsley Bridge.  The former was used for both Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest supporters and the latter for Liverpool supporters only. One
special train and three service trains from Liverpool conveyed a total of 825
supporters, 430 to Wadsley Bridge, with service trains from other areas
bringing this to a total of 1,337.

LICENSED PREMISES

Premises selling alcohol in and around the Sheffield area were identified and
sub-divided into full On Licences, that is public houses, and Off licences,
which includes shops and supermarkets.  The general opening hours for licensed
premises on this date were for public houses 11 am to 11 pm and off licences 8
am to 11 pm.

193 Public houses were visited in an attempt to identify those frequented by
Liverpool supporters on Saturday, 15 april 1989. These can be graded as
follows;-
10 Public   Houses remained closed on this date.
72 Public   Houses were frequented    bylocal persons only.
37 Public  Houses reported having less than 20 Liverpool supporters.
51 Public  Houses reported having in excess of 20 Liverpool supporters.
23 Public  Houses reported having in excess of 100 Liverpool supporters.

Seventy-four off licenses were identified as open. These were also visited and
enquiries show that some of thoses closer to the ground were particularly busy
prior to the kick off.  It is not possible to quantify this further.
POLICE ARRANGEMENTS

A comparison of the South Yorkshire Police orders for the Cup Semi Finals 1988
and 1989 has been made.

This reveals that the 1989 order was basically a repetition of the 1988 order,
although there was a reduction in manpower in some areas. Details are as
follows

The Chief Inspector in charge of Sub Section 2A and an Inspector in charge                       of
Serials 16, 17, 18 and 19 postfed to the front of Leppings Lane turnstiles
performed the same duties in 1988 and 1989.

An Inspector in charge of Serials 14 and 15, comprising 2 Sergeants and 20
Constables, was posted to the concourse area behind the West Stand, one serial
to the North and one South in Phase 1 (before kick off). There were no
officers specifically posted to the central tunnel during this phase.   In Phase
2 (after kick off) Serials 14 and 17 should have taken up a position in the
central tunnel but it appears they were overtaken by events.

Initially there were 5 mounted officers posted to Leppings Lane area. At 1415
hours approximately this was increased by the arrival of a further 8 mounted
officers who had escorted Liverpool fans from Wadsley Bridge Railway Station.
These can be sub-divided into 4 from South Yorkshire Police and 8 from
Merseyside Police and 1 from the Nottinghamshire Constabulary.  Between 1440
and 1452 hours this was supplemented by an additional 8 mounted officers, 3
South Yorkshire Police, 3 Merseyside and 2 Nottinghamshire Constabulary, making
a total of 21 in all.

In addition to these people there were 45 programme sellers, 50 catering staff,
15 lottery ticket sellers and 77 additional catering staff.

Each section of the Football Ground has stewards allocated. In the area of
Leppings Lane there were 37 stewards covering the West Stand, 23 Turnstile
operators covering the turnstiles in Leppings Lane.

As far as can be ascertained manning levels for both semi finals were similar
in numbers.

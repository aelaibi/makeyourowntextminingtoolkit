              in P EN 3 and after              a bout        15 minu te s      I was    joined     by my friends Paul

              C LA RK and A n d r e w BQQl/i.              We    stood talking          for a few moments              and    I

              t hen     n oticed   that     the PE N star te d to               fL*l    up.      As the    crowd       increased

              A n d r e w B O O TH was    behind me and P a q j ^ C L A R K was                 on my    right    hand side

              of me.         We were    together.             At^-a^fou t 3. Q pm      ( 15 Q Q ) later    I s ud de nl y felt

              crowd      p ressure      from    behind.           I sew Paul         C LARK move        right    forward

              virtually         up to the Per imetejy F eric i n g .                 I couldn't         do anything,          I

              just      couldnt    move and 'was/nemmed                  in by the mass           of    people,    all       being

              cr am me d      into PEN 3.         I then felt a surge                  from     behind me w h ic h

              tightened         up and    I couldnt             move anything.           I was     looking       forward to

              w h e re Paul      CLARK was,          but      I could not        see    him.      The m atch had         only-

              just      started.        I then       saw some _F_ans had             climbed      up on to the

              P a r im e t e r F am c:i n g and      over       on to the       pitch.         The Police       then    came and

              were      asi-crrig people       to move          back,    and a l t h o u g h    I tried to force myself

              faackwards, I c o u l d n ’t m o v e .              I heard       people     shouting       ’open the g a t e ’

              and      'we    cant move',       but after a little while                       the gate w hi ch        leads

              onto      the    playing a r e a was            opened and        people were        forced       through.           The

              s lo wl y start      to move        back.          The    game   had     been stopped        by now and             part

              was a little         boy.        He was         lifted up and          carried avjj^'^tYie fencing               on

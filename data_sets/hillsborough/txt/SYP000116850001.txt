                       I am Beverley Martin,       PC 3023 and stationed at W o m b w e l 1 Police

                       Station.      I paraded for duty at W o m b w e l 1 Pol ice Station at 9,00 am

(Z jS   f    d   t f   t n^ was    transported to Hillsborough Footbal 1 ground with other

                       officers.
        (i             I attended a briefing in the North Stand and then another briefing

                       with Inspector White.

                       I was in Serial 15, my Sergeant was PS B u r n s .       We were on duty inside

                       the ground at the West Stand turnstiles at Leppings L a n e .            We arrived

                       at the turnstiles at about 11.15 am after a detailed             briefing with

                       Inspector W h i t e .

                       The gate opened at about 11.30 am and supporters started to arrive

                       at about n o o n .

                       The supporters were only entering the ground in ones and twos and it

                       wasn't until about half t w o , twenty to three that things started to

                       buiId up at the tu rn st il e s.

                       Up to this time the supporters had been well behaved and in good

                       humour,    only a couple had complained that they had already been

                       searched.      I could tell that the supporters were buiIding up outside

                       the turnstiles and the large metal gate nearby,           I could hear people

behind the large gate shouting and s c r e a m i n g .

Supporters then started to climb onto the top ofthe large             metal gate

and onto the wall above the t u r n s t i l e s ,

At first I thought they were trying to get in because they d i d n ’t               j
                                                                                    I
have a t i c k e t , but soon realised from what they were saying,     that         j

they had cl imbed up to get out of the way of the c r u s h i n g .    They were

shouting that people were getting crushed and that they needed h e l p .

They then got onto the sm a l1 roof on top of the turnstiles and we

helped them to jump d o w n .     One of the Inspectors cl imbed onto the

small roof and helped them to get o v e r .         Some of the supporters

managed to get across the top of the metal gate and then onto the

wall at the other s i d e .                                                         j

Shortly after this one officer told me that the other large metal

gate was o p e n .   I then saw the other metal gate open        for a short time   j

I can't remember how many supporters came through.                                  ]

the Sergeants radio that all available officers were required at the

perimeter of the pitch.

The large metal gate opened again and a lot of officers from outside

the ground ran through and towards the centre t u n n e l .

Myself and a few of the other officers were told to stay by the

turnstiles as we were still needed at this loc a ti on .

It only seemed 1 ike a few minutes later that people coming from the

direction of the centre tunnel were shouting for help and assistance.

Myself and PC 3107 Pearson ran towards the centre t u n n e l , injured

people were staggering up the tunnel,          one man ran to me and told me

to get into the terraces as people were dying.

Both myself and PC Pearson ran through the tunnel to the back of the

terrace.    At this point I could only see heads of people,          the crowd

was so tightly p a c k e d .   At first I tried to push through but there

was hardly any room.         I think then people saw my uniform and more or

less pushed me t h r o u g h .   Cries for help were coming from different

directions.      People were shouting at me that other people were d y i n g .           j
I then got to a point where I saw what seemed 1 ike a pile of b o d i e s ,              j

abuse from supporters and could smell alcohol              in the air.                   j

Once the fans had got through the crowds with the injured I ran up                       j

Some supporters were still staggering up the tunnel and were suffering

from shock rather than any physical            injury.    I walked with them and         j

tried to comfort them.                                                               j

A lot of relatives by this time were getting frantic as they c o u l d n ’t          j
find their friends and r e la ti ve s .         Myself and other officers tried to !

comfort them as much as p o s s i b l e ,      but we were still getting abuse           j

from some of the s u p p o r t e r s .   One   man came up to m e , he pointed his       .

finger in my face and called me a"fucking mu r d e r e r ” .       For the rest          j

         of the afternoon I lost count of how ma n y times that was said to me

*       and other officers.

         When all the injured were out of the terraces, myself and other

         officers wre told to stand in a line at the entrance to the tunnel to

         stop supporters relatives going back into the terraces.

         I did this for a while,        but could see that people needed comforting.

         I remember standing with a lady who couldn't find her husband and a

         young man who was weeping on my shoulder.

         After this I cannot recal1 exactly what I d i d , I walked around and

|       reassured friends and re la ti ve s.

         I then met up with Sergeant Burns and          some of the other officers from

         my s e r i a l .   By this time all the fans   were leaving the s t a n d , both

         Liverpool and Notts F o r e s t .   We stayed by the turnstiles at the West

         Stand until        the majority had left the   ground.

         We then went to the North Stand for a          d e- b r i e f i n g .

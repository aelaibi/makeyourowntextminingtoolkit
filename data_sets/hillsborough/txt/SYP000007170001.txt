                      F ur th er        to my       previous      s t a te me nt s   I would      like to add the following.

                      On Saturday              15th April         1989       <150489)     I worked       in the       c a pa ci ty of

                      Special           C on s t a b l e a t the F .A . S em i- F in a l        football m a t c h betw ee n

                      the H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium,             Sheffield.

                      My       r ec ol le ct io n of the events                of that      day are      vague and        confused.

                      As a result of the disaster                            I was




                                                                                                                              I felt      like

                      a     *Zombi e . ’

                      As a result                 of this     I feel     that my memory,            my r e co l l e c t i o n of that           day

                      is possibly                 inaccurate.         I am unsure           of what time          I a r r i v e d at   the
                                                                                                                 PAGE          2
                                                                                                                 S621C

    L e pp i n g s Lane        entrance        to the g ro un d or even how              I came       to be on the

        pitch but       I did.

    By time         I got onto          the    pitch    it s ee m ed to be mass            confusion,          there

    were       police      off ic er s and s up po r t e r s all           over the      place.         I could see

        people who a p p e a r e d       to be    injured and           possi bl y dead,          lying    on the

        pitch.         I was      in a state      of shock.          I d i d n ’t know what          to do but my

        natural        instinet was           to he 1 p these people          in the      best w ay that          I could.

        I c a n ’t describe         to y ou     in a ny detail my exact m o v e m e n t s               over     the next

        half an hour or so.                  I know that         I a p p r o a c h e d several      people     lying on

        the   pitch a nd a s s i s t e d       if possible.            I did not give any of these

        people m o u t h - t o - m o u t h    or heart massage.

        I d e ci ded thaj* t here were            e nou gh       people deal in g w i t h the s i t u a t i o n

        at the LafSpings Lane                end of the g r ou n d a nd made m y w a y to the S pion

        K op end of the ground.
    —          -------------------
        I could     see that bodies              were     being carried from the L e p p i n g s Lane                    end

        to the       S pion Kop end of the groun d and then being                           placed on the           pitch.

        I a s s i s t e d to   carry a          numjy^r^of dead and             injured people               from the S pi o

        Kop end of the            pitch,       ^nto     the g y m n a s i u m w here a t e m p o r a r y m o r t u a r y

        had been set up.                        talking to some             of these      people,        comf or ti ng

        them and trying            to   reassure       them.        I am unable        to desc ri be a ny of

        these     people       in the detail.

        By this tiroe I really was                    in a state       of shock,       I c o u l d n ’t believe wnat

        1 was seeing.             I s ee me d to be on a u t o m a t i c         piiot.         My m e m o r i e s are

        very      confused a nd distorted.

        I can r e c a U ^ carrying a y o ut h who                  J./f'iow know to be, K e v i n Daniel

J       un;LL.1             m the       pitch to the g^rnnasiuffu                He was     the     last     person that

         I assisted        in carrying.           I    f/trs   t saw K e v in W I L L I A M S    lying     on the      pitch

        near to the goal a rea at the S p i on K op end of the ground.                                      At that

         stage he w a s n ’t on a h oardi ng               or a stretcher.

         I remember        that    there       were     several       people a r o u n d w here he         was   lying.

                I can't         recall a ny on e     giving     him m o u t h to mouth.               W it h the help of

                other     people,        who   I can *t r e c a l 1, K e v i n W I L L I A M S was          placed onto a

                h o arding a nd          carried    into   the gymnasium.               S om eo ne    i ns tr u ct e d me to

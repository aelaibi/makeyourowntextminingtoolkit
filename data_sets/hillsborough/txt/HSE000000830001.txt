STORAGE PLACES WITHIN PARTS OF BUILDINGS


84 Where storage in the open air or in separate
buildings is not reasonably practicable, LPG may be
stored in specially designed rooms in buildings that
comply with the conditions in paragraphs 85 to 94
below.

85 Except as provided in paragraph 56, the store
should be used only for LPG containers and access to
the store should be restricted to authorised people
who should not include customers.

86 The store should be on the ground floor and have
at least one outside wall. The walls, doors, ceilings
and floor etc which separate the storeroom from the
rest of the building should be of not less than 30
minutes’ fire resisting construction and be sufficiently
robust not to be damaged by normal usage. Where the
building is also used for residential purposes 60
minutes’ fire resisting separation should be provided
between the two occupancies with, where possible, no
connecting doors or direct access. A suitable
automatic Tire detection and alarm system should be        Fig 6   Indoor storage

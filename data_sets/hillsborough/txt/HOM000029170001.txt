   You will recall the other day that I mentioned to you that                            t
                                                                                        two
   documentaries were being made independently by BBC TV (out of Pebble Mill)
   and Yorkshire Television. This has been agreed with Lord Justice Taylor
   directly who will have the right before showing to view both finished
   products. Both documentaries are concentrating on the investigation, which
   from their perspective is most' interesting, not least of ail the high
   technology used. Of course, you are carrying out a major part of the
   technical research and much o f‘what you are doing will naturally be of
   interest to the documentary producers. The purpose of my writing,
   therefore, is to enquire whether the Health and Safety Executive would be
   prepared to be involved in the'making of these programmes.
   Our view in the West Midlands is that the documentaries will show that a
   very thorough enquiry has been'undertaken, the obvious benefit being that
   there has bee.n no "whitewash".! It will also be beneficial to us in
   publicity terms so far as the professionalism of our work. Of course the
   same applies to you and I would hope, therefore, that you feel that you
   could get involved.

   Bearing in mind the investigations will soon cease to have quite as much
   visual impact there is a need for an early response to the television
   companies, particularly if your answer is likely to be in the affirmative.

   1 look forward to hearing from;you in due course*

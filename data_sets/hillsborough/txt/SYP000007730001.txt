                On S a t u r d a y    15 April 1989 (15-0489) I was at home with my husband,
                              <<b    -----   --------------------
                                        At about 8.30 am (0830) I saw the first suppor ter for

                the       football     m at ch arriving,            I then went          out umt i1 about       1.15     pm

                (1315)       on returning           home along Wads 1 ey Lrj/1 saw a gang                    of 20        30

                youths,       drinking        beer and         shouting ^tj             were    certainly    drunk,      other

                fans       we re coming       up towards          t h e m , I think       they we re 1ook i ng for            pubs

                that were open-               I told two Police               officers         who were    standing

                o ut si de    the Park Hotel              Pub,    they    informed me           that they knew about

                the       gang.      I then    carne home.            I stood outs id e          the house with my

                h u s b a n d w at ching      the    fans arrive.            It was      very noticable        that     there

               were a        large     number       of    fans    outside         the   entrance waiting        to go     into

                the       ground.     By now the           time was about 2 . 4 5              pm (1445)    and the      crowd at

                    the    gate   had spilled            out   into    the    road and fans were            still      coming
                                                                                                          PAGE         2

d own L e p p i ng s Ln and from M i d d l e w o o d Rd towards                 the ground.          I was

g et t i n g    quite w o rr i ed about           the amount      of   people       I thought    if they

Son't        get    into the gr ou nd soon there w o ul d               be some trouble.            F rom

about 2.30           pm    (1430)    I saw youths          climbing     over    the wall      and    into the

g r o u n d , this was going              on for at       1 east quarter       of an hour and no one

was    s to p pi ng       them,    other    fans .were w a lk in g      past us and saw this and

said,        "Lets     try and get         over    the wall as well",           I     c o u l d n ’t see any

P o l ic e     there      only some m o un t e d F o l i c e , about      ten of them.           There was a

P o l i ce L an d ro v er      there an a B^fiiceman was               on top of       it shout i ng at the

crowd to stop              pushi ng at >£ne back be cause              they were       squashin g     people

at    the      front,      he wai— Snouting         this    for a bout    10 minutes,         I don't       think

the    crowd were           taking an y notice            of this,     everyone       kept   edging       forward.

At about           3 pm    (1500)    the    crowd s ud de nl y e ased and d is a pp e ar e d          into       the

ground,         fans were         still    corning down the        road at      this time.          The    next

thing        I. noticed was         the    horses    from the entra nc e            g al loped down Vere Rd

an d then L ep pings              Ln was    s u d de n ly full    of Policemen,          I couldn't

believe         how so many P o l i c e m a n a pp ea r ed from nowhere.                  They all        went

into     the       ground very quickly.              As    the fans were        passing      us on the way

to the         ground and asking            if we had any tickets              to sell.

The    next        thing    that    h ap pe n ed was      that   the   fans    came    out of the ground

in silence,            and a lot were         crying,       there was a lot of swearing and one

lad kicked a Police                 car,    the    swearing was        d ir ected at the Police.

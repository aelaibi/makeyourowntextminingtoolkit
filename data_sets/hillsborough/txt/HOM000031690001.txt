Thank you for your letter of 15 July 1997.
                                                                                             M .r       ^ m /'
I think it is a matter for you what material you publish following the receipt of my             W      (0<-jfc^v
Report. If there are any documents which I consider it is not in the public interest for
you to publish, I will let you know.

It is my intention to write to each of the bereaved families inviting them to draw my
attention to any fresh evidence they believe they may have. I will tell them that I am
also writing to those representing them, Mr Hicks, Mr Hammond and Ms Adlington,
the Support Group’s solicitors.

I am also proposing to write to these three people with a somewhat more detailed
questionnaire and asking them for written representations.

I am also writing to Mr Houldsworth and Dr Walker, the only two known witnesses
who, it is suggested, have fresh evidence. I already have written statements from
them. I propose to ask them if they wish to add to them. I have indicated that I shall
probably wish to interview them in due course.

I am writing to the Chief Executives of the three football clubs, Liverpool, Nottingham
Forest and Sheffield Wednesday, together with the Chief Executive of the Football
Association, inviting them to submit any further evidence.

I have invited the submission of all written evidence and representations by 1st
September 1997. I shall also be inviting the assistance of the Chairman of the Police
Complaints Authority, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and
the Chief Constables of the West Midland and South Yorkshire Police. But I do not
anticipate that they will wish to put any fresh evidence before me.

                                                                              received by
                                                                                   18 JUL 1997
I propose to interview all the witnesses in private. Their evidence will not be tested
by cross-examination, though naturally I shall probe it myself to assess its significance.
I anticipate having a shorthand note taken. A witness can obtain a copy.

I have also indicated that I will meet the families Mid their representatives in Liverpool.
Again this will be a private meeting. I do not intend to hear evidence at this meeting,
but to listen to representations. I shall have a shorthand-note taken for my own benefit
as an aide-memoire to avoid excessive note-taking.

Those whom I meet will be able to speak to the Press afterwards though I shall
discourage witnesses from doing so.

In the event that I consider the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police
Complaints Authority should be invited to reconsider their decisions not to take any
action, then it will be necessary to consider carefully what material should be
published. No doubt we can consider this in due course.

I think this accords with what you have said in your letter. If you like, I can arrange
for copies of the various letters I am sending out at this stage, to be sent to you.

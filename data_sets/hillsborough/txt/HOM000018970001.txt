         Re:    The Hillsborough tragedy - Saturday, 15 April:
                Evidence for the Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor

         The In stitu tio n o f S tru c tu ra l E ngineers has an ad hoc c o m m itte e th a t h as been w orking
         since D ecem b er 1986 to produce a re p o rt on th e ap p raisa l of sp o rts grounds. The background
         to th e w ork of th is c o m m itte e is given in th e accom panying p a p e r w ith th e ti tl e 'A ppraisal
         of sp o rts grounds: Evidence to th e T aylor Inquiry'. The w ork is n o t y e t fully co m p lete
         b u t has re a c h e d a sta g e w here a co m p lete d r a f t is av ailab le to g e th e r w ith m in u tes of

         tra g e d y so th a t th e view s ex pressed a re n o t in fluen ced by th a t p a rtic u la r e v e n t.

         I believe stro n g ly th a t th e view s developed by th e c o m m itte e a r e im p o rta n t and will be
         a valuable source o f evidence to Lord J u s tic e Taylor's inquiry. A ccordingly I enclose,

         held on 16 S ep te m b er 1988.

         The f a c t th a t th e In stitu tio n is in th e p ro cess of producing a re p o rt on ap p raisa l o f sp o rts
         grounds has been re p o rte d in th e te c h n ic a l p ress and th e r e h as been som e sp ecu latio n
         on its c o n te n ts. H ow ever, it is n o t our in te n tio n to re le a s e th e d r a f t re p o rt to th e p ress
         or o th e r in te re s te d p a rtie s , a t le a s t a t th is s ta g e . O ur view , w ithin th e In s titu tio n , is
         th a t th e d r a f t can n o t be se p a ra te d from th e m inuted discussion and, in th e c o n te x t of
         H illsborough, should be considered w ith a ll th e o th e r ev id en ce th a t is av ailab le to th e

 Scope




This document draws together inform ation1,2’3 that a chartered engineer should be
aware of when designing o r analysing dem ountable spectator stands.
   In the context of this docum ent, dem ountable stands are considered to be
structures assembled from suitably connected single and/or part-assembled
com ponents supporting a level or stepped platform . In general it is expected that they
will not be in a position for periods longer than one m onth and that after dismantling
the constituent parts will be reused m any times. It is assumed that they will have to
conform with Building R egulations A l , 2 and 3 and B1 and B3.4
   Much of the m aterial is naturally com m on to the design of all stands w hether
perm anent o r dem ountable. Special emphasis is how ever placed on those items that
are likely to be of greater im portance in the design of dem ountable stands. It
concerns:
   stand occupancy access and egress
   loading
   foundation design assumptions
   analytical procedures and
   inspection responsibilities
  It should also prove helpful when assisting his client to draw up the brief before
going out to tender. A clear brief to the supplier is essential to avoid
misunderstanding later.

     There may be many instances when the contractor                       It is only from a test to failure that the real mode of failure
     chooses or is requested to offer proof tests to substantiate          and true capacity of a specimen can be determined.

  3.4 Acceptance test
;This test is intended as a non-destructive test for
i confirming structural performance. The assembly should
  prove capable of sustaining the test loading given in
  subsection 3.3.
 3.5 Strength test
 The strength test is used to confirm the calculated capacity
iof the structure or component. Before carrying out the
:strength test the specimen should first be submitted to and
imeet all the requirements of the acceptance test.
    The capacity of the assembly under test will be
 dependent on the material properties. The test load
 (including self-weight) is given by:
          , .          (averaged yield strength)
     test load =      ---------    .••-- -------- —s ——x (factored load)
                             (design strength)
       The actual yield strength of the material should be
    determined from coupon tests*, and an average yield
    strength value taken from such tests.
       At this load there should be no failure by buckling or
    ruptlire of any part of the specimen, and on removal of
    the test load, the recovery should be at least 80%.
       The design strength and factored load are as defined in
    subsections 2.4 and 2.5.

     4.7 Balustrading and handrails
   Demountable grandstands should be fully protected with
   front, side and rear safety rails. These rails should comply
   with the relevant local licensing authority requirements,
   but the following general rules should be observed:
 : End safety rails
      1100mm high of closed- or open-mesh construction such
     that a 100mm sphere cannot be passed through any part
        Side rails should resist a horizontal load of 0.75kNm
     run at their top rail position
     Rear safety rails
      1100mm high of closed- or open-mesh construction such
     that a 100mm sphere cannot be passed through any part
        Side rails should resist a horizontal load of
     l.OOkN/m run at their top rail position
     Front rail
     Front rails should resist a horizontal load of 1.5kN/m
     run at their top rail position
     Front balustrade (in front o f gangway)
     1100mm high of heavier construction to resist a horizon­
     tal load of 3.0kN/m run at their top rail position.
     All access stairways and ramps should be fully protected
  with safety rails.

     4.8 Stairways and ramps
 iAll access stairs and ramps, whether internal or external,
  should be so constructed as to have at least Vih fire
 ;resistance1011. Stairways need not be closed in or covered,
 :but steps should be well defined and dimensioned as given
 ■ in subsection 4.4.
    With internal stair units (constructed within the grand-
 !stand main understructure) it is often difficult to restrict
 Ithe number of risers to 16. Where this occurs, the relevant
  local licensing authority should be approached for a
  dispensation. Where poor light conditions exist in an
  indoor arena, emergency lighting and clear signs should
  be fitted to all stairways and ramps.

     4.9 Voids and additional structures
 :By nature of their construction, demountable grandstands
 ;have large voids underneath the main seated areas. These
  voids become the resting place for paper, cartons and
  other combustible materials that can be ignited, un-noted,
  by a carelessly discarded cigarette end or even by
  vandalism. These areas should be cleared of litter as
  regularly as possible but at least after each performance.
  Litter is a major fire hazard to spectators. In addition, it
  should not be possible for infants to gain access to them.
     It is now a common feature to use the voids under very
  large grandstands to provide space for purpose-built
  hospitality suites or rooms. Each box or room becomes an
  integrated part of the grandstand understructure and
  usually provides a glass-fronted viewing room just below
  the first level of seating. By nature of their use hospitality
  boxes present a certain fire hazard, and it is therefore
  essential that these additional structures are constructed
_.from materials that have at least Vih. fire resistance.

                                                                                      IStructE report: D em ountable grandstands

has been excavated locally unless backfilled with suitable
consolidated material.
  Soleplate spreaders are most commonly of timber, but
may sometimes be of precast concrete. Care is required
to ensure by ‘bedding in’ full and even contact of
soleplates with the ground. Cavities should be filled, and
loose materials compacted. Where foundations are not
level or are uneven, appropriate packing may be em­
ployed. Care should be taken that this does not promote
instability.
   In the case of timber soleplates, which should prefer­
ably be not less than 35mm thick and 220mm wide, the
concentrated column loads may be assumed to spread
down at a slope of 2:1 horizontal to vertical along the
grain, and 1:1 across the grain.
   The edges of any excavation should be protected
against erosion by wind or water.
   In certain cases where baseplates are larger and stiffer
than those generally employed, the use of plywood
soleplates at least 19mm thick is permissible.
5.4 Assessment of ground conditions
If part of a permanent structure is to be used, its strength
may be confirmed by the designer or conservative
calculations made.
   All other forms of base must be assessed either by a
visual examination, which may be assisted with a small pit,
or by a site survey which could take the form of soil
analysis, or more probably a direct load site test. When
making an assessment, consideration should be given to
existing and possible future weather effects, e.g. frozen or
parched ground may give false information on bearing
strengths of soil in more normal conditions.
5.5 Allowable bearing pressures
Demountable grandstands are loaded for relatively short
periods, and while it is well known that settlement usually

 For most rhythmic activities the periodic forces can be
 approximated by a sinusoidal dynamic load causing
 vibration at the rhythmic frequency. For rhythmic events

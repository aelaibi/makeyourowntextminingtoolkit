                          Entry procedures at clubs


                                     Summary




Luton Town                 Kept outside.     Enquiry office adjacent to
                           turnstiles.


Derby County               Kept   outside.     Enquiries to club office.


Oxford United              Let in.   Enquiry centre inside turnstiles.


Reading                    Kept outside.     Enquiries to club office.


Tottenham Hotspur          Depends on situation outside turnstiles.




NB.   All clubs experience very few problems - they deal with comparatively
      small numbers in their membership areas. Even Luton Town's system only
      applies to the terraced areas (capacity 4,460).

                serials are as outlined in D Division Operational O r d e r .                                Our role

                initially was to su]^rvi\e Liverpool fans arriving at M i dland Station

                on the normal services ^"rain. They were loaded onto public transport

               and then taken to the ground.

At least two Police Officers travelled with each PSV so that their

conduct could be monitored.

to the ground left at 2.3Qpn»^( 1430? .          Their instructions on arrival at

the ground was to .report at theVymnasiuffi for redeployment.



During the time we were at the Railway Station Liverpool              fans were

good natured and my officers had an excellent rapport.



I liaised with Inspector^H^RPER who was supervising the Nottingham^

Forest Supporters at the Rai l w a y ^ y a t io n .   He did not require any

further assistance.          I then travelled to the Hillsborough Ground

arriving at Penistone Road at approximately 3.QQpm (15QQ).



When walking along Penistone Road,          towards the gymnasium there were

very few Nottingham Forest supporters waiting to go into the ground.

I believe these had attended in the hope of being able to buy a ticket

at the ground but had been unsuccessful.



I went into the ground, as\I approached the gymnasium d o o r I was met
              fs/ fajLtiiQ
by Chief   Inspector SUMNER w h o \ s k e d jte to take some serials to the

West Stand where there was a pitcrKj-nyasion.            I set off with a number

of other officers to deal with this incident.             Some officers were from

my previous serials,         ottiers were not.    On walking   into the playing

area I saw that the game w a s ^ ^ M^-LA1
                                        *-n progress in front of the West

Stand.



The crowd was shouting and roaring and I saw spe's^^tors were still

                                                                               S3568

              3 over the f^gge of the playing area.   As we got past the halfway
                                       _ _     jg-jjjQ i
       line,   I saw a Police Offffrs^ run onto the pitch from the West Stand

       and go up to the referee .      I th^Q told\my officers to form a cordon

       across the pitch to sweep the spectaTWrs back towards the West Stand.

       The West Stand terracing      is fenced in and divided into sections by

       iron railings.



       As we started to sweep them U             approached the fence of pen 3,        I

       saw fans crushed up against the wire m e s h .    Some people were reaching

       through the fence screaming and shouting for us to help them.           I went

       up to them to try and reassure them and realised then that some of

       them apfieaj^ed to be dead.    Whilst up at the front I realised that the

       crowd were st i 1 ifHyshi ng forward and crushing the people at the front,

       I saw people lapsing    i?N^o unconsciousness before my eyes.      It was not

       a deliberate surge and on lsooking sout into the crowd it appeared they

       were all    leaning forward and phis wa\ creating a slow momentus of

       crushing.     I stood up on the fron$ a n ^ shouted loudly,   “Push b a c k ;

       you're crushing people at the f ront        I also made a pushing motion
Po l
       with my arms.     It had absolutely no effect whatsoever.      Other officers

       by this time had jumped onto the small wall and were gripping the wire

       mesh and were shouting    lfr^a similar way to myself.



       People at the back of the crowd v^re being pulled up into the stand

       above them and I had fears of someonXJbfj.ng trapped onto the spikes of

       the separating fences.



       I continued to shout and all      I could see were staring faces which were

       not responding to our requests.

                                                                                             S3568

        ' at this time and a space had been created.                  All   it needed was for the

         crowd to start to rrnive back and it would have helped to relieve the

         pressure.



         I was conscious that there were ms^pollice officers to the rear of the

         crowa.
         Xi-----


                                                 C o rrv m       a)
         I made a transmission to c o ^ r o l          to ask for officers to come in from

         the rear of the stand to get th^qi to pull back,                   to do what was

         required,    but I had no recol lectioflyoV them responding to the call.

         You will appreciate that due to the shouting and screaming and people

         milling around on the pitch,            it was near enough a sheer         impossibility

         to hear the radio,       even though I held it next to my ear.



         I stood back to take stock of the situation.                    Immediately in front of

         me           number of people trapped on the fence in a large pile.                    I
                                                & o a JLq   *
         saw that the            to the number 3 enclosure was now open and officers

         were in the gatewayvspne of whom I identified was Chief Superintendent

         NESB1T.     He had a n u m b e \ o f   officers with him so I remained in situ,

         I saw that some officers we>^ neaV number 4 g a t e , giving assistance,

         People were still       climbing over the fence a nd coming over the top of

         .number 3 peri".^ Me assisted them to the playing track.

         I then made a request X r b o l t \ cutters in an effort to create another

         opening into number 3N'^errafts^*^ Again I do not know if this message

         was   received or if in fact'H.hey ever                came to our location.   I then saw

         Police Officers and spectators > 4 eking (\at the fence to my right and by

3   •    pulling th>svwi.re back they cheated aTn-^ntranee into this enclo sur e.

         This still beifba. pen number 3.             I immediately went to this space and

         started to assist       iNvbringing      people out from the enclosure onto the
                                                                              PAGE      5
                                                                              S 3 56S

playing area.

-----------------

You will appreciate that some of the bodies that were removed from the

enclosure were either u n c o n s c i m h k o r   dead and as Officers   came to the

entrance to carry people away I was C bJ 1 in\j them to see to them to

give what aid they could.



Casualties were building up on the pitch behind the goal area and I

told Officers to take them further onto the pitch so as not to cause

obstruction for ourselves.          Whilst we were helping people one man who

was conscious became trapped in the wire and whilst we were trying to

assist him people were jumping on him and over him and other                people

who were trapped to get on the pitch.               I do not blame them for this,

some of them were injured,         some had cuts.      They had been trapped for

so long that once they became free they wanted to get out of that

situation.     The young man was eventually freed and moved on to the

pitch.     I continued to help at this location where both regular

Officers and Special Constables were involved in carrying                people away.

Spectators and Police Officers were involved in removing the bodies

from this particular area.           I was conscious that one young man, a

Liverpool Supporter,       was stood up and the pile of casualties was above

his knees.     Until    then I had not fully appreciated the enormity of the

tragedy.



I then saw that the enclosure was now empty of casualties but was full

of Police Of f i cers 'irqd the remaining spectators.



I looked around the area of ti5hsSsgoal mouth where I saw St J o h n ’s

Ambulance    people and Police Of f i c e \ i nvo 1vfcd in giving various types

of artificial       respiration.    An ambulanceMaaci come down the pitch to

                                                                       S3568

number 3 enclosure.    I then noticed that the F i re\J3erv i ce were in

attendance w ith some of their members walking about with oxygen

bottles which they were giving to people who required that service,



I then became conscious of some hostility between the Police

Officers and spectators   in the pen and told the officers to come out

of that area onto the pitch and they did.        I remained in that area of

the pitch as they did.



I remained in that area purely as a containment exercise when suddenly
                                                   V
I became aware of a skirmish in the number 3 enclosure.          I looked

round and saw a stocky built uniformed Police Officer         running out of

the enclosure. - He had his head in his hands.         He was not wearing a

helmet and he ran omNa^the pitch.     Two other officers followed.          I was

unable to speak to them btfr^ I und^sfstand that they had been into the



        ,\
enclosure with a Scenes of Cr

had upset The spectators,
                                    Of *)i cer to take photographs and this




We theii^appeared to be in a state of limb's^.    Officers were stood about

in groups on lT>e playing area.   Spectators were'sstill      ripping down

boardings to make rriafk^shift stretchers.   I then s tarted to re-group

what was left of my serials which would bs five Sergeants and 15

Constables.   All of us, without exception,      by this time were in a

state of shock.   Police Officers were walking about the pitch crying

and I ensured that they were comforted by other Officers.



Whilst I was on the pitch a number of supporters kept trying to pick

an argument with me stating that it would not have happened if

Liverpool   had been allowed to use a larger stand.        I pointed out that

this was nothing to do with me and they all accepted it and said they
                                                                            PAGE       7
                                                                            S3568

were upset.     At no time was I threatened with        violence but it appeared

to^mfe^^hat they only wanted to argue.


            \            * £  -
I later attendeeNgt Penis\tone Road to load the Liverpool            fans onto the

bus to return to theN^tatp.on.    In the main the spectators were very-

very subdued as were my officers.     So far as        I recall, only two     bus

loads left that location.     I put my remaining        Officers onto one     of the

buses where they sat in silence.



Whilst    I was stood outside on the pavement, a young man came to me, a

Liverpool supporter and asked for the directions to the Northern

General Hospital and how he could make enquiries regarding his

friend.     I started to obtain details of the casualty number when one

of his friends started shouting,    "I've told you not to speak to those

bastards.     You bastards did this, murderers."       He then went on to say

we had opened the gates and had caused the problem.



I initially wanted to go and remonstrate with him but decided it was

better to ignore the remarks,    not knowing all the facts,          than creating

a scene.    TfYi^ remark really hurt me as all the Officers who were

with me had giverNtheir all    in an effort to help the crushed

supporters.            N.


                                                   -
At no time did I see any of rag C y u b Stewards       in the g ro u nd .   I have

referred to my problems with the radio but would add that everyone

appeared to be so engrossed in their respective duties that they did

not or could not hear any radio transmissions.



I handled many, many casualties.     Some had lost their         lower garments

whilst being in the crush,    others had wet themselves,         been sick,    so
                                                                                    PAGE

              ' one can appreciate the smell at this particular location.



                  My main involvement was passing the people on to other Officers to be

                  taken away and the only one I handled at that time who I feel that 1

3** f     t       could recognise again was a young girl/woman being carried out with

^   lls \jA       dark brown spiky hair,    long at the sides, wearing what appeared to be



    9 6   *       a brown coat or dress.



                  'Many young officers   responded to their responsibilities with vigour

                  and determination and were a credit to the South Yorkshire Police.

              *   Some   climbed over the fence into the pen to lift people out and on

                  occasions gave artificial   respiration whilst others had to stand on

                  the fence and shout at people to pull back.



                  The things that really stick    in my mind were:-



                  •13     A young policewoman coming up to me and asking what she could

                          do.   I told her to get the crowd to push back.   She then left

                          rne and ran up the fence nearly to the top and was shouting and

                          screaming at the crowd in her determination to get them to

                          respond.



                  23      This was the depth of bodies that had built up in the well of

                          the terracing.



                  My own feelings are that I shall never forget the helplessness and

                  frustration I felt when I went to the West Stand.



                  Here I am, a well   paid professional with nearly 28 years service who

                  has attended and been involved in many public order situations and

          approximately one eighth diameter.

HILLSBOROUGH

1.   In Georgeâ€™s absence, I attach two copies of the report which George managed
      to revise before being called away from the office ;___________________
                (He is likely to be away for a few days).

2.   If any amendments are required, please let me know and I will make sure they
      are done immediately (I have access to the disk).

3.   I understand from George that, once you are satisfied with the report, you will
      send a copy to the Law Officers for their information.

4.   In the meantime, I will commission some work on the handling aspects of the
      job as well as preparing draft letters putting the decision into effect.

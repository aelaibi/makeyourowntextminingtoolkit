necessary           to m o v e     from       the       l o we r     concourse              of      the      North         Stand,        down a

ultimately           gives        access          to    the       football             pitch.           Upon         looking         out      o nt o

the    playing          area      I saw       t h at        the     match         was     in        p r o g r e s s.

However,          looking         over       to    the       Leppinqs             Ln       en d o f the              ground       it was

clear       t hat    some        sort    of       incident           was      taking           place.               A number        of     faris

were       running        on     the    playing             area     behind            a n d at       the       side       of    the     goal

mouth.           Almost        immediately              I noticed             a senior              Police           Officer         running

onto       the    playing         a r e a , trying             to a t t r a c t            the a t t e n t i o n           of    the r e f e r e e .

The    matc h was          halted        a l most           immediately,                  and after                 some    c o n f u s i o n the

players          were     escorted           from       the       pitch.           My     first         impression               was     th at

large       scale       fighting          was      taking           place         amongst            the     Liverpool             fans.         I

immediately             left      the     area         of     the    North         Stand         and       run a c r o s s         the

playing          area     to     the    Leppings             Ln     en d     of    th e    ground.                  When    I reached

that       section        of     the    ground          it     became         apparent              t h at      a    public        o r de r

incident          of a d i f f e r e n t          nature          was      taking         place.             The      Leppings           Ln

terrace,          in the a r e a          behind            the     goal      mouth         was       extremely             conge ste d and

p a n ic    had     set    in a m o n g s t        th e      crowd,          particularly                  at       the    front        where      a

large       number        were     obviously                in d i s t r e s s .          The       c r o w d was          so    packed        that

                                         ■ the         persons          at    the       front         of     the      terrace,           and

behind       th/e w e r g        mesh        to mov e.              A number            of P o l i c e          officers          were

actually                   ing     on    th e      top       of     the      wire       fencing,             pulling            f ans    over

and    o n to     the     playing        area          and     perimeter               tra c k .        A number            of     fans       were

l y ing     on the        pitch        s,er ious ly          injured.              Some        of     them were             unconscious.

As    I looked          o n to    the    terrace             from       the       pitch        I realised                 that     it w as

desperate             to     remove           as     many       f a ns     as     possible               from       the      front       of    the

terrace.              To     the        right        of    the      congested               area         was      a narrow           ’s t e r i l e ’

corridor.                 Th e    narrow           section          had a         door         at    the       front         allowing          access

onto      the       playing            area.          This        sterile            area       was       separated             from       the         rig ht

of     t he    congested               area        by a m e t a l          fence.              I went          into       t his      area and

began         to    pull         persons           from      the      crowd          into       the       sterile            area and          then

directed            them         through           the     door       at    the        front         and       on to      the      playing             a r ea .

It w a s       extremely               difficult             to     pull        persons             o v er     the     fence         because             they

were      so       tightly            p ac k e d ,    particularly                   at     the      fro nt.           I remember              o ne         man

saying         to me         as       I pulled            him     over      the        top      " T h e r e ’s p e o p l e           dead      in

there”.             It was            impossible             to     see     into          the       crowd,          communicate               with

anyone         or     get        into      the       congested area                    behind            the      goal.         I had         been

issued with a                    radio        and     earpiece             but       the       noise         wa s    so      lo ud      that       I

couldn't            hear         anything            over       the      radio,           or    be       heard.           I continued                  to

get     people            out     by     the       sideways           rout e.             I have          no      concept          of    time.

Numbers            were      still         being          pulled         o v er      the       fence         at     the      front       of    the

terrace            by P o l i c e        Officers            standing             on      the       w i r e.        After       a time         I

noticed            the     body        of m a n       lying         on     the       floor          at    the       extreme          front         from

the     terrace,             o v er      to    the        r i ght     hand        side         as    one       observes            from       the

pi t c h .         T he    congestion                slowly         began         to      subside,             although            the     feeling

was     still         one        of    panic.             I managed             to     jump         over       the     dividing            fence            and

find      my way           to     t h is      man.         T he     person was                 heavily            built       and       l yi n g

parallel            to     the        steps.          His       face was             blue       and       his       e y es   were        open.              1

immediately                formed          the       impression             t h at        he w a s        dead.           I gave         him mouth

to m o u t h        resuscitation                    without          success.              I looked              to m y      right.           Police

and     fans        alike         were        pulling           down       the       wire       fencing             immediately               behind

th e    goal        in o r d e r         to    get        people         out.          As      I looked             along       the      wall       at

the     front         of     the       terrace            I was       shocked             to    se e      l a rg e     numbers           of    bodies

lying         on top         of       each     other,           two a n d         three         deep.             It was        immediately

noticable             t ha t      none        of     t h e m was         moving.               They       were       all      at     the      foot          of

                                                                                                                                            82181

the      wire     fence.              I saw       another             m a l e,     younger          person        lying       on       the

terrace          a few      f e et       away.             I made           my way       to    him.         He a p p e a r e d         to       be    in

his      thirties.               Again       hi s      face          wa s    blue       and    eyes       open.        I applied             mouth

to m o u t h      but      there         wa s     no       doubt        t h at     he w a s        dead.        It was        my       opinion

that       these        people         had      been        dead        for       some    considerable                 time,       taken             in

context          with      the        incident.                 The     wire       fence       at    the     front       had       been

partly       torn        down.         Fans       were          tearing           down    t he      advertising              hoarding

to    be    u s e d as      stretchers.                     I moved           further          along        the      terrace           to       the

right       and     saw     bodies           placed             further           up    the    terracing,              away       from          the

boundary          wall      at        the    fro n t .          One     of    them       had a       coat       placed        over          his

hea d.       Together             with       another             officer           I attempted              resuscitation                   on a

young       boy.         I called            for       oxygen           but       none    was       readily available.                           After

a time       we     managed            to    get       him       o nt o      the       pitch where           a Doctor

was      present.           Oxygen           was       applied              but    the    Doctor          pronounced              him       dead.

As    I have        stated,            I have          no       concept           of    ti me.       It

appeared          that       oxygen          was       a    long        t im e     arriving.              However,           I am

certain          that      the        body was             dead       p r i or     to    the       arrival        of    the       Police.

Whilst       all        t hi s    w as      going          on a g r e a t          deal       of a b u s e      was     being          h u r l e d at

the      Police         from      Liverpool                fans,        both       on the          terrace        but    in the              main

from       the    front          of    the      West        Stand           which       overlooks           the      terrace.               I

assisted          with      the        removal             of    bodies           from    the       front       of     the    terracing

on t o     the    pitch.              This      was        done       quickly           once       access       could        be    gained

through          th e    wire         fencing          and       sufficient              numbers          had     been       removed             from

the      terracing.               A    l a r ge     amount            of     personal          p r o p e r t y wa s      littered                all

over       the    terracing.                 This          was       placed        in    plastic          bags.I        had       occasion

to e x a m i n e        a metal          barrier            placed           halfway          up    the     terracing                            the

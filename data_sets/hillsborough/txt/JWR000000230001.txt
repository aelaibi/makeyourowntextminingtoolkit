     The Duke of Kent has asked me to thank you, most
warmly and sincerely, for the trouble you and your
colleagues took to enable him to visit the Northern
General Hospital on Tuesday, 18th April.  His Royal
Highness was most impressed by the generally positive
atmosphere, as well as by the high level of
professional skills evident throughout your unit.

     The Duke would be grateful if you could pass on
his thanks to the numerous members of your staff, and
other colleagues, who made it possible for him to pay
such an instructive visit.   His Royal Highness was
delighted to be able to meet Mr. Welsh and Mr.
Griffiths, and, as he toured the wards, Dr. Powell, Dr.
Appleyard, and Mr. Wardrope.   The Duke is also aware
that Mr. Andrew Jones, whom he did not meet, had done
much to make the programme work so smoothly.

     His Royal Highness, and all of us with him, were
greatly shocked and saddened to see at first hand the
scene of the Hillsborough Tragedy. We all send our
most sincere sympathy to all of those affected by it.
The Duke of Kent also greatly admired the fortitude of
the response of so many people in Sheffield, and the
superb efforts of the Northern General Hospital were
outstanding in this context.

Dear Mr. McKay

May I just say thank you for taking the time out
to make arrangements for my short visit on Sunday,
following the tragedy at Hillsborough.

I know how busy everyone was, and how tired they
must have felt, and I'm sure they must get heartily
sick of people like me intruding on their work with
platitudes and sniaii talk.  I am aware of liow
politicians must be viewed at times like this -
talking a lot and contributing very little.

However, I felt I wanted to come and appreciate
the arrangements you made.

My thanks to everyone again for the magnificent
way in which the hospital was able to respond.

Best wishes.

Yours sincerely

 Dear Mr.McKay,

 I want to express my thanks to you for the way you received the church
 leaders from Merseyside on Sunday. I appreciate that it must have been in
 the middle of a very hectic period.   You and all your staff were extremely
 gracious and I want to say thank you to you and to them.


 Yours very sincerely,

        The Prince and Princess of Wales asked me to thank you
   and all the staff at the Royal Hallamshire and the Northern
   General who helped organise their visit tb Sheffield
   Hospital.

        Their Royal Highnesses were very pleased that they were
   able to see so many people at both hospitals who had worked
   so hard over the weekend, and hoped that their visit indeed
   assisted rebuilding morale and did not impose an additional
   burden.

        Their Royal Highnesses asked me to pass on to all
   concerned their warmest appreciation for everything that was
   done at your hospitals following the appalling tragedy at
   Hillsborough.

   the injured in the Northern General and Royal Hallamshire
   hospitals today and for coming personally to accompany me.          I
   know how very busy all the staff in both hospitals have been.
   They have worked with great dedication and professionalism,
   both in the way they have dealt medically with the
   consequences of yesterday's terrible tragedy and also in the
   care and concern which they have so obviously shown to the
   relatives of those who were seriously injured.    You can
   justly be very proud of them.


          I should be grateful if you would pass on my warm thanks
   to those who were involved with the arrangements for my

       Enclosed are copies of letters which we were very pleased to receive from the
       Secretary of State for Health, Mr Nichol the Chief Executive of the NHS
       Management Board and the Chairman of the Mersey Regional Health Authority.

       Although sorely tempted to become personally involved immediately after the
       incident we held off doing so as we knew all concerned had more than enough on
       in order to cope with the immediate consequences of this tragic incident and
       its aftermath.

       There are many times I know when we all feel pride in our services and this
       must be a particularly significant and important one.   From the first hand
       reports I have received from my Regional officers and other sources I know
       that the response from staff at all levels was magnificent.

       Would you please pass on our sincere thanks for a job well done?

    HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

    Sadly, this is my second letter to you this year about a major
    disaster within the Trent Health Region.  However, once again health
    service staff responded superbly.

    At a time like this one's immediate thoughts naturally turn to the
    victims and their relatives but it is also very important to
    remember the dedicated people who help them.  I know that emergency
    staff who attended the scene and those at the Northern General and
    Royal Hallamshire Hospitals coped magnificently in very difficult
    circumstances.  I hope you will pass on my sincere thanks to
    everyone concerned.

The tragic events of Hillsborough on Saturday have reached
out into so many peoples' lives in Merseyside, all of whom
I know will be deeply appreciative of the splendid work
carried out by the medical and ambulance services on that
distressing afternoon in Sheffield.      The dedication of the
hospital staff and the commitment of the ambulance service
has been quite outstanding.     You will know that throughout
yesterday and today the closest possible links have been
established by your colleagues and staff with Health Service
and Social Services Departments of Merseyside to provide
support and relief whenever possible to the bereaved families
and those who were injured     in this very sad event. I know
you are with us in our deep sympathy with all those who
hhve been affected by this event.

Will you please convey to those involved the deep appreciation
of all the people of Liverpool and from the Mersey Region
of the dedication and commitment of so many people.     This,
I am sure, shows the excellence of the co-operation between
all arms and sections of the NHS.

I am writing to express my deep admiration and gratitude for the
way in which the emergency services responded to the Hillsborough
disaster. This was an appalling tragedy which profoundly shocked
us all. Coping with it must have placed a terrific physical and
emotional strain on local health service staff. I know that a
great many people were involved in the rescue effort both at the
Northern General Hospital and the Royal Hallamshire and from the
South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service. There was
tremendous support from off-duty staff and from ambulance
services in nearby areas.

Everyone did quite magnificently in what were the most testing
circumstances. I hope you will pass on my warmest thanks to all
those concerned for their tremendous courage and dedication.

  Dear Mr Wardrope
  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

 The Chairman of the RHA is writing separately to the District Chairman of
 Sheffield District Health Authority, and to Chief Metropolitan Ambulance
 Officer of the South Yorkshire Metro politan Ambulance Service to express
 the sincere thanks of all of us at the Regional Health Authority for the
 work of NHS staff after the recent tragic disaster at Hillsborough. I am
 writing to you as a Consultant in Accident and Emergency Medicine to say
 very particular thanks for y o u r personal work and that of all yo ur colleagues
 and staff within your Department. It is quite clear that the response from
 all NHS staff was magnificent. Your own staff's commitment and dedication
 shone through clearly and provided a note of real pride in achievement within
 a situation that was otherwise clearly grim and desperate. The
 professi onali sm and skill within our Accident and Emergency Services, which
 the NHS was able to mobilise so quickly, is w o r t h y of the highest tribute.

 I would be grateful if you would pass these thanks to all y o u r staff and
 all those who worked with you in y o u r department in the task of treating
 those who lives were touched by the Hillsborough tragedy.
           sincerely

YOU’LL NEVER
WALK ALONE


   The Hillsborough
   Memorial Service

 Saturday, 29th April 1989, 11.00 a.m.
            W IN D SO R   CASTLE




The Right Reverend David Sheppard,
  Bishop of Liverpool.




    My thoughts and prayers are with you and
with your fellow Church leaders in Liverpool
today, and with all those who mourn the
victims of the Hillsborough tragedy.




                                   ELIZABETH R.




29th April, 1989.

From the Archbishop o f Canterbury

My prayers and thoughts are first with the victims and their
families - but so many are caught up in the tragedy.

I am thankful that the churches together are playing their part in
counselling and healing.

As one born and brought up in Liverpool I know that a tragedy like
this will bring out the best in my home City and the best of that
City’s spirit is incomparable.




From the Vatican

Deeply saddened by the Sheffield Stadium tragedy which has caused
such loss of life and brought about suffering to the injured and to
numerous families whose beloved set out for a day of relaxation and
pleasure, the Holy Father prays for the souls of the deceased and
invokes God’s comfort and strength on the nation and on all who
have been affected personally.




From the Moderator o f the Free Church Federal Council

The members of the Free Churches join with fellow-Christians, and
all men and women of goodwill, in expressing their solidarity in grief
with all who have suffered through the Hillsborough disaster.

We pray for all whose lives have been devastated by this tragedy.
We mourn the loss of so many innocent people, young and old. May
we resolve, by God’s grace, to do all in our power to prevent such an
unspeakable horror ever happening again.

HYMN


Abide with me, fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide:
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.


Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see,
O thou who changest not, abide with me.


I need thy presence every passing hour;
What but thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?
Who like thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.


I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if thou abide with me.


Hold thou thy Cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies:
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.


THE WELCOME


We sit and the Bishop o f Liverpool,
the Rt. Revd. D avid Sheppard, welcomes
the people and introduces the service.

LIGHT IN OUR DARKNESS

Now candles are lit, one fo r each life lost at Hillsborough,
as the Choir sings:

Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts: shut not thy merciful
ears unto our prayers. But spare us, Lord, spare us, Lord most holy:
O God, most mighty. O holy and most merciful Saviour, thou most
worthy Judge eternal: Suffer us not at our last hour for any pains of
death to fall from thee. Amen.
                                            Music: Henry Purcell

We kneel, or remain seated,
as Canon Ken Riley says

Let us pray

Almighty God to whom all hearts are open, all desires known and
from whom no secrets are hidden, look on us today in your mercy:

       on those who have lost loved ones and whose lives seem
       empty of meaning;

       on those who were badly injured and for whom life will never
       be the same again;

       on those who cannot forgive themselves;

       on those who blame everyone except themselves;

       on those overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster;

       on those who escaped with their lives and today give thanks.

       Lord, when we are down,

All:          lift us up.

       Lord, when we do not understand,

All:          lighten our darkness.

       Lord, when we draw near to you,

All:          draw near to us. Amen.



                                      7
Bound together as a family in common sorrow, we pray in the words
which Jesus taught us:


Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy Name,
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
On earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread;
And forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive those who trespass against us;
And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory,
for ever and ever. Amen.



Now we stand to sing



HYMN


God is Love: and he enfoldeth
     all the world in one embrace;
With unfailing grasp he holdeth
     every child of every race.
And when human hearts are breaking
      under sorrow’s iron rod,
Then they find that selfsame aching
      deep within the heart of God.                                 .
                                                                    1
God is Love: and though with blindness                              J
      sin afflicts the souls of men,
God’s eternal loving-kindness
      holds and guides them even then.
Sin and death and hell shall never
      o’er us final triumph gain;
God is Love, so Love for ever
      o’er the universe must reign.

THE FIRST READING
read by a Liverpool Football Club Supporter

The Book of Wisdom Chapter 3 verses 1-9

But the souls of the just are in God’s hand, and torment shall not
touch them. In the eyes of foolish men they seemed to be dead; their
departure was reckoned as defeat, and their going from us as disaster.
But they are at peace, for though in the sight of men they may be
punished, they have a sure hope of immortality; and after a little
chastisement they will receive great blessings, because God has tested
them and found them worthy to be his. Like gold in a crucible he
put them to the proof, and found them acceptable like an offering
burnt whole upon the altar. In the moment of God’s coming to them
they will kindle into flame, like sparks that sweep through stubble;
they will be judges and rulers over the nations of the world, and the
Lord shall be their king for ever and ever. Those who have put their
trust in him shall understand that he is true, and the faithful shall
attend upon him in love; they are his chosen, and grace and mercy
shall be theirs.

THE SECOND READING

read by Mr Kenny Dalglish, Manager of Liverpool Football Club

from the Epistle to the Romans, Chapter 8

What are we to say?

If God is on our side, who is against us? He did not spare his own
Son, but surrendered him for us all; and with this gift how can he
fail to lavish upon us all he has to give?

Then what can separate us from the love of Christ? Can affliction or
hardship? Can persecution, hunger, nakedness, peril or the sword? In
spite of all, overwhelming victory is ours through him who loved us.
For I am convinced that there is nothing in death or life, in the realm
of spirits or superhuman powers, in the world as it is or the world as
it shall be, in the forces of the universe, in heights or depths -
nothing in all creation that can separate us from the love of God in
Christ Jesus our Lord.

HYMN

Guide me, O thou great Redeemer,
Pilgrim, through this barren land;
I am weak, but thou art mighty;
Hold me with thy powerful hand:
Bread of heaven,
Feed me now and evermore.

Open now the crystal fountain
Whence the healing stream doth flow;
Let the fiery cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through:
Strong deliverer,
Be thou still my strength and shield.

When I tread the verge of Jordan,
Bid my anxious fears subside;
Death of death, and hell’s destruction,
Land me safe on Canaan’s side:
Songs and praises
I will ever give to thee.

Meanwhile the Choir sings these words o f consolation


And I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and
the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I,
John, saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out
of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard
a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is
with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people,
and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God
shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more
death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more
pain: for the former things are passed away.

TH E PRAYERS

Heavenly Father, God of all mercy, receive into your loving and
eternal presence the souls of our brothers and sisters who have died
in the disaster at Hillsborough. We loved them very much in their
years among us. Now we entrust them to your fatherly care, that they
may live with you for ever in the happiness of life in your kingdom.
Father, the sudden unexpectedness of their death has left us sorrowful
and bereft. We turn to you for comfort and new strength. Grant
peace of mind and consolation to their families and friends. Fill the
emptiness in our lives with faith and new hope in the power of your
risen Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.


God our Father, life of the faithful, glory of the humble, happiness of
the just, hear our prayers for those who have been injured in body or
in mind. Grant relief to their pain and give them new confidence and
strength. Restore them to good health and turn our anxiety for them
into joy at their recovery. Father of power and mercy, bless the
people of Sheffield who have shared our sorrow, and bless all those
who have cared for our people in hospital with such devotion and
skill. Lord, you know what really happened on that fateful afternoon.
As we praise you for the heroism and dedication of so many, heal the
wounds of any remaining fear and misunderstanding. Amen.


Almighty and merciful God you make all things new in your Son,
Jesus Christ, our Universal King. Bless the spirit of reconciliation
that is amongst us and heal the wounds of past division. Open our
hearts to new purpose and mutual concern. Grant prosperity to our
City, to Merseyside and to the Nation. Free all the world to rejoice
in the peace of your Son, to glory in his justice, to live in his love.
Bind us all together as one family, united in the service of our
Saviour, Jesus Christ, whose kingdom is with you and the Holy
Spirit, one God for ever and ever. Amen.

       Lord, we your servants speak this prayer:

All:   Be it your care. Amen.

HYMN


Ye holy angels bright,
Who wait at God’s right hand,
Or through the realms of light
Fly at your Lord’s command,
Assist our song,
For else the theme
Too high doth seem
For mortal tongue.


Ye blessed souls at rest,
Who ran this earthly race,
And now, from sin released,
Behold the Saviour’s face,
His praises sound,
As in his light
With sweet delight
Ye do abound.


Ye saints who toil below,
Adore your heavenly King,
And onward as ye go
Some joyful anthem sing;
Take what he gives
And praise him still,
Through good and ill,
Who ever lives.


My soul, bear thou thy part,
Triumph in God above,
And with a well-tuned heart
Sing thou the songs of love.
Let all thy days
Till life shall end,
Whate’er he send,
Be filled with praise.

We kneel or sit and Cardinal Basil Hume says

God grant to the living, grace; to the departed, rest;
to the Church, the Nation and the Commonwealth unity, peace and
concord, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Now the Archbishop of York, the Most Revd. John Habgood
pronounces

TH E BLESSING

Go forth into the world in peace; be of good courage; hold fast to
that which is good; render to no one evil for evil; strengthen the
fainthearted; support the weak; help the afflicted; honour all people;
love and serve die Lord, rejoicing in the power of the Spirit. And
the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit, be upon you and remain with you always. Amen.


There is a profound silence.


The silence is broken by a chorister singing "You’ll never walk
alone" as the Cross of Liverpool, the youngest choristers and
Crossguild lead the Ecumenical Procession, distinguished guests and
representatives of Liverpool Football Club to the Hillsborough
Memorial on the steps of the Rankin Porch.


As the Choir comes to the end of the words below, THE WHOLE
CONGREGATION rises to its feet and sings

W hen you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don’t be afraid of the dark.
A t the end of the road there’s a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark.
W alk on through the wind,
W alk on through the rain,
Though your dream s be tossed and blown;
W alk on, walk on with hope in your heart
And you’ll never walk alone,
You’ll never walk alone.

Once the Procession has left the Cathedral, ALL SIT.

TH E HALLOW ING OF THE HILLSBOROUGH M EM ORIAL

When the Processions have descended the Rankin Steps, the Dean of
Liverpool, the Very Revd. Derrick Walters, hallows the Hillsborough
Memorial in these words:

       IN THE FAITH OF JESUS CHRIST,
       WHO DEED AND ROSE AGAIN,
       WE HALLOW THIS STONE
       AS A PERPETUAL MEMORIAL
       TO THOSE WHO DIED AT HILLSBOROUGH.

       REST ETERNAL GRANT THEM, O LORD.

All:   LET LIG H T PERPETUAL SHINE UPON THEM .


TH E BLESSING OF TH E CITY

Now the Merseyside Church Leaders say:

God bless Liverpool
      and make her people
      strong in faith,
      steadfast in hope,
      and generous in their charity,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Flowers are now laid at the Memorial.

The inscription reads

               I attach a copy of an article in the January issue of THS concerning the
               above. Dr Ashton has of course taken a high profile vis a vis Hillsborough
               from'the very start, and to that extent I was not surprised to read the
               article. However I do not know whether his group of 13 doctors, nurses and
               a medical student who all became involved with the emergency response at
               Hillsborough has included any representatives from the Northern General
               Hospital.

               My purpose in writing to you is therefore twofold. Firstly, were any
               representatives involved in MAHWP and secondly, do we have a view about the
               content of the article?

               Yours sincerely

I would like to assure you that as far as I am aware,   there was no
member of the Northern General Hospital staff who has   been involved
in the medics at Hillsborough Working Party {MAHWP).      I am surprised
that Dr, Ashton is still continuing to be critical of   the Emergency
Services in such a public manner, especially since he   was specifically
criticised in Lord Justice Taylor's Report (photocopy   enclosed).

There are some parts of the article that I agree with and in fact some
of the recommendations regarding the ordinary every day medical emergencies
at sporting events were in my recommendations which I submitted to the
Regional Solicitors to pass on to Lord Justice Taylor.    However, I believe
that these were not acted on.

There however my agreement ends.   The point regarding defibrillators
is relevant since this was not the treatment required by the patients
and the points he makes about " Casualty Consultants becoming involved
in proper arrangements for emergency coverj' are not possible within the
present staffing arrangements.

I would point out that Consultants in Accident and Emergency Medicine have
a great interest in accident prevenrioa.    Through a professional body
the Casualty Surgeons Association we have been instrumental in introducing
a number of extremely important pieces of legislations such as compulsory
helmets for motor cyclists, compulsory use of seat belts for front seat
occupants of drivers and the use of safety glass in houses to prevent
childhood accidents.

More recently, the Casualty Surgeons Association argued that all vehicles
should be fitted with rear seat belts and they should be used.    Unfortunately
this was rather 'watered down' and the use of rear seat belts only became
compulsory for children.    However, we continue to monitor the patterns of
accidents presenting to our departments and the local survey of ski slope
injuries is one example of how we intend to make recommendations regarding
accident prevention,

I do not know what Dr. Ashton imagines we do with our time but I feel the
responsibility for 56,000 patient visits including round the clock cover for
normal emergencies as well as for the events such as Hillsborough is more than
enough commitment than could be reasonably asked for from a single handed
Accident and Emergency Consultant as I was at the time of the Hillsborough event.
                                 - 2 -

X do not know whether you wish to reply to this letter.   I would be more
than happy to help formulate a response.

Yours sincerely,




J. WARDROPE
Consultant in Accident and Emergency Medicine.

                                      THE CLUB AND DR EASTWOOD

  289. It should be recorded that in general the Club has over the years adopted a responsible and
conscientious approach to its responsibilities. It retained the services of Dr Eastwood as consultant engineer
and abided by his advice. For his part, Dr Eastwood is skilled and experienced in this field, as already
indicated, and he sought I have no doubt to act efficiently and professionally in his advice and practical work.
The Club also retained Mr Lock who had acquired great experience and knowledge of Hillsborough during his
police service. A number of witnesses described Hillsborough as a very good ground, “one of the best in the
country”. The police agreed that relations between them and the Club were good. Over the last four years, the
Club had spent some £ 1h million on ground improvements.

   290. Nevertheless, there are a number of respects in which failure by the Club contributed to this disaster.
They were responsible as occupiers and invitors for the layout and structure of the ground. The Leppings Lane
end was unsatisfactory and ill-suited to admit the numbers invited, for reasons already spelt out. The Club was
aware of these problems and discussed solving them in various ways between 1981 and 1986. In the result,
there remained the same number of turnstiles, and the same problems outside and inside them. The plan for
this semi-final, involving as it did the loss of 12 turnstiles for the north stand and large numbers to be fed in
from Leppings Lane, was one agreed between the Club and the police. The Club knew best what rate of
admission the turnstiles could manage and ought to have alerted the police to the risks of the turnstiles being
swamped.

   291. The alterations inside the turnstiles and on the terraces clearly affected capacity, but no specific
allowance was made for them. In that respect, both Dr Eastwood and the Club should have taken a more
positive approach. Either a scheme such as one of those Dr Eastwood put forward should have been adopted
giving more turnstiles and total separation of areas or at the very least the capacity of the new pens and of the
terraces as a whole should have been treated more cautiously. The police view in 1981 that 10,100 was too high
a figure was known to the Club (although Dr Eastwood says not to him). Yet, despite that and the sub-division
into pens, the figure remained.

   292. Although the police had assumed responsibility for monitoring the pens, the Club had a duty to its
visitors and the Club’s officials ought to have alerted the police to the grossly uneven distribution of fans on the
terraces. The Club operated and read the closed circuit television and the computer totaliser. Liaison between
Club and police on the day failed to alert the latter to the number of Liverpool supporters still to come. The
onus here was on the Club as well as on the police.

  293. The removal o f barrier 144 was the responsibility of the Club although it clearly acted on the advice of
Dr Eastwood and the Advisory Group which in this instance was misguided.

  294. Likewise, the breaches of the Green Guide were matters which the Club should have appreciated and
remedied.

   295. Lastly, as already indicated, the poor signposting on the concourse tended to produce under-filling of
the wing pens and over-filling of pens 3 and 4. Poor signposting outside the turnstiles and the unhelpful format
of the tickets also led to confusion aggravating the build-up in the turnstile area.

Dear Hr, Knowles,

Bei     Hillsborough Disaster

I would like to thank you and your staff for providing the vide* tape
of the Hillsborough Disaster,

I an sorry to be so long in thanking you, but it is only recently I have
seen the tape in full,    I realise that it must have been very difficult
for your staff to once again go through these horrific scenes, especially
since some of then there is very blunt and direct criticism of your film
crews.

I can only congratulate your fll» crews and your staff on their
professionalism in this Incident.

The video tape scenes have been very useful in instructing energency care
personnel in the difficulties in major disaster management.

Thank you once again for all your help.

  Dear Dr Ashton

  I am now able to send a definitive reply to y o u r letter of 27 April 1989 about the
  Hillsborough catastrophe. I sent an interim reply on 22 May 1989. You asked for
  information about the outcome and welfare of the spectators you were involved with
  personally in the area behind the Leppings Lane terrace, to help you to obtain
  some measure whether attempts to prioritize the dispatch of casualties to hospital
  were effective.
  Your request has been c onsi der ed within Sheffield DHA, and by consultants in
  Acci den t and Emergency who were personally involved in dealing with casualties.
  I am afraid that it is not possible to provide y ou with specific information about
  patients you may have seen at the site, as the information available within the
  A and E Departments does not identify the part of the stadium they came from.

  Is it possible that the West Midlands Police might be able to provide you with
  these details?

 Dr J Wardrope, who is Consultant in A ccident and Emergency Medicine at the Northern
 General Hospital, wo uld be prepared to discuss the generalities of the incident
 with you on a p r o f e s s i o n a l basis if this wou ld be of help to you. He can be
 contacted on P

  I am sorry that I cannot provide you with any more detailed reply.

         19 October 1989



         Dear Mr Wardrope

         Re:         Submissions to Lord Justice Tavlor's Inquiry

         I am writing in response to your letter of 21 July 1989,
         enclosing draft submission to the second part of Lord Justice
         Taylor's Inquiry and first of all would like to apologise for the
         inexcusable delay, caused entirely by your letter having been
         overlooked:  it appears your letter had been pinned to the back
         of Mr McKay's statement which came into the office during July
         and which was simply filed with all our other statements on the
         Hillsborough Inquiry.  Please accept my sincere apologies for
         this oversight.

         I have discussed the submission with the Health Authority, to
         ascertain whether the Health Authority wishes to make any
         representations on its own behalf. It appears the Health
         Authority is pursuing several matters, both internally and
         externally, as it were, with SYMAS and the police and does not
         consider any of these matters should be the subject of
         submissions to the Inquiry but are rather more domestic issues
         for the Health Authority to sort out in-house.

         However, the Health Authority are happy for you and all your
         colleagues to make submissions on the medical aspects of the
         Hillsborough tragedy and in particular on the provision of
         medical equipment and personnel referred to in your draft
         submission.  I wonder whether you wish to make the submission on
         your own behalf or a joint submission from the A & E Consultants
         at both hospitals?  I just wonder whether a joint response might
         carry more weight with the Inquiry.

         As regards the draft submission you have sent me, I think this

should be confined to recommendations about the medical equipment
and personnel at sporting events and the submission could take
exactly the form you have adopted in the first three pages.
However, I do not think it is appropriate for you to make
submissions regarding the hospital response or the Site Medical
Officer as this is really a matter for the Health Authority to
comment upon if it chooses to do so.  In fact, I understand the
Health Authority are taking up the whole issue of communications
with the police and SYMAS at meetings which are beng arranged by
the Deputy DGM, Mr Thornton.  As regards the Site Medical
Officer, again I think this is a matter for the Health Authority
to issue its own policy about the seniority of Doctors who attend
major accidents and your recommendations have already been
brought to the attention of the Health Authority.

I have tried to contact you this afternoon at the hospital to
discuss the above, but thought I should at least drop you a line
to let you know the position.   I have spoken with the Secretary
to the Inquiry who would like all written submissions to be
forwarded by the end of October, if possible.   If you could let
me have your final submission then I will forward it on to the
Secretariat to the Inquiry.   If you wish to send me another draft
first of all, I would be happy to look through it - and promise
to do this promptly!

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

                                                       PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL
       1 June 1989


       Dear Mr Wardrope,


       Hillsborough                    Disaster Inquiry


       Further to our telephone conversation today, I confirm I have
       heard from the Treasury Solicitor dealing with the inquiry about

       a.          Your (and other staff's) possible attendance at the inquiry
                   and

       b.          The potential problem of "contempt" should you speak at the
                   National Conference or publish any articles about the
                   Hospitals response to the disaster.

       Rather than repeat the Treasury Solicitor's views, I enclose a
       copy of his letter, which I think speaks for itself.   It appears
       no hospital staff will be called to the first stage of the
       inquiry, although it appears the hospitals will be allowed to
       make representations about possible improvements in the
       hospital's response (in the context of safety at sports events
       and crowd control).  If you, or indeed any of the medical staff,
       have any strong views about making such representations, I
       suggest you discuss these with Neil McKay.

       In the event you do speak or write about the disaster, would you
       please be careful to honour the proviso in the Treasury
       Solicitor's letter, at least until such time as the inquiry is
       completed.

       I am copying the Treasury Solicitor's letter to Neil McKay, so
       that he can advise other members of staff.

Messrs. Qxley & Coward,
275 Glossop Road,
Sheffield,
S10 2HB.

For the Attention of Miss D. Hallatt.

Dear Sirs,

                          Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry

    I refer to your letter of 26th May to Mr. Whalley, a copy of which you
kindly copied to me.

    May I first confirm that this Inquiry is a non-statutory one, and is not one
to which the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 applies.

    Secondly, Counsel to the Inquiry, Mr. Andrew Collins, Q.C., does not
consider that the response of the hospitals, once they had received the necessary
information, is really in issue in this Inquiry at either stage. (Stage 1 of the
Inquiry is the oral hearing stage which is currently proceeding and is
concentrating on the events at Hillsborough on 15th April; in Stage 2 Lord Justice
Taylor will be considering what recommendations to make as to the future about
the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events).

    Recommendations as to possible improvements (if any) in the hospital
response may well be relevant at Stage 2. However, Counsel to the Inquiry
considers that there is no real reason why Mr. Wardrope should be called at
Stage 1. He does not therefore see any objection in principle to Mr. Wardrope's
participation in the Conference to which you refer or to the publication of the
article in question, provided that the scope of Mr. Wardrope's contribution in
both cases is limited to the response of the hospitals and does not extend to
such matters as the response of the ambulance service which are going to be
dealt with at Stage 1 of the Inquiry.

    So long as Mr. Wardrope proceeds with his conference/article contributions
on this basis, Counsel does not see any real danger of prejudice. Indeed, it
might even be thought helpful for interested parties to discuss what ought to be
recommended with a view perhaps to sensible suggestions for the future, relating
to the "hospital response", being made to Lord Justice Taylor during Stage 2 of
the Inquiry.                                             \

    As vou know. Messrs. Dibb. Lupton. Broomhaari of fi Btitts Court, Leeds (Tel:
0532-439301; Mr. Callaghan) are representing the Trent Regional Health Authority
(which includes the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service) at the Public Inquiry,
am sure that, if your clients had any representations to make to Lord Justice
Taylor at Stage 2, Messrs. Dibb, Lupton, Broomhead would be grateful if you
would contact them so that your representations can be incorporated with the
submissions they are preparing for Stage 2 of the Inquiry.

                                  Yours faithfully,




                                   D. Brumnell

            15th June, 1989




            Dear Colleague,

            As you may know, the West Midlands Police are investigating the incident
            at Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th April 1989.     One arm of the investigation
            concerns the Coroner and he is especially interested in the patients who were
            brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of the Northern General
            Hospital and have subsequently died.   I have provided an over used statement
            of the situation but the Coroner would like much more detail on the
            activities in the Resuscitation Room on that day.   I have therefore provided
            the Police with a list of people involved in the Accident and Emergency
            Department.

            You may therefore be asked for a statement by West Midlands Police.
            There may be difficulties in patient identification but all the available
            information on patients is housed with Mrs.                 Iin the Medical
            Records Office.

            I have contacted the Solicitors acting for the Health Authority in this
            matter and they have advised that if you have any reservations regarding
            these statements, you contact them before speaking to the Police.

            The Solicitors concerned are Oxley & Coward, address - 275 Glossop Road,
            Sheffield S10 2HB, Telephone No. 727485 and the person dealing with this
            matter is Miss D. Hallatt.


            Yours sincerely.

            Dear Hiss Hallatt,

            Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry



            Please find enclosed a copy'of the final draft of the article of the
            Medical Response to the Hillsborough Tragedy.

            We feel that there is little con traversal in this document and mostly is
            a statement of fact, but I would be very grateful for your comments.

            I have been in contact with one of your colleagues whilst you were on holiday
            regarding the development with the Coroner's Enquiry.    The Coroner was anxious
            to find more information regarding those patients that died in the Accident and
            Emergency Department of the Northern General Hospital'.   Using what scanty
            information there was in the medical records and from copies of the post mortem                      *
            results provided by the West Midlands Police I was able to give some indication
            of which patients received resuscitation and which did not.   However, the
            Coroner is not happy with this and has instructed the West Midlands Police to
            interview all those involved in the resuscitation of these patients.                                 f
                                                                                                           ■/.

            I therefore contacted one of your partners and he advised that I proceed by
            giving the Police a list of those I knew to be involved, but at the same time              ;         v
            informed those on the list that if they had any doubts, to contact yourself.                         v
            I enclose a copy of the list of names and also of the letter which I sent out
            to all those involved.

Mr. Peter Knowles,

Bear F!r. Knowles,

As the Consultant in Charge of the Accident and Emergency Department of the
Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, I was very involved in the treatment
and care of the victims of the Hillsborough Disaster on the 15th April 1989.

The type of injuries seen in Hillsborough were quite unusual in medical
practice and many Doctors in the United Kingdom and indeed the rest of the
world are interested in hearing of the treatment of these unfortunate people
and also the problems encountered in handling the Major Incident.

I was wondering if you could be of assistance in helping us set the scene
of this incident.

The live   television coverage of Hillsborough showed very graphically how the
incident   unfolded and some of the problems encountered.    X wonder if it
would be   possible to obtain some of the video footage of the Hillsborough
incident   for use at the scientific raeetings.

I have not approached you on the subject previously since I realise that
the incident is the subject of Judge Taylor's Inquiry but now the interim
report has been published 1 wondered if you might be able to help.

Thank you very much for your help and if you require any further information
or assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,

             Dear Mr Wardrope

             Hillsborough Tragedy

             I attach, in confidence, copies of an exchange of correspondence I have had
             with Dr Alderslade, the Regional Medical Officer, arising from an approach he
             received some time ago from Dr John Ashton, who is, I understand, an academic
             community physician from Liverpool University who was a spectator at
             Hillsborough.

             You will, see that he made an approach regarding the outcome and welfare of the
             spectators he was involved with in the area behind the Leppings Lane terrace.
             I sought some clarification of what he required from Dr Alderslade because, as
             far as'I could see, there would be little information which we could usefully
             provide without finding the identity of the individuals concerned and he
             clearly could not identify this for u s .

             The more particular point is also made as to whether attempts at the ground to
             prioritise despatch of patients were effective.  Apart from the fact that,
             presumably, many casualties were brought away by the Ambulance Service without
             passing through any medically directed sorting area, my impression from our
             de-briefing discussions with you is that we would not be able to trace whether
             particular casualties had acutally been handled by Dr Ashton, or indeed any
             other doctor at the site.

         However, Dr A s h t o n ’s further letter of the 10 July presses me to ask the
         questions of clinical colleagues. I wondered whether you are able to advise me
         accordingly.    I shall be away in the next fortnight (as indeed is Dr Todd) but
         would be happy to discuss this with you on my return if you prefer.        If the
         matter is as straight forward as it seems to me I think Dr A s h t o n ’s latest
         letter invites us to say so.

         Yours                   sin rp rp lv

 DR JOHN ASHTON: H ILL SBOROUGH
 Thank y o u for y o u r letter of 31 M ay 1989; I am sorry that I have not been able to
 reply until now. I share y o u r own appreciation of the likelihood of us being able
 to provide Dr A shton with the information that he is seeking; namel y on the out come
 and w e l f a r e of the spectators that he was involved with perso nall y in the area
 behind the Leppings Lane terrace. You will recall that he was anxious to obtain
 some m e a s u r e as to wheth er attempts, by himself and others, at prioritising the
 dispatch of casualties to hospital was effective. In other words he was asking
 for an analysis of outcome by location of initial trea tmen t and severity.

 I am anxious to be as helpful as I can but I do not wish to impose any u nrea sonable
 burden on y ours e l v e s or y o u r colleagues in Sheffield. Will y o u feel able to simply
 ask the question of y o u r clinical colleagues at the N orthern General and Royal
 Hallams hire Hospitals. Now, with the benefit of rather m o r e hindsight, I w o n d e r if
 t here is anything that they might feel able to say on the subjects in which
 Dr Ashton is interested. However, if y o u do not feel that this w o u l d be worth
 w hile or if they t hemselves have nothing relevant that th ey wou ld like me to pass
 on to Dr Ashton, I am certainly pre par ed to simply w rite to him again and say that
 we cannot help him further.

 With kind regards.
 Yours sincerely

   Dear Richard

   Dr John Ashton : Hillsborough

   John Todd has passed me your letter of 22 May 1989.   Whilst I should obviously
   want to help with anything you think we should do, I am a little puzzled about
   what is required and, perhaps, what it is needed for.   On the face of it, I
   doubt the feasibility of the request.

   Is Dr Ashton interested in those spectators he was involved with?  If so, I
   think it would be impossible to identify them.  Surely he must appreciate we
   could only trace those he, or others, assisted if he could identify them for
   us.

   Clinicians have been studying the progress of the casualties which reached our
   hospitals, of course, and I believe that the incident has thrown up some
   interesting research issues in a clinical context, but I cannot see any
   bearing this would have on any interest Dr Ashton might be expressing given
   the terms of your leter.  If I have misinterpreted this I should, of course,
   wish to consult those clinicians who have been concerned at the Northern
   General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals.

   I would be happy to have a word with you about this on the telephone if this
   would h e l p .

   HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

   I have r eceived a letter concerni ng the Hillsborough trage dy from
   Dr John Ashton, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Com munity Health at the
   Univ er s i t y of Liverpool. He asks for any information that is available on
   the outc ome and welf are of the spectators that he was involved with in the
   area behind the Leppings Lane terrace, in order that he can try to get some
   me a s u r e as to w h e the r attempts, by himself and others, at prioritising the
   de spatch of casualties to hopsital were effective. In other words he is
   asking for an analysis of outcome by location of treatment and severity.

   I know that you have been conducting a detailed de-briefing within Sheffield
   on the various events of that day. I w ond er if y o u y et have any information
   which could t h r o w light on the points about which Dr Ashton is asking.

            Mr. A .P. Mapplebeck,
            General Manager.
            Sheffield Health Authority,
            Westb rook House,
            Sharrow Vale Road,
            Sheffield,
            S11 8EU.

            Dear Mr. Mapplebeck,

            Hillsborough Tragedy

            Thank you for your letter of the 17th July with copies of correspondence
            from Dr.. Alderslade regarding the Hillsborough Tragedy.

            To my knowledge it will be impossible to identify which patients came
            from different areas of Hillsborough on that day.   As you realise we have
            very scant in formation regarding the casualties as they arrived and
            certainly no information as to which part of the stadium they came from.

            I believe that the West Midlands Police are conducting a very in depth
            study of this subject and they might be able to provide full details,
            since they had the time and the manpower to piece     togetherthe exact
            happenings of that day.

            Regarding the point about the priority of patients arriving in the
            Accident Department, I can certainly vouch that most of the seriously
            injured patients arrived before 4.00.    There were three cardiac arrests
            in the department when I arrived and the second wheel of ambulances brought
            large numbers of seriously ill patients with few walking wounded or
            n on critical patients.

            I would be   quite happy to discuss generalities of    the incident with
            Dr. Ashton   on a professional basis if he would wish it.

            I hope this in, formation is of some assistance to you.


            Yours sincerely,

       Dear Mr. Wardrope,

             Thank you very much for your paper on the Hillsborough Tragedy.
       I have sent it on to Nigel Tubbs "Injury". Thanks again for your contribution
       to the Symposium which certainly raised some important issues, which we
       are hoping to address with the "Ginger Group" which will be meeting next
       week at Stoke-on-Trent.

                  Best wishes,

Dear Sir,

Re   Hillsborough Tragedy

the Northern General Hospital was unfortunately very closely Involved
in the care of patients following the Major Incident at Hillsborough
Football Groupd on the 15th April 1989.

You were good enough to ask me to come to Leeds to take part in a
Calender programme on the incident on the 18th April.   I was made most
welcome and I found the experience very interesting, although I must
admit I have still some lessons to learn on television interview techniques!

As you can imagine, this incident has been fairly unique in recent medical
experience and has engaged interest of m any Doctors in this country and
Abroad.

We are in the process of preparing detailed scientific articles on the
injuries which were seen on that day and I feel it might be helpful if
we could preface our various presentations to learned Societies with some
video pictures of the actual incident.

I have not written to you before since I realise that this subject has been
under scrutiny of Judge Taylor’s Inquiry but now the first part of the Inquiry
is over, I wonder if it might be possiblbeto obtain some video tape
of the Hillsfebrough incident.

I do not know whether you are the right person to approach on this subject
but I hope that you can be of assistance.

If you have any questions and I caan be of any further assistance, please
do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,


J. WARDROPE   F.R.C.S.

Dear Mr. Thomas,

Please find enclosed the abstract of the paper from Sheffield on the
Hillsborough Tragedy.

The abstract is rather shorter than you intended for two reasons.
Firstley, the paper has been prepared for publication elsewhere and
secondly, many of the issues are still under review in Judge Tutor's
Inquiry.     I had hoped that the Inquiry would have been published by
now and some issues could be discussed more fully, but this is not the
case.

Dr. Porter said you wished the paper sent off as soon as possible and
this I have done.


Yours sincerely,

           At         15.00 on 15th April play commenced in the                      in the

   1989     the       F.A.     cup semifinal between Liverpool                 F.C.     and

   Nottingham              Forest     F.C.   .       The venue     was     Hillsborough,

   Sheffield           .      Approximately 50,000 supporters had come to

   watch the match.

                A large gate was opened to allow latecomers into the

   stadium. A large number of supporters entered through this

   gate and onto terraces which were already overcrowed. There

   was no escape from the terraces due to a large wire crowd

   control fence at the front of the terrace.

                There was a large crush of people and most of the

   deaths and serious injuries were caused by traumatic asphyxia.

           At       15.06 play was abandoned.              At first there appeared

   to     be some crowd trouble and                   at that time no-one realised

   that     they were witnessing the worst disaster at a sporting

   event in the United Kingdom.

                The        Northern       General       Hospital     and     the      Royal

   Hallamshire                Hospitals      both       implemented        their      major

   disaster plans.              The Northern General Hospital was                  closest

   to     Hillsborough           it    received most of the early              and     most

   seriously injured victims.

                A     total     of    159 casualties were received by                 the     two

hospitals, all but 4 within 90 minutes of the declaration of the

major incident. All of the severely injured were received within

45 minutes.




                                                 2
The Dead.

                  7        patients        were       pronounced        dead        on    arrival.

Resuscitation              was      attempted     on 7 patients          in        cardiopulmonary

arrest.      5        of        these   patients could not         be     resuscitated           .    2

patients were resuscitated and admitted but both died.                                   Therefore

a    total       of        14 patients were pronounced dead                   in     hospital.       81

victims were pronounced dead at the site of the incident.


     The seriously injured.

                                  The major injury was one of traumatic asphyxia

In    the    crush              of people there was simply not                enough     space       to

expand the chest or abdomen to ventilate the lungs.                                   This lead to

a    spectrum of presentation from asystolic cardiac arrest,

profound          unconsciousness,                status      epilipticus,                 cerebral

irritation, cortical blindness to headache and minor neurological

symptoms.

                            20 patients with serious asphyxia were admitted:

2    patients          who        had been resuscitated from             cardiac         arrest,      a

further      16        patients who required ventilation and and two                          other

patients who developed cortical blindness.


                            One         other   patient with a chest injury required

intensive care.

                           19     patients were admitted to the intensive care

units. A total of 81 patients were admitted.

                            Other injuries included 5 pneumothoraces, three

brachial         plexus           injuries,     a large number of soft tissue                 crush

injuries         and two forearm fractures and one minor ankle fracture.




                                                  3
Outcome
                     Ten of the ventilated patients have made excellent                                 $

recoveries. 3 patients have significant neurological sequelae and

3 patients have severe neurological deficits.

                    Two     patients        died    (those in          cardiac      arrest        on

admission).
                 Most of the other patients with less severe injuries

were     discharged        within        one week of      the    incident.           Only      four

of     these patients        were transferred             to    other        hospitals            for

convalescence.

Discussion
                     Many        major     incidents require the skills                   of      the

surgical        staff       of    the hospital.        In this         incident       the      most

severely        injured needed urgent intensive care and the care of

these      patients          involved       the    team    work        of      physicians,

anaesthetists and surgeons.

                     As with almost all major incidents there were

severe     communication problems but these problems are part of a

judical enquiry and cannot be discussed at time of writing.

                     Communications were also hampered by the media

nature of the event and large numbers of staff rang into hospital

causing problems at the switchboard in one hospital.                                However the

live coverage of the event also brought large numbers of staff to

the hospitals by-passing the call out system.

                     The      sudden       arrival of large numbers of                    staff

did     cause   some        problems       since   there        were        many     medical

volunteers      who did not know the hospital major incident                              plan

and     presented      to     the patient triage area.                 Their       help     was

invaluable but thought should be given to the                           siting of the


                                              4
volunteer    sorting   area   and making this area obvious   from   the

outset of an incident.

            There   was difficulty in triage of the severely injured

due to the nature of the injury.

                This incident was a severe test of a hospital to

respond to the sudden influx of large numbers of patients

requiring urgent resuscitation and to deal with large numbers        of

admissions .

tained by casualties fatalities a copy of your major disas
ter plan and any pitfalls or problems that have been high­

ficiencies have been highlighted in documentation, identifica­
tion of victims, transportation of victims, communications
both on and of f site triage etc-

Thank you for your help   I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear     Mr. Rowles,

 Thank you for your letter of the 2nd June regarding the Hillsborough
 Football Disaster.

 We have in fact been asked to prepare a chapter for The Management of

 There are a number of lessons which we have learned from the Hillsborough
 .Disaster, but unfortunately, the matter is still sub^udice because of

 publishing in full the lessons that we have learned.

Dear Dr. Shroeder,


I would like to infers you of the outstanding contribution made by one
of the rotating Anaesthetic Senior House Officers on the 15th April
following the Major Accident at Hillsborough Football Ground.

Dr. Edward Walker, S.H.O. in Anaesthetics presently at Rotherham was at
home and heard of the incident on the radio.   He therefore decided 6a
his own initiative to come to the Northern General Hospital and arrived
here just as the first casualties were arriving.   Almost immediately
the department was flooded with large numbers of acutely ill patients
requiring urgent resuscitation.    For a time Dr. Walker was the only
person with anaesthetic training in the Resuscitation Room and he was
instrumental in bringing speedy treatment and resuscitation to a large
number of patients.

I am indebted to the cool and efficient actions of this young Doctor
on that day and he dese^rves special commendation.


Yours sincerely,

Dear Dr* 0*Connor,

I an sorry that I have not been in touch with you earlier but the
past two weeks have been extremely busy for the department.

I would like to thank all the local General Practitioners who helped
during the major incident at Hillsborough Football Ground on the 15 th
April.    This tragic event brought a huge response from all Doctors
in Sheffield.    Many went to the ground and further Doctors went to the
Royal Hallarashire and I know that many Doctors personally reported to me
in the Accident and Emergency Department of the Northern General offering
their services.

I an very grateful for their support and expert clinical help.

I have already been approached by Dr. Redgrave who was involved in the
incident regarding the future planning of Major Incidents and asking
for involvement of General Practice in this process.

We are obviously reviewing the Major Incident Plans in view of our
experiences on the 15th April and I will certainly ask for a G.P,
Representative to be involved in this process,

I would be very grateful if you eould pass ay thanks on to all the
General Practitioners in Sheffield.

            Thank you very much for your letter of the 30th May regarding Nigel Brayley's
            letter.

            I was quite sure from the outset that his Consultant would not have knowledge

            I would not normally have bothered you with this sort of thing, but I must
            admit that the letter did upset me somewhat and I felt that Mr. Brayley
            required some lessons in tact and diplomacy.

            has got the point.

Thank you for sending me a copy of your reply to Nigel
Brayley's letter.   I had not in fact seen his letter to
you as I retired from the NHS a few weeks ago and there
are now two Consultants in charge of tha   Aand E service in
East Berkshire, Dr Chris Matheson and Mr Charles Litchfield.


However I was very concerned to receive your letter and had
a long talk with Chris Matheson who also knew nothing
about Nigel's letter to you nor of its content.      I was
very concerned both by the tone and the subject of his letter
although I must confess not really suprised, neither tact
nor appropiate communications are his strong points!

I can well understand that you would be some what upset
by receiving this letter and I appreciate seeing a copy of
your remarkably restrained reply, and do hope that you
will be quite reassured that neither Chris Matheson nor
myself had any knowledge of it whatsoever, and most
certainly have no sympathy with its contents.

I beleive that Chris is going to have a word with Nigel
and suggest that a letter of apology to you would not
be out of place.

             With Kindest Regards   -■->______ __________________

Senior Registrar,
Accident and Emergency Departaent,
Wexhaa Park Hospital,

Dear Dr* Brayley,

Letters like this I can do without at present.   As you know, this
Incident Is the subjeot of an appropriate Baplry at present and therefore
satters somewhat aubjudice.

Having said that, I believe that the response of the Efeergeney Services
to this disaster Has excellent, given a number of problems which were
encountered on that day.

No doubt the French SAMV oould have Mounted a better response, but given
the aedical funding and oomltnent to pre-hospital care in this country, I
feel that the Eaergency Services In Sheffield did an excellent job on that
Saturday, given United Kingdon conditions.

I find it hard to envisage how a City has seven trained Anaesthetists
standing by to react iaaediately to such an accident.   They are obviously
«ueh better resourced than we are North of Watford Gap.


Yours sincerely,

Dear |   ~ .

Thank you for your letter which I received today and thank you for your
kind invitation to talk to your Organisation on the 4th July at 8.00p.m.

I would be pleased to come along on the understanding that there are
certain aspects of the Hillsborough Incident that are still subjudice and
therefore I can neither discuss therein the talk, nor answer questions.


Yours sincerely,

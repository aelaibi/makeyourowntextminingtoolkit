227.    MINUTES

     The Minutes of the last meeting held on 2nd December, 1981 were taken as
read and signed by the Chairman as a correct record.

228.    ARISING OUT OF THE MINUTES

     Mr. Wharton reported that he and Mr. Carter had visited Hibernian F.C. as
instructed at the last meeting. He now felt that the club understood more
clearly the position of the Trust with regard to claims.

     Reports on the meetings held on 11th January 1982 with the Football League
Management Committee, on the 15th January with the Pool Promoters' Association,
and on the 25th January with the Football Trust were received and noted.

     The Secretary reported that he had met the P.P.A. on behalf of the Football
League Management Committee and was informed that there was no more money
available from the P.P.A. He was also informed that the receipts of Spotting-
the-Ball were hoped to increase by 5% - 7j%. and that Mr. Cyril Morton refused
to accept the arguments that F.G.I.T. needed more money. It was agreed that
little had been achieved at these meetings except possibly the continued
assurance of the 60% share from the Football Trust.

229.    ADDITIONAL TRUSTEES

     The Trustees felt that this matter should be dealt with as a matter of
urgency. Three nominations had been made, Mr. Neville Vincent, Mr. Cliff Lloyd
and Mr. Sturgeon. Mr. Finney agreed to contact Mr. C. Lloyd with a view to
inviting him to join the Trustees for lunch after the next meeting and it was
agreed that Mr. Neville Vincent be invited to the same lunch.

       Mr. Taylor would endeavour to submit his nomination within the next month.

     Mr. Wharton was to contact Mr. Sturgeon of Aberdeen and ask him to join
the Trustees when they met in Scotland.

229.   ADDITIONAL TRUSTEES (Cont'd...)

     The Trustees considered it would be helpful to vary the location of
meetings from time to time. Manchester and Birmingham were mentioned as
possible venues. It was also decided, where possible, to hold meetings after
having met with other parties or bodies. A meeting with the Scottish Football
League would be arranged for Monday, 26th April at 10.30 a.m., and a meeting
of the Trustees would follow at 2.45 p.m.

230.   FOOTBALL TRUST

     The Trustees had each received a copy of the Minutes of the Football Trust
meeting held on 29th January.

     Mr. Barclay reported upon the Minute on Hampden Park. It was decided to
increase the percentage of grant aid given for safety to Queens Park F.C. from
50% to 60%. This increase was to be retrospective and would be adjusted in the
Club's next claim.

     Mr. Wharton reported on the visit by himself and Mr. Finney, together with
the Football Trust working party, to Belfast, It was decided that Windsor Park
should be treated as an International Ground for claims in respect of safety work.

     The up-dated bulletin on the work of the Football Trust was received from
Mr. R. Faulkner. It was decided that this should be distributed by the Football
Trust rather than by F.G.I.T,

231o   DRAFT REPORT FOR ALL ENGLISH, SCOTTISH AND NORTHERN IRELAND LEAGUE CLUBS

     A draft report compiled by Mr. Barclay was laid before the Trustees. It
was decided to request the Trustees to consider this report and forward any
amendments or recommendations they may wish to make within the next fortnight.
This would enable the Chairman and Secretary to meet to consider the suggested
proposals and submit an amended draft to the next meeting.

     Mr. Carter distributed papers concerning the matter of local authorities
and proposed changes for the financial and administrative controls of the
safety grant scheme. It was felt that the latter should be incorporated in the
report when finalised.

     As regards the request for a list of local authorities making excessive
demands on Clubs, Mr. Carter explained that it was not possible for Messrs. G.
Corderoy to provide such a list. It was decided to advise Mr. Norman Palmer
of the position.

     The question of requesting the appointment of a Government Observer on the
Trust was deferred. Mr. Barclay would sound out Mr. Palmer to ascertain the
probable Government reaction to the suggestion. It was felt that perhaps an
observer would only find it necessary to attend meetings quarterly.

232,   ACCOUNTS

     The   draft accounts were agreed. These could now be placed before the
Football   Trust and the Management Committee =, It was decided that, in the event
that the   full report referred to in Minute 231 was not completed at the next
meeting,   a shorter version should be forwarded with the accounts and a copy of
the more   detailed report forwarded when completed.


                                                                    Continued/3.

233o GEORGE CORDEROY & CO.

     As stated in Minute 231 above, Mr. Carter having distributed a paper on the
proposed changes to the grant scheme, it was agreed that this should be debated
more fully at the next meeting after the Trustees had considered it.

234.    NORTHERN IRELAND

     Papers in respect of an application for funds from Coleraine F.C. were
considered, which, after hearing Messrs. Wharton and Finney after their recent
visit, prompted the Trustees to the conclusion that they should proceed cautiously
with regard to Northern Ireland clubs generally. As it would be necessary for
Messrs. G„ Corderoy to visit Windsor Park to assess safety work at that ground,
the Secretary was instructed to write to the Irish Football League asking if
facilities could be provided for them to visit all other League Clubs in Northern
Ireland at the same time.

     George Corderoy were then to report to the Trustees on the safety work
requirements at these Clubs, after which a meeting with the Irish Football League
would be arranged,,

       The Secretary was instructed to inform Coleraine of this decision.

235.   NORTHAMPTON TOWN F,.C,

     Papers in connection with a proposed new stadium at Northampton were
considered„ The Trustees could not help with this scheme but the Secretary
was instructed to write to Northampton informing them that a report would
shortly be distributed giving detailed reasons for this decision.

236.   CELTIC F.C.

     An application for a grant in respect of the removal of a disused railway
embankment was considered,, Letters received that morning from Strathclyde Police
and Local Authority were read out by the Chairman.

     On the evidence it was decided that this claim was in respect of safety
and therefore eligible for grant aid.

237.   CREWE ALEXANDRA F.C.

     An application in respect of work in connection with a new toilet block was
considered.

     The Trustees decided that this was a very marginal case but felt that they
should accept it, making it clear that they were not creating a precedent. The
Secretary was instructed to inform the club accordingly.

238.   SHEFFIELD UNITED F.C.

     An application in respect of replacement costs of public facilities in
the existing administrative block was considered.

     This application was refused as the Trustees felt that this expenditure
was clearly for improvements.



                                                                     Continued/4,

           On-Saturday,          15th April      1989,         I worked .duties In connection with

             .
             FA.       Cup Semi final L i v e r p o o l :v. Nottingham Forest.                 I came on duty

            at 8 am.         1 was paired up with PS                  ^     [a West- Yorkshire.,Dog

            Handler,        After a br iefing at .Niagara we commenced our patrol at

            about 10.15 am.             Our. patrol area was as follows.                  Hill sborough Corner

            including Holme Lane,             Br ad f i e l d Road, Middlewo6'd Road as far as

           Hawks ley Avenue and Langse tt Road.                      We were briefed by and

            responsible to Inspector P h e n i x , Dog Section Inspector.                             Our duties

           were general supervision of the area including pubs and also to keep

            an eye on traffic build up.                        Right from the time we started patrol

           we found that numerous fans of,both clubs were already in the area

            and large groups were wa n d e r i n g round trying to find pubs which were

            Marlcliffe Road and on arrival                       large number of Liverpool            supporters
fathered outside an off licence at this location bottles and empty

cans strewn all over pavement and road, although all were drinking and

were happy no trouble was being ca us ed at this time.           We also

attended at the Royal Hotel - P eni st on e Road - Bradfield Road where

it was reported fans were smash in g the place up.            The first police

vehicle to arrive had a bottle thrown at it,           On our arrival we

assisted'..to empty the, pub and .to mov e >■ larff; .crowd of up to 200 fans

away from the pub.     The whole of the area at the front was covered in

broken ,|Jass.ef»..bottles'      'e§i>£y •beer .cans, this also spread across

the road and all over a grassed area opposite.           T h e ..ifparent reasdn

for the damage inside the pub was .that they had run out of drink;.

Through out our-patrol-, up'until about'* 2 . 4 5 -pm we toured the area all

pubs that were open ..#%re packed and m a n y were standing outside the

p u b s , all the off licence shops    in the area were also packed with

fans buying drink.     Hundreds w e r e w a lk i ng the streets drinking from

cans and bottles and we saw that a lot of these fans w ere carrying

unopened bottles e t c .   Under normal circumstances when engaged         on

football duties    it is   practice w h e n anything 1 ike this is seen    to

inform by radio the officers at the turnstiles that a drunk or a

peson carrying alcohol        is approaching,   a description is passed and

appropr iate action taken when the person tries to enter the ground.

On this occasion because of the large numbers of person affected by,

and carrying drink it      was   impossible to do t h i s .

Our brief was to take      a meal at Niagara at 3 pm. We were to be in and

out as soon as possible to a ll o w the other dog handlers to m e a l .          I

left the patrol area at about 2.45 p m and at that time it was

noticeable that the pubs were still f u l l .       the last checked was the

Free M a s o n s , Walkley Lane and there were still large numbers standing

outside drinking.     There were also still a lot of fans making their

way along Middlewood Road towards the ground and as said previously a
lot of these were carrying drink.               To get to Niagara I drove along

Periistone Road.       One reason for this was that I could hear on the

radio that Lappings Lane was still busy.                   Penistone Road, however,,

the Kop End was clear of fans it was very quiet and all entrances to
                                                                             ■-   ;   ' '   • '


the ground were clear.          1 heard messages on the personal                      radio

indicating that large numbers of fans were still                    in Lappings Lane.             1

heard messages sending further mounted officers to that end and also

other .serials > 1     o f f l e e r s ,who had been on standby.      . I also heard a .

message from someone outsi.ai-the grouad requesting that the kick off

be delayed in order to-':get. the Liverpool fans in and t r y .t o 'alleviate

some pushing and crushing.            Shortly after I heard a r e p f :that the

authorities presumably F.A. and Hil ls borugh staff had refused this'

request.      I then heard that problems were being caused at one of the

large gates because people were rushing it and trying to force entry

to the g r o u n d .   I then heard a message requesting the gate be opened

in order to prevent serious injury or death as people were still

pushing the gate and it appeared likely they would fetch that gate

and the wall down.         I then went off at Niagara.

At about 3.20-3.30 pm Insp.           Phenix came into Niagara and asked all

those on meal to turn out and go to their after m at c h points as it

appeare d likely the game would be ended early.                    Our after match point

was Middlewood Road,        Hawk sl ey A v e n u e .    As we arrived there a message

came over for all dog handlers to go to the ground as trouble was

threatened from* the Notti ng ha m f a n s .           We returned to the g r o u n d , to

the Leppings Lane end, but before we got inside we were stopped by

Insp.   Phenix and told to remain in Leppings Lane to supervise

dispersion of the crowds and facilitate free access for a m b u l a n c e s ,

fire engines and other emergency s e r v i c e s .            This we did until the

ground had emptied.            .      .     ■                           ••

What was very noticeable during this time in Leppings Lane was the
fact that amongst the first        lot of people to leave the ground" a n d '

pr esumabl y those who had been last in and at the back were a large

number who were still      the worse for drink.       They were all

understandably upset but their behaviour whic h included using obscene

language shouting,     threatening and spitting at police officers was

o bviou sly due to their being affected b y alcohol.           Those that came

out later after the game had been officially abandoned were totally

different, :.they too were upset and angry .-tout did not cauii^he.'ji^enea

like the first     lot had ione. .:.My own feelings outside the ground were

of deep shock and.also a fear that a large scale public order

situat ion could arise outside the ground becausiV:©£ the large number

of those still affected by d r i n k .                                       .;   .

I have worked numerous football matches at this .ground before and I

did   in fact work the same game last year w he n it was very q u i e t .         It

was very noticeable however this year that a lot more drink was being

consumed and also being c a r r i e d .                              .

As far as commmunications are concerned I had no trouble with the

radio and it worked okay t h r o u g h o u t .   Whilst the incident was at its

height h o w e v e r , it was obvious that the control room was swamped w it h

message s and several unav oidable delays in responding to messages were

n o t i c e d , h o w e v e r , given the gravity and enor mi ty of the situation and

the large number of officers calling for advice and assistance I

thought that communicatio ns and control was as good as could be

expected.

I did not come into contact with any ground stewards and I did not

enter the ground or deal with any dead or injured p e o p l e .          I finished

duty at 7.30 pm.

             On Saturday,      15th April   1989,    I worked duties   in connection with

             F.A.    Cup Semi Final Liverpool v. Nottingham Forest.           I came on duty

             at 8 am.     I was paired up with PS               a West Yorkshire Dog

             Handler.     After a briefing at Niagara we commenced our patrol at

             about 10.15 am.        Our patrol area was as fo-llows.      Hillsborough Corner

             including Holme Lane,       Bradfield Road, Middlewood Road as far as

             Hawksley Avenue and Langsett Road.            We were briefed by and

             and large groups were wandering round trying to find pubs which were

             open.    We first informed match control about a group of 50-60

             Liverpool    fans attempting to gain access to the Beehive on Dykes Hall

             Road,   although the pub was closed and displaying notices to that

             effect they were reluctant to leave.            The landlord came out to us and

             asked if we would move them on as he was apprehensive what would

             happen should he let them in.           We also received a call via ground

             radio regarding a complaint of drunks causing trouble - Wadsley Lane

             Marlcliffe Road and on arrival           large number of Liverpool   supporters

attended at the Royal Hotel - Penistone Road - Bradfield Road where

Throughout our patrol up until about 2.45 pm we toured the area all

At about 3.20-3.30 pm Insp.    Phenix came into Niagara and asked all

appeared likely the game would be ended early.       Our after match point

was Middlewood Road,   Hawksley Avenue.    As we arrived there a message

came over for all dog handlers to go to the ground as trouble was

threatened from the Nottingham fans.      We returned to the ground,      to

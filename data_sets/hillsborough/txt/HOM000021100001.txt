FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL: PART I


Your letter of 12th, and David Russell's of 6th;September raise

the question of appeals under s.5 of the Safety of Sports Grounds

Act 1975 (c.52) in the light of clause 13 of the Bill.                It seems
appropriate to write this to you, copying it to him.



2.   My views on the effect, or probable effect, of the Bill on
the 1975 Act are as follows.



3.    Firstly, to get the point out of the way, it is clear that
the decisions of the FLA are reviewable by the High Court by

reference to reasonableness and other well-recognised grounds for
judicial review.



4.   Secondly,      as regards an "appeal" on the merits,          it seems
clear to me       that    1975 s.5(3)   gives no   right   of   appeal   to   a

certificate holder against any other authority than the                  local

authority.     It is very probable that the FLA would be regarded as
an "interested party" for the purposes of section 5 because of

its clause 13 functions.              As such the FLA could appeal against

the local authority.           Also, I think the court would be entitled

to hear what it had to say on an appeal by a certificate-holder

under that section.            But,    as I say,       there is no appeal under

section 5 as it stands against a clause 13(2)                      decision of the
FLA.



5.     Thirdly,       the   appeal    being   against     the    local   authority's

decision       to    include   conditions     in the     certificate,     the   local
authority would simply say, as regards clause 13(2) conditions,

that     it    had   merely    complied   with     a    clause   13(2)   direction.

Clearly its including the conditions could not be challenged.



6.     I think a court would conclude that clause 13 had in effect

precluded an appeal by a certificate-holder under 1975 s.5 as

regards such conditions.             They would be entitled to criticise the

Bill for saying nothing about this interaction, one way or the
other.        So we cannot leave the Bill unamended.



7.     My only comment as            regards the policy decision           is this.

When the FLA acts under clause 13 it is essentially substituting

its    view     of   what   conditions    are    "necessary       or   expedient   to

secure reasonable safety at sports grounds [at which designated

football matches are played]            (s.2(1)) for the views of the local

authority.          Since the merits of the local authority's decision

are appealable under section 5 there is something to be said for

treating the FLA in the same way.               But I can see an argument for


                                                                                   2
protecting the FLA's decisions from challenge on their merits, as
distinct from their reasonableness.

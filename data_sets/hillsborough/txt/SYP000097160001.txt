E N D OF   REPORT
                                HAMMOND SUDDARDS SOLICITORS LETTERS


         Letter I - Dated 20th April 1989 - headed 'Hillsborough: Public Enquiry'
                    introduces proof of evidence submitted by Cleveland Chief Constable to
                    Cleveland enquiry - as an exampleof the kind of thing required.

                    Proof of evidence to be submitted   7-14 days before inquiry opens - may
                    be expected to be supplemented by   oral evidence of C.C. and relevant
                    senior officers.  Recommends voluntary submission of proofs of
                    evidence.

                    Provides 6 headings under which a formal proof of evidence might be
                    prepared.

                    1.    History, geographical area, manning & organisation of South
                          Yorkshire Police.
                    2.    Policing of sporting events: statutory and common law
                          background.
                    3.    Approach of S.Y.P. to policing major sporting events. History
                          of such operations and current standing of operational
                          orders.
                    4.    Specific background to Police involvement in match on 15.4,89.
                    5.    Details of manpower and organisation of match.
                    6.    Events which occurred.

                    Necessary to have statements from as many as possible of the officers
                    deployed including all senior officers.  For all officers it will be
                    helpful to have statements indicating when they came on duty, to whom
                    they were responsible, where they were, what they saw and did.

                    Obviously a big task   but quality of proof of evidence will depend upon
                    accuracy and quality   of information provided by these officers.

                    Not CJA but self taken records will do.

         Letter 2 - dated 20. 4. 89 headed 'Hillsborough1.


•   ..
                    Enclosing letter of advice relating to the public enquiry and the sub
                    judice rule.

                    Notification that author Peter Metcalf will be on holiday 22-30/4.

         Letter 3 - dated 21. 4. 89 headed 'Hillsborough Stadium Disaster'.

                    Position re. Section 85 complaints.   Inappropriate to investigate
                    until public enquiry has reported.   This applies also to allegations
                    of crime.  Suggest Force regularise this position by corresponding
                    with DPP on this matter.
Letter 4 - dated 21. 4. 89 headed 'Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Second Letter'.

           Counsel will be Bill Woodward QC who has approved 6 headings in Letter
           1^ above. Following points to be raised by counsel:

           a)    Four copies of any films/photographs etc. (Requested by 0-/ w M
                 letter to Mr. Dear).
                 Copies of statements made to West Mids. enquiry.   (RequestedCa
                 by letter to Mr. Dear).                                         S>?.s , ,
                 Requires sight of all operational orders, manuals etc. Cn
                 Mr. Woodward wants to visit a game - Hillsborough
                 preferably - and for demonstration of communications and
                 surveillance equipment used in crowd control,
           e)    S.Y.P. have no investigative role to play in relation to
                 events of 15. 4. 89. But this firm is concerned with more
                 general background picture of the type of problems
                 experienced at and in the vicinity of Hillsborough when
                 football takes place.

Letter 5 - dated 21. 4. 89 headed 'Police Committee Meeting'.

           Provides C.C. with extracts from Popplewell report re. demarcated
           responsibilities of police and stewards.

Letter 6 - Dated 24. 4. 89 headed 'Re: Hillsborough Stadium Disaster'.

           Resume of points covered in telephone conversation between Miss
           Norcliffe (of Hammond Suddards) and DCC.

           1.   Albeit, SYP have asked for copies of statements taken
                 from SYP officers by West Mids. team, we should get self-taken
                 statements from relevant officers. Relevant = officers in
                 Leppings Lane area and all senior officers on duty.
                 May be 50 - 100 officers.
           2.   No statements required from lay individuals about the
                 events of 15. 4. 89. But, stats are required from officers
                 who can provide history of Hillsborough and the policing
                 of matches there.
                 Suggest C.S. Duckenfield, Supts. Marshall and Murray and
                 C/I Beal may be be'st placed. The latter 3 are in best position
                 to review history.
                 Plus Mr. Mole can provide useful information on history
                 and ticket allocation etc.
                -Self-taken statements can and should be obtained from these
                 officers.  Should relate to F.A. semi last year and another
                 previous F.A. semi and one or two league games.   Statements
                 should also set out their function at these games, thereby
                 providing a general and specific guide to policing and
                 senior officer involvement in football matches at
                 Hillsborough.
  All relevant documentation - i.e. operational orders etc
  etc should be collated and 'flagged' re. most important
* regulations and sections to be considered by counsel. Also
  require to know, at this stage, whether there are any
  regulations not actually complied with on the day.
  Counsel cannot, technically, see the individual senior
  officers until they make formal request.  Solicitor will
  see them in first instance on Wednesday 26. 4. 89.
  Outline suggested by Mr. Hayes in earlier tel. conversation
  with Miss Norcliffe will suffice for the actual events
  of the tragedy.
  Counsel will attend Police HQ for meeting on Wednesday
  26. 4. 89 at 2.00 p.m.
  Counsel require list of all names and ranks of senior
  officers on duty at match (prior to Wednesday). Also
  require ranks and full names of 4 officers to be seen by
  Mr. Metcalf on Wednesday.

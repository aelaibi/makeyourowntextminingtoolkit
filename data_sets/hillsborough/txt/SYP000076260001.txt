Nottingham            Forest          fans        star\ed        arriving          at    about       10.3 0 a m       (1030)       in

groups.              They were              in    cars    a m i on       foot.           We    didn't      see a n y         coaches

arrive.                                                            \



All    the      f an s       were     v e r y w ell       behaved           I d i d n ’t see         any   trouble.                They

were     all        very      jovial.




We were         very         busy and            served     a    lot     of      fans.         I only       saw a       couple          who

appeared            drunk      but       they were n't             troublesome,               I didn't          witness       any

fighting            or a n y       t yp e    of    disturbance              at    all.         It was      a very           friendly

atmosphere             everyone             was    in a f a n t a s t i c         moo d .       It w as         like    a    carnival,

It w a s      very        cr o w d e d .



There        wa s    one      police         officer        on     f oo t     standing         outside          the    used    car

garage        opposite             directing          the       Forest        fans      to    the    ground.            I only

heard        him     say      'Come         along     lads       hurry        into      the    gr o u n d ' .         Everything

was    very         friendly.                The    police         officer         was       there    from about             ten

o'clock         but       lots      of      police       officers           were     coming         and    going       they were n't

letting         cars         park     any        further        up H e r r i e s     Rd So ut h       than       our    van.            The

road     wa s       k ep t    clear.



Most     of     the N o t t i n g h a m           Forest        fans     ha d     gone       past    us a b o u t      ten    to

t hr e e .          The      odd    one      or    two    were         sti ll     going       past    at    ten       past    three

(1510)        but      not     a    lot.




We    d i d n ’t hear          anything            from     the        ground      there       was    no    noise.




At    about         quarter         past         three    (1515)         some      f a ns     started       filtering          back

towards         us a n d       I thought            this        wa s    strange.              When    they       got    to    us    one
                                                                                                                                   PAGE          3
                                                                                                                                   S2052

of    the    f a ns    said,        ’ Its      dreadful            in t h e r e      there's         people        everywhere’.




Another       man said,             ’T a k e      your Van          ho me     t h e r e ’s g o i n g       to    be a        riot.

Everyone          seemed         subdued.              No     one     seemed         to    know what            w as    going           on.




More     fans        continued           to    come      out a n d         just      stop      for    tea a n d         c off ee .

Everyone          seemed         qui et .



About       three       thirty          (1330)         someone        said        t h e r e ’s a     couple        of    people           of

dead and          I realised             something            terrible            had     happened.              The     r a d i o w as

on and       they were             saying         keep       the    r o ad    c l ea r     and      they    said 4 were                  dead.




I've     j us t      remembered           about         twenty        to     three        (1440)      on R a d i o       Hal lam          the

announcer            wa s    saying       d o n ’t come            down      to     the    ground we've                got     a

c o n g e s t i on    outs i d e . ’



We    d i d n ’t see         any    Liverpool            fans       at     all      a n d we     left a b o u t         te n       to    six

(1750).              It wa s       terrible            the    atmosphere             from      before       the m a t c h           to    the

atmosphere            after        was    so      different.                 The     people         were    so     upset           when

they were            corning out.                 No    one     seemed        to     know      or    believe           what        was

going       on.



At    about       quarter          to    f iv e    (1645)          a man      drove        past a n d       shouted            out       of

the    window         80     people       are      dead.            I couldn't             believe         it,     it wa s

terrible.



We    were    h ere         last    year       1988      for       the     s am e    m a t c h a n d we         d i d n ’t see           any

trouble       it w e n t         very well.                  I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r        whether          there        were

more     police         h er e     last       year      or    not.           There        were      certainly           police           about

both    years.

             I w o u l d n ’t like     to    say why      I thought     the        tragedy     happened,        I just

             think    it was      a   lot    of    circumstances.             As    I s a i d we    n e v er   saw any

             trouble      t his   year      or    last.    Everyone      wa s       gr ea t.

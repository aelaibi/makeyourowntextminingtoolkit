I am     directly          concerned with                    the    security             implications                for       the       safety

This     is    of    paramount             importance              with       regard          to L e a g u e       games.            Of    course

am    still        concerned with                the     security             implications                 as     tickets           perhaps        to

probiems „

My    role     involves          the       following:—

1.     Supervision              and      responsibility                  fo r      the       stile      room.           The     stile        room

is    responsible             for     issuing          floats           to    turnstile            operators,              issuing           money

to    the     Chief       Stewards          to    enable           them       to       pay    their        stewards,            checking

the    takings          from     turnstile             operators              and       from      programme             sellers,           or

tickets        where       appropriate.

2.     Making        my    own      notes        as    to     the       number          of    turnstiles             in use a n d

available           for    the      various           areas        of    the       ground,         based          upon     the

information             provided           to me       by the           Club       administration,                   so    that          I could

give     instructions               to     those       employed              in    the       stile      room       to     prepare          the

sheets        for    issuing          to    each       turnstile              operator.

3.     Inspecting             the     turnstiles              before          each match,               to      ensure         that       the

correct        signs       are      properly           displayed              in a c c o r d a n c e         with       the     tickets

issued        to    spectators,             and again              based          on    information               supplied           by    the

C 1ub a d m i n i s t r a t i o n .

4.     Carrying           out    further          inspections                 of       turnstiles            at    intervals              around

the    ground,          and     dealing          with any           problems             t h at    may arise.                  For       example,

suspected           forged       tickets          or     insufficient                   float      money,          or w h e r e          (on v e r y
r a re    occasions)            a     turnstile          jams.

5.       Preparing           the      paperwork          to      record        the    expenses          of    the       re f e r e e ,

linesmen,          reserve            officials,             and    paying          the    same       (usually          the     expenses

are      agreed        about         30 minutes          before          kick       off    and    the       officials           a re     paid

after       the    match).

I am      not     responsible               for    the       stewards          in    the    terraces          or      stands.            No r

am    I responsible                  fo r   the    training             and    recruitment             of    stewards.

On    match       days,        I am         responsible            for       preparing        the      lists       of     turnstiles,

noting       any       instructions               given       b y _____________               the      Administration

Manager,          as    to     the        number    to       be m a d e       available          and    the      t y pe    of    ticket

to    accept       through            a     particular           turnstile.               I am    not       concerned with                  the

allocation             of    turnstiles            as     1 comply            with    the     instructions                given        to me

by                                   I understand             t ha t     the    allocation             of    turnstiles            is a

matter       to    be a g r e e d           between      senior          Club       officials          and    the       Police,          and

                        simply            provides       me w i t h          instructions.              I normally              prepare

these       l is t s    the      night        before         a match.           From       these       lists,         those      working

in    the    stile          r oo m    allocate          turnstile             operators          to    the    turnstiles               as    and

when      they arrive                and     in the      event          of    a League        game,         those       turnstile

operators          are       provided with               fl o a t s .

A    turnstile          operator             is   not    allocated             to a       particular          turnstile            at

every       match       and     therefore           could          be    d e p l o y e d at      any    turnstile              around        the

ground.           However,            where       there       may       be    difficulties             in t a k i n g      money         o w in g

to    the    variety           of     tickets,          or    different             amounts       of    ca s h     being        handed

over,       we    normally            arrange       for       an    experienced             turnstile            operator          to w o r k

that      turnstile.                 Shortly       after         the     kick       off,    the       turnstile           operators

close       down       their         turnstiles          and       then a ttend            the    stile       room        to    hand        over

their       takings.

A new       turnstile           operator           is    normally             put w i t h a n         experienced              turnstile

operator          in t h a t         they work          s i de     by    side .       The     turnstile            operator            does

not      need     direct        training           as    it      is a        very    simple       matter         to     operate          the

he    becomes        aware       of a          problem             can    contact          me    by    rad i o        and    direct           me    to

the    turnstiles.               Other          than          this,       I do     no t      have any            r e s p o n s i b i 1 ity         for

secuirty        as    Doug       LOCK           is       in    charge.           He     is a b l e         to    keep       in    contact

with     the    chief       stewards                by    radio,          and    also        has      information                provided           by

the    computer           count       and       the       TV       streens       located           in the            C l u b ’s c.ontro 1

room.         However,          if    I witnessed                   a security             problem,             say    by    spectator

violence,          I would           of     course            contact        Doug       LOCK       or a n y          nearby Police.

I now       turn     to m y      involvement                   in the        events          which         to ok      p l a ce    on the           15th

turnstiles           at    the       ground          shortly after                 my arrival.                   I s t a r t e d my

inspection           at    the       Leppings             Lane        end.       I checked             that          the    correct           signs

were     displayed          outside             the       turnstiles             and       found       that          everything              was    in

My     primary         concern            was     with       the       entrance          lettering,              but      there      is a l s o

another          form       of      sign       postings           in    t ha t    signs        about        10— 12        inches        square

th e     Leppings           Lane         end,     there       were       signs         denoting            th e N o r t h      Stand,          West

Stand,       and Leppings                  Lane        standing,              I do       not     specifically                 remember

checking          the       signs         on     this    occasion,               but     I would           have     done       so as       a

matter       of       course,            and     the    signs          were      displayed,

I then       prepared               the    turnstile              operator's             sheets        by     noting          down      the

turnstiles             for         e a c h area,        and       the    type       of    ticket           for     each       turnstile              by

reference             to    the      entrance           lettering,                I provided               the     l i st s    to    the m e n

working          in the            stile       r o o m wh o       then     proceeded             to a l l o c a t e        turnstile

operators             to    the      available           turnstiles,

I regarded             the         sign    posting           outside          the      turnstiles             to    be     adequate            as

t he     ticket        clearly            shows        the    entrance            le t t e r ,    and       this       ca n    be m a t c h e d

up w i t h       the       entrance            letter        outside          the      turnstiles.                 T he    other        t yp e      of

signing          is a l s o         adequate.            However,             I am aware              of    the     match       that       in

effect       the       entrance            lettering              ra n A - C - B .        With        hindsight            it m a y      have

been      preferable                to    have     the       entrance            lettering            in s e q u e n t i a l        order

A - B - C , and        t hi s       sequential           order          now      operates         for       the     1989/1990

(000089)/(000090)                        season.

I made       a    second            inspection           of       the    turnstiles              at    about        11,30 am            (1130)

just     after         the         turnstiles           opened.            The      purpose           of    this       i n s p e c t i o n wa s

Whilst       at    the      Leppings           Lane     end       the    turnstile              operators               to    turnstiles                 8

and    9 drew my            attention           to a b a r r i e r           dividing           those         turnstiles.                  The

lettering          above        those         turnstiles           matched             the    tickets,             ie    entrance

letter       " A” was         displayed.

Those       turnstile           operators            had     told       me    that          Stuart      THORPE,              Chief       Steward

f or   th e W e s t        stand      had      drawn        their       attention             to      the     barrier.              At        the

back    of     the      Leppings           Lane      turnstiles,              I noticed               the     dividing             rails

behind       those         turnstiles           separated              8 and       9    turnstile.                 It    had       of    course

been agreed             in a d v a n c e       to    use     1— 10 t u r n s t i l e s          for      the N o r t h          stand and

11— 16 for         the      West      stand.           As    the       gate    was          left      dividing           8 a n d 9,            I

radioed        Doug        LOCK     a n d we        agreed        that       the       dividing          rail       should          be

unlocked          and      with      the      use    of a h a n d        rail          to    create          a barrier             between

turnstiles           10 a n d        11.       Doug     LOCK       also       stated          th at     two        stewards             foe

deployed          on the        barrier.

Stuart       THORPE          confirmed          to me        that       two    stewards               would        be    deployed              to

deter       any    fan      from      climbing          over       the       barrier          and      he w o u l d a l s o             see        that

the    barrier          was     put      in    place.         I did          in f a c t       witness          the       barrier              being

put    in     place,        and      1 confirmed             to D o u g       LOCK          what      ha d    been       do?ie.          The

o p e ration was            completed           in m i n u t e s .           I noticed             th at      the       barrier          was        in

place       from my         position           outside        the       turnstiles.

incidents          which        occurred            at a b o u t       midday          ( 1 2 0 0) .     The        first        involved             a

young       co u p l e ,    both Liverpool                  fan s,      who    were          seeking          permission                to e n t e r

tickets        had      been        purchased          on the          black       market.             (Both        complained                 t ha t

explained          that       the     Police         would        not    let       them       go      round        to    the       Kop     en d as

fans       could       go       in at       that       end.          He       was       a    senior          officer          and       said       that

the    two       fans       could          not    be a l l o w e d            e nt r y ,          I do       not       remember          what       I wa s

t old,      save       that          the    reason          or      on e      of     the         reasons         g iven was             to    co nt r ol

numbers.           I informed                the       couple            wh o      then went                a w a y.      I accepted               and

always       have       accepted             that          the      Police           have         the       right       to    say yes          or       no

on    such matters.                    I was          obliged            to a c c e p t           the       Police        d i r e c t i o n as          they

had    control          over          fans       entering            t he       turnstiles.                  The       second       incident

occurred when                   a Police          Sergeant,                again            outside           the      turnstiles,             showed

me    some       tickets             which        th e P o l i c e            s u s p ected were               forgeries.                The       Police

Sergeant          told          me    that        the t i c k e t s h a d               been found               in the           possession             of

a Liverpool             supporter.                    I do       not       remember               my    conversation                in deta i l

with       the    Police             Officer,          s a ve       that        I was            informed           that      the       Liverpool

supporter          had          in his       possession                  an     unreasonable                   number         of    tickets.

The    Police          Sergeant             said       h al f       a dozen.                The    Sergeant             also       t o l d me       that

the    Liverpool                supporter             had      been        taken            to    th e P o l i c e        room.          I wa s         not

informed          of    the          background             to      how       t hi s        supporter            had      been      stopped and

taken       to    the       Police          room.          I wa s        asked          to       identify           whether         the       tickets

were       genuine          or       not.         The tickets were                          for the N o r t h             stan d.            I took       two

or    three       to    examine             t h em.         I c o u l d not             tell w h e t h e r             they       were       forgeries

or    not.        1 am          of    course          aware         of     the       type         of    ticket          that       is    issued.

They       looked       genuine,             but       I thought                it      right          to     refer       the m a t t e r          to

                        as       she w a s        able         to    check           the         water       mark       which       is       invisible

except       under          a    certain          type         of    light.                 I decided            to     take       the       tickets

to                               whom       I met          on m y w a y            to       the    main        reception            a r ea .        I

showed       her       th e      tickets          and       she a s s u r e d               me    that       the       tickets          were

genuine.           I went             back       to    the P o l i c e             Sergeant             at     the      Leppings             Lane       end

to    inform       him what                I had       been         told        and         1 heard          no m o r e       about          the

matter.          I then          returned             to    the      stile           room.             I. di d      not      go    back       to    the

Leppings         Lane           end a g a i n         t ha t     day.           (Between a b o u t               midday           (1200)       and       1.

30    pm    (1330)          I did          try    to w a l k         up       the       lane       from        the      car       park       area

outside          the S o u t h            stand         to    the     Leppings             Lane        end    on    one      or    two

occasions             but      was        told      by       the P o l i c e         that     they        preferred           me       not     to

walk       up    the        lane        as    they were              attempting              to    deter          other      people          from

doing       the       same,         ie       f ans,      and     it w o u l d         not     look        good      if    I walked

through.              I was         of       course          dressed        in a          suit.         The       purpose         of    the

intended             visit         was       to    ensure        t ha t     the       turnstiles              were       open and working

properly.               If t h e          turnstile             does      jam        or    there        is s o m e       other         p r o bl e m,

it    is    likely            to    occur          at    some        point       shortly           after          the    turnstiles             open.

However,             I was         no t      too    concerned             by     no t      being        able       to    gain access                to

the    Leppings               Lane        e n d as       the     Club       has       its     own       camera          system which

shows       pictures               of     the      area       behind        the       turnstiles.                  If    there         had     been

any    problems,               I would             have       been      contacted             by       r a d io    by D o u g      L O C K.         In

Stand and             the      Leppings             Lane        end.

In    the       stile         room        I had a            cup of       te a       and     prepared             the    paperwork             to    pay

the    referee              and     other          match        officials.                 I was        in or       near      the       stile        room

fo r a b o u t        an      hour        and      in t h is         period          I had        some       lunch.          I left          the

who    was       present            on       each       occasion.

I went          to    th e     Club          control          room     to       keep myself               informed           of    the       overall

At    about        2.15         (1415)          to 2 . 3 0       pm    (1430)           I agreed          the      expenses             with       the

referee          and       other          match        officials.                 I was      in    the       r e f e r e e ’s room.                I

took     the       figures            back       to       the    stile        room and a r r a n g e d                 for    one       of    the

after       the       match.

Normally,             at    League             games        I am      preoccupied                with     dealing            with       any

problems           that         may arise              in the         taking        of m o n e y        by    turnstile             operators.

For    an FA C u p m a t c h                   where        no m o n e y      is    involved and                  simply       tickets,

there       is     not      the       same       need        for      me    to     be    positioned               near       the    turnstiles

and    it     is m o r e            appropriate              for me         to     be    located          near         the    Club       co n t r o l

room     so      th a t     I can          be    directed             at    any moment             by D o u g          LOCK    to a

Whilst        at      the       pitch          end     of    the      tunnel        I d id        notice          the     ground         filling

u p bu t      I did         not       notice           any      crowd       problems.              T he      players          tunnel          is of

away     to      tell       whether             there        were      any        crowd      problems             on    the    terraces                at

the    Kop       end       or       the    Leppings             Lane       end.

Between          2.30       (1430)             and 3.00          pm    (1500)           I would         have       had       occasion          to

speak       with        Doug         LOCK       on m o r e       than       one     occasion,             as we         would       normally

find     t h at       our       paths          crossed          before       a big          game     w h e n we         were       attending

to    our     respective                  t as k s .        I cannot         specifically                 remember            details          and

timings          of     those         conversations,                   but        I do      recall           on one                occasion

mentioning              that         the       centre           pens       at     the     Lepp i n g s Lane             e n d a p p e a r e d to            be

pretty        full,         but       there          was        s t i ll     plenty         of     r o o m in the w i n g           pens.          I

was    not       c o n c e r n e d as           it     is       q uite       normal         for     the c e n t r e                pena/lofill

more     quickly            than          the    wing        pens.          Many        f a ns    like       to    s'          behind          the

g oal.        I could               not    tell        how      full       the     centre         pens       were       from       my    position,

and    certainly                1    did       not     see a n y       signs        of      distress.

I also       remember           a further          conversation              with       Doug       LOCK        when      he     came         up

to me       and    said      that      he h a d     just    received a                report          t ha t   a    gate        had         been

o p e n e d at     the     L eppings Lane            end.         This       conversation                took       place          at       the

pitch       end    of     the    tunnel.           I do    not        remember        whether            this      was        before          or

after       the    players        c am e o n t o     the    pitch.            Doug       LOCK         said     that        he w a s

going       back     to    the    Club       control        room.           We    were       both       very       surprised                but    1

assumed        that       the    s i t u ation was         under        Police          control.

I also       remember           that    on    one    of    the        two    occasions             when        I did       h a ve       a

conversation              with    Doug       LOCK    that        he    said       there       were       2,000          to 3 , 0 0 0         fans

still       outside,        but      there     was      sufficient               room    in the          wing       p en s      to      take

t hem.       Whilst        I remember          t hi s     comment           being       mad e,        I cannot           remember

whether        it w a s     on    the    occasion           of    the       first       or    the       second          conversation.

As    the    game       started,        I noticed           fans       climbing          onto         the      perimeter               track.

I pointed          out     to a P o l i c e        Sergeant           the    number          of    fans        getting          onto         the

perimeter          track,        but    he    said      that      the       Police       at       that      end     c o u l d deal

with     any      problems.            I made       my way        to    the       Club       control           room,       but me t

Doug     LOCK      coming        towards       me    in the           tunnel.           I told          him     that       people

were     coming         over     the    safety       fe n c e .        I next         remember            the      referee

leading        the      players        off    the    pitch.

More     and more          fans      were     coming        over       the       safety       fence         and     a    large          number

were     running          across       the    pitch.         I tried             to   keep        the    f an s     ou t      of       the

tunnel.           Some     wanted       to    follow        the       players         down        the    tunnel.              Th e      Police

initially were              trying       to    keep       people        off       the    pi tc h.           There        was       a

certain amount              of    taunting          from     the       Nottingham Forest                       supporters               who

obviously          were     not      aware     of w h a t        had    happened.                 For    that      matter,              nor

was    I aware          of w h a t     had    happened           at    the       Leppings          Lane        terraces.

I then       received word              of m o u t h      reports           stating          t ha t     a number           of      people

had    been       injured,        this       was    followed           by    reports          that       there          were       a    number

dead .       I could        not      believe        it.      I overheard                requests            for    stretchers

from     f an s    on     the    pitch.        I believe              these       requests            may      have      been made                to

the     ground            staff        who       were     in the          tunnel.             I remember           fans       stripping           the

advertising                hoarding              around        the     pitch.

Although             I had       the        Club        radio,       there         was    far    too m u c h        noise       and       it w a s

not     possible            to       hear        any message              relayed         over       the    radio.            From    there

the     situation               go t    more        and       more     chaotic.               There    were        hundreds          of    people

on     the      pitch.           It w a s         total        confusion.                I witnessed           the       scene       from       the

p l a y e r ’s t u n n e l .

I was          at    the    pitch           end     of    the       tunnel         until       about       3.HO     pm    (1520).            After

that       I retreated                 to     the       top    of    the      tunnel          and assisted            spectators             as

best       I could.              For        example,           many wanted access                     to    telephones,               I was

also       responsible                 fo r      turning        people            away    from       the    players           r o om a n d

referees             room.           Between            about         3 . 2 0 (1520)          to 3 . 4 5 pm    (1345)          I m a y well

have       gone       to    t he       Club       control             r oo m a g a i n a l t h o u g h I c a n n o t            remember

with       any       certainty.                  This     is    important            as       I do    re c a l l    someone          saying

that       a    gate       had       been        broken        down,         but    upon       checking        the       TV    screens          in

the     Club         control           room       I could           not      find    any       gate    having         been       broken

down,           I cannot             remember            who    t o l d me         this,       nor    do    I remember            the      time,

b ut    it      is    likely           that       this        occurred            after       3.20    pm    (1520).

Doug       LOCK       came       up     to       me at        about       3.43      pm    (1534)       and     told       me     that      if the

game       was       abandoned              we    had     to    ensure            that    the    e xi t     gates        were     manned and

opened.              Doug       sent        me    to     the    south         stand       to    ensure        that       the    exit       gates

were       all       manned          and      opened.           Most         of    the    spectators           were       s t i ll    in s i d e

the     ground.             I knew            from       Doug       LOCK      that       both    th e H o p        e nd a n d     the

Leppings             Lane       end     exit        gates       were         open    and manned.               The       announcement                at

that       stage          had    still           no t    been         m a d e to a b a n d o n        the game.

As     I went         off       to     ensure           that        those exit            gates       were opened, I noticed                         a

fireman             behind       the        Police        control            room    in the          lane a n d      near       the       car

p ark      attempting                to a d m i n i s t e r         s om e    form       of    resuscitation              to    someone

l y i ng       in the       road a nd             an     ambulance            was    called          from     the    bottom          of    the

car     park         in    the       South        stand and            the        injured       person was            put      in that
ambulance          and        t a k e n away.              I was       shocked           by the          sight       of a L i v e r p o o l

f a n wh o    must        have          been       taken        through          th e    uncovered             seated          area    in the

south       stand        to    the       lane.

The    abandon           message             was     announced           at      4.10        pm    (1610).           It w a s     s till

total       confusion.                  I di d       not    really         know what               had    happened             although         I

had    of    course           heard          reports        of     fatalities.

I called          home        to    reassure              my wife        that

oka y .      I walked              about        in or       n e ar      the      player's           tunnel        and      stile       room

trying       to    keep        fans          away     from       the     tunnel          and       the    official             areas.       I

was    also       checking              to    ensure        the        turnstile             operators          had      returned.              I

was    listening              to    their          stories         of w h a t       had       happened          at      the L e p p i n g s

Lane      end.       Towards             the       end     of    the     afternoon                I was       detailed          together

with      four     others           to       collect        the        programme             money which             had       been    stored

in the       gymnasium.                  Th e      programme            money       is       normally          stored          in the

gymnasium.               I do       not       remember           who     asked          me    to    do    this       task.        It w a s          not

a    pleasant        task          as    we     discovered              that      the        other       end    of      th e    g y m was

being       used     as a m o r t u a r y .                I believe             that        this    h a p p e n e d at         about    5.00

pm    ( 1700).           We     collected             the       money      from         the       head    programme             salesman.

The    money was              in    bags        and       consisted           mostly          of    coins.           About       S O ,000

30,000       programmes                 are     sold       per m a t c h .          I then          went       b ac k    to     the    stile

room a nd         wa s    in       the       stile        room     until         about        7.00       pm    (1900)          when    I w e nt

home .

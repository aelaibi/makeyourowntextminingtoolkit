                                                              Date:             January 1998




                    M   r      La/ cJ p j U .

Thank you for speaking to me today about the scrutiny o f evidence concerning the
Hillsborough football stadium disaster which is being conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith.

2.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to carry out this task by the Home Secretary.
His objective is to establish whether there is any significant evidence about the disaster which
was not previously available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, to the Inquests, or to the prosecuting
and police disciplinary authorities. If there is significant new evidence, he intends to see
whether it might have affected the outcome o f any o f the proceedings. He hopes to report
his findings to the Home Secretary early next year, and the Home Secretary intends to publish
his report.

3.     You may wish to see his terms o f reference, and I attach a copy.

4.      As I said when we spoke, the Judge is looking at the way in which evidence was
collected from the police officers who were involved in the disaster. We have found that
officers at the scene - including o f course yourself - were not asked to make witness
statements in the usual way. Instead they were asked to write down their ‘recollections’ o f
what had happened. South Yorkshire police later passed these to the West Midlands police,
who investigated the disaster on behalf o f Lord Taylor.

5.      Some officers’ recollections went to the West Midlands police investigators in a
different form from that in which the officers had originally produced them. They had been
‘vetted’ by people at force headquarters, who made changes to them and asked the officers
who had made them to sign them again in their altered form. We have o f course discussed
the background to that with South Yorkshire police management and their legal advisers.

6.      One o f these altered documents was yours. What we are curious about, as I said on
the telephone, is the extent to which officers who were asked to sign altered recollections
were reluctant, and/or put under pressure, to do so. We wanted to make contact with you
because the recollections which you produced seem to have undergone important changes.

C:\HILLSBOR\MAIN\WALPOLE.233
7.     I attach copies which we have made o f your original andamended recollections, as
they are preserved in the South Yorkshire police archive. The original version exists both
handwritten and as it was typed up by the South Yorkshire Police typing service, and I attach
copies o f it in both forms.

8.      The typed copy o f your original version is headed ‘document record print’. I am
afraid that it is, in parts, a little faint but I have run a pink marker pen over the parts o f it
which, so far as I can see, were removed or changed before the final version was sent to the
West Midlands Police investigation team. This final version is the other typed document
enclosed - you seem to have signed it at the bottom o f each page.

9.      I have spotted three deletions. These are

                  ‘I did not hear any radio message for the entrance to the central pen to be
                  closed off, despite this being packed solid’ (page 3);

                  ‘I felt that fans outside the ground trying to get in would become ‘excited’ by
                  hearing all the cheering and that it could make things worse’ (also page 3);

                 the whole o f the final section, starting ‘There seemed to be no organisation or
                 radio messages ...’ (pages 5 and 6).

10.    There is also an alteration on page 4, where you say you saw Mr Duckenfield run
onto the pitch to stop the game. (It was in fact Superintendent Greenwood who did this, as in
your amended version). If you see any other changes, please let me know.

11.      The Judge would be grateful for any observations you may want to make to him about
the extent to which you were reluctant to sign the amended version o f your recollections or to
which you felt police management pressurised you into doing so. I do o f course understand
that this is a very unusual request, and that it may put you in some difficulty especially given
that we have unavoidably had to contact you via South Yorkshire police.

12.    I entirely appreciate that you may wish to seek advice before responding. But I
wonder if I might nevertheless ask you to let us have what you want to say by Friday 16
January. I am o f course very willing to talk again over the phone if that would help. I look
forward to hearing from you.

  place    in the North         Stand by C h i e f        Superintendent                  Duckenfield.               I „ as

  approximately           10.20 a.m.      and I s u b s e q u e n t l y        took      up a p o s i t i o n        on     the

  track under        the North Stand            between       the      half way          line       and   the     S p i on

  Kop end.        I usually work the               same duty for all S h e f f i e l d                   Wednesday

  home games       and    I have      worked       m any s e mi - f i n a l s       at the g ro un d           d u r i n g my

  11 years       Police     Service.       I usua ll y        take       up the same            position          as

  stated    for all matches.

  I noti c e d    that    a few fans had          entered          the    Spion      Kop       by    ll.Ho      a.m.      and

  there was       a constant       t rickle      of fans        arriving          a ft er      this      time    a ga in     on

  the Spion       Kop    (Notts Forest          fans).

 "eal was taken at a p p r o x i m a t e l y           1.15     p.m.      on   the       direction         of P o l i c e

 S e r g e a n t C ha p m a n and this     was    a hot       meal       e aten     in    the       gymnasium        at     the
 rear of the        North Stand.

  I returned      to my pr ev io us       position        on the          t ra ck    at a p p r o x i m a t e l y

 1 .0O p.m.       I r em em be r that by           this time the           Spion         Kop    had       filled       up

 considerably           and by 2.15 p.m. the           S pion      Kop and S o u t h            Stand          appeared

   to be near i ng         full       capacity,          these     parts       of     the     ground b eing            t aken      up

   by Notts Forest              fans.        At this        same     time      I n o ti ce d        that    the    N or th

   Stand was        perhaps          only    half full         and    this       also being           the      case     wit h       the

   West    Stand      seats.

   The Leppings          Lane        terrace       has     three     pens      for     stand in g       only      and     at

   a pp r o x i m a t e l y 2.15      p.m.    I can recall            the      centre         pen    being      quite        full,

   the pen nearest              the    police       control        was     about       one     third       full    and       the

   pen towards         the North Stand was                    almost       empty.           This    was     certainly

   unusual      for a semi -f in al            match being            only       45 m in ut es        from kick          off

^|^time.      It was       obvious          that    the L i v e r p o o l      fans       had not       arri ve d       at     the

   ground early          as     the    Spion       Kop and S ou th           Stands         c on ta i ni n g    the     Notts

   Forest     fans were          almost       full.

   By a pp r o x i m a t el y    2.45       p.m.    the     North     Stand         a pp ea r ed    to be       quite        full

   but    the Liv er po ol          fans     in the       seats      directly          facing me were              very

  intoxicated.            At normal           S he ffield        Wednesday           matc he s      such y o u t hs          w ou ld

  have     been    arrested           at the       t urnstiles        for      being        drunk     at a

  sportsground.               The     problem was          that     all     the      young white           males        aged

  about     20-30      years        were     all the        same     and     it w ould         have    been       impossible

  to arrest        them       all.        It was     quickly        evident          that     these      Liverpool             fans

  were    very     hostile          and     abusive       towards        myself        as a Police             Officer         and

  Press     p h ot o gr ap he rs      who were           taking up p o s i t i o n s          on the       track       n earby.

  At about        this    time        (2.45 p.m.)           I can     recall         hearing        on my p e r s o n a l

  radio,      S u p e r in t en d en t     Marshall        at the        L e p p in g s    Lane     t ur ns t il e s

  stating         there       was     a serious          p r ob l em with       the       crowd outside           and        that

  he wanted        to have          the main gate            opened.          I re ca ll        Superintendent

  the following           few minutes              and    from his         voice,         he was      obviously          in    some

Le ppings      Lane       terrace.          I s to pp ed       the first         three      y o u t hs    and       asked

them where        they were          going.          They      all     p ro duced     North      S ta nd       seat

tickets       so I d ir ec te d        them       to go       towards         the Spion      Kop     then        turn

left    to get       into     the    seatin g        area.         By now all         I c ould       see       at    the

Le ppings      Lane       end was people             s p i l li n g    out onto       the    track        and Police

Officers       trying        to prevent        them        going       onto    the    pitch.         I then          saw

S u pe r in t en d en t    G re e nw o od run        onto      the pitch         towards       the       referee,

obviously       r eq ue st in g      him     to stop         the      game.     The p la y er s          all    then

went    off    the field         and by       this       time      there were         literally           h un dr ed s

of fans       spilling        out    onto     the     track        through      the    gates       at     the

Le pp in gs    Lane       terrace.         I recall          I n s p e c t o r Sewell       sa yi ng      on Police

radio    he had       five     serials        in     the     gym w hich were           then     sent          out    to

the    track     in front        of the N orth             S ta nd     and L ep pings        Lane        terrace.              I

then saw the          St.     John's A m b u l a n c e        drive        across     the    p it ch      to    the

track     in front         of the L ep pi n gs           Lane      terrace.

I was    at    this time        in the        same       position          on the     track     to p r e v e n t          the

drunken       Liverpool        fans     i nv ading         the     pitch,      but    assisted           by    a n ot he r

Serial     who were         spread     out     in front            of the      North    Stand.

By 3-15       p.m.    a number        of c a su a l t i e s        were     being     c ar ri ed     ac ro ss        the

pitch on stretchers                 and s ho rt ly         a f te r wa r ds    I noti ce d      casualties

being    carried          on ad ve rt is in g       h o a r d i ng s    by other       fans.         It       was    now

apparent       that       a large     number        of     fans      had   been c r us he d        in the

central       pen.        It was     not    until        about        3.15 p.m.       that     the       scale       of

the    disaster       became        apparent.            I was       by now very        frightened              for my

own    safety     as the       crowd       in the N orth              S tand were more          h o st i le         and    I

feared     they would          invade       the     p it ch      en mass       at any mome nt .                I b egan

to feel       very    sick     as there            a p p ea r ed      to be    total m a y h e m        ev er yw he re .

C asualties       were being carr ie d                across         the   pitch      in t he ir        do ze ns      and

many    were    obviously           dead.      By about            3.40 p.m.         the Fire        B r ig ad e      and
                                                                                                         PAGE 5

 medical        services        were    present       and     p eo p le      were    receiving           treatment

 over the        full    length        of the pitch.             I was        a p p ro a ch e d    by a male

 Liverpool        fan aged about             45 years         who was         g as pi ng       for b r ea t h     but

 able    to walk.         I assisted          him     towards          the    track       at    the c o r n e r    of

 the Spion        Kop,    but we were unable                  to get         up    the    track     to   the      rear

 of the North Stand               due    to the       amount          of pe op le        and    casualties         being

 carried on a d v e r ti s in g hoardings.                     The      man       stated       he w ou ld    sit    down

for a while         on the        track      at   the    c or n er      of    the Spion           Kop.      I then

noticed      a number         of Police O f f i ce r s           t ry in g        to place       a male     casualty

onto     an a d ve r ti s in g hoarding             on   the p i t ch         so I went           to assist.            I

then helped         carry       this casualty            up   the       track       to the       gymnasium         at

the rear of the North Stand.                         T here      was      a serial         of Pol ic e      f o rm in g

a cordon        to the entry           at    the rear of          the N o r th           Stand.      There      was

only     just     s ufficient      room to get             the    casualty           into       the gym     where

other oficers            pulled    the man        in on       the      advertising             hoa rd in g.        The

man was      semi - c on sc io us ,         white,     aged      about        25   years.

The    g y m na s i u m was     full of bodies            and     casualties             still     alive      were

being     taken     to    the    far end.         I am u n aw a re           who    the o f f ic e rs       were        who

took over my c as ua l ty or who                     a s s i st e d    me    as    they were         from     o ther

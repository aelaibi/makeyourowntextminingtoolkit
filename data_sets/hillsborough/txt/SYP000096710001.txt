        TO:     The Chief Constable                          DATE:                      16 June 1989

                SUBJECT:   HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


                A review of the transcripts from the Hillsborough Inquiry has identified a
                number of issues, which together with appropriate recommendations as to
                suggested courses of action are appended hereto in the form of a schedule.
                This schedule will be updated as necessary if further issues are raised by
                the Inquiry.

                The schedule in the first instance was intended for use by Counsel in
                addressing his mind to preparing final submission to the Tribunal. For that
                purpose the schedule will be accompanied by separate notes to Counsel, which
                may be of assistance to him in presenting his address.   Some of the
                recommendations are issues which Divisional Commanders can immediately
                address as appropriate to their respective Football Ground. There are,
                however, some issues which require force policy decisions and a few which
                perhaps might be of interest to ACPO.

                Counsel could, I am sure.also use this schedule to make clear to the Inquiry
                that we have taken note of some of the criticisms raised, and whilst we
                await their full findings   have anticipatedareas where improvements can be
                made and are taking steps   to implement thesame.

                I am not convinced that it is necessary toaddress the Inquiry with regard
                to these issues but if wedo then I suggest that the response be in general
                terms rather than addressing specific issues. You may feel it prudent that
                we say nothing at all and await the Inquiry's findings. We have given the
                Inquiry more than sufficient by way of documentary evidence and written
                statements and this without doubt has enabled other interested parties to
                maximise on their attacks on the police in many areas which were not really
                our province. There was no alternative but to co-operate with the Inquiry,
                but in responding now with the recommendations it could be taken as an
                acceptance by us of criticisms raised during the Inquiry, rather than
                stemming from its final deliberations.

PARAGRAPH

1 - 4         Outlines the development of national policy in the
               policing of football and the publication of the
               ACPO Public Order Guide in October 1987(Appendix 'A')

Hooliganism
Problem

5 - 2 2       The development of football hooliganism has prompted
               a police response of a more organised and forceful
               policy aided by legislation and technology. It has
               done much to colour police perception of crowd
               control, strategies being based upon a presumption of
               the probability of violence between rival spectators.

              "Policing by containment" has developed and there are
              three fundemental aspects to this approach

              (a)   development of information re crowds in transit
                    and plans to intervene and escort;

              (b)   a commitment to segregate in transit, at the
                    turn stiles, inside stadia and on departure;

              (c)   construction of containment fencing to control
                    movement of supporters.


              This general strategy is well known to police and
              supporters alike and allows decent spectators to feel
              secure within their own controlled environment.
              However, it tends to encourage antagonistic and
              tribal attitudes between rival groups which requires
              a high police presence.

              Observations and intelligence operations have done
              much to reveal the inner workings of hooligan gangs.
              The Sub-Committee goes on to describe the
              organisation and objectives of the determined
              criminal hooligans and the tacit support received
              from others by acquiesence towards the ill-behaved
              and indifference to police strategies.
PARAGRAPH

               "Policing by containment" is therefore seen as a
               check but not a cure. Concentration in recent times
               has therefore been on the development of
               surveillance, intelligence and evidence gathering
               ("Pre-emptive policing") and these initiatives are
               discussed later in paragraphs 23-40.

               The issues of public safety and hooliganism often
               seem at variance. Containment fencing may prevent
               rapid evacuation but its absence may facilitate wild
               surges, panic and dangerous crowd pressures - public
               disorder being a prime mover. So long as a crowd is
               reasonably orderly then danger is minimal but there
               can be no absolute protection, by engineering or
               policing, if large numbers in the crowd are
               determined to behave irresponsibly (e.g. non ticket
               holders attempting to gain entry in large numbers).

               The characteristics of football hooliganism is ever
               changing and legislation re alcohol and C.C.T.V. have
               made a major impact. This has had a displacement
               effect away from the terraces.

               Additional problems are identified where the
               atmosphere is heightened by the occasion
               (e.g. championships, promotion, relevation). It
               takes little to upset the balance of order
               (e.g. violent incident, late train, inadequate
               turnstiles, non ticket holders) and can reduce
               policing to a desparate effort to maintain order.
               If crowds are disorderly or unreasonable then no
               matter what the policing arrangements and given the
               out dated nature of most major sports stadia, there
               is a potential for danger, if not disaster.


RECENT INITIATIVES

Intelligence

               its development and the creation of "intelligence
               officers" for each club. Also identifies the
               financial constraints inherent in wholesale
               intelligence operations embracing undercover
               operations, the use of "spotters" and the training
               necessary to put the theory into practice.

Intelligence Unit

26   -   28   Its development is seen as of critical importance
               and negotiations with the Home Office are well in
               hand for it to be funded by the Common Police
               Services (Appendix 'B').

C.C.T.V.

29   -   32   Details the progress made in this area but states its
               real potential not entirely fulfilled given the lack
               of wholehearted development on the intelligence
               front and the different specifications required for
               use in terms of crowd control and safety. ACPO Sub­

PROBLEM AREAS

Old Grounds

41   -   42    Identifies piece-meal development of many grounds
               which have outgrown their sites and which still have
               inadequate parking and crowding problems compounded
               by narrow streets. The result is crowd supervision
               both inside and outside consisting of "making the
               best of a bad job". The point is made that home
               supporters are familiar with the problems, that
               semi-finals are made up entirely of away supporters
               and it may be that on these occasions the design
               failing of old football grounds are most likely to
               surface.

Capacities and
safety certificates

43   -   53   Identifies the problem of overcrowding on terraces as
              opposed to seated areas. Gives one solution as
              smaller segregated areas but recognises dangers in
              terms of lack of crowd expansion in the event of an
              emergency.   Conversely wide open terraces allows
              expansion but also enables crowd concentration at
              given points. Stewarded passages/gangways and secure
              corridors give protected access to initial areas but
              the reality is that in practice these are difficult
              to maintain.

              The pros and cons of all seated stadia are discussed
              and a rolling programme to introduce same is
              advocated.

              At paragraph 50 suggests it is timely that safety
              certificates require some system of monitoring crowds
              accessible to the Police Control Box and at
              paragraph 52 questions whether the guidance in the
              "Green Code" is sufficient.

Late arrivals and
banned spectators

54   -   58   Identifies the problems re delayed kick-offs, the
              fact that an absolute ban on alcohol drives
              supporters further afield and encourages late
              arrivals and questions whether the 3 pm kick-off
              time is really appropriate.

              Discussions with the league are proposed with
              reference to turn stile frauds.

              "All ticket" fixtures have in practice presented
              match day commanders with a mob outside and
              insufficient resources to police both inside and
              outside, the result being that non ticket holders
              have been let in.

              Short term exclusion orders are not enforceable and
              are not a deterent.

Touts

59            They disturb segregation arrangements and encourage
              none ticket holders to attend. Legislation is
              advocated.

Stewarding

71   -   81    Whilst recognising the legal argument and the
               responsibilities of the club, the effectiveness of
               the police in the event of an emergency is
               conditioned by what has gone before - "otherwise the
               service is very much a hostage to fortune".

               Police should have control over stewards through
               their supervisory chain, stewards would continue to
               have a vital role but two issues would follow : first
               if "packing" and "gangway" control were on occasion
               a police responsibility, the police might require a
               different standard of performance from stewards;
               secondly co-ordination between the organisers and
               police would have to be clear and formal.

               Should be mandatory inspection of stewards (included
               in safety certificate ) and failings should result in
               sanctions.

              Dual responsibility is a recipe for confusion -
              police must accept a leading role and despite civil
              liabilities of the clubs, take an overall supervision
              wherever crowd safety is an issue. Safety will
              always be in the balance if crowd behaviour is
              unreasonable. Safety Inspectorate to be set up to
              inspect and support the affairs of "certifying
              authorities".
              HILLSBOROUGH F.A. CUP SEMI-FINAL - POLICING COSTS

The Police Act 1964, Section 15, provides for the availability of Special
Police Services to any person within a police force area, subject to payment
to the Police Authority of charges on such scales as may be determined by the
Authority.
Special services are traditionally provided, at the request of football
clubs, for all League football matches and, for Football League matches in
South Yorkshire the policing charges are based on a scale which relates a
given number of police officers to varying levels of crowd attendance.
Copies of the current charges per officer and the scale of officer/crowd
attendance are attached for information and these criteria for determining
special service charges are agreed annually in South Yorkshire in discussion
between the Clubs and the Police Authority and incorporated in a contractual
document.
The agreed   charges for normal Football League matches reflect that element of
the Police   attendance at the ground for deployment wholly within the stadium.
The total     police attendance to all aspects of the football match is
inevitably    much greater than the number of officers whose services are
charged to   the Club.
FA CUP SEMI-FINALS
The policing demands of a FA Cup-Semi-Final are far greater than the normal
League game.    A capacity crowd, with all-ticket attendance by two "away"
clubs and associated problems lead to the deployment of between 800 and 1000
officers and those officers deployed solely to the internal policing of the
stadium far exceed the normal League game. The policy for those matches is
to base special service charges on the actual number of officers deployed
inside the stadium.
With regard to the 1988 Semi-Final the total additional policing costs for
t h e e v e n t w e r e £ 79, 600. Those are the costs of overtime directly
attributable to the game and additional to the Police Authority budget. The
charges met by the F.A. through Sheffield Wednesday F.C. amounted to £39,800
and this represented the cost, at the Special Services rates, of officers
deployed within the stadium.
The policing of the 1989 event and associated costs was so distorted by the
protracted events of the day and the additional police manpower called to
assist at the Stadium that an accurate assessment of the total costs, had the
g a m e p r o g r e s s e d n o r m a l l y , is not at this time possible. However,
acknowledging that the total manpower deployment was similar to 1988, and the
number of officers policing the internals of the Stadium was identical to
1988, it can be estimated with reasonable a c c u r a c y that normal costs and
charges for the 1989 game would be as follows:
Total additional cost to the Police Authority         -        £86,400
Special Services charges to the F.A.                           £46,100

(For information only, the additional overtime costs to date in respect of
all deployment of South Yorkshire officers to the events of the day and
subsequent enquiries is £194,200).

            were    opened.             The   brief     was to observe and                  spot     check    for    containers

            etc    being       taken      into    the    ground,        this was           done    by means      of spot       check

            The    flow of s p e c t a t o r s         into the ground at                  the early       part was         slow,

            but o b v i o u s l y       i n c reased as the kick              off time drew            near,     the main

supporters           was       jovial       -and g o o d         humoured             but     it m u s t       be      said      that      a

lot    had     been       drinking,          som e      I would             say       in e x c e s s .         By      t his     t ime     the

crowd      has    swelled             considerably and                     there       was       pushing          and     shoving          from

the     rear,     the      turnstile             area       was       now    very           congested.              1 had        in fact

moved      from      the       side    of    the       turnstiles                and     go ne      to      the     outer        edge      in

an    effort      to      discourage             the    supporters                from        pushing,,           other        officers

had    j o i n e d me.          Whilst       there          was       an    ongoing           problem with                the       crowds

pushing        and     surging         forward,             another          p r o b l e m arose,              that       was       there

was    some      confusion amongst                     the        fans       as       to w h i c h       part       of    the       ground

their     tickets          were       for.        This       was       due       to    the       poor       indication              given       as

to w h i c h     was      the    correct          entrance             to    the W e s t          and South S t a n d s .                  The

s i t u at ion as         to    the    pushing          and       shoving             became       worse          as     kick       off    t ime

became        nearer,           The    people          at    the       front          were       being       sgnashed            and      ties pit

efforts        by a       number       of    police              officers             asking       the       crowd        to     refrain

from      pushing         forward          there       was       no    response,              things         at     this       point were

dangerous         as      ser i ous        injury was             1 i k e 1y      to    be       caus e d , i t w a s            with      thi s

in m i n d     several          supporters             went       into       the       ground          through           the w r o n g

turnstiles           to        relieve       the       situation.                 By    k ic k     off       time        the re was

s t ill   a    considerable                number       outside,             the       pushing           and      shoving         was      still

apparent         but      not    as    severe.              By    around          3.30pm          (1530)          the     crowd        had     all

been a c c o m m o d a t e d         in the       ground.              At    this       p o in t       I along           with     other

colleagues           were       directed          to    take          our    meal       in the          gymnasium,              this we

did.      After        about         half    an    hour          we    were       called          on     to a t t e n d        the

Nottingham         Forest            end    of    the       ground          as    there was             a    report        of     crowd

problems,         by      the    t ime      we    attended             the       problem          had       been       sorted        out     by

other     officers.              We    took       up    standby             duties          in    the       gymnasium,           and       then

resumed       duties           round       the    ground          to    the       Leppings             Lane       end,     where

after     the    match          we    escorted          the       f ans      to       the    coach and             r ai l w a y .

In    general      discussion               after       the       match          it    was       thought       that        for       future

               I am a       police        co nstable            in the     above       force       stationed        at   Hain        Street?

               R ot h e r h a m .

               In a d d i t i o n    to m y         previous        statement           regarding          the    1988 s e m i - f i n a l

               match     with       Liverpool             and    Nottingham           Fo r e s t at H i l l s b o r o u g h .        There

               are    a f e w mi nor           points        which     I wish         to    clarify,        firstly       the Moun t e d

               Section       did m o v e        into the           crowd    to e a s e       the    surge        towards       the

               turnstiles           at    around          2 p m <1400), they made               some       headway       and     it    e a s e d th

               situation        but       it        d i d n ’t s o l v e it as       there     were     still       a    large       number

               of    spectators           to        get     into   the g r o u n d     at   kick     off    time.         T he    problem

               eased     after       kick           off.        I h ave not    seen any            video    or m u c h m e d i a                g.t%

               coverage        as    to    try and           compare       the    situation           in    1989.        I can       say   t hat

               the    late     coming          of     the    spectators          in     1938 a l o n g      with the        confusion         of

               the    entrances           to S o u t h a n d West S t a n d                caused     confusion and              problems.

      Dear Sir

      Hillsborough Disaster

      Mr Gareth Williams QC and Mr Peter Birts QC are retained to
      advise the Crown Prosecution Service in this matter.

      I met with Mr Birts in conference on Friday, 20 April 1990.
      Mr Birts asked if it was possible to obtain copies of the
      opinion given by leading Counsel for the prosecution in the
      Zeebrugge Ferry Disaster case.  Leading Counsel in that case
      is Mr David Jeffreys QC whose chambers are at Queen Elizabeth
      Building, Temple.

      I have spoken with the Lawyers in this office dealing with
      that matter and it is felt that it might be better if a
      request for copies of Counsel's opinion was dealt with on a
      Counsel to Counsel basis.  Accordingly we have no objection to
      Mr Birts approaching Mr Jeffreys to discuss the matter.

      Secondly Mr Birts asked if we were aware of the dates of the
      Zeebrugge trial at the Old Bailey.   The full trial is due to
      take place later this year.   However preliminary argument has
      been fixed to be heard by the Trial Judge initially on 22 May
      1990 for four days and then subsequently for a further four
      days from 5 June 1990.   Interestingly this argument is to be
      on the corporate manslaughter point.

I should be grateful if you would place this letter before
Mr Birts for his attention.  Should any matters require
clarification or should Mr Birts wish to discuss any matters
with me I should be only too pleased to speak with him.

Yours faithfully

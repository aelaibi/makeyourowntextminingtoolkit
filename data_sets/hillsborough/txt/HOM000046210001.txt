    Dear Madam,
    Dear Sir,

              I acknowledge receipt                      of your   letter of 30 March             1995.

          The Commission can only deal with allegations which involve
    state responsibility.  It is not clear how the state could be said
    to be directly responsible for the events at Hillsborough in 1989.
    If there were, however, to be liability, and if there was nothing
    you could effectively do about it, than the six months' rule would
    probably prevent you from complaining about what happened then.

          The other complaint you make relates to Article 6 of the
    Convention.   It is not clear whether proceedings before a Coroner
    determine the "civil rights and obligations" of the families of a
    decease,   but if you have specific procedural complaints about the
    proceedings before the Coroner, you should let me know,        also
    showing that you have put those complaints to a Superior Tribunal
    (probably by way of judicial review).     Again, the final decision
    would have to be within six months of when you first brought the
    substance of your application to the Commission (on 11 March 1995).

          Under Article 8, it is difficult to see how reporting of a
    matter of public interest could, in /4fe, normal course of events,
    raise issues under these provisions.

                                                   Yours    faithfully.

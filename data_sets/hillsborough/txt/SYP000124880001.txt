 THE POLICE THAT I SAW THERE AT THE FENCE WERE DOING WHAT THEY COULD, BUT THERE

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE, MAYBE THE ONES THAT WERE ON THE HALF-WAY LINE.

 OBVIOUSLY NOBODY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THERE WAS     TOTAL CONFUSION.

 T £    POLICE WHO HELPED ME WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR MY BROTHER,   BENT THE RULES FOR

 ME SO I COULD FIND HIM. THEY WERE GREAT AND I WANT TO PUT FORWARD MY POINT.

 <254

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PENS IS WRONG. THE FENCES SHOULDN'T BE THERE TO ALLOW

 THE SUPPORTERS TO SPREAD OUT. THE GATES SHOULD HAVE STAYED SHUT. THE AREA

 OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES IS A NATURAL ’BOTTLE-NECK' AND ASKS FOR TROUBLE.

 HAPPENED?

 NO.

 045

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,    IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT?   (BRIEFLY)

 YES.     SAW CLEARLY FROM OUR VIEW THAT THERE WAS SWAYING IN THE MIDDLE SECTIONS

 Q^p E N S 3 AND 4, BECAUSE OF THE DENSITY OF THE PENS.   THERE WERE TOO MANY

 PEOPLE IN A SPACE NOT DESIGNED TO CARRY THEM.     PEOPLE COULD NOT FAN OUT TO THE

 SIDES.     ONCE IN THERE, YOU WERE TRAPPED, CAPTIVE.

 NO.


G17

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

YES.      THE LACK OF DIRECTION EVIDENT IN THE GROUND, DUE TO THE HIGH DENSITY OF

FANS IN 3 AND 4 AND THE LOW DENSITY IN THE SIDE PENS.      I COULD SEE THE
                                                                              PAGE    8

 LATERAL BARRIERS, THAT IS WITNESS TO ITSELF THAT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE

 DEATHS & INJURIES BECAUSE THIS PREVENTED PEOPLE ESCAPING FROM THE CENTRE

 SECTIONS OF 3 AND 4.

3.40 (1540) - 3.45 PM (1545).

 OWN DECISION.


G #

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

FROM WHAT I WITNESSED, CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN.

A /■* THE WHOLE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED IN A VERY AMATEURISH MANNER.       IT SEEMED TO

M^|jp~IE POLICE WERE INTENT ON ONE THING ONLY AND THAT WAS TO PREVENT PEOPLE

GETTING ONTO THE PITCH.      THEY WERE NOT TRAINED TO ACT UPON THIS TYPE OF

TRAGEDY, CRITICAL OF POLICE DEPLOYMENT WITHIN THE GROUND.      EVIDENT TO ME NO

OVERALL CONTROL OR COMMAND, POLICE SEEM TO RESPOND ON THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL

 INITIATIVE.     NOT AWARE OF ANY LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENTS MADE.     EVENTUALLY,

AFTER 10 MINUTES OR SO, THE SCALE OF THE TRAGEDY DAWNED ON THE POLICE AND THEY

BEGAN TO TEAR AT THE FENCING IN PENS 3 AND 4.      FANS RESPONDED SUPERBLY, USING

THE HOARDINGS TO CARRY INJURED AND DEAD.      THEY DID EVERYTHING AT THE DOUBLE.

AMBULANCES DID ARRIVE EVENTUALLY AND COME ACROSS THE PITCH.         FIREMEN ATTENDED

APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES,THE GEAR THEY WORE WAS A HINDERANCE TO THEIR RESCUING

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 •1.   HAVING DECIDED TO HOLD THE GAME AT HILLSBOROUGH,     IT WAS LUDICROUS TO HAVE

 OVER 24,000 FANS GAIN ACCESS FROM THE SAME SPOT.

 2.    WHY WAS THE ROAD STILL IN USE TO TRAFFIC?    SIMPLE TO PUT BARRIERS ACROSS.

 3.    POLICE NOT SELECTING AND FILTERING PEOPLE INTO THE GROUND.

 4.    THE FA SELECTING THE GROUND TO BEGIN WITH AND THE ALLOCATION OF THE

 TICKETS.    THE POLICE WERE LEFT TO DEAL WITH THAT DECISION BUT FAILED IN

 OVERALL ORGANISATION.     SHORTAGE OF POLICE IN THE LEPPINGS LANE AREA BUT NOT
                           r

 OUTSIDE THE GROUND, BUT AN ABUNDANCE OF POLICEMEN INSIDE THE GROUND.       ALONG

 T ^ ROUTE THERE WERE A LOT OF POLICEMEN.      SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF

 CONGESTION BEFOREHAND AND ACTED UPON IT.


Q 19

 FROM AT LEAST 2.30 PM (1430) WITNESS OBSERVED ON DENSITY OF FANS IN 3 AND 4

 AND COMMENTED TO COMPANION ON FACT, SIDE PEN NEAREST TO NORTH STAND WAS

 VIRTUALLY EMPTY, BUT THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ANY ACCESS FOR THE FANS IN

 3 AND 4 TO GET INTO IT.

 HAVE SUPPORTED LIVERPOOL OVER 40 YEARS; LIVERPOOL FC HAVE CROWD CONTROL SECOND

 TO NONE, AND THE FA     TAKE NO NOTICE OF THEM.   NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY TROUBLE

 A^tNFIELD    IN TERMS   OF CROWD TROUBLE OR CROWD CRUSH.    ABOUT TIME THE VOICE OF

 THE REGULAR RESPONSIBLE FAN WAS LISTENED TO.

 WITNESSED AFTER KICK-OFF PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT PERIMETER FENCING,

 PEOPLE IN 3 AND 4 WERE MOST CERTAINLY IN A DISTRESSED STATE.       A FRIEND THAT

 WAS IN THOSE PENS AT 2.30 <1430) STATED THAT HE COULD NOT GET OUT DURING THE

 TRAGEDY.    FOLLOWING PEOPLE GETTING ONTO THE PITCH WITNESSED PEOPLE BEING

 GIVEN CHEST MASSAGE     AND MOUTH TO MOUTH.

DID NOT ATTEND LAST      YEARS SEMI-FINAL AT HILLSBOROUGH. HAS RETURNED TO ANFIELD

SINCE TRAGEDY TO PAY RESPECTS.

WITNESS IS EMPHATIC IN STATING HE SAW NO DRINKING NO AGGRESSION AMONGST THE

CROWD.

 I ^ T H E R E ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IN RELATION TO QUESTION 53 I FEEL THAT ALL THE OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS

 LANE ENTRANCE SHOULD HAVE ENTERED THE GROUND AND AT LEAST ASSISTED THE

 INJURED PEOPLE.       THEY WERE ALL STANDING IN A DOUBLE LINE OUTSIDE THE ROAD.

 THEY WERE THERE BETWEEN 3.10 (1510) AND 3.20 (1520) AND DID NOT ENTER UNTIL

 ABOUT 3.20 (1520).

 FANS BACK INTO THE PENS, THEY WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OUT O F . A LOAD OF US LINED

 UP AGAINST THE   FENCE TO TRY AND PULL IT DOWN , BUT THE POLICE TOLD US TO GO

 AWAY OR THEY WOULD NICK   US. I GRABBED HOLD OF A STRETCHER AND TOOK A   LAD DOWN

 THE FOREST END ON IT. HE WAS ALREADY DEAD. WE PUT THE STRETCHER DOWN THEN WENT

 BEHIND THE FOREST GOAL TO PULL DOWN THE HOARDINGS. EVEN THEN I WAS TOLD TO

 LEAVE OR I WOULD BE ARRESTED. EVENTUALLY WE GOT SOME HOARDINGS AND CARRIED

 ANOTHER SEVEN PEOPLE FROM BEHIND THE GOAL.


G19



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IT TOOK A LONG   TIME FOR THE POLICE TO REACT TO THE EMERGENCY. WHEN THEY DID,

 IT SEEMED ONLY   TEN PER CENT OF THE POLICE SEEMED TO GET STUCK IN AND   HELP.

THE OTHERS WERE OBVIOUSLY UNDER ORDERS TO STAY WHERE THEY WERE POSTED AND DID.

 I ’M SURE THAT I WOULD HAVE BROKEN RANKS TO GO AND HELP THE INJURED. NO SENIOR

OFFICER TOOK CHARGE AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS,    f®*

REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE




FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS FACING A DISCIPLINARY HEARING
ARISING FROM THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


1     Matter for Consideration

1.1    To consider an ex gratia payment of £5,000 from the Municipal Mutual
       Insurance Company Limited to an officer facing a disciplinary hearing
       as a result of the Hillsborough Disaster.

2     Background Information

2.1   In December 1990, the Authority granted      financial support to six
       officers, including Superintendent Murray in connection with their
       legal representation at the Hillsborough Inquest.

2.2   The terms of the agreement were such that any of the Superintendents
       subject of disciplinary proceedings would be allowed to retain
      £10,000 exclusive of VAT from the insurance cover which they had
       taken out via the Superintendents' Association.

2.3   Superintendent Murray is now subject to disciplinary proceedings
      which will take the form of a Tribunal chaired by Mr John Newing,
       Chief Constable of the Derbyshire Constabulary sitting with two
      members of the Police Complaints Authority. The officer is entitled
       to legal representation and he has intimated that he would wish to be
       so r e p r e s e n t e d . It is anticipated that the cost of legal
      representation may well exceed the £10,000 available to the officer.

2.4   At the meeting of the Authority held on 30 August 1991, a request for
      additional financial assistance to the officer was rejected.

2.5   On 2 November 1990, the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company intimated
       that it would be prepared to make an ex gratia payment to any of the
       Superintendents who face disciplinary proceedings following the
      Hillsborough Disaster.   The provision of the funding was conditional
      upon:-

       (a)   the officers having spent all the £50,000 insurance cover;

       (b)   the Authority agreeing to the officer receiving the payment.

2.6   The above offer was made orally on 2 November and in order to confirm
       the agreement,     on 18 July 1991, the Chief      Constable wrote to
      Municipal Mutual Insurance Company to ascertain that thisoffer was
       still available  (see letter  at    Appendix 'A'). The Companyrepliedin
       the affirmative  (see letter  at    Appendix 'B').
                                  -   2   -




3     Financial Implications

3.1   There are no financialimplications forthe Authority.

4     Recommendation

4.1   The Authority is recommendedto approve      the ex gratia payment   in
      respect of Superintendent Murray.

HILLSBOROUGH - DISCIPLINE PROCEEDINGS

I write regarding our recent telephone conversation on the subject above.

The   officers  to   be   proceeded  against   for  discipline   are    Chief
Superintendent David Duckenfield and Superintendent Bernard Murray.

You will recall attending a Police Authority meeting at South Yorkshire
Police Beadquarters on 2 November 1990, when these two officer* and others
made application to the Police Authority for financial support in relation
to the then following Inquest hearing which at that point in time the
Authority refused.

My recollection is that as part of those proceedings you offered an
ex-gratia payment of £5,000 to each superintendent to be used to fund
defence costs in relation to discipline proceedings if (a) they had by
then spent all of their £50,000 insurance cover, and (b) subject to the
Police Authority's agreement.

The two officers in question each have at least £10,000 (it may be that
Superintendent Murray has significantly more than this) remaining of their
£50,000 insurance cover available for use at the discipline hearings.

My understanding now is that you, on behalf of MMI, are prepared to make
available to each of these officers a £5,000 ex-gratia payment for use
towards their defence in relation to the discipline tribunal subject t©:-

a. their having spent all of their personal insurance provision; and,
b. Police Authority agreement to this payment.

If you can confirm my understanding of your offer, I will then make the
details known to the officers concerned, take the necessary action to
obtain Police Authority approval and contact you again.

Many thanks.

Yours sincerely
                                                                                                            APPENDIX “B”

                                                                                                                  /Ax,

Dear

wfflnborough - Discipline ProceedingB
Thank you for your letter of 18 July 1991.
I confirm that the offer is in the terms you have outlined in your letter
and have no objections to your communicating it to the two officers
concerned.
No doubt you will have to remind the Police Authority of my offer but I
would not anticipate that they would withhold their authority for these
payments.

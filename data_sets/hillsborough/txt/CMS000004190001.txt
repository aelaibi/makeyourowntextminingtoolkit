Thank you for your letter of 17 April to the Prime Minister which has been
passed to this Department in view of our responsibilities for sports ground
safety legislation.


We are very grateful to you for your offer of assistance and for your
condolences to the families of those who died at Hillsborough.   I have
arranged for copies of your correspondence to be passed both to the Sport and
Recreation Division of the Department of the Environment and to the Sports
Council for information.


I have also copied your letter and enclosures to the Inquiry under
Lord Justice Taylor, which was set up by the Home Secretary to look into the
Hillsborough tragedy in case there are any points which it might wish to
pursue with you.

     Dear Madam Prime Minister:

     Re; StafliraL B sto
     As a British Citizen living in Canada may I offer my condolences to the families of those
     who died in the Sheffield Stadium tragedy.

     I am the architect for the Toronto SkyDome, the world’s first retractable roofed football,
     soccer and baseball stadium, which wdll be officially opened by the Premier of Ontario on
     June 3, 1989.

     In designing the Toronto SkyDome my partner Michael Allen (structural engineer) and I
     have sought to mate SkyDome the best and safest stadium in the world, as well as the
     most innovative.

     In June 1988 I made a presentation of the Toronto SkyDome at Ontario House, London to
     UK sports officials and the London press. Mr. George Hutchinson or Mr. Ray Vaudry of
     Ontario House can furnish your representatives with information on the Toronto SkyDome.

    SkyDome is the result of a unique partnership between government and the private sector.
    Government has guaranteed the project, and especially the cost of the retractable roof,
    while the private sector are providing most of the financing. The retractable roof has
    made SkyDome the first stadium in history which is logically responsive to the weather. It
    will open or close in 20 minutes, so games need never be rained out again, or seen indoors
    on a beautiful sunny summer (or winter) day.

    SkyDome is a multi-purpose facility usable for soccer, football, baseball, concerts, track
    and field, exhibitions, trade shows and conventions, as well as a large number of smaller
    events. It is a place for the whole family, and women as well as men. The stadium has a
    350 room hotel with 70 rooms overlooking the field, together with 161 private boxes, a
    club, restaurants, bars, health club, retail space, and a full TV production centre, and the
    largest coloured video board anywhere                                              40 University Avenue

   A Partnership of Corporations




    The Right Honourable Margaret Thatcher
    April 17, 1989
    Page 2



    As part of our work in designing and reviewing the construction of SkyDome I, my
    partners and staff have solved numerous other long standing problems in stadium design
    aside from that of basic safety.

    May I offer mine and my partners services to you as architects and engineers for a new
    generation of retractable roof stadia and family sports and entertainment centres for the
    principal UK population centres, which your government might wish to sponsor, and which
    both national and international corporations (as in die case of Toronto) might help to co-
    fund

    I would be honoured to review my proposals with you in person.

    Yours very truly,

Architectural and Structural Engineering Design: Rod Robbie & Mike Allen
Architects and Engineers: The Ran Consortium. 40 University Ave., Toronto, Canada
Design/Build Contractor: Ellis Don Ltd.

The RAN CONSORTIUM: is a joint venture made up of:
F ''bie/Sane Architects Inc.*
/■.-.jdeian Allen Rubeli Limited Consulting Engineers
NORR Partnership Limited Architects Engineers
(♦Robbie/Young + Wright Architects for future stadium projects.)
The consortium was formed to design and build the Robbie/Allen**award
winning design for the retractable roofed Toronto SkyDome stadium.
For work outside Canada - RAN International has been established.

DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION:
Innovation: The extensive use of computer generated and solid geometric analytical modelling
has allowed the design professionals to systematically assess and confirm accurate sightlines for all
seating in the stadium. The marriage of architecture and engineering in this project has been
complete and highly successful. The strict requirements of the complex structural design of the
roof and its supporting structure have teen integrated with the equally important functional and
aesthetic demands of such an enormous structure. The new standards of stadium and retractable
roof design established with this facility will revolutionize future development of stadia throughout
the world.
Versatility:   This is a multi-use facility providing the following:

        a venue for major league baseball, 53,400 seats, 42,000 between foul poles
        a 55,500 seat venue for Canadian Football (the field for CFL football is slightly larger than
        soccer, and 62% larger than (US) National Football)
        Club with 5,800 fully upholstered seats. 161 private boxes each with its own seating
        balcony
        a venue for concerts for 10,000 to 67,500 spectators
        150,000 square feet of exhibition space with connection to the Toronto Convention Centre,
        using the stadium field
        Skyvision, the largest scoreboard/replay screen in the world 10.6 x 34.8 metres (35* x
        115*). Over three times the size of any other existing stadium video scoreboard,
        the first 350 suite luxury hotel to be fully integrated into a stadium, including 70 suites
        directly overlooking the field,
        a 600 seat tiered restaurant with all seats looking directly over the field,
        a 350 foot long bar overlooking the field, a Subway Bar, Homeplate Bar and a Hard Rock
        Cafe,
        a health club with squash and racquetball courts, a gymnasium, swimming pool, and a 680
        metre running track,
        offices for the Toronto Blue Jays Baseball Club and the Ontario Stadium Corporation, as
        well as other companies associated with the stadium

        a full TV station for Dome Productions and two large press suites, each with
        accommodation for 106 media representatives
        A Family Sports and Entertainment area surrounding the north east comer, SkyPlace.
FACTSHEET:

The SkyDome is the key project for the human and urban renewal of the Toronto waterfront and
railway lands.

Financial Statistics: The SkyDome is owned by a unique Consortium of public and private sector
partners. Funds have been provided by the Government of Ontario, the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto and 28 private corporations. It is operated by the Ontario Stadium
Corporation, a crown corporation. The SkyDome will have 200+ days of full operation per year.
The project will have created an estimated 12,000 parson years of employment for the Province of
Ontario upon die completion of the project.

Roof: The revolutionary rigid retractable roof is constructed of tubular steel parabolic framed
arches with a skin of single PVC membrane on thermal insulation and precoated insulated acoustic
steel deck. The roof will span 205 metres (674 ft.) at the widest point and will be 87 metres (285
ft) above the ground at centre field. The roof can be opened or closed in 20 minutes with 100%
of the field and 91% of the seats exposed to the open sky. The retraction of the roof involves
both linear telescoping and rotational nesting movements.

Hie roof panels which are 4.2 metres thick contain 6348 metric tonnes of structural steel and
covers an area of 3.24 hectares (8 acres). Movement of the roof panels is carried out by 54, 14
ton to 40 ton bogies, electrically powered along rails. Very close construction tolerances had to be
achieved in order to ensure the success of the movement system.

Strict safeguards against roof truss failure have resulted in design requirements that prevent
progressive failure in the roof structure, as has been seen in other types of roof systems. A thirty
(30-) foot hole may occur in the roof structure, without progressive failure. The loads blocked by
die hole would be transferred down alternate pathways into die structure then into die ground.

Construction: The Design/Build Contractor Ellis Don Ltd. under the leadership of Don Smith,
George Davis and Walter Woloshyn have undertaken to build the SkyDome in 30 months. Co­
ordination of a crew 1000 workers comprising approximately 15 subtrades, 16 cranes, both
stationary and mobile, ranging from 15,000 to 400,000 tons, as well as the constant flor of
enormous amounts of construction material has been a constant challenge.

The opening of the SkyDome in Spring 1989 will coincide with the 100th anniversary of the
opening of the Eiffel Tower. Excellence in design was heralded in the 19th Century, in the 20th
Gsntury, excellence in design must also satisfy rigorous standards of applied function as well. The
Toronto SkyDome is a shining example of both excellence in design and innovation and function
grounded in sound economic viability.

         SkyDome is the world's first major stadium with a fully
liS ii   retractable roof. The roof, which can open or close in twenty
         minutes, provides protection against the weather all year
         round. The architectural and engineering technology
         developed to operate the roof has made a significant
         contribution to stadium design. Although used here on a very
         large building, the technology is applicable to any scale. The
         engineering, pioneered in the building of SkyDome, will be
         pivotal to the design and construction of all future facilities of
         this type

         Rome's Colosseum would fit comfortably under the Dome.

         concerts or exhibitions 17.000 field seats in rotating sections
         can be positioned to provide optimum viewing of each event.
         The 52,000 baseball seats are arranged in a "V” pattern, while
         the 54.000 seats for football are placed parallel to the field. As
         many as 70,000 people can be accommodated for concerts or
         special programmes and as few as 10,(»0 tor smalt scale
         productions.

         The versatility of the structure is entranced by SkyTent, a
         concept that uses acoustical banners to form walls and a
         ceiling within the Dome. This gives the feeling of intimacy vital
         to certain types of theatrical and concert productions. The
         material is translucent and very sympathetic to film projection.
         Therefore it can be used to create a wide variety of multi-
         media. graphic and lighting effects for advertising, sports,
         concerts, theatre, pre-event displays and performances of all
         kinds. SkyTent can be set up quickly permitting small events
         to be scheduled back to back with large ones.

         SkyOome is not just a stadium, but an entertainment complex
         of great diversity. The building includes a 350 room hotel, with

 It is proposed that the 10 stadia/forums have the same retractable roof systems to achieve
 maximum building and operating efficiencies at minimum cost However that each stadium
 differ from the rest in Architectural treatment and Decor to give each a unique "Sense of
 Place", and make each a unique destination on the 10 stadium tour network.

                       I am here today to suggest the Lime has arrived

            for construction of a major domed stadium in the United

           Kingdom.

                       And, I would argue, the best model available —

            the only major stadium with a fully retractable roof —                    is

           the Skyuome, uow under construction on the             |rv>T*nni-o

           waterfront.

                       Certainly the nee-?                 While we in Toronto

            are subjected to uncertain weather conditions, including

            winter snow, no weather in the world is more unpredictable

            than Britain's

                       The recent rain-out of the men's tennis final at

            Wimbledon demonstrated m u s t dramatically hew disruptive the

            elements can be to international sporting events staged in

            Britain.

                       The demand that the games must go on has seldom

            been greater.     Millions of viewers around the wuxld -- and,

            not insignificantly, hundreds of corporate sponsors -- are

            often deprived of television signals because weather

            intervenes.     That is no longer necessary in the case of

            Buvjiea of field sports                 fiivfcertainment

            undertakings.

                 The answer is a stadium along tbe lines of the SkyOome,

            which next spring will begin offering a venue of

            spectacular appeal, where athletic events and shows will be

            staged - - o n schedule —    regardless or tne~weather.

         1.    Whv Build A Retractable Roofed Stadium.

               With very few exceptions major sports should be played
               out of doors before a live audience.

               The advent of sports television, both nationally and
               internationally has created the sports star and super
               star — and consequently made professional sports very
               costly to run.

               To pay, TV must operate to strict schedules, and meet
               its audience obligations to advertisers.

               To succeed professional sports clubs must
                    a)   Win — hence, expensive players
                    b)   Maintain large live audiences — to make
                         money and improve the TV spectacle.

               Open-air stadiums are weather dependent.

               Stadiums with fixed roofs eventually lose “gate"
               income.

               The solution to the dilemma of watching sports out of
               doors, maintaining game and television schedules, and
               hence, income is the retractable roofed stadium.


          2)   What will It Cost.

               The cost is greater than a fixed roof and is extremely
               design dependent.

               SkyDome is costing about £20 million more than a fixed
               root ot comparable size {wvejL 3 auies t   of it wu the
                                                             *


               project could pay for it in two years (i.e. the extra
               cost).


          3)   Roof Structure.

               Mike Allen, my structural engineering partner and
               designer of the SkyOome roof and building structure,
               and I believe that the only fully retractable roofs
               (that leave na structure over the stadium when open)
               which are structurally and economically practical are
               of rigid steel construction.

               Hence, the SkyOome design.

               Because of wind, snow, ice, rain and earthquake forces,
               retractable roofs should be of conservative design.
               The forces to be handled especially in high winds are
               very rare

               Roofs should be fail-safe,

               SkyDome can open and close in sustained winds up to 40
               mph in 20 minutes, and can be closed in sustained winds
               up to 60 mph.

         4) JLaULt-Sa£s.
               The SkyDome is extremely safe.

               It is designed for a life of 100 years-plus.

               It is designed for one in 100 year return wind periods
               — three times as long as the Ontario Building Code.

               Fail-safe design has been used. That is, the roof has
               been designed to handle severe localized damage without
               progressive collapse.

               None of the roof elements have to move on inclines when
               operating — removing the risk of spontaneous
               run-aways.


         5)    Copyrights and Patents.

               SkyDome and its stadium design is protected by world
               copyrights held by the RAN Consortium Architects and
               Engineers, Toronto, Rod Robbie and Mike Allen and by,
               U.S., EEC and Canadian patents held by Rod Robbie and
               Mike Allen.


          6)   Brief Outline of Skvdome Financing andOutline Coata.

               The Toronto SkyDome is owned by The Stadium Corporation
               of Ontario — (STAQCQ).

               President and Chief Executive Officer —             Charles
               (Chuck) Magwood.

               The corporation (STADCO) is owned 56% by the Province
               of Ontario who have underwritten the financial risk of
               building the retractable roof — and — 44% by 28
               corporate partners (private) sector.

               This is a unique business arrangement for building a
               major public facility in North America.

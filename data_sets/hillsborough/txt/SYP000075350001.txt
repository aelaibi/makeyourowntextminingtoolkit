The    car was       parked        in a residential                  side street             near   to the L e p p i n g s

Lane.                 !j

We had a clear drive                    into Sheffield,                  the    police       sectioned all       the

football          traffice and they stopped the                            coaches          to check    them over,

I saw some fans              drinking            outside          pubs    in the area,          in the main the

fans were          good natured,             we wal k e d together                to the ground and

split       up.                   and his            dad had tickets             for    the North Stand,           they

                   a £6 ticket              for       the Leppings             Lane    standing are

■a 1 tH''‘oT^Tans          hanging about               outside       the area                       urnstiles      some

were    drinking           from    cans      of beer and             lager

T here were         very few people at                    the t u r n l ^ T, Jjp^'fact there was                     only

one    or two queueing                 at each.           I p r e s ^ n S/w t i c k e t and went                into    the

ground.

 I had seen a policeman at                           the turnstile and two stewards                       inside

selling       programme.

 I found my turnstile                   very easily,               it was       clearly marked,           I didn't      see

any    police or stewards who                         d i r ected me        to the terracing at all and                     I

didn't / e e        anyone at           the m ou t h of the tunnel                     a head of me.

I loo/ed about              for    the way,7to tM h                terracing          but    I couldn't      see any

went    down       into the        tunn                                  quite    clear with only a few

people       walking        through         r*

At    the end of the tunnel                      there was a dividing                   fence,      I went    tothe

to    the    right.         I made my way t ^ u g h                      an a l r e a d y full      terrace     to the

the    crash barriers,                this       is normal        at football         matches,        over      the       next

ten to fifteen minutes                         from being      r e asonably         comfortable        on the

t e rracing         the   crowd became                very tigh t l y       packed    in,    this was        to such an

extent         that    I could no              longer move my arms and                I had to move wit h the

sway of the            crowd,        o cc as i o na ll y my feet            came    from the floor,             at    no

time whilst            inside        the ground did            I witness any drinking                  of alcohol              or

any disorder at all.                       I    did     not e xperience any            crowd surge at all, the

pressure         inside        the    pen       increased g raduaj^Ay.

my hands         to my waist,              I    tried to      raise my hands            up my chest          in      an

a tt e m p t    to push the           person          in front     of me to give me some                 breathing

room,     e ve n t u a l l y    I mana g e d          to do this,          and    I can recall        thinking            to

myself         that    I couldn't              cope wit h such         pressure       for    the whole          of the

game .

The    players         came onto           t he 'p i t c h and     people         in the    crowd were moaning

about     the u nc om fo r t a b l e            conditions,        I   to,       was still    very hot and                I

still      had no control              over my movements,                   by the time kick off occured

the    crowd was          screaming             out    in agony,       I was       starting       to panic s l i g h t l y

because         I knew     I couldn't             last     till    half      or full       time    in the       crowd.

I could still             feel       the       pressure     increasing all            the time and           I was

startin g        to feel        pain from the              crush of other            fans about me,             my back-

had    initially been against                         a barier     but      now    I was about        six feet            in

front      of    it.

At this         stage     the game             kicked off,        Liverpool         were a t t acking        the goal

at    the opposite             end of the ground,                 I cannot         give any specific details

of    the match.           I think             both teams      had a corner           but    I couldn't

co n c e ntrate        on the game.

                 As this was            happening       I saw a suddgr^ ytyrqe of               people      in front     of me

                 and to my            right,    I would       say   it o e c (i/e <±"3 - to - 4 metres           in front        of

                 me and 5 - to 6 metres                  to my      right.          I saw the hole appear as             if

                     people    had suddenly fell and the                  people          behind stumbled forwards

                     into    the     gap.

                     As this       happened     I c o u l d n ’t control       my mov e m e n t s and I went          forward

                     wit h the       crowd,    I was    by now only 4 metres                 from the front      fence and

                     the    pressure was        still    intense.

                 Fans were            by this    stage    pouring       over        the fence and onto         the    pitch,        I

                     saw a    policeman        run onto       the   pitch,     Liverpool        fans also      ran onto        the

                     pitch,    I saw the Liverpoo l             goalkeeper           looking    round at the         crowd,     I

                     saw a N o t ti ng ha m     player,       Nigel    Cl o u g h    push one of the fans            off the

                     pitch,    they must have           thought       it was a pitch           invasion,      the game was

                     then stopped.

          FOREWORD BY THE CHAIRM AN


The Football Trust 1990 has been chosen by the Government and the football
authorities as the principal means through which grant aid will be channelled to
help the game. It brings together the work of the former Football Trust (founded
in 1979) and the Football Grounds Improvement Trust, which came into being in
197 5, following the introduction of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act. Both trusts
were established by the pools companies, Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters, and
funded entirely by donations from their Spotting-the-Ball competition. Over the
15 years these Trust arrangements operated over £81 million was made available
for the game.

Spotting-the-Ball continues to contribute around £10 million per annum; in ad­
dition the Trust receives the proceeds arising from the decision by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer to reduce pool betting duty in the 1990 Budget. Over the next
five years, the amount from this source is expected to total £100 million, or £20
million per year. The Trust hopes therefore to have an annual income of around
£30 million from 1990 until 1995.

This booklet is a guide for clubs in the Football League and the Scottish Football
League to the Trust's grant aid policies. Our aim is to be helpful and as generous to
you as we can, but you will appreciate that our funds are limited and we must
insist that the procedures we lay down are strictly complied with.

I hope you will find the description of the ways in which we are prepared to
consider offering assistance clear and straightforward. If you would like further
information and advice, please contact the Trust's Secretary, Peter Lee, at
our London office (telephone 071-388 4504), or the secretary to our Licensing
Authority Liaison Committee, Glynis Firth, on 0253 729421.
                         ORGANISATION


The Football Trust 1990 operates through two principal committees: the Licens­
ing Authority Liaison Committee (LALC) and the Chairman's Committee.

The LALC is chaired by the Trust's Second Deputy Chairman, Tom Wharton. The
committee's work covers all aspects of grant aid affecting clubs in the Football
League, the Scottish Football League and the Irish Football League, and the
national stadia of the four home countries. It is administered by Glynis Firth and
her colleagues at Lytham St Annes.

The Committee chaired by Lord Aberdare deals with every other level of football
in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the provision of financial assistance for the
game's grassroots being its most important responsibility. The secretary of the
Chairman's Committee is Pat Finney, and it is run from the Trust's London office
at Walkden House.

An important ingredient in the operation of the LALC is the role played by re­
gional representatives of the Trust (some of whom are co-opted for this purpose).
They are:

   Groups One & Two (North of England):            David Dent
                                                   and
                                                   Tom Finney
   Groups Three & Four (Midlands):                  Colin Thwaite
                                                    and
                                                    Arthur Sandford
   Groups Five & Six (South of England):            Richard Faulkner
                                                    and
                                                    Stanley Taylor
    Scotland:                                       Tom Wharton
                                                    and
                                                    Bert Sturgeon

Arrangements for meetings, interviews and visits should preferably be made
through Glynis Firth at the LALC office.

                     GRANT A ID POLICIES

Clubs will appreciate that areas of expenditure eligible for grant aid are bound to
alter with the passage of time. In the early days for example, assistance from the
Football Grounds Improvement Trust was limited almost entirely to essential
safety work arising out of the 1975 Safety Act. With increased funding, and
changing priorities, it proved possible to widen areas of eligibility into ground
improvements, such as seating, toilets, facilities for people with disabilities, and
family enclosures.

At the same time the former Football Trust embarked on a range of grant schemes
which were also aimed at League clubs. These included grants for closed circuit
television, transport improvements, help with policing costs, and a wide range of
community-based initiatives.

In combining the work of the former Football Trust and the FGIT into the Football
Trust 1990, and taking advantage of the substantial extra funding made available
from the reduction in pool betting duty, it will be possible not only to continue all
the grant aid schemes of the two former bodies, but also to provide significant
extra assistance with the measures the game will have to take in response to the
Interim and Final Reports of Lord Justice Taylor on the Hillsborough Stadium
disaster.



       AREAS ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE

In this section we describe those areas of expenditure which are eligible for grant
aid. They consist of the following categories:
              1. Safety work
              2. Floodlighting
              3. Toilets
              4. Facilities for people with disabilities
              5. Seating
              6. Major projects including new stadia
              7. Closed circuit television
              8. Transport improvements
              9. Policing costs
             10. Community projects




                                             4
 Categories 1 - 6 are administered from the Trust's office at 319 Clifton Drive
 South, Lytham St Annes, Lancashire FY8 1JG, and categories 7 - 1 0 from the
 office at Walkden House, 10 Melton Street, London NW1 2EJ (but note role of
 sports councils in the community projects).


 1. Safety
 Essential safety work which is the subject of written instruction under the Safety
 of Sports Grounds Act 1975, the Fire Safety and Safety at Places of Sport Act
 1987, and (in England and Wales) the Football Spectators Act 1989 enjoys the
 highest priority and can be grant aided at percentage levels of up to 7 5 per cent of
 approved expenditure.

 Eligibility is determined by the Trustees, at their absolute discretion, taking into
 consideration the advice of the Trust's consulting surveyors, Messrs George Cor-
 deroy & Co. In coming to a decision they will also take into account average at­
 tendances at League matches, so as to avoid money being wasted on projects
 whose principal effect would be to create expensive unused accommodation.
 (This qualification applies to all grant schemes).

 The Trustees also set maximum gross expenditure ceilings for safety work.
 Projects which take an individual club beyond the ceiling (at July 1990, £1.25
 million) cannot be grant aided in respect of that excess amount. For details of
 the procedures which clubs should follow, see below.


 2. Floodlighting
Funding will be made available for floodlighting to a maximum of 7 5 per cent of
£75,000 for any one club over a period of five years. Grants will not be paid for
maintenance items such as painting, cleaning, and replacing bulbs.

Grant aid on floodlights is included within the gross expenditure ceilings de­
scribed previously.


3. Toilets
Grants at up to 70 per cent of approved expenditure are currently available for the
installation of new toilet facilities, up to a maximum ceiling of £50,000.


4. Facilities for people w ith disabilities
The Trust will consider applications from clubs wishing to provide facilities
for people with disabilities. Grants of up to 70 per cent are available up to a
maximum ceiling of £50,000.




                                        5
5. Seating and n ew stands
The conversion of standing accommodation to seating is a key recommendation
of Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report. A significant proportion of the revenue
produced by the reduction in pool betting duty will be devoted to assisting clubs
convert their grounds to all-seating.

Under the terms of the agreement with the Government giving effect to the cut in
betting duty, the Trustees are obliged, when determining levels of grant aid, to
pay attention to clubs' needs (as measured by actual attendances at League
matches) and resources (meaning the level of finance available to a club from all
sources). For this reason, there will be no universal percentage level applied;
every case will be considered on its merits, and the Trustees' discretion regarding
the level of grant aid will be absolute.

In addition to receiving advice from its consulting surveyors, the Trust will invite
its reporting accountants, Rushtons, to examine and advise on seating and major
project applications. To undertake this task they will require the co-operation of
clubs and their accountants: a draft letter of authorisation has been circulated to
clubs, and further copies are available from the LALC office. See also paragraph 6
(Major Projects), below.


6. Major projects
Prior to 1990 neither trust was in a position to offer assistance to clubs seeking to
relocate; the trustees took the view that a decision to build a new stadium was one
that was based on commercial criteria, and generally involved the realisation of a
development opportunity at the original location.

The Trust recognises that circumstances have changed in the light of Lord Justice
Taylor's recommendations: in a small number of cases better value for money
maybe obtained from disposing of an old ground and constructing a new one.

However, even after taking into account the extra funds which are flowing to the
Trust from the pool betting duty concession, the level of assistance (as a percen­
tage of the total cost) which may be offered to clubs building a new ground is
unlikely to be very substantial. A more generous view may be taken if a new
stadium is to become the home of more than one club on a shared basis.

Applications for grant aid towards new grounds will therefore be considered, but
they will be subject to the most rigorous scrutiny by the Trust's reporting account­
ants and consulting surveyors. It is likely that a detailed financial appraisal will
be carried out, and any decision on the level of grant will be taken on the 'needs
and resources' criteria described in paragraph 5 above.




                                          6
    Applicants for major grants will be expected to have instructed architects and other
    consultants in relation to the construction work and financial advisers on the fund­
    ing of the project. The Trust will need to be satisfied that other sources of finance are
    fully assured.

    Depending on the flow of funds into the Trust, and the demands made upon it, it is
    likely that grants for major projects will be spread over a period, rather than paid in
    a single lump sum.

    Provisions relating to the repayment of grant in the event that a facility ceases to be
    used, or is otherwise disposed of, apply particularly with regard to major projects.
    See paragraph on Repayment Conditions below.

    Clubs should give the Trust as much notice as possible of their intention to apply for
    a grant towards major works. They will appreciate that it may take some while for
    an application to be processed and considered by the Trustees.


    7. Closed circuit television
    CCTV surveillance has proved to be the single most important means of assisting
    with the improvement of spectator behaviour at football grounds. Its universal
    introduction was entirely a Trust initiative, and very considerable funds have
    been made available for this purpose.

    Unlike other categories qualifying for assistance, up to 100 per cent of the cost of
    installing CCTV can be grant aided. Details of the procedure to be followed can be
    obtained from the Trust's office in London.

    An important element of the grant scheme is the need to ensure that once in­
    stalled, equipment is properly maintained. Grant may be witheld if the Trustees
    are not satisfied that adequate continuing maintenance arrangements have been
    made.


    8. Transport im provem ents
    Grants are available to improve transport facilities for spectators travelling to and
    from matches. Eligible schemes include railway stations, and coach and car
    parks. Schemes which achieve a significant social benefit, such as the improve­
    ment of the environment around a stadium, are given priority.

    Applications can be made by any interested party (clubs, transport operators or
*   local authorities) to the Trust's London office. They will be assessed by the Trust's
    transport consultant, and his report will then be considered by the Trustees.

,   The level of grant is normally up to 50 per cent of eligible expenditure, but for
    major schemes the percentage may be significantly less.




                                                7
9. Policing costs
Since the 1984-85 season the Football Trust has helped clubs in the Football
League arid the Scottish Football League (and latterly the GM Vauxhall Confer­
ence) to meet the costs of policing League matches.

Claim forms and instructions will continue to be sent out by the Trust. Clubs
should note that claims should be submitted only after policing bills have been
paid: the Trust does not pay these grants (or any others) 'on account'.


10. Community projects
The Trust attaches great importance to developing community sports facilities
based on League clubs, and has invested substantial funds in 'football and the
community' projects. The majority of these grant schemes have been adminis­
tered on the Trust's behalf by the local regional office of the Sports Council (or in
Scotland, by the Scottish Sports Council), and clubs should contact them in the
first instance.
In addition the Trustees have decided to make £4 million available over two years
to assist the joint Football Association/PFA/ Football League community initiat­
ive in England. The great majority of these schemes will be centred on Football
League clubs. Details can be obtained from the Footballers' Further Education
and Vocational Training Society.



                             PROCEDURES

- general
The Football Trust aims to offer assistance as speedily, and with as little bureau­
cracy as possible. But it is necessary for a number of simple rules to be followed:
these are in place to protect the interests of everyone.

Whilst a number of procedures differ according to the grant aid scheme category,
there is one general rule which clubs must remember: grant aid cannot be claim­
ed for projects which are either completed or on which work has started unless
prior approval has been obtained in writing from the Trust (there are special pro­
visions for the rare, genuine emergency).




                                           8
- safety projects
With safety projects it is essential that the Trust is given the following informa­
tion in good time (normally six weeks):
- Description and location of the work to be undertaken
- Three properly authenticated tenders, or an estimate of cost accompanied by a
copy of the enquiry to obtain the competitive tenders.
Plus one or more of the following:
- Safety certificate documentation showing the need for the proposed work
- Written instruction from local authority, the police, the fire authority, or (in
England and Wales) the Football Licensing Authority.

Clubs wishing to apply for grant aid, having met these criteria, should complete
the appropriate proposal forms (examples of forms are shown in Appendix A,
and further copies are available from the Trust offices). Applications will then be
processed (and the advice of Messrs George Corderoy & Co. obtained), and clubs
notified in writing of what offer the Trust is prepared to make. When this has been
received, work may proceed.

Once the work has been completed (or a substantial part of it), a claim may be
made to the Trust for those elements which had been accepted for grant aid. This
should be on the appropriate claim form. Clubs will be notified in writing how
much grant aid they can expect to receive.

The grant from the Trust will be available once clubs can demonstrate that they
have paid the appropriate invoices and their auditors (having examined the
club's books and accounts) have certified that the amounts in respect of which
the claim was made have been paid without any discount or rebate. An example
of the auditors' certification form is enclosed.

The Trustees reserve the right at any time to call for additional information to
prove that payment has been made for grant aided works. This may take the
form of receipted invoices, cancelled cheques, or letters of confirmation from
contractors.

With safety projects clubs normally have six months in which to carry out the
works on which a proposal has been accepted by the Trustees. This time limit
starts from the date of the offer letter; if a claim is not made within that six
months, the offer will automatically be withdrawn, and clubs will have to re­
apply. A similar time limit applies to other grant schemes (with the exception of
major projects, for which three years is the normal limit).




                                         9
- im provem ents
The procedures relating to the grant aid schemes for toilets, facilities for people
with disabilities and seating are broadly similar to those which apply to safety
work.

Clubs should appreciate that these procedures exist for their benefit. If they are
ignored it is likely that the application will be rejected, and no grant paid.



               REPAYMENT CONDITIONS
When a facility which has been the subject of a Football Trust grant ceases to be
used or is sold, the Trust reserves the right in all cases to demand repayment of all
or a proportion of a grant within a specified time scale. This is necessary to guard
against any possibility that its resources may be wasted, or its funds used to en­
hance the personal investment of others. This condition is clearly stated in the
Trust's offer letter.



                    FRAUDULENT CLAIMS
Should any attempt be made to defraud the Trust - by such means as the falsifica­
tion of documents, or the inflation of figures - the most serious view would be
taken. A report would be submitted to the appropriate football governing body,
and any other necessary action taken. The payment of all Trust grants would be
automatically suspended whilst the matter was investigated, and the club could
be disqualified from receiving future grant aid.



                             CONCLUSION
In this booklet we have tried to answer as many questions as possible regarding
grant aid from The Football Trust 1990. Nonetheless clubs may require further
information and clarification: they should not hesitate to contact the appro­
priate Trust office. Our aim is to continue to help the game to the greatest extent
possible.

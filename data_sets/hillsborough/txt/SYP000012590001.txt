                                          With reference to the above, I report as follows.

                                      On Saturday 15th April, 1989, the following road works were in
                                 operation on Motorways within the Greater Manchester Police Area.

                                              s 1.        M63 between junctions 3 and 5 - two lane each direction
                                                          contraflow - long term works relating to the widening
                                                          scheme.

Examined                                        2.        M62 Between junction 21 and 22 - two lane each direction
                                                          contraflow - long term works relating to widening
                                                          scheme.
P.S.
                                                3.        M 6 1 Southbound carriageway between junctions 4 and I -
                                                          major re-surfacing scheme leaving two lanes open    for
                                                          traffic flow. - These works commenced on Friday,
                                                          14th April, 1989, and had been given extensive media
                                                          coverage for some time previous.

                                                4.        M62 Eastbound carriageway at junction 15 - 3rd lane
                                                          closure between 0S30 hours and 1345 hours for general
                                                          maintenance work, - information regarding this closure
                                                          was given to the media on Thursday 13th April.

                                     During that closure traffic was flowing slowly through the road
                                works and was only held up for 10 minutes at the most.  (That time
                                is from initially slowing down at the advance signing to actually
Forwarded                       clearing the roadworks.)

                                     During the morning and early afternoon of the day in question,
S u p t/C h .ln s p .           only the one accident occured, on the Eastbound M62 Motorway.  This
                                was at 1106 hours at Marker Post 49.6, which is within the four lane
                                section  (where the access slip road from the A580 merges).

                                      As a result of the accident, the 3rd and 4th lanes were closed
                                 off for about 10 to 15 minutes, whilst the two vehicles (a motor
                                 cycle and saloon) were removed from the carriageway.  During that
                                 time, with two lanes still open to traffic no serious hold up took
                                 place.

                                      The most likely routes to be taken by Liverpool supporters
                                 travelling to Sheffield are likely to have been.

                                                A.        M62, M 6 , M 5 6 , M63, A6 and A57.

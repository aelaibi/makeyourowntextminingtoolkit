It was therefore decided after consultation between our own management and
police to move home spectators from positions that they had occupied on
the terraces adjacent to the visiting supporters and to accomodate the away
fans in the additional space created. To accomplish this meant deploying
nearly all of the available police to ensure that fans passed through the
area containing 1,580 into the additional space created where they had to
be heavily policed for their own safety. I am informed by our local Chief
Superintendent that Senior police officers verbally informed as many visiting
fans as possible of this situation.

Due to the difficulty of this manoeuvre and the need for numerous police
to accomplish it, this could not be carried out until police had completed
their duties appertaining to spectators entering other parts of the ground.
This action was only agreed as an emergency measure and would only ever
be used as such and would invariably result in sane away supporters entering
after the game had started and being more crowded than the adjacent home
supporters.

This particular incident is being brought to the notice of Lord Justice
Taylor who is preparing his final report and recommendations as a result
of the Hillsborough tragedy to highlight the problems that his recommendations
have created for Arsenal Football Club and the policing of our matches.
We would therefore ask you to 'bear with us1 during this transitionary period
and in closing, we hope that you enjoy your future visits to Arsenal Stadium.

Yours sincerely




D Miles
Assistant Secretary

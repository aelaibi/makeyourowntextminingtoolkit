             I live at the above address with my sister and family.



            On Saturday 15th April, 1989 (150489) I attended the Hi 1lsborouah
              ------------------------------                          c > r p y
            Football match between Liverpool and Notts Forest I am a Liv^fpoo 1

             supporter myself.



             I attended the match by car travelling with three/f^fends.                       I only
                                                                  hj I        S'
             know one of my friends and he is

                     , S k el mer sdal e, Lancashire.      The car^,jrfe travelled in was a hire

             car hired in Mr                              tame.    I d o n ’t know where from.



            We went to Sheffield via the M62 motorway and then the M 1 .                      On the

            motorway we stopped and I there purchased a ticket for the West
                                                                             PAGE      2
                                                                             S I964-

Stand,    Gangway Z Row 16, Seat      132 value £12.00.    I infact paid £16

for it.



The man I purchased the ticket off was a man with his son and

grandson and he just had a spare ticket.



We started travelling to Sheffield about           11.45 (1145 hrs) arrived

in Sheffield at about 2.20 pm (1420 hrs).            We only stopped on the

motorway.     It was our intention to go to a pub in Sheffield called

the Rose    & Crown.     This was organized by my friends who meet in the

Highwayman in Skelmersdale.



In fact one of the people who I travelled with named                             was

given a note to this effect the night before.             I don't know where

lives.



Upon arrival at        Sheffield, we parked our car in Collin Ave     and then

made our way to        Middlewood Rd and then across Hillsborough     Park.

By this time it        was about   1445 hours,   so we made our way to the

entrance to the        ground via Parkside.



Whilst walking up Parkside we saw abouJ^lOO Notts Forest fans walking

towards the Leppings Ln end of the/ground.            Upon reaching the junction

of Leppings Ln and Middlewood             they ran towards the Liverpool        fans

A few fights broke out frutyKot a lot.           I and my friends then ran

towards the Leppings Ln entrance to get out of the way of the

fighting.     I was with about 200 other people at the time all doing the

same thing trying to get away.



Whilst walking round before the match,           I did see Policemen standing
                                                                                         PAGE      3
                                                                                         S 1964-

         round on the junctions and some in vans and on foot going towards the

         ground.      As I got nearer to the ground there seemed to be more

         Policemen about.        However at no time was   I directed towards the ground

         by a Policeman.



         I, nor the people I travelled with had any alcohol            before the match,

         but I did see people walking rounji at the Motorway services and in

         Sheffield sitting on wal ls^*<f£inking beer from cans.          I did not see any

         d r u n ke ness .



         Upon arriving at the Leppings Ln entrance wj              was at 2.43 pm (1445

         hrs)   there was no queues at all therj             just a mass of people about

         3000 or more waiting to get ip.x'They were right across Leppings Ln and

         up Leppings Ln.        There j*cis a gap in the crowd leading to the West

         Stand seating area so I pushed my way into it.            At the front by the

         gates there was also a Policeman on horseback shouting at people.                     I

         had to wait a few minutes to go through the t^rf^nsti les.             Whilst

CArT /   waiting     I saw other fans climbing over^>fe turnstiles.            They were

         showing the tickets to the Police w>fS were letting them in,



         Upon getting        into the ground I saw more Policemen,     about    15 or 20

         looking at the crowd.         I then seperated from my friends who had

         seperate seats and made my way through a gap in a wall to the

         staircase      leading to the West Stand.    Whilst    crossing the open area at

         the rear of the stand I did not see any gate being opened or any crowd

         surge.



         At the bottom of the staircase my ticket was again seen by a steward.

         This was the first steward I had seen.           I then made my          to my seat

         on row 16 and found another        person sitting    in it.   IyShowed him my

             ticket and he          wed rne his.     It was the          s mine, with the same

             seat a          ow number on.   He then          he thought his was a forgery and

                      off.



CAT          At the time when the teams         came out to warrru         I then noticed that

CO/^M.fej'i^there was a crush in the standing pen Jjp^ow me which is number 3.                    I

             saw young children being        passed o^(^r the crowd towards the front by
T O V|£W
 COA/SiJ)££the fence and ^people trying t ^ g e t         them out onto the pitch but the

tmcicvo   r Police     on the pitch just/fJushed them back into the crowd when they
/n /t V
Of"fiofe£S   were on top of the i^tflflings.        This happened about 4 or 5 times.

              I could see that there was           too many people    in Pen 3 and they were

              being crushed.       I then left my seat and went to the front of the West

Cs&   , \ s t a n d   just a bit to the right of the central           railings above Pen 3.



              Whilst there I could see people in Pen 3 being crushed in the crowd.



              There was also people climbing over the railings             into Pens 4 and 2.

              In fact I saw Mr                        and my othej*-''"?riend known

              climb out of Pen 3 into Pen 4.           Then^^other     surge of the crowd came

      <y\     through the tunnel      into Pen 3 apKT 4.      Just after kick off I then saw

              the crowd fall at point B oj/the diagram and the rest of the crowd

              go over the top of them,          I was in fact standing at point A on the

              diagram.       Now produced marked Ref              (Exhibit No.           ).


                                                  *x/                     ? V J T)
              I then with another man started to pull             people out of Pen 3 up into

              the stand.       I pulled about    10 or more People up.      A few of them were

             winded but none of them were seriously injured or dead.                  I remained in

              the stand for sometime after and then made my way out.



             At the time I attended the match I was wearing jeans and a blue
                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                         SI 964-

            jumper.     I am clean shaven and have a heavy build.



        /   After the game had been stopped I continued to pull people out.                 Ther

    /       was also others on the pitch the other side oj>-'tfie fence.             The Notts

            Forest fans then started to chant a n d > * t a w       some Liverpool   fans run

            towards them and then come ba<             At this point the Police formed a

            line on the centre l i n ^ S c r o s s   the ground.    They were doing nothing t

            help what was happening.         They even d i d n ’t move out of the way when

            they were running across the ground with stretchers.              There was also

            other Policemen helping.         I also thought the ambulances took time

            getting thera^pand the other Emergency Services.             From what    I saw the

            fans were helping a lot m o r ^ t h a n what the Pol i ra wrrr


                              CAT"                      Al
            I attended the semi - final match last,                 and I stood in Pen 4-.

            There was    crushing last year                ing like this.    That    is one of

            the   reasons   I^ot   a stand ticket this year.         Also there seemed to be

            comp 1ete lack of organisation or direction at the rnatj:h.

                                                                                         SIGNED

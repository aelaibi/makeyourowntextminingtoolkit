 Dear Mr Owen

Football Specials - Hillsborogh Tracjedy

As i t becomes apparent t h a t a t l e a s t one of the contributing factors
to l a s t Saturdays tragedy a t Shef field was the number of fans who
arrived without t i c k e t s f o r the match, I ask t h a t you consider the
following suggestion.

I f i t i s known t h a t a sporting event i s to be "Ticket Only", be i t
a soccer, or rugby union match, and B r i t i s h Rail are laying on a
special t r a i n for the t r a n s p o r t of supporters; a condition of
purchase of the t r a i n t i c k e t i s production of a match t i c k e t . This
of course could be subject to touts or persons with one t i c k e t returning
to purchase more t r a i n t i c k e t s for f r i e n d s , but i t would discourage
some people from travel 1 ing without match t i c k e t s . Further r e s t r a i n t
could be put on the amount of t i c k e t l e s s t r a v e l l e r s , by the refusal
to l e t people through the t i c k e t b a r r i e r to the platform without the
match t i c k e t .

I know these precautions may be d i f f i c u l t or even impossible a t some
s t a t i o n s with one s e t of b a r r i e r s serving many platforms eg New S t r e e t ,
but a t s t a t i o n s such as Euston, with Separate t i c k e t b a r r i e r s , they
could be implemented with next to no cost a t a l l , and with the support
of the Police on e sc o r t duty, i t should not be to d i f f i c u l t f o r your
staff.

With the simmilar co-operation from coach companies, the chances of
another Hillsborough will be lessened.
Yours si n c e r e ly ^                                         .

H ig h l i g h t e d   by these    s u pe r v i s o r y officers was       the    prospect      of trouble

betw ee n Liverpool           s upporters and N o t t i n g h a m Fo re st         fans    on the Kop.

We were        to assist      in any fighting          that may occur            b e tw ee n the fans.

The sterile area was               e x pl ai ne d to us,     and we were          told that was where

Liverpool         fans w ou ld be      removed to.



At approx imately            11.45am    <1145)^1       attenraed at        the    turnst i 1es     on

P e n is t o n e Rd,     in company w i t h ffC 89^T Geoff S T O K E S            (POL PC 892 S T O K E S ) .

Our    duties were         to sear ch f ans\Jj»r alcohol            and o ff ensive w e a p o n s .               We

were also         to deal w it h     public     order      offences.



The    t urnstiles        into the ground were             opened at       12 noon     <1200).             Fans

started        entering      the ground at          this   time.     The    conduct       of the

N o t t i n g h a m Forest    fans was      quite     orderly.       There was a stead y              flow of

people        entering     the ground and queuing was minimal.                         These     fans were

in good spirits and               co-o pe ra ti ve w h e n told they were             to be searched.



As    I was     s earching     one male,       I came across and air               horn.        I took       this

to the        property store and gave               this   boy my name and number.                    He    took

it very well           and was     r el ieved he wa sn 't      to be a r r e s t e d      for   it.



Other      fans were a p p r o a c h e d    in the street          if seen to be drinking                  from

cans     of    lager and beer.             T hese    cans were     confiscated.             Once a ga in

this was a c c e p t e d good        n at u re d ly and only m i n i m u m a buse was            given       by

these      individuals.

A r o u n d 2.30prn the m a j o r i t y          of fans that had          c on gr egated       opposite

P e n i s t o n e Rd t urnstiles            started a rr iving at the             turnstiles,          to gain

entry to the Kop.                      We were    prepared to deal w it h u nc o -o p er a t i v e

A round 2 . 5 0 p m       (1450)        most Nott i ngham supp or te rs were               inside      the

ground.           A few were m i ll in g a ro un d on the                street,        and others w a lk in g

up and       down P e ni st on e Rd enq ui ri ng as to w h et h er any tickets                          were     for

sal e .



At this       time      I heard         reports      come over the       radio     of my serial

sergeants,          that a wall           was    trying    to be ki ck ed down by L i ve rp oo l

suppo rt er s at Leppi ng s Ln.                      I also   heard that        there may be a

p o ss ib il it y of the m at ch being                 delayed.



A p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 1 0 pm    (1510)    after    the m at ch     had kicked off,             we    heard a

call     over     the    radio         r equi ring    our a ss is t an c e at     the L ep pi ng s Ln end of

the    pitch.



We    ran,    as a s e r i a l , t h ro ug h the Kop towards                the    pitch.         At    this

stage      I was      preparing my se lf             for what a p p ea r ed     to be a pitch           i nv asion

or fight        on the L ep pi ng s Ln terraces.                   As we      ran thro ug h the Kop we

were     being      taun te d by N o t t i n g h a m supporters,           who     informed us we were

at the wrong            end of the          pitch as      usual.      We    then     ran ac ro ss       the

pitch to the L e p p in g s Ln e n d .                  Although    I was     gree te d by the most

ho rr if ic     sights       I have       ever    seen    it was   impo ss ib le        to u n d e r s t a n d what

was a c t u a l l y     happening.          I saw L iverpool       fans at        the    rear    of the

terrace       being      pulled up to the second tier                    by fans.           At the      front a

surge      of    people had been squasjyed

                                           against                         the    r ai l in g s.      Y ou ng     people

were    contorted and t w is te d w it h blank,                       shoc ke d expres si on s         upon their

faces,      and their         skin a purple              colour.         I shall        never      forget     one

y o un g girl      of a p p r o x i m a t e l y    12 years,         s q u a sh e d and e x p r e s si o nl e ss       w ith

the    railings         dug    into her        cheek.



As the      r ealisation of w h a / was                  hapc^ming       dawned on m e , bodies were

being      pulled over          t                     a /a     t hr o u g h the   g a t e s , by fellow

officers.           As    this           s go i nig on police           officers        formed a tunnel             to

as si st    in getting          p             into    the fresh air                   I was   towards       the     end

of this         chain and       lit er al ly g ra bbing            people and w a lk in g           them    into       the

m i d - f i e l d area of the            pitch.



I then had a check                  round that        the many bodies             on the      pitch were

br ea th in g and        in a s a ti s f a c t o r y     state.          At this        point      one m an     ran up

to me and hugged me,                  telling me          the     police       had saved his         life.          Then

a mi dd le age d man and a y o un ge r                   girl      ran up to me telling me                  to get

their      friend out.              As    I went with them to the                     railings      this    friend

was    being     s u c c e s s fu l ly    carried        out by a fellow officer.



I was      then a tt em p ti n g         to   clear      the    crowd back        from the terraces               in

order      to a ll ow more           bodies       into    the o p e n a i r .



I was then told by S u p e r i n t e n d e r ^ r j R E E N W O O D              to find some         stretchers.

I went      to    look and found              n o n y a v a i l a b l e , as    the    limited few w i t h i n           the

g r o u nd were     being used.



At this         point    I was       v ag ue ly a wa re        of a tanrioy message,               although       I am

I was     then asked to assis t with keeping                      the    crowds       back     in the       seated

a r e a where       the N o t t i n g h a m fo re st    s up po rt er s were,           This    e n ab le d

s tretchers         to be m o ve d easily up the gangway.



A fter about          ten m i nu te s    scuffles      were    breaking        out betw ee n Liv er po ol

fans    on the        pitch and      the seated N o t t i n g h a m For es t          fans.



I ran to the           pitch and m o v ed the Liverpool                 fans    back to the           centre      of

the    pitch.          Minor    s cu ffles were        breaking       out amon gs t       fans.           These

were    unserious and due               to emotion.



I a sk e d one man to m ove              back and he just kept scr ea mi ng                    that    his    son

was    in there.



X was     then a sk ed to form a line with fe ll ow officers across                                   the     centre

of the        pitch.         It was at this       time,       a r o u nd 4 . OOp m    (1600),      that a

m e ss ag e    over    the    tannoy     c onfirmed the m a tc h was            to be a bandoned.                 A

Once    the m a j o r i t y of     the ground had emptied,                 I m o ve d    into P e n i s t on e        Rd

should head towards H i l l s b o r o u g h Park where                   fighting was           taking        place.

However,        we were       then told that           the scene      had q u ie te ne d down.



Inspector B OO TH then told us to head towards C l a y w h e e 1s roun d ab ou t as

problems were a n t i c i p a t e d with traffic.                     However,        on arrival          it was

under     control,        so we he ad ed back.

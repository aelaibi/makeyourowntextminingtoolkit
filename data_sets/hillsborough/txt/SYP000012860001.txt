         At a b o u t      1.45       pm     ( 1 3 4 5 ) , the        players          came        out     to    check        the    pitch and

         we    started          to    get       going     with        singing          and     clapping.                At 2 . Q Q       pm    (14QQ)

         many     people         in       it.      We    also        started          talking         to      two     fellas        behind          us

         and    three        fellas          in f r o n t       of    us.        We    started           shouting            and    chanting

         again.         Around 2.45                pm    (1445) you              just       could        not     m o v e » we       had a

         people mo ve d              to    the     sides        and    there was             a big         gap       to w h e r e    the

         barrier        was.          I had my arms                  down    by m y         sides        so     the     only way          I could

         move    my arms was                 to    elbow        some       fella       in the         face       and my arms              were        all

         right.         Then         the    teams        c a m e gtit a n d           there        was     a biq ^ s u r g e .           I grabbed

     Jli^out    and     I saw D e s m o n d L Y M A N                pointing          to    the      crowd.




         We    could       not       help     ourselves,              we    had       to    go w h e r e        the     crowd was             goingi

         time     I was         sweating           like     a    p i g , I was             taking        my     hat     off    every          two

         seconds        to w i p e m y            face.         A I 1 you        could       hear        w a s , "Please            let       us    out,

         and    I saw        the      front        row    fall.            I had       hold        of P h i l ' s       hand and          it w a s

         slipping          and       slipping.            The        next    thing          I could           not     keep     hold an d            he

         fell    away        and      that was           the     last       time       I saw        him.




         The    barrier          c o l l a p s e d a nd         loads       of    pe ople          fell       forward.             People          who

were     o n the        pitch were              shouting,             "Push      back."             I pushed          back        and     fell

over     something.              When          I turned          round        there         was     a fella          ly ing       there,

his    face     was       b l u e , he w a s          d e a d a n d J^ 'couldn't                  help      him.




When     I fell         over     the       body       someone          stood          on m y      chest        and my       hands.            I

don't       know     if      I ^.lacked out                for a       couple          of    seconds           but    the     next

thing       I remember           was       two       lads       p i c k e d me        up a n d w e r e         asking       if     I was

alright.           I wiped my              face       again and              started         shouting,           "Open        the

. . .....      gates,"          and       the    police          were        just      standing           there.          I was

shouting        with         t his    fella          to    open       t he    back      doors.            At    this      time      I did

not    know where             Ian,        Phil       and                 were.




Finally       the       b ack    doors          were       opened.            I started             to    get    out.         I

c o u l d n ’t b r e a t h e     because my                chest was           killing            me.       I got       dragged           ou t

by    one    f e l l a . He     said,          "Go    on        mate,          get ou t        there."           I crawled          out

with    a    policeman           just           looking          at    m e .W h e n     I      got        o ut of the       stand         I

just    broke        down.           I got       myself          back        together          and       ran s t r a i g h t       back       in

to    find     the      other        three.           But,       there        was      so m u c h        panic       I got        halfwav

down    the     t u n n e l,     but       there          were    so m a n y        people          t her e .        I pushed my way

through        but      there were              too m a n y       bodies         lying         there.           We    had     to    carry

the    dead     out and,             at    last,          the    police        knew         there        was    people        dying        out

there.        When        I got       to       the    t e r r a c e I could             not       see     any    of     them.           When

I was       looking,          I saw        one       young       la d g e t t i n g         Railed        out    on the           pitch,

but    I could          not     believe          it w h e n        I saw       him      getting           thrown        back       i n.       I

just     couldn't               believe what               had          happened.




I went       to get             a drink and               this           blokewas              charging          4 0 p.       I said          that

he    should       be     giving          us    the       drink       free     because            of w h a t w a s

happening.              He    replied           that       we w er e         holigans.              Two     other       blokes

heard       this and          started           to    threaten           him     , but         he    said       t hat     he w a s

sorry.        I got m y             drinks          and    stood        there wa t c h i n g            police          carry          bodies

body    b u t , thank             god,       it w a s n ' t                      Then        I saw                        We       both       ran

to    each    other         and        threw        ou r a r m s      around         each       other,        then made                our w a y

back    to    the        coaches .             We    tried       to     se e    if w e       could       use       some       telephones

but    they were            p acked,           even       in    in the         houses        there       were        queues            there-

On    the w a y      back we met                  Ia n but       there         was    no P h i l -           By    now    th e         time

was    around 3-45                pm     (1545)-




When    we    go t       back       to    the       coach,                     got    back       on     his       coach and             Ian

and    I went        to     his        coach        but P h i l       w a s n ’t t h e r e -           I looked a r oun d                   and

saw a social              club a b o ut             500    yrds       away      so w e w e n t          to    ring       my    parents,




W h e n we    reached             the     club       the       queue     for     the       telephone              was    enormous.

We    decided        to w a it .             We     had    been waiting               f or      roughly           twenty m i n u t e s ,

then    it w a s         our      turn       to     d i a l , but we           c o u l d n ’t get a           1 ine      out.           We

went    back        down       to      the     coaches          and     there        was     still       no       s i g n of P h i l.

Ian a n d     I went           back       to      the     ground        ho ping we           could       f ind him,            but we

bad    feeling           t h at     he    had       g o n e , so w e m a d e          our       way     back       to    the       coaches

with    our        fingers          crossed          that       he w a s       there       b u t , wh e n we            got    back,

there     was       no    sign.           Ian made             his w a y       back    to       h is    c o a c h.       I shouted                if

you    need me you                know where              I was.         I was        one       of     the    last

people       to     get     back         on the         coach        b u t , even      the n ,         the    coach was                only

three     quarters             full.           I jumped          of f    the      coach         just     to       see    if    I could

use a n y     of     the       car       ’phones          which were            in t he         poli ce       cars       but       I

             all    the       way     home.     I was        hoping          when     I woke      up    that     I would          find       it

            was     a    l    l   d     nightmare,           but    it w a s n ' t .        When       the    c o a c h got       back       to

15th April 1989


On Saturday 15th April 1989 I went to watch Liverpool play
Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup Semi-Final. We got on the
coach and when we set off we were talking about the match.   I
went with             but he was on another coach. We also saw
Ian Southgate and Phil Hammond.  Back on the coach we watched a
video about Liverpool, when I got off the coachP       was
waiting for me. We started to go to the ground (this was
around 1pm). When we got to the ground^        got a body search
before he gave his ticket in. He was clean so the police let me
go as well. We gave our tickets i n . Then there was another
policeman there, he searched         then he searched me as
well, I had a comb in my back pocket and I had to show it to
him.

We got a programme off two stewards (they where the only one’s
I had seen). We got a drink and then we saw the pitch. We had
to go through a tunnel then you where on the terrace. At about
this time it was 1.30pm, it was quite empty. We met Ian and
Phil so we sat down to read our programme.

At about 1.45pm the players came out to check the pitch and we
started to get going with singing and clapping. At 2.00pm it
was getting pretty full where we were but the sides didn’t have
many people in it.   We also started talkingto two fella’s
behind us and three fella’sin front of us.    We started
shouting and chanting again.   Around 2.45pm you just could not
move, we had a couple of surges before disaster struck when we
got pushed forward people moved to the sides and there was a
big gap to where the barrier was. I had my arms down by my
sides so the only way I could move my arms was to elbow some
fella in the face and my arms were all right. Then the teams
came out and there was a big surge, I grabbed hold of         t-
shirt and pulled him back. The teams got called out and I saw
Desmond Lyman pointing to the crowd.

We could not help ourselves we had to go where the crowd was
going.

Around 2.55pm all you could hear was "let us out" at this time
I was sweating like a pig, I was taking my hat off every two
seconds to wipe my face. All you could hear was "please let us
out, please Brucie help us". Just then there was one hell of a
big push and I saw the front row fall. I had hold of Phil’s
hand and it was slipping and slipping, the next thing I could
not keep hold and he fell away and that was the last time I saw
him.

The barrier collapsed and loads of people fell forward, people
who were on the pitch were shouting "push back" I pushed back
and fell over something, when I turned round there was a fella
lying there, his face was blue, he was dead, and I couldn’t
help him.

When I fell over the body someone stood on my chest and my
hands, I don’t know if I blacked out for a couple of seconds
but the next thing I remember was two lads picked me up and
were asking if I was alright. I wiped my face again and
started shouting "open the ...... gates" and the police were
jsut standing there. I was shouting with this fella to open the
back doors. At this time I did not know where Ian, Phil and
      were.

Finally the back doors were opened I started to get out, I
couldn’t breathe because my chest was killing me. I got
dragged out by one fella he said "go on mate, get out there".
I crawled out with a policeman just looking at me. When I got
out of the stand I just broke down.  I got myself back together
and ran straight back in to find the other three. But there
was so much panic I got halfway down the tunnel, but there were
so many people there. I pushed my way through but there were
too many bodies lying there we had to carry the dead out, and
al last the police knew there was people dying out there. When
I got to the terrace I could not see any of them. When I was
looking I saw on young lad getting pulled out on the pitch, but
I could not believe it when I saw him getting thrown back in.
I just couldn’t believe what had happened.

I went to get a drink and this bloke was charging 40p, I said
that he should be giving us the drink free because of what was
happening, he replied that we were holigans. Two other blokes
heard this and started to threaten him, but he said that he was
sorry. I got my drinks and stood there watching police c^rry
bodies out, I saw one body with the same clothes as         I
rushed to the body but thank god it wasn’t      [   Then I saw
      we both ran to each other and threw our arms around each
other, then made our way back to the coaches. We tried to see
if we could use some telephones, but the were packed even in
houses there were queues there. On the way back we met Ian but
there was no Phil. By now the time was around 3.45pm.

When we got back to the coach       got back on his coach and
Ian and I went to his coach but Phil wasn't there.  I looked
around and saw a social club about 500yds away so we went to
ring my parents.

When we reached the club the queue for the telephone was
enormous, we decided to wait. We had been waiting for roughly
twenty minutes, then it was our turn to dial, but we couldn’t
get a line out. We went back down to the coaches and there was
still no sign of Phil. Ian and I went back to the ground
hoping we could find him, but we couldn’t get back on the
terraces and we couldn’t find him. I had a bad feeling that he
had gone, so we made our way back to the coaches with our
fingers crossed that he was there, but when we got back there
was no sign. Ian made his way back to his coach I shouted if
you need me you know where I was. I was one of the last people
to get back on the coach. But even then the coach was only
three quarters full, I jumped off the coach just to see if I
could use any of the car phones which were in the police cars,
but I couldn’t. Then I saw         and he was alright.

When I got back on the coach everyone was just sitting there
stunned by what had happened. About 6.15pm our coach left to
go home. I just put my hat over my face and fell asleep. No­
body spoke all the way home. I was hoping when I woke up that
I would find it was all a bad nightmare. but it wasn’t. When
the coach got back to Amberline            ffas there to pick me
up and drove me home and I didn’ say a word.

When I walked in the door my dad just broke down, when I was
walking down our road everyone was watching and pointing to me.
I learnt later that Ian stayed behind and came back in a police
car. When I went to the doctors I learnt that Phil Hammond had
passed away and I had bruised ribs, arm and shoulder. But that
is nothing to whats happened to the dead,        had hurt his
knee caps.

Just thinking I had hold of Phil’s hand and I could do nothing
to help him. That could easily have been me. I would like to
say that there was somebody up there that helped me and I thank
you very much.

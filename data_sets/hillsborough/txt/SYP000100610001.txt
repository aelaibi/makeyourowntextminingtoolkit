STEVEN THOMAS                                                                             R192



POLICE SERGEANT 1764



RING FARM, CUDWORTH, BARNSLEY



At 7-^5 am on Saturday 15 April 1989. I reported for duty at the Niagara

Stables, Sheffield, performing clerical and stable duties, grooming Police

horse 'Sandhurst' for football duties later the same day.

At 10.15 am along with other South Yorkshire Mounted Officers and officers

from Merseyside and Nottingham.             I attended a briefing in the Niagara Club,

held   by   Inspector    Hand-Davis.         Officers       were    given    specific    duties    to

perform for phase I and phase III.             I was instructed to work at the Leppings

Lane turnstiles along with Police Sergeant 1951 Smith, Police Constable 1300

Grunhill, Police Constable 1696 Stanbridge (Merseyside) and Police Constable

3186 Wilson from South Yorkshire.

At 11.30 am all the Mounted personnel were mounted and assembled in the car

park   of   the    Niagara    Club.         After    a    welcome    by     Chief   Superintendent

Duckenfield,      we   then   left    for   the     football   ground.        On    arrival   at   the

ground, Inspector Hand-Davis split the Mounted contingent up to work with

their respective       groups or partners.               I then took the officers mentioned

above to the Leppings Lane turnstiles.                   There I briefed them, showing them

the lay-out of the turnstiles, where the supporters with North Stand tickets

would go, where the West Stand ticket holders, and also where the Leppings

Lane terrace tickets holders go.               At this stage I noticed that there were

turnstiles already open and that supporters had started to enter the ground.
                                                  -    2    -




I also     told   the    officers       that    there would be a build up                 of supporters

without tickets hanging around on the pavements and near to the perimeter

gates in hope that they would get tickets.                            Also to expect ticket touts

which would obviously attract supporters, thus blocking entry to the ground.

Once briefed, I took all the officers up to Catchbar Lane, Middlewood Road,

Parkside    Road,       Penistone   Road        and        finally    Leppings    Lane,    showing    and

briefing    the   officers,       car    parking arrangements,               flash points     and   their

points for Phase III.         On return to Leppings Lane, I instructed that Police

Constable 1696 Stanbridge and 1300 Grunhill should work together in a pair,

that I should work with Police                  Sergeant 1952 Smith and Police Constable

Wilson by herself.         I also suggested that because there was very little all

five horses could do at this time, that officers took the opportunity to

walk around the area yet again to allow the horses a leg stretch and also to

have another look round the area.

At 12.30 pm that day, in company with Police Sergeant Smith, we went on a

general patrol.         We went up to Middlewcjod Ro^d and turned right up Wadsley

Lane, pass The Park public house.                     I rcturncd-a steady stream of Liverpool

supporters walking up Wadsley Lane away from the ground.                              Most stated that

they were looking for somewhere to get something to eat.                              When passing the

shops in Wadsley Lane, I noticed that Liverpool supporters were leaving off-

licence premises with packs of beer and what appeared to be the two litre

plastic    bottles      of beer.         Some    supporters          were   sitting   on garden walls

drinking the beer, whilst others just sat on the pavement.                            I actually moved

six or seven that were sat on the kerb edge.                                I also advised that they

should go to the ground early and that if they arrived at the ground drunk

they would not          get in.     We    continued             to walk up Wadsley Lane until          we
reached The Horse and Jockey public house.                There I saw approximately 100

Liverpool supporters drinking beer in the car park.               Some were sitting on

the nearby grass verge.        We continued to walk round the estate passing other

off-licence       shops, where     again   Liverpool   supporters were buying    cans    of

beer.

Approximately 1.00 pm, we returned to the ground to join officers mentioned

above.     At this time I asked the Mounted Officers to keep the area in front

of the perimeter gates clear.              Asking them without tickets to leave         the

area.     I was also asked by a foot Inspector to try to keep the footpath over

the     bridge    clear,   because    supporters   were    congregating,    blocking    the

pavement    causing other pedestrians to step out into the road.                This was

passed on to other Mounted officers.             At this time I noticed that all the

turnstiles       were   open and   that    supporters were going through without        any

problems.        For the next hour up to approximately 2.00 pm, all my contingent

were employed as described above.

At approximately 2.00 pm, I heard over the radio that the special train had

arrived at Wadsley Bridge.            I looked at the turnstiles and noticed that

small queues had formed leading to nearly all the turnstiles and the foot

officers were searching all the supporters going into the ground.                 Mounted

officers were still asking people not to block the entrance to the ground,

again getting people without tickets away from the ground.                 I was asked by

an Inspector to clear the footpath in front of the shop and terrace house,

so that the supporters arriving from the special train could be directed

towards their respective turnstiles.             Queues were already being formed by

foot officers at the turnstiles and at this stage there was no problems.                  I

was then joined by Inspector Hand-Davis and eight other Mounted officers.                 I
noticed that as people arrived they seemed confused, because for the next

10-15 minutes, I was continually being asked where certain entrances were.

Approximately 2.15 pm, I looked at the Leppings Lane terrace turnstiles (B)

and noticed that there was a build up of people.                         No queues at turnstiles.

At   this     stage    all    the     perimeter     gates     were   open    and    supporters     were

continually arriving at the ground.                     I noticed that Police Constable 1300

and 1696 had actually gone into the pen area and started to relieve pressure

and re-establish queues.                  I went   in     to help because I noticed that some

supporters were trying to crawl under the barrier and push their way to the

front.      It seemed at this             stage that the supporters arriving at the ground

just did not want to wait                 their turn but just push their way to the               front.

The mood of the            crowd gradually         changed from being happy to aggressive,

because myself and the other two Merseyside officers were trying to get them

into queues      thus preventing a crush.                   I noticed that people          with    small

children      were    holding      them    above    their    shoulders.       People     were    totally

disregarding what was being said to them.                     I noticed beer cans being thrown

at one of the Merseyside officers.                 A man with his young son was shouting at

me to do something because he was getting crushed,                          because as I have said

above,   the people arriving just wanted to push their way to the front.                               I

then left the pen area because I wasn't being effective.                                 I tried three

times    to    get    my   horse      into   the    pen    area   just   where     the    blue   barrier

finished, but could not because the supporters were so densely packed.

The supporters actually pushed me out.                     My intention was to try and join up

with the two other Merseyside officers so that we could put a cordon of

horses across thus stopping some of the pressure on the turnstiles and also

to try and regulate             the    flow of supporters.           People      at this stage were
                                                -   5   -




complaining of being trod on by the horse.                         I moved out of that area and

organised a cordon of horses across the blue perimeter fence.                               I noticed

that Police Constables Grunhill and Stanbridge had also left the pen area

because     they   were    not   being    effective.             After organising    this   cordon I

noticed that people at the front near to the turnstiles were being crushed.

I   also    noticed   an    Inspector        standing       on    the   blue barrier near    to   the

turnstiles pulling and lifting people out.                         Whilst I was in   the cordon of

horses on the perimeter gates,               I was askingsupporters not to push, but yet

again they just ignored what was being said.                            I saw youths climbing the

perimeter fence just to get into the pen area.                          At about this time myself

and the horse were pushed through the gates.                        The supporters pushing past.

I saw several people fall to the floor and myself and Police Constable 2316

Scott managed to push back the crowd, blocking the gap, allowing the people

who had fallen to get back onto their feet, otherwise I believe that they

would have been trampled on.                 It was at this stage that I tried to                 get

through on the radio,            saying      "Emergency",         but I couldn't get through to

control.

It was about 2.45 pm when I finally got through and asked control to send

the horses detailed to work at the rear of the South Stand up to Leppings

Lane.      They arrived at approximately 2.50 pm.

It was about       this    time when I saw supporters that was                   in the pen being

ushered round towards            Gate   C.     I would say that            approximately 100 went

towards Gate C.           This still left approximately 200, still trying to push

their way through towards the turnstiles.                        About 2.50 pm I then saw Gate B

open which allowed the remaining supporters in the pen to enter the ground

on mass.       I saw Gate        B   close    and we then allowed supporters                to filter

through towards the turnstiles.
It was at this point that I went to the turnstiles and put my horse right up

to the wall.     I saw two youths approach the turnstile, one had a ticket in

his hand, the other had a ten pound note.                 It was at this time that I heard

a   message   over   the    radio   asking    for   all    turnstiles   to   be   closed.   I

immediately stopped further entry into the ground by putting the horse in

front of the turnstiles.

I would say regarding radio communications that because of the position I

was   in,   the noise      of the   crowd    and actually     trying to organise Mounted

deployment, I found it very difficult to hear anything clearly.                    Whether it

was because of the noise round me at the time or because of traffic on the

radio I cannot say.

I have ‘vrtgfft years Mounted experience, having worked at all the grounds in

South Yorkshire, plus others at Derby, Chesterfield and Leeds United, and I

would like to say that I have never experienced crowd behaviour like that.

It seemed that people did not, and would not, listen to advice.                   They seemed

to totally disregard what was said to them.                Totally disregarding the safety

of people at the front of the turnstiles.

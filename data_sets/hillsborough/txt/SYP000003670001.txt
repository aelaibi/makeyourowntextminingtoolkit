                 employed as an enquiry agent and I have been a Liverpool s u p p o r t e r

                 for all of my life.             I was born in between the two grounds.

                 I am a standing season ticket holdff and as soon as the tickets

                 became available I contacted my rtate,                                   who lives near to the

                 ground and arranged for him                        pick up my ticket for me.

                 has recently moved but                      as not going to the match.

                  On Saturday,   15h April,    1989 (150489)     I left my house and drove to

                                     WALTON, LIVERPOOL, to pick up my ma1                 I don't

                  know his surname or the house number.   I had to/wait a short while,

                  I ’d left at 1/4 to 9am (0845) and left         at about 1/2 past 9am

                  (0930).
                                        till
                  I then drove to              picked him up, in fact 1 left my car at his

                  house and we drove in                 ar setting out at about 10am (1000).       My

                  mate         who is one of               mates also came with us.    I don’t

                  know his details.

                  We drove to Sheffield over Snake Pass and were held up in Manchester

                  by road works.

                  At about 12.30pm (1230) we stopped at a pub on the outski rts of

                  Sheffield for a pint and some lunch but the place was not very good so

                  I only had a pint and a sausage butty.             There were about 50 Liverpool

                  supporters in there all having a good natured good time.             There was

                  no trouble and I did not see anyone who was drunk.

                  We left that pub, I d o n ’t know it’s name, at about 1.00pm (1300), and

                  drove into Sheffield proper nearer to the ground.             I have angina

                  so we wanted to get as close to the ground as possible as I cannot

                  walk very far and Sheffield is all hills.
          ft
                  At about 1.30 (1330) or 1.40 (1340) we parked up at a pub called

  nfi             the S p o ^ s m a n where we went for a proper meal.       I had two pints and

                  a beefburger meal and we left there about 25 past 2pm (1325) to walk

tj f r *             the ground,                 -----------------------------------

         rfa      1^ was about a mile or so to the g r j r t m d ,    it took us until about 25 or
              /
7*                a quarter to 3pm to get there because I had to walk slowly.

                  At the ground I saw a veryyfarge crowd of people backed up into

         sO       Leppings Lanjs standing J t h B r e just waiting to go in.
  S °"
                  I remember seying^^ar'couple of policemen keeping an eye on things whilst

                  we were en route to the ground.
                                                                  PAGE     3
                                                                  S367

When I arrived at the ground, as I ’ve said, there was a large crowd

of people just standing there as far as I could see which was up to

the fences and walls of the ground.    No one was moving, this was about

1/4 to 3 pm (1445), and I moved forwards because we wanted to get in.

It was 7 or S minutes before anyone moved and then suddenly everyone

moved forwards.

I was standing by a police horse as I was waiting,     I was so close I

was stroking it, it was on the right hand side somewhere but I

couldn’t see too much because of the crowd and I cannnot say exactly

where I was other than in relation to the police horse on the right.

I remember there was a ,second police horse somewhere nearby but I

cannot say exactly where.

The crowd was not too bad but it was pretty packed, but it was not a

crush or anything.

Suddenly,   there was a gate open aiyd everyone moved forwards.    I passed;:

in front of the police horse amf on into the ground.     We definately

did not go through any turnstiles and I believe that we went through

the gate on the right tha^ywas opened by the police but I cannot say

who exactly.

Everyone walked •hrr'wards, everyone was in a good mood because we w e n

now going in, but I can remember that while we had been waiting there

had been a lot of shouting from nearer the front but I can’t say what

it was all about.

Everyone was singing and in a good humour and w f walked in and the

crowd just carried me forwards and into thg/tunnel .    I didn’t see any

police or stewards once I was insid           ound.

My mate        had my tickets and it was as I was going through the

tunnel that I realised that we had not gone through a turnstile and

that he had still got the complete tickets.     I didn't actually see

I did not see any signs telling me where to go but I went behind the

goals last year so I knew which way to go.      As far as I was aware the

tunnel was the only way to get onto the terraces.

Mind you, the crowd was walking forwards into the tunnel and if I had

wanted to go anywhere else I could not have.      There was no way I

could have turned around because the crowd was going to the tunnel

and it just carried everyone along with it.      Also there was a large

number of people who had arrived behind me and they were all moving

into the ground.   I   didn’t Z e e anyone causing any trouble or climbing

over any walls or anything.

I was carried along ythe tunnel by the crowd and again there was no

bother until weiMsached the far end by the pens where it became

tightly packed.

I was carried forwards into pen 3 on the right which I could see was

already full of people I saw that the players were having a kick

about on the pitch.

As I was pushed fowards I thought,    I don't want to be here,    I would

have given everything I had to have got out of there at that time.            ]

know that it was 7 minutes to 3 pm <1453) because in the crush my

watch was pulled from my wrist and the strap broke and it cut my

wrist slightly.

I managed to catch it as it fell off my wrist and Iy4aw the time

clearly.

I was pushed   forwards until I was about 10 $ 4 e t from the   front fence

and a bit to   the right of the tunnel

It was impossible to move anywhere j>C your own free will, you just

went where ever you were pushed, there were elbows, arms and bodies

pressing into you from all sides.      I   was close to passing out but I

knew that if   I went down I would never get up again.

As I was pushed forwards I felt myself walking over thebodies        of two



                                                                a vv

people who must have been dead and crushed under foot.              I couldn’t

prevent it, I couldn't see them I could just feel them underfoot.

I must have been amongst the f ij-st^ to_ cgj|fte^througj-> jtti# ^ t e ^ t hat was

opened and into the tunnel.

I did not see any barriers break and I did/riot know any had until I

read it in the newspapers.

I was gradually separated from              /fnd          inside the pen,

and          had got separated from us inside the tunnel.

The last I heard fromj              un'yrl we found him in

the Royal Hospital / ater was piirn saying that he couldn’t breath from

somewhere behind nut.          I cou/dn’t even turn to see him. I could see

people suffering around roe and I saw 6 or 7 people go down and not come

back up again.  Ij did riot see any of them again at all so I cannot say

if they died but iL^eel certain that they did because there is no way

that they could ever have got up again.Someone shouted to help a girl

behind me     butI couldn’t even turn to do anything,          I was jammed solid.

In the HOP if    anyone faints we just lift them up and pass then

overhead forwards.        We all sing, we want a stretcher, the St Johns

Ambulance come and we pass them over.              It was so packed that we just

couldn’t do anything, the people were just going down to the ground.                  I

wouldn't be able to describe the people that went down because I was

trying tostay calm because           I was fighting to breath and I had to stay

calm.   If    I’dhad an angina attack I knew that I ’d be dead so I           was

just concentrating on breathing and staying alive.             I know that I saw

one girl go down.        She had brown hair and was 18 or 19 yeas old.          She

was not wearing glasses.          I can’t say what she was wearing or how tall

she was.I saw the fella just next to me go down, he was about 25 but




climbed over the front.          nee a n y p u t him back into the pen through the

       front gate.    I couldn't believe it, I nearly gave up hope at that point.

       It was just about that time that the match was stopped.            The policeman

       was bald and had glasses.I remember seeing later that the game was

       stopped and 1 saw police offic/tls telling everyone to move back from

       the fence.    I saw a police ofiticer open the gate and start trying to

       get people o u t .People werej/trying to get out but they couldn’t because

       the gate was so narrow it was a bottle neck.            People were jammed

       against it and there was no space for people to maneovre to line

       themselves up to get    out.   There was a delay between       the gate being

       opened and the first    person gett^TlKj^ out.

       I can’t remember too    much about the next few minutes        but I remember

«. '
        indng myself further up /fearer to the tunnel entrance.

       A fellow called                  who I’ve seen at matches dragged me to

       the top of the pen/and I realised that I was free, there was no

       pushing.—    I (H*rrned
                        Z P to face the pitch and I saw all of the mayhem and
       I couldn’t face it, I was feeling bad and I was worried about my

       angina so I went into the tunnel where I saw people sjL^ggering around.

       I came across a man who was unconscious in the tunnel about half way

       along on my left as I was going towards the cojafrt yard.          I managed to

       drag him out into the court yard.       I tried J f a   revive him using jnouth

       to mouth resusitation as I found that he -hasn’t breathing.           He had

       no pulse so I tried cardiac massage, f j s r     10 minutes I worked on him

       but I realised that he was dead a n d JL \hat he was not going to revive.

       I moved on to another guy who was /lying in the recovery position.              He

       had a pulse and was breathing byt was unconsious so I stayed with him.

       It was about ten minutes befo/e he came around and I stayed with him

       until he was well e n o u g h T o sit up and talk.      I remember that he was

       thanking me for staying with him and he was chuffed that his money

       was still in his pocket.

       On the way out of the pen I remember seeing glases, money and wallets
                                                                                  PAGE

         everywhere.     I did not see anyone trying to take anything.        Everyone

         was concerned with helping everyone else.         If I had seen anyone

         looting I would describe them to you in great detail but as far as I

         am concerned nothing like that occurred.

         I stayed with that guy who came around until he was well enough to sit

         in the ambulance queue.       He said his name wai         and he was from

         WALTON.    I was with him for 3/4 of an hour or so.

         I left the ground at about 5pm (17QQ) of my own accord as I was

         trying to find out what had happend to my mates.

         I wandered around in shock for some time and it took me over an hour

         to find the car.     I met up with them at the car except for                   We

         searched for him and went to the general hospital but eventually we

         received information that he was at the Roy al so we went there and

         checked that he was alright.

         One of the    neighbours near to the parked ca^r/let us use the phone        to

         phone home    to let people know that we w e r j / okay.

         I received    no injuries except for brui/ifng a nd 1 finally got home

         after midnight.

After    the briefing at H i l l s b o r o u g h Stad i u m we made              our way to our

point and at about            1.145 hours      placed the       barriers across             the m o u t h of

the    road.



At this time there were               persons who were          obv i o u s l y a t t e n d i n g    the m atch

in Leppi n g s Ln but they were well                  behaved an d not         large      in numbers.



N e i t h e r myself      nor PC Roberts       had a radio an d to the best of my

knowledg e      only PS W i l s o n had a radio w i t h i n our serial.                      By about

1230 hours         large    numbers    of persons were walk i n g down Leppi n g s Ln

towards    the stadium.            At this     time     it was a p p arent         that     large amounts

of alcohol         were    being   consumed.          I saw man y      persons       carrying         bags,

packs an d bottles           of alcohol.         It was a sight           that     caused me to feel

uneasy.         I w ould not       like to estimate        the     number      of people who were

drinking       from 2 ltr bottles as well as               carrying         other full         ones w i t h

them.       I w o u l d say that       from where       I was    standing        to the stadium gate

wo u l d have      been a walk      of only 3 to 4 minutes,               which      in my view meant

that    unless      they were      going    to surrender        the drink at the stadium

gates,    people were         going to consume vast amou n t s               of alcohol             in a very

short    space of time and at              this time     I feared for what may ensue,

a l t h o u g h the scale     of what was to follow did not                   cross my mind.



Some    of the crowd began to drift               back from the stadium a n d                   I recall

being a s k e d for dire c t i o n s       to pubs and     clubs nearby,            m any of those who

a s k e d for directions a l r e a d y smelled s t r ongly of alcohol a n d some were

w a r n e d that    should they drink any more they w o u l d most                      likely be

refused a d m i s s i o n to the game.



One g ro up in p articular            stands    out    in my min d having a s k e d for

directions         to the    “C lub that     put on scran an d beer for us                    last t i m e ’ .

Le p p i n g s Ln by this       time was a mass        of p e r s o n s,    no doubt m ost    had

tickets      but many had not and kept asking me                    if I knew where         they could

get one and sales of tickets we re o b v i o u s l y taking                     place wit h   large

crowds quickly g a thering a r o u n d anyone who had tickets                        for sale.



a n d the    lady from the house           came out to us to tell               us that    in the    past

she had had problems              w i t h persons u r i nating

repeated complaints            to us about      this occurring.               Bot h myself an d PC

Robe r t s   turned from our          point   to w a t c h for any such occurr e n c e s           but

did not      see this happening.



By 2 . 0 0 p m    (1400)    Leppings     Ln was full and the                  wall   of the house Ihave

just    referred to was            full of    people drinking         from      cans/bottles like

alcohol      was    going out     of fashion,       as was    the

opposite.



Some    time just after 2 . 0 0 p m        (1400)    I was    detai l e d by a Chief

I n s o e c t o r , who   I did not know,      to go and stand

behind the         lady's    garden to stop persons           ur i nat i ng                      ihat I

have a l r e a d y mentioned.



I did feel         that    this was    un n e c e s s a r y because w i t h the sheer      volume        of

persons,         many,    many of w h o m were well       intoxicated,         a PC on his own was

v ulnerable and a g a i n even more            so without a radio and the                 crowds were

so m a s s e d that had an officer            got   into trouble           no one w o u l d have    been

able    to see the fact and            react accordingly.             What      further made       this

exercise         seem pointless was that the            lady who was          doing all    the

complaining must            have had to have        been w a t c h i n g    from her   roof top,

because had an y o n e been urinating                                 they w o u l d have     had

their        back to her house an d were s h i elded from her house wind o w s                          by




Du r i n g    the time to now the only               contact we had was        superv i s o r y

o fficers       paying what          visits    they could and having a quick               chat.         At

what     I w o u l d estimate         to be    perhaps 2.3 0      (1430?   to 2.35    (1435)_ there

was a lull           in the    crowds a n d I left the                       and    reformed PC

Robe r t s     in F a r ndale Rd.



At about 2. 4 5 p m          (1445) L e p p i n g s Ln b e came    sheer   hell    as hoards       of

drun k e n m i n d l e s s    "fans*      a r i v e d f rom nowhere   heading for the L e p p i n g s

L n end of the ground.                    There   is no doubt      in my min d that        of the

perhaps 2-3 t h o usand              people who a p p e a r e d from nowhere,        90 per       cent

were    drunk and well              so.      I did not have a radio and could not advise

Gro u n d Control        of the a p p r o a c h of these fans.



The    crowds who were              now filling     the area were        truly unruly and

behaving        in a disgraceful             manner,   when    I tried to w arn several            persons

as to their state,              the s t a n d a r d reply was      "Fuck off"      and had an arrest

tried to be made              I have      no doubt a serious          public order    sit u a t i o n

w o u l d have arisen.



Du r i n g    this    period     I do h o n estly feel        that the officers       in L e p p i n g s Ln

were at great           risk from the mob who were filling the                     road.



Some     of the elderly             people    from F a r ndale Rd were      standing       behind the

barriers watch i n g           the mob and their          comments were      of disgust       that so

called football              fans    could behave      in such a manner.            The general

behaviour of these               people made me feel a s h a m e d to think           that should

they follow their              team a b r o a d we may all        in E n g l a n d be judged by their

acti o n s and behaviour.

At kick         off time    the       road was still a mass of people                but we had been

    in struc ted to take meals            in ones at this time so PC Robe r t s                set    off

    for C l a y w h e e l s Ln to have      his ,meal.         He had been gone some 5 minutes

w h e n several         transit       loads of officers went along L e p pings Ln towards

    the gro und and PC Roberts              reappeared.             I a s k e d him why he had come
                                  -            ■■   ---



back and he was under the                   impression that           there was a fight at the

ground.           We stayed at out           point as some           Inspector    had told PC R o b e r t s

to do s o .



S h o r t l y after      this an elde r l y         resident       of the are a   came to us and told

us that         she had just          heard on the         radio    that someone had been killed

at the ground.



The      next    thing    I saw was       eme r g e n c y service      vehicles     of all    types

heading         into L e p p i n g s Ln towards           the ground.      W i t h the    lack of

communications,            it was a case of follow the                  last order       so PC Roberts

and myself            stayed on our       point.          The old lady then        r eappeared and

s aid that she had just                 put her TV on and that            several     people were        dead

in what         she thought       had been a pitch            invasion.



    It was   then that      people       began to walk u p L e p pings Ln away from the

g round      in mass      numbers and        some of them at first            stopped to tell           us

what      had happened.               But wi t h i n a few minutes        of this     the moo d of the

    crowd had become very aggressive.                        Both of us were spit          upon and

v e r b a l l y abused,     some w a n t e d to fight w i t h us but              commonsense       d i c tated

that we stood our ground a n d prevented them from entering                                  the side

    roads.       Of    those who       spit an d ab u s e d us we did not answer              but    tried

to assist         the genuine          fans who were         shocked and want i n g       to ring home
                                                                                                      PAGE         6

to    inform the         relatives      that    they were       safe.



It must        have    cost the      residents       of F a r n d a l e Rd a considerable amount

of m o n e y    in allow i n g      gen u i n e l y w o r r i e d fans    the use of their          phones.



At one     stage we had to             let a ma n and his wife who was                  pregnant      into

F a r n d a l e Rd and      into one of the houses              because       the m i n dless      drunks    had

re cogni sed that           they were        locals with the shopping               they were       carrying

and were       badly abus i n g        them.



Although        I had     reservations at the earlier                    stage of the day          I felt as

the    crowd left the ground that we were at any time                               likely to be

assaulted.



The worst        part of the departing               crowd for me was whe n a man                  came   to me

and said he had not been able                     to find his young            son.      I had to tell

him that        I had no radio and             could not d i r e c t l y assist         him   in

contacting        the ground,          he was at first and u n d e r s t a n d a b l y abus i v e           but

then a p o l o g i s e d and was at           crying    point.           F o r t u n a t e l y there was a dog

van over       the     road and      I took him to this for help via the                      radio.



I cannot        pass     comment on the following               points       because    I did not see or

take    part     in them.



1.     The actions           of the stewards,           or the actual           incident an d       rescue

       us no      c o m munications at all.

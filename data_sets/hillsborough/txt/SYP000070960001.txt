              At 0845 hours,      Saturday 15th April                1989 (150489),           I attended Woodseats

              In company w j/lh other officers                 I was     conveyed to the / o o t b a 11 ground

              and inforgred 1 would be working on the Spion Kop ijfi Serial 7.                                  Pol S*g'

              instructions were to Police fairly but firmly we made our way to the

              S pi on Kop.



              At approximately 1130 hours,                 the two Serials working                inside this       part

              of the ground were briefed further by Superintendent GREENWOOD,

Inspector C A L V E R T , S e r g e a n t B ATTY               and S e r g e a n t     MARPLES.         Serial         1 was

to be      present         in the        m a i n body of the S p i o n Kop to

observe          public order            and as a back           up unit       to the other             serial who

w o u l d form a barrier                 on a wing        of the S p i o n Kop s eparating                     the

majority          of s upporters             being    from N o t t i n g h a m    from any L i verpo ol

s u p p o r t e r s w h i c h may       have    tickets        for    that     side     of the       ground.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1415 hours,           the s e g r e g a t e d wing          of Liverpool

supp o r t e r s w h i c h      numbered about 200 to 300 was                          being v i r b a l l y ab u s e d

by a number             of N o t t i n g h a m s u pporters and             the serial          I was w o r k i n g      in

jo i n e d the      barrier as           officers were           ejecting         some       supporters.              Shortly

before      the kick           off N o t t i n g h a m   suppo r t e r s     were      pre s s u r i s i n g    the

barrier which             remained           stable and about 5 minutes                     after      kick      off    they

became more a g i t a t e d w h e n             it a p p e a r e d    that Liverpool             supporters            at the

Le p p i n g s    LN end of the              ground were        invading         the    pitch.         W hen     it was

evident          that      suppo r t e r s at       the L e p p i n g s LN erid        of    the ground were

seriously          injured        the    pressure        eased.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1545 hours,          man y L i v e r p o o l     s u pporters        on the S p i o n

Kop    e x p ressed       their w i s h        to    leave     the gr o u n d and           I escorted          two

batches          of s upporters          to the       exit     gate.        About      15 minu t e s       later       the

m a t c h was      o f f i c i a l l y a b a n d o n e d and    the    two serials            on the S p i o n Kop

cleared the             terraces        of   supporters.             When    this was         f i n a l i s e d we were

on s tand by until                the    serials were           stood       down at         1830 hours.



I was      conveyed back             to W o o d s e a t s Pol S t n and           concluded my duty at                    1700

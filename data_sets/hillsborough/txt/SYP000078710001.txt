                  in the vicinity of Sto ck po rt                    the sheer       v o 1ume of f o o t b a l 1 traffic and

                  about     1 hour      in time.        My son had obtained 2 tickets                     for me,        one of

                  which     I gave      to                 I.       The    tickets were       for   the S pion Kop end and

                  cost £ 6 . 0 0 each.          We   parked the            car near a hospital           on a private

h ousing     estate     some     13 minutes walk            from the ground.               In order     to get

an entrance        point we wa lk ed along L ep pings Lane with the Liver pool

supporters.          We went        into a s m a l 1 shop owned              by an A sian man and

bought 2 cans of beer each                    in/the     shop at the same             time were    numerous

Liv er po ol   supporters who w^re                buying 2 and 3 four                packs   of beer a nd       I

heard    complaints          by s o m / o f    them that the Police                 had taken the       beer

off    the   buses    prior      X® the i r ar r ival         in Sheffield.            Having    left

the    shop we    saw a number          of s upporters            in Leppings Lane           consuming       cans

of beer.       This w a s /at about            1400 hrs.         F ro m this

point    to the ground           I saw numerous Police O ff ic er s at various                        points

along    the    route,       more    observing       the s upporters           than hearding       them to

the ground.          A lt ho u g h most were         keeping          the   supporters moving along.

I w o u ld d escribe         the general        a tmosphere           as happy.       It was a nice

sunny day and a lt ho u g h           there were         some     people      shouting,      it was more

high spirits         than aggression,             and I never say7 a ny fights                or drunk en es s

a nd we s u b s eq ue nt ly      passed the Leppings J'ane t urnstiles where                          the

Liv er po ol   s upporters were           going      into/Xhe          ground.      There was     quite a

crowd of       people    there as well as Jk number Police                          foot   patrols as well

as some m o u n t e d officers.               I h^d noticed just              prior    to the L ep pings

Lane    turnstiles,          more    in thy? Vere R oad a rea that                  there was a number

of ticket      touts     but t he yydidn't           seem to be doing any business.                     At     no

time at this end of t h a/ gr ou nd or the outside                            did    I notice any m at ch

stewards.        The only        nersons       in a u t h o r i t y    I saw were those Police

O fficers.       I s u bs e q u e nt l y made my way a r o u n d the ground to the

N o t t i n g h a m Forest    end.     It was       obvious      that       if the Liverpool       fans were

going    in at one end,             then the Forest           fans must        be using the other

end.     I spoke to a p o li c ewoman and a s k e d her w hi ch way to go,

went    th ro ug h the first          turnstile we saw.                 There was      no problem getting

into    the ground there were only one or two other                                 supporters    in front

of me.        I handed rny ticket             into the turnstile a ttendant and he

re tu rn ed my stub.              Once    inside       the ground     I was    unaware of w hich

d i r e ct i on to go to get to my match viewing                       point and bought a program

from a seller and a s ke d him to direct                        us,   but he was unable           to do so

stating,        "I'm just a programe               seller.’       I think he may have              been a

Nottingham         lad he      certainly didn't            have a local accent.              I cannot

recall      seeing any Police O ff icers                  in this are a       nor did I see any one

who was       i dentifiable as a Steward,                  as a result we just f ol lowed the

crowd up some steps,                I had     looked for some dir ec ti on             points     but    there

was    nothing.

At    no time at our           end of the ground was              I sub je ct ed to

any e xcessive           crush a l t h o u g h    I w o ul d say that at about 2 . 5 0            pm there

was a build up of              pressure       from behind and there was                 pushing and

shoving as the            late     comers     came      into^/ihe g ro un d and this         continued
                                                           /
until    at     least kick off           time.         Hav/ng   taken up my match viewing                point

w h i c h was     located to the          right o jf the Forest          goal,       in the d i r e c t i o n of

the N or th Stand and about m id w a y down the terrace                          itself      (Spion H o p ) ,

it was      immediately a pp arent               jjmat pens 3 and 4,          behind the Liverpool

goal    were      f i 1 1 ing u p , m uc h / o r e      rapidly than the other            pens.      In fact

by 2 .1 5     pm pen 4 was          packy d      and    pen 3 was also        very full,      whereas      in

the outer         pens    people     co^fld still move a bout            fairly unhindered.               To

clarify that          point       the Excessive          build up of fans was            in fact    in both

pens 3 and 4 from my v/ewing                      point    they   looked      like only      1 pen it was

the    pens     on either         side of these that were             fairly empty,          par ti cu la rl y

the    right      hand one as        I viewed the s i t u at io n and this               remained so even

up to kick off time a l t h o u g h the                  left hand area,        as    I viewed     it had

f il le d up somewhat.

As the whistle went                for   the start of the m a t c h           I saw Liverpool

s up po rt er s    over     the    fence of the touchline wall,                 a ct ua ll y on the

t r a c k b eh i n d the goal.           I commented that         I thought      it was a pitch

           climbing         the fence onto      the    pj^tfch from these            pens and also        some    being

           pulled up into the West S ^and a b o v e . I saw fans knocking                              the

          "-----------------
           S tand and the Sf>ion K o p . I began to consider that a serious sit ua t io n

          had a r i s e n, /p ut      I saw a line of Police O ff ic er s               formed across          the

           pitch and this           re inforced my view that                 it was a pitch invasion.

          Obviously          by this    time the m a t c h had been stopped and the                     players       had

           left      the    pitch and we      remained where we were hoping                    that e v en tu al ly

          the m a tc h w ould be         restarted.       We were           tota ll y unaware      that any

          t rag ed y had o cc urred even those that were                       being    carried on the

          stretchers         we    presumed had been injured,                 because    of the fighting

          amon gs t        themselves and something of that                   nature.     During all          this    time

          I was with I                      and we and all           the other Forest           fans    thought       it

          was a h oo ligan          problem,    the    result being           that   some of the Forest              fans

          began anti Liverpool               chants.     I remained where              I was    until about 3 .43

           pm when we         left the ground through a gate opened                      by a man.           Although       I

          w o u ld    point out that         he was unfamiliar with the keys                    he was       carrying

          as he had to visit 3 gates                  before he event ua ll y found a key to fit.

          Had there          been a rush of forest            fans     to    leave   the ground a problem

          w o ul d have arisen.             Even at    this     stage       it was still       believed to have

          been a hooli ga n element             in the Liverpool              section that was          responsible

           for stopping           the m a t c h as all   the Hot Dog           sellers    in the

          Forest area,            brought    their    carts     inside       the ground wall        for      protection

          when we          got back    to our   car we switched on the                 radio and       listened to

          the a nn ou n c e m e n t who stated that 5 people were dead at H i l l s b o r o u g h

          a nd that was           the first we knew about any tragedy and that was at about

          4 pm.        When we did       leave,      it was     entirely of our own accord,                   and not

           on the di re ct io n of the Police              or    loudspeaker.

             My views       on how the    incident was handled after            the match was s t o pp ed

              are   contained    in a letter         that   I sent to the Prime Minister         on     18.4.89

             and to reiterate are            that   there was a total        lack of    c om mu ncaiton for

                  11 concerned, police, stewards and both sets of fans.          Had the loud

             was going on, and          I have      no doubt   that   the Forest     fans would have        been

             silent a nd there w o ul d have             been no   chanting at the Liverpool          fans.

             The    co mmunications were          very    poor an d made a bad sit ua ti on worse.

             The most       important    factor,      X feel about     this whole      situation was      the

             al m os t   total abse nc e of       identifiable      stewards.    These    stewards     to me

             form control       of   large    crowds at all        times,   but at   no time   did I see

             a n y stewards     carrying our their           duties and had they been o pe rating

disturbance or whose presence is likely to create a disturbance - this covers
a wide range of activities contrary to ground regulations.

GATEMEN AND TURNSTILE OPERATORS

1.      Gatemen ?ud Turnstile Operators should report for duty no later than 2
        hours before kick-off, or eariior if-advioed . Anyone reporting after the
        stated time cannot be guaranteed a job.

2.      All exit gates should be manned at all times. If any gate is left
        unmanned at all, the entire staff covering the gate will be instantly
        dismissed.

3.      Turnstile Operators on cash turnstiles will be given a cash float and
        batch of tickets. Full details of the banking procedure will be given at
        the induction meeting before the start of the season, and this procedure
        should be followed at all times.. All cash banked should be counted and
        placed in the correct bags. Continual disregard of these procedures will
        result in dismissal.

        The float, and unsold tickets, should be returned to the Turnstile Office
        together with banking details.

4.      TUrnstile Operators on ticket only stiles should firstly check that the
        ticket they are accepting is a) for the correct match, and, b) for the
        correct area of the ground. The tickets should be sorted between season
        ticket vouchers, match tickets and (where applicable) shareholders

STEWARDS

1.   Stewards must wear their official waistcoat on duty at all times.   This
     will be allocated when you report for duty.

2.   Stewards must report for duty no later than 2 hours before kick-off time.
     Any steward reporting for duty after this time cannot be guaranteed a
     job. This provision may be subject to amendment in the event of major
     fixtures when prior notice will be given.

3.   Whilst every effort will be made to allocate you the same job throughout
     the season, you must carry out any alternative duty as directed by the
     Chief Steward, or his deputy or an official of the club.

4.   Stewards are reminded that they should remain on duty until the final
     whistle and until their area is clear. The practice of stewards leaving
     their positions before the final whistle will not be tolerated. Except in
     an emergency. Stewards should not leave their place of duty without
     consent of the Chief Steward or Senior Police Officer who should, if it is
     considered necessary, arrange for a replacement. At the end of the match,
     when your area is clear, you should report back to your Chief Steward to
     hand in your official waistcoat and receive your wages.

5.   STEWARDS WORKING IN STAND

     Stewards are responsible for ensuring spectators sit in correct seats (as
     shown on tickets) where this is not the case, they have a responsibility
     in the first instance for requesting them to do so, and only if there is a
     refusal should they contact the Police for assistance. Stewards are also
     responsible for ensuring that gangways and exits are kept clear.

     Stewards should prevent, as far as possible, standing on seats, and the
     climbing of fences and other structures. It stewards are unable to comply
     with this request due to the severity of the incident, they should report
     the matter without delay to the nearest Police Officer.

     Where more than one steward is on duty at the same gangway, one steward is
     to remain at the bottom of the steps until at least 10 minutes after
     kick-off, or until any 'rush' is over, to ensure that the spectator uses
     the correct gangway and remove any ticket stubs.

     No gangway steward is to sit down until at least 15 minutes after
     kick-off, and then only if there is a vacant seat on the end of a row in
     the immediate vicinity of the gangway - all other stewards must sit as
     close to their allocated position as possible at the end of a row. No
     more than two stewards may sit together.

     In the period leading up to half-time and at the end of the match it is
     imperative that no one stands in the gangways watching the match.

     Be aware of the location of fire fighting and medical equipment in the
     area for which they are reponsible and being capable of effectively
     operating the same. Familiarise yourself with all aspects of the Ground

         B efore the start o f next season I want you to arrange a Seminar for
stew ards and programme sellers so that they can be informed e x a c t l y o f their
duties.

              It is important that you draw up a list o f stew ards and their
r e sp e c t iv e duties, and sim ilarly with programme sellers. In the c a s e o f
programme sellers th e y must be instructed that this job is a selling job and
they must go out to our supporters to sell and make som e vocal contribution to
it. They must be str a te g ic a lly placed and their p erform ance monitored.

           Many o f the above requirem ents apply also to stew ards.

         Do you think it would be rewarding if other people such as our
turnstile operators w e r e also properly instructed along t h e se lines?




                                                                                                                      -jr

I am attending to the matter of stewards, as was the case last year, and
during a telephone conversation with the Chairman he wishes you to
organise such for the programme sellers.

C o u M you please make the necessary arrangements to organise an instructional
evening for turnstile operators and stewards similar to last year*

The response from both the Police and fire Services to that event was very
good and highlights the desire of S.W.F.C. to endeavour to provide a good
service and professional attitude towards their responsibilities.

We discussed such an event before the end of last season and it may be prudent
for you to liaise with Basil Jones (Tel.NoJ_                        and the
Riverside Suite as to the most suitable date.

Please retain a close liaison with                and/or myself re this event.

TO:   ALL MATCH DAY PERSONNEL         FROM:                             DATE:   7.5.87



One again I am writing to you all to thank you for your assistance during the
past season, in particular all those who made the semi-final the success it
was.

The season has not gone by without any "casualties" - persons dismissed for
various reasons - and club policy for next season will continue to be strictly
upheld.

It is intended to make a few alterations with regards to various aspects of
the ground and to fully explain them and to do the usual briefing of match day
staff, the following nights have been arranged

Gatemen
Turnstile operators                           6th August at 7.30 p.m.
Commissionaires
"sundry area" stewards
                                and

All other Stewards                            13th August at 7.30 p.m.

As before the briefing will be followed by a pie and pea supper and we would
like everyone to attend.

The stewards/gatemen passes for next season will be the same as last year but,
in addition, everyone will be issued with a security badge with a photo, which
must be worn at all times when on duty. An extra 50p is being paid to
everyone at next Saturday's game - would you please bring 2 photo's (from a
photo booth) with you to the briefing meeting.
MEETINGS OF STEWARDS, GATEMEN AND ANCILLIARY STAFF TOOK PLACE ON THURSDAY 6111
AUGUST AND THURSDAY 13TH AUGUST 1987, BOTH MEETINGS COMMENCED AT 7.30 P.M.


Members of staff were welcomed by Company Secretary, G.H. Mackrell who
introduced:

    i)   Station Officer Miles - South Yorkshire Fire Brigade
   ii)    inspector C. Calvert - South Yorkshire Police
  iii)   Duty Officer - Peter Wells, St. John Ambulance Brigade


Station Officer Miles: Slowed staff present how to extinguish a small fire
using the relevant fire extinguishers. A practical demonstration took place.
Bnphasis was placed on the point that stewards, gatemen etc. should only tackle
a minor fire, if in any doubt the Fire Brigade should be alerted at once.

Inspector Calvert: Went through the duties of stewards vis-a-vis members of the
general public. The emergency evacuation procedure was discussed and examined
in detail. Inspector Calvert answered questions from the floor regarding the
responsibility of stewards in the event of crowd misbehaviour. It was
emphasised that crowd control was the responsibility of the police. In addition
it was pointed out that the division of responsibilities was clearly set out in
the instructions for Matchday Staff.

Duty Officer Wells: Gave a demonstration of basic first aid designed to assist
in the resucitation of spectators, it was emphasised that if at all possible
trained members of the S.J.A.B. should be called to assist.

Doug Lock: Went through "instructions to Matchday Staff" and emphasised the
need to report for duty on time.


Graham Mackrell then closed the formal part of the meeting and thanked all those
present for attending.

                            GOLD MINS BINGO




       Bingo and soccer were made for each other. Both, are enjoyed by
millions regularly each week; both have become an integral part of the
British way of life; and both, one as a past-time, the other as a sport,
have achieved the status of national institution.
       But, for the purposes of Gold Mine Bingo, they have an even more
important common ingredient that has so far been overlooked: the number 90»
       In bingo, the game 'is-,played with 90 numbers. In soccer, the game is
played for 90 minutes.
       Marry them together and 90 could become a number with six figures.
       Soccer is the mate that bingo has long been waiting for. Why?     The
huge     success of bingo has always been blighted by the problem of how to
produce numbers in a purely random, unbiased way. The history of bingo
is littered with stories of clever cheats, of dishonest callers, of
manipulated numbers, of newspaper cards that can never win. This type of bad
 publicity has tended to undermine the public's confidence in the game and
to stifle its growth.
       Gold Mine Bingo has overcome this problem at a stroke.
       Gold Mine Bingo is cheat proof. The winning numbers will not pop
up on plastic table tennis balls. They will not be spewed from a computer.
And they will not be plucked from the air.
       The winning numbers will be the times of the goals scored every
Saturday in the Football League.
       The system has been checked and cannot fail. Every Saturday, between
50 and 70 goals are scored in the four Football League    divisions. This is
more than adequate to provide the numbers required for a bingo game.
       And who is the final arbiter of these numbers? Who decides if a certain
goal was scored in the l?th or 18th minute? The Sunday Mirror, of course.
Or the Daily Mirror on a Monday morning. The millions who clamour for a chance
to play this new game will have to buy a certain newspaper to check their
results. Gold Mine Bingo is a circulation winner as well.
       There are a number of ways that the game can be operated. For
eample, cards - bingo type cards with three lin;s and five numbers on each
line - could be given away with every single copy of the Daily Mirror. On
Sunday, the players would have to buy the Sunda.y Mirror ( or The People) to
check their   six cards against the score times. There could be exceptionally
large prizes for a full house ( accountants will agree that the odds for
the organisers are almost twice as good compared to pools coupons) and various
smaller prizes for correct lines, triangles etc.

                                   mf
        Alternatively, the Gold Mine Bingo managment may decide to borrow
     if
the ‘Spools11 element. And this could be an even more successful venture.
      Using this second method, the housewives and football fans from all
over the country will be invited to fill in their own blank forms in much
the same way as they .now mark their 1,2,X on the pools coupon. They will be
required to pick any 15 numbers ( repeat numbers being void) which they hope
will correspond with the first 15 goals scored on any particular Saturday.
      In addition, this second method will circumvent the gambling laws ( laws,
as Derk Jameson proved, would never be applied to people apparantly     giving
money away) Because cho sing, say, the time that Arsenal are likely to score
a goal will offer plenty of scope for skill and calculation.
      There is even the possibility that Gold Mine Bingo, operated on the
blank card basis, could devastate the pools companies. Cards could be
handled by bookmakers and corner shops. They will be simpler than pools forms,
easier to fill in, and will certainly offer the possibility of larger prizes.
A £1,060,000 winner every week is feasable.
       Whichever way the new game is played, Mirror Group Newspapers cannot
fail to win. At the worst, their circulation will soar. And there is every
possibility that the game could grow to become the company's most successful
enterprise.
      If launched with enough force and verve, if operated skillfully and
professionally, if, in effect, given the Maxwell touch, GOld Mine Bingo is
destined to become the sensation of the $0s. And 90, after all, is the
magic number.1

You wrote to Lord Justice Stocker on 7 March and will be now have
received a reply from his clerk, dated 14 March, informing you
that your previous correspondence has been forwarded to Lord
Justice Taylor.

Lord Justice Taylor has now seen your letters of 18 February and 7
March to Lord Justice Stocker. He has, as you know, already seen
your letter to him of 5 February.

Lord Justice Taylor regrets that he will not be able to see you
himself. He suggests that if you would like to take forward your
ideas about financing of football ground improvements, you should
write to the Football League about them.

Dear Mr
Thank you for your letter of 5 February 1990.
The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry office
has now closed, but I will ensure that Lord
Justice Taylor sees your letter.
                            Yours sincerely




                            R M WHALLEY
                       Secretary to the Inquiry
                   Sir,
                            I have had an odd meeting today when the Court 6
                   Usher asked if I would speak with a man who had been
                   sitting in your court, and who wished to see you.        The
                   man turned out to be                 !! •
                            You will recall you sentenced him to
                   for                 during one of your sittings at the
                   Old Bailey.    He was released I   |years ago (I think
                   he said) and has had a "rough time" over the last 4 years
                            One of his memories when you sentenced him was
                   your words "if you could channel your obvious
                   organisational talents to something legitimate you could
                   not fail to be a success".
                            What he would like to do is meet Taylor LJ to
                   discuss a scheme he has planned for the Football League
                   to adopt in order to finance football ground improvements
                   An outline of this scheme is attached.      I think he wants
                   to use you to effect an introduction to Taylor LJ.
                            I said that it was not possible for him to meet
                   you, or Taylor LJ, personally, but that if he cared
                   to write a letter I was sure you would find time to
                   consider it.    I also suggested that I thought his best
                   plan would be to have a word with his local MP (
                   did not seem to have much faith in his MP !).
                            This note is only to put you"on notice" and for
                   me to say what happened whilst I remembered the
                   conversation.

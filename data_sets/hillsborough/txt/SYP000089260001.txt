           I am a Detectiv.e C o n s t a b l e   in the South Y.ot>Kshi re Poli ce presently

           stationed at Hammer                d PStn, Hi 1 lsboro.ugK» Sheffield.

           I have eight and a half years service and during this time I have

           policed a large number of football matches at Hillsborough in both

           uniform and plain clothes.                Whilst in uniform the majority of my

           duties at Hillsborough were at the Leppings Ln end involved in various

           duties including coach reception,                    turnstiles and general       public order

           patrols.      I worked last year's jfeirti final at Hillsborough between the

           Liverpool and Nottingham clubs in plain clothes and experienced no

           problems.        I have always prided myself on the positive and well                     run

           policing operations at Hillsborough which, without doubt, made it one

           of the best grounds in the country for football fans to attend and

           enjoy a trouble free match.

At 8.30am 0830 on Saturday 15            1989 150489 I signed on duty at

Hammerton Rd P S t ^ C I D office.
                                My duty at the match was to          in plain „

Inspector TOwELL on the pick-pockaft s q u a d , this tour of duty was to

commence at 9.00am 0900.      This squad had been set up in an effort to

identify and catch persons,      believed travelling Liverpool fans, who

were responsible for pick-pocket offences.       There were a large number       ^

of complaints from supporters at the previous semi final        in 1988

000088 relating to pick-pocket offences.

On arrival at the station I was informed that a prisoner I had

circulated as wanted had been arrested and required interviewing.           I

liaised with the Custody Officer and Detective Inspector TOWELL, after
                              C — pna^bn,<2<p,
which I attended the match briefing^at Hillsborough with other CID

officers.    The briefing was much the same as the previous year with no             ,

significant alterations.      After the briefing I returned directly to

Hammerton Rd PStn and dealt with my prisoner      completing my dealing

with him at 1.30pm 1330 the same date, after which I walked alone to

Hillsborough football ground intending to meet up with Detective

Inspector TOWELL, Detective Sergeant MCSLOY and other CID personnel

working the pick pocket operation.

The walk to the ground along Middlewood Rd and down L e p p i n g s L n went

peacefully enough but I noticed a large queue of fans outside

Threshers Off Licence near Hillsborough corner on Middlewood Rd and as „

I continued up the road, although there was a good Police presence

along the route,    there were a large number of fans I passed and

observed in the Park carrying and drinking from beer cans,        usually

they were in possession of packs of four cans, they were all good

natured and no signs of trouble was apparent.  In Hi 1lsboramgh Park
                                                        C. — bczbcisj to o C 1
nearer to the Leppings Ln end I did see half a dozen fans urj^aXing in

full view of the public,     obviously well the worse for drink.     It was
                                                                      PAGE        3^
                                                                      S3352

hard to determine from which City was they hailed.

I continued down Leppirjrf^Ln and met up with Detective Inspector

TOWELL, Detective Sergeant MCSLOY an 0 other Officers, namely Detective
               {o lS U             5®TS/        S
Cons tab le^/ftALLAM, LOCK lyWG, LAWREja&E and LIL L g ¥ . I moved into a

position near the gates to the/Zurnsti1es where, with the other

Officers,   I kept in close contact with Detective Constable HALLAM who

was stood alone with a large wallet    in his rear trouser pocket acting

as bait for the pick-pockets who we expected U      be in the area.       I

would estimate that the time would be 1.5Q#m 1350.      The crowd in the

Leppings Ln area at this time appeared orderly and Officers on duty

were managing to Police the situation effectively.

As time went by, the crowd gradually grew in density within the

turnstile area and up to the roadway.     The mounted/fafficers
                                                          ------ were doing
everything possible to keep the crowd moving,     so much so that myself

and other plain clothes Officers were moved on repeatedly.

Nevertheless,   the situation was still orderly at this time.     I moved

into a position inside the small    protected area caused by the ground

gates being in the fully open position,    from where   I could clearly see

Detective Constable HALLAM and not get moved about by the crowd.

Whilst stood in this position I recall being pushed and watching three             ;

Liverpool fans urinate up the dividing fencing between those fans

queuing for the West Stand and those for the Leppings Ln end.         I would      ,

estimate that the time wguld be 2.2Q4$m^1420 at this time and I thought

this   is getting a bi^/congested and I moved from this position to

outside the gates.    From this point onwards the situation outside           the „

ground seemed to steadily increase in intensity and deteriorate.              I

was repeatedly asMl?d by Liverpool frans if I had tickets fgr s a l e .       I

then witnessed fans walking towards me with their tickets      in their

hands in readiness to enter the ground when o t h e r ,Liverpool fans moved

up to them and snatched the tickets out of their hands which resulted
                                                                      PAGE         4
                                                                      83352

in a confrontation after which the tickets were returned.         The time

now would be approximately g.2         425 and after talking to Detective

Constable HALLAM I voiced the opinion th           ; operation regarding

pick-pockets was impossible in such a de           'owd and we withdrew to a

position where the broken white line is marked on Leppings Ln prior to

entering the ground area.      On standing there and watching the

situation it was obvious that we had problems regarding the crowd

control.        ■        ...       .   ■ ~     , were proving ineffective

and were having difficulty in moving     in the crowd.    We were joined by            ~

Detective Sergeant MCSLOY and other Officers, after which Detective

Sergeant MCSLOY mentioned two persons whom he suspected of being

involved in pick-pocket offences.      Together with Detective Sergeant

MCSLOY and Detective Constable LOCKING I walked along Leppings Ln

towards Wadsley Bridge    in an effort to locate the two suspects.         As we

moved along the road there were a large number of fans walking towards

the ground, many were drinking from cans and they all appeared merry

and in good spirits and quite orderly.        We turned at Law Brothers

garage and walked back towards the ground amongst a constant stream of

Liverpool supporters who filled half of the roadway as well as the

footpath.    I was asked about tickets all along the return journey to

the ground, always the same "Have you any tickets for the game?"

always delivered in a scouse accent.

As we approached the ground I heard ayrfren f rom behind and on looking

round I saw the Police short wheely^oased Land Rover approaching with

its headlights illuminated.     The Land Rover pulled up outside the

Leppings Ln end facing into the crowd.        Myself, Detective Sergeant

MCSLOY and Detective Constable LOCKING w                     earby.   The

occupant    in the vehicle was Police Const                  W*   Police

Constable BUXTON alighted from the vehicle and delivered a message

over the PA s       ■ attached to the vehicle requesting the Liverpool

                                                                                     S3352

           fans to move back and stop crushing at the front.          This was repeated

           numerous times and appeared to have no effect whatsoever on the crowd.              ,

           At this time 1 remember stopping an elderly man who passed me as I

           stood beside the Land Rover telling him to stay out and not to go any

           further into the crowd,       trying to get into the ground,   he just looked

           at me and carried on pushing into the crowd in front of me.             The time

           now would be about 2.4opm 1443.        The mounted Police Officers were hard

           pressed to jatay on their horses.       The PA system was later taken over

           by an I n j e c t o r who repeated the message Police Constable B-UXTON had

           been saj/ing.       At this time I also recall seeing Chief^Jmspector

           CREAjfeR from South Yorkshire beside the Land Rover.

           The situation was by now desperate with fans climbing onto the tops of

           the turnstiles and then pulling up others to escape the crushing

           below.     Still    large contingents of supporters   continued to arrive at

           the ground in large numbers and continued to swell the crowd outside

           the ground.        Some had the good sense to walk over the road and stand

           on the footpath but these numbered only a few dozen,         the rest

           continued to try to get into the ground.        It was also apparent that

           not all had tickets for the match as myself and other plain clothes

           Officers    continued to be asked had we tickets for the match.         The time

           now would be nearing the kick-off and the situation outside the ground

           at Leppings Ln was serious.        Detective Sergeant MCSLOY decided that

           we would be better utilised elsewhere and we made our way via Vere Rd

           to the gymn^^ium.        As we walked down Vere Rd a large cheer went up

           from the ground and fans in Vere Rd began to run passed us towards

           the Leppings Ln end of the ground.        On arrival at the gym I got

           something to eat and sat down with other CID officers          inside the gym.

           Almost as soon as I had sat down reports began to come into the gym

           that people had been killed inside the ground after which the f^/lTt*

-io       < body arrived in the gym, which was a yoiing/ijoy.       I was ordered with

         I began to check the boy for jt'fiy signs of life and almost immediately

         I was surrounded by uniforirrOfficers who were all bringing people who

         were dead and injured into the gym area.   From then on I was involved

         in the laying out of the deceased and looking after their personal

         effects and later making the bodies   presentable for identification and

         actually participating   in some of the identifications by relatives and

         friends.

Dear Colin

Enclosed are two copies of letters to the Football League and the Football
Association.
As you will see, the Tidy Britain Group are very disappointed with the
level of support they are offering to continue a project which could have
been a great success story for footbal 1.
I am sure you will share our disappointment and would be grateful for any
help you can give to our attempt to "blow the whistle on litter" in and
around football grounds.
Yours sincerely



Professor Graham Ashworth
Pi rector General

Dear Mr Kelly


I was very disappointed to learn that the Football League Management
Committee and the Football Association Executive Committee have offered
only £4,000 to continue the research project which the Tidy Britain Group
is operating on your behalf.

As you know, this project began twelve months ago with £6,000 from the
Football Association and the Football Trust. The Tidy Britain Group have
therefore, taking into account staff costs, administration and back-up,
travel etc, supported the project to the tune of at least £20,000 over the
year.

Originally envisaged as lasting for one year only, the project's aims have
altered following two important developments. First, Lord Justice Taylor’s
Report identified squalor in- and around football clubs as a cause of "bad
manners and poor behaviour" and notes its "disagreeable effect on the local
community".   Extension of the project would have enabled the Group to
provide valuable input into the recently established Advisory Design
Council to begin to remedy these problems.

Secondly, the Environmental Protection Bill will enable local authorities
to enforce a duty on football clubs to clean the area around grounds -
often within three hours of littering occurring. Clubs will be responsible
for the cost of this.

In addition, it must be said the Group have been continually delayed by a
lack of co-operation from both the Football League and Football
Association. Instances where we have been promised responses within days
and have then been unable to contact the individuals concerned for weeks
have been common.

The Tidy Britain Group feels strongly that these developments necessitated
further research and experiments during the coming season in order that
clubs are prepared for the new legislation in 1991. We therefore prepared
a budget for extending the project for a further year. As a charity we are
unable to continue our previous level of financial support any longer.

It seems    a shame that, at a time when English football is generating so
much bad    publicity, you have not seen fit to support more fully such a
positive   initiative. I would be very grateful if you could reconsider your
offer in   the light of the above.

Yours sincerely,



Professor Graham Ashworth

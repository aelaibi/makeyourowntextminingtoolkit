Re: Hillsborough

Further to our recent telephone conversation.

I attach for your use a complete set of the papers (minus videos)
that have been forwarded by Paul Pugh from the Home Office.

These have been acknowledged and steps are being taken to arrange
the meeting that he refers to in the final paragraph of his
letter.

These papers will be brought to George Croston's attention,
though this might not be until shortly before your video link
conference, and to Peter's upon his return to the office.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can assist further.

      Dear Sir,

                                            Re: HILLSBOROUGH

      In Peter Pearson's absence I acknowledge receipt of your letter
      dated 10 February 1997 together with enclosures.

      We share your view that a meeting would be beneficial and am
      content for this to be organised through your office.

      Notwithstanding the possible problem of finding a free day I
      think our only immediate caveat would be the actual timing of the
      meeting so as to enable us to undertake the journey down from
      York.

      Peter's secretary can be contacted on 01904                                         456670 once your
      secretary has any potential dates in mind.


      Yours faithfully

HILLSBOROUGH

Stephen Wooler in the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers has spoken to me about
your interest in the recent representations concerning the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, I requested from the South Yorkshire Police a full report on the matters
which were raised in the television programme before Christmas. I have now
received that report, and I am enclosing copies of all the material which the Chief
Constable has sent to me. Stephen Wooler asked me to send you a copy directly.

I have suggested to Stephen Wooler that we should aim to meet to discuss the next
steps in handling this material at the beginning of March. I assume that you will wish
to attend that discussion. If you agree, I will ask my secretary to arrange a provisional
date.

Hillsborough Inquiry.

The enquiry centres on letters received from representatives of bereaved families in Merseyside,
addressed to the Director in London, asking her to re-open the inquests in this case.

The trigger for the letters was evidently Granada's recent drama documentary "Hillsborough" and
the Director has, for some reason, forwarded the letters to your Region.

Your Central Casework Unit has written to our Constable Ken Greenway asking him to forward a
video tape of the programme and then for us to give a briefing to your office about what, if anything,
the programme might have added in the way of material facts not placed before the courts
previously. I am unsure about the locus of your office in this matter but want to be as helpful as I
possibly can. As a token of this approach, we have already sent a copy of the videoed drama
documentary so that your Central Casework Unit can review it.

However, before taking the matter any further with your staff, I would like to up-date you on the
fact that we have done a very comprehensive briefing for the Home Office on exactly the same
subject. We have invested a tremendous amount of time and effort in answering 10 questions
forwarded through Labour MPs in Merseyside and Sheffield by the Home Office to us, designed to
flush-out the precise point of whether or not there is any new material.

I am loath to repeat the exercise for your office when the logical link would be between the
Director's Office and the Home Office, centrally.

The current state of affairs is that we have reviewed the broadcast with a fine tooth comb and have
answered each of the 10 questions in the fullest way possible, rather than taking a minimalist
approach of simply referring the enquirers to lines and paragraphs in, for example, the Taylor Inquiry
transcript, or that of the Coroner's Inquest, or the Judicial Review upon it. It is our firm view that
there is absolutely no material new in the broadcast which has not been placed before the Taylor
Inquiry, the Inquest, or the Judicial Review, and that will be my advice to the Home Secretary.

What I now propose to do is to conclude our preparation of the response to the 10 questions by the
end of next week (31 January) and send them to the Home Office. I propose also to include in that
bundle a copy of your letter and this reply, so that the Home Office may make contact with the
Director and seek her views on the best way forward.

I am also copying this letter to Donald Adams, our Chief Crown Prosecutor, for his interest.

          HILLSBOROUGH

          We spoke yesterday afternoon about the Parliamentaiy correspondence the
          CPS has received, based on the letter circulated by the Hillsborough Family
          Support Group to all Members of Parliament. We agreed that this would need
          careful and co-ordinated handling.

          The Home Office and LSLO have each received extensive correspondence from
          families affected by the Hillsborough disaster which have hitherto focused
          either on demands for a fresh public inquiry or the reopening of the inquest,
          of both. Our line has been to draw on what the Home Secretary said in the
          House of Commons on 17 December 1996 when responding to an adjournment
          debate. He made the point that any decisions which have to be taken must be
          on the basis of consideration of all the relevant facts and underlying evidence,
          rather than simply on the basis of the television programme itself. He also
          said that In particular the Home Office would consider whether there is any
          new evidence, and If so, whether that evidence is of such significance that had
          it been put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome of the
          Taylor Inquiry or the verdict of the juiy would have been different,

          I enclose a specimen of a typical letter which we have written. We do not, at
          present, consider that anything in the programme materially affects the
          applications which the Attorney General has already considered under Section
          13 of the Crimes Act 1988, but have in place arrangements so that we are
          informed of any new evidence which can then be considered.

         The correspondence from HFSG opens a new angle on this by calling on the
         DPP to request a further criminal investigation. Since we spoke. I have been
         in touch with Paul Pugh in the Police Policy Directorate, who informs me that
         the South Yorkshire Police have undertaken to report to the Home Secretary
         by the end of January on the issues raised by the programme. That will, in
         particular, include clarification about the point whether the film from the video
         camera trained on the central enclosure was available to the Taylor Inquiry.
         I enclose, for each of reference, a copy of Paul Pugh's letter of 20 December
         1996 to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire.

         You may feel that it would also be appropriate for the CPS to adopt a similar
         stance indicating that it will consider whether any further action may be
         appropriate on its part once the results of the enquiries by the Home Office are
         to hand. That would not, of course, preclude the CPS from asking for further
         or wider enquiries at that stage. As to co-ordination, Paul Pugh thought there
        would be no difficulty in making the results of the South Yorkshire enquiries
        available to the CPS and LSLO. We felt that, assuming the report is received
        in early February, we should look to a meeting between ourselves, the Home
        Office and CPS in mid-February. Whilst each Department must form its own
        judgment in relation to the discharge of its own duties, It is equally Important
        that there is a coherent and co-ordinated response.

         I shall be revising our model letter to take account of the additional points
         made in the HFSG circular and will fax that to you as soon as possible.

         HILLSBOROUGH

         As  you will    be  aware,  following the Granada     programme,
         Hillsborough, a number of representations were made to the Home
         Secretary calling on him to reopen the public inquiry into the
         disaster. Whilst the Home Secretary emphasised that he would not
         take a decision to reopen the inquiry lightly and would need to
         be convinced that it would be in the public interest to do so,
         he, nonetheless, made a commitment in the House of Commons
         carefully to consider the issues raised.

         In coining to his decision the Home Secretary is particularly
         anxious to establish whether any new evidence has emerged. I
         would therefore be grateful for your views on this matter in
         relation to the ten points raised by the programme which 1
         attach. It would also be helpful if we could have clarification
         on the point about whether the film from the video camera trained
         on the central enclosure was available to the Taylor inquiry- The
         programme makers have specifically alleged that the Taylor
         inquiry was told that the camera was not working, when this was
         not the case; 1 would be grateful for your comments on this
         particular point. I understand that the film is available and it
         would be helpful if we could receive a copy and of any transcript
         of the film which the Taylor inquiry may have received.

          Whilst the Home Secretary does not have the power to reopen the
          inquest - that is a matter for the High Court on the advice of
          the Attorney General - the relatives have expressed continuing
          anger that the Coroner imposed a 3.15pm cut off point after which
          he would not take any evidence. Whether this was the correct
          course might have a bearing on the Home Secretary's decision. I
          would also be grateful therefore to receive any relevant
          information you might have on this matter. I understand that the
          issues will be investigated by the Complaints and Discipline
          Department who have already indicated to us that they could
          provide a full report by the end of January.

                                      IHE HILLSBOJRQUGH DISASTER;

                                       IEM UNRESQLYEP QUESTIONS

              ONE

             Why was Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield put in charge of a major semi-final
             only 2 1 days before the game, when he was relatively inexperienced at policing
             football matches?

             TWO

              Why were there no barriers or cordons to filter the crowd and prevent a build up
              outside the Leppings Lane end of the ground if, as the fans insist, there were the
              previous year?

              THREE

              Why was the game not delayed, as a number of police officers thought it should have
              been, when it became obvious that it would not be possible to get all the Liverpool
              fans safety into the ground before the 3pm kick-off?

              FOUR

              Why didn’t police recognise overcrowding on the Leppings Lane terrace when eye
              witnesses, including football commentator John Motson, were aware of the problems
              fifteen minutes before kick-off?

              FIVE

              Why wasn’t the tunnel leading to the central pens closed when they became full, the
              procedure adopted at the previous year’s semi-final?

              SIX

               Why did Chief Superintendent Duckenfield mislead the Secretary of the FA by telling
               him that fans had forced open Gate C, when the officer knew he had given the order
               for it to be opened?

               SEVEN

               Why did it take half an hour after the first crushing began to pull down the 10 foot
               spiked fence which trapped the fans, and why were the gates which led on to the pitch
               too small to be effective in an emergency evacuation?

        EIGHT

        Why was no public address announcement made - either informing the fans as to what
        was happening, asking for their help or for any medical personnel at the ground to
        help - until 3.30pm?

        NINE

        Why, when 42 ambulances reached the ground, did more not get on to the pitch where
        the dying and severely injured were in urgent need of trained medical help?

        TEN

        Why did only 14 of those who died get to hospital?

       Mr and Mrs K Clark




        17 January 1997




       Dear Mr and Mrs Clark

       The Attorney General has asked me to thank you for your letter of 9 January
       and to reply. He has the deepest sympathy for yourself and all the families
       involved in the tragic events which took place at Hillsborough and fully
       understands the concerns raised by the recent programme. Your letter
       suggested re-examination of the circumstances although you did not indicate
       whether you had in mind a further public inquiry or the seeking of an order for
       a fresh inquest.

       In considering the question insofar as the inquest is concerned the Attorney
       General has in mind the points made in the House of Commons in a debate on
       this topic on 17 December and what the Home Secretary said in response. He
       made the point that any decisions which have to be taken must be on the
       basis of consideration of all the relevant facts and underlying evidence rather
       than simply on the basis of the television programme itself. He said that in
       particular the Home Office would consider whether there is any new evidence,
       and if so. whether that evidence is of such significance that had it been put
       before Lord Taylor or before the Coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor
       Enquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

       The main role of the Attorney General in the events which have followed the
       Hillsborough disaster has arisen from his responsibilities under Section 13 of
       the Coroners Act 1988. He has previously considered several applications for
       consent to the making of an application to the High Court for an order
       directing the holding of a fresh inquest. In each case he concluded that the
       matters put forward did not establish that there was a realistic prospect of the
       High Court granting such an order. Indeed, very similar issues have been
       canvassed in unsuccessful judicial review applications.

   G




            There does not appear to be anything in the programme which materially
            affects the applications which the Attorney General has already considered.
            Officials here are however in touch with the Home Office to ensure that the
            Attorney General is informed of any new evidence which may emerge and is
            relevant to his responsibilities under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988.

           At present, and while the Attorney awaits the views of the Home Secretary,
           there is nothing that can be added to what has already been said by him in the
           House. The Attorney will have close regard to any points the Home Office may
           put to him as to the desirability of any further inquest. In addition, any
           application based upon further evidence would be considered carefully in the
           usual way but as I have indicated, the programme is not of itself evidence.

           Yours sincerely

        before Lord Taylor or before the Coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor
        Enquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

        The main role of the Attorney General in the events which have followed the
        Hillsborough disaster has arisen from his responsibilities under Section 13 of
        the Coroners Act 1988. He has previously considered several applications for
        consent to the making of an application to the High Court for an order
        directing the holding of a fresh inquest. In each case he concluded that the
        matters put forward did not establish that there was a realistic prospect of the
        High Court granting such an order. Indeed, very similar Issues have been
        canvassed in unsuccessful Judicial review applications.
    22-JAN. ’ 9 7 (WED) 15 =18   ATTORNEY GENERAL            TEL                             P. 003



!




            There does not appear to be anything in the programme which materially
            affects the applications which the Attorney General has already considered.
            Officials here are however in touch with the Home Office to ensure that the
            Attorney General is informed of any new evidence which may emerge and is
            relevant to his responsibilities under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988.

            At present, and while the Attorney awaits the views of the Home Secretary,
            there is nothing that can be added to what has already been said by him in the
            House. The Attorney will have close regard to any points the Home Office may
            put to him as to the desirability of any further inquest, In addition, any
            application based upon further evidence would be considered carefully in the
            usual way but as I have indicated, the programme is not of itself evidence.

            Yours sincerely




            S J WOOLER

Dear Mr Howard,

        We request th a t the events o f the Hillsborough Disaster be re-examined not
only because o f the new evidence produced, but because 7V2 years after the Disaster
the questions we have asked since Day 1, have never been addressed. We ask you to
read the following.

        We write to you not only as parents who lost a much loved member o f our
fam ily at Hillsborough , but were also firm believers in the rule o f Law and Order, sadly
we now realise that there is no such thing as honesty, integrity or justice.

       The Inquest started our concerns w ith the Coroner, who we considered, was
himself put in an untenable position, being employed by one o f the parties likely to
come under criticism for their decisions leading up the Disaster.

         The Coroner Dr Popper, was carrying out the investigation, and it was he who
selected the evidence to be heard. It was hardly surprising then when questions were
and still are being raised about his impartiality. The way the evidence was selected by
the Coroner was in our opinion, and in the opinion o f most independent professionals,
who have looked at the Inquest transcripts extremely biased.

         In our own personal experience, Dr Popper was quite happy to call witnesses,
who had not been w ithin ten miles o f the Football Stadium, to discuss the supposed
drunkenness o f fans, while at the same time refusing to call professionals who were at
the scene and attended the injured and dying who possibly could have answered some
o f our questions and cast some light on what occurred.

        We personally requested tw o Doctors and one Senior Nursing Officer who were
at the scene to be called as witnesses (see letter to the Coroner and his reply). All
were refused the opportunity to give the ju ry the benefit o f their knowledge o f events,
but as your know the Coroner enforced the unprecedented cut o ff time o f 3-15 and
no evidence o f events occurring later than this was to be heard, considering a lot o f
our questions relating to our son's death was after 3-15 (he was declared dead at 4.0
p.m.) we knew then th a t our questions would go unanswered.

        When concluding the Coroner himself commented th a t the Inquest was not
the place to conduct a major Disaster enquiry, and the current law commission has
expressed views that the system needs major review.
        We as a fam ily consider the system as it is at present to be corrupt and biased,
when one party the Police Authority, had full access to all statements, while the
families and their legal representatives were refused all access, and had to rely on the
Coroner, to present the evidence impartially which he patently did not.

       The Police Complaints procedure was another major concern, we know you are
aware, o f the general criticism o f the complaints procedure, but are you aware th a t
the complaints procedure is toothless.

         Senior Police Officers closely related to the incident, were seen in Sheffield,
whilst the Inquest was in progress, laughing openly at the plight o f the families,
confident that they were under no threat o f disciplinary action. Because if found that
disciplinary action was needed, that they could take early retirement unhindered and
unpunished. This was later to prove the way things were allowed to happen, so their
confidence was not misplaced.

       Only in our naive trust did we believe th a t because their Hactionswere so
obvious they would somehow be made accountable.

        We were involved in the judicial review procedure before the High Court and
although our faith in the system had been shattered, we were confident that even
w ith the meagre am ount o f evidence that we had managed to collect to support the
review, it was o f such importance as to require careful consideration.

        One piece o f evidence was th a t the West Midland investigation team had
attempted to coerce witnesses to change statements and this went uncontested,
although West Midland Police were aware what was to be produced, to support this
allegation.

        We were amazed th a t such strong charges could be dismissed in one o f our
major courts in the Country w ith the words in the judgem ent "Who's to know what to
believe" surely the courts exists for just th a t purpose to have evidence presented and
assessed. If it fails to carry o ut its prime responsibility it w ill quickly lose c r e d ib ility
w ith the general public.

       I would like to remind you th a t law and order has to be applied, with the
consent o f the people, lose th a t consent and the future looks very bleak.

       Please try and restore some o f our faith in the judicial system and be as
concerned about the events as we are, support our enquiry which o f course will be
open with fu ll disclosure.

                                        Yours fa ith fylly,

—                                                               12th February, 1991




               Dear Dr. Popper.

               At the mini inquests we attempted to ask a series of questions concerning
               the aftermath at Hillsborough, we were left with the impression that the
               questions would be dealt with at a later stage.

/-             However since then you have ruled that it is not necessary to proceed after
                15.15pm and it now appears that our questions will not be addressed, you
53 >           did say that in-an Ideal world everyone would have ended up in hospital and
___            you suggested that we were naive in thinking that the medical response was
                inadequate, that sort of answer is not conducive to the facts as shown in
m              the video, and reports from Medical Personnel who were trying valiantly to
                assist the injured.

               The video shows it took till at least 15.35pm before all the casualties
               were removed from the pens, a fairly lengthy delay which obviously did
               nothing to help their chances of survival.

               Reports and recommendations from the Medical Personnel (please find
               enclosed) certainly imply that in their opinion, the response left a lot to
               be desired.

               We also know of people who were removed in an unconscious state, a prime
     k         example being Mr. Edward Spearritt who according to Mr. Spearritt was not
     I         admitted to hospital until 17.00 hours and who subsequently recovered, that
               it was possible for people in the crush who suffered severe injury to
               survive with a reasonable amount of aftercare.
    i '                  ■   .    .              .                    ■               ’




               At the very least this raises questions 1n the eyes of the families that
               the inefficiency of the major incident response could have contributed to
               the number of deaths occurring at Hillsborough and therefore we consider
    i          that this should have been part of your enquiries into the reason for the
               deaths.

               You have promised to look into individual questions of concern, therefore
    ,          it would not take a great deal of your time to enquire into this matter.

     He would suggest the two most qualified Medical Personnel namely Or. John
     Ashton and Or. Glynn Phillips be called to give evidence at your Inquests,
     so they can be questioned as to their medical opinion of whether the
     response contributed at all to the amount of fatalities.
iM               /




     Me think you realise the seriousness which we place on this matter, and we
     feel that if you fail to address this situation, that this failure will
     obviously form part of a case for Judicial revidw no matter what verdict 1s
     reached.

     Trusting you will give this matter your earnest consideration.

Dear Mr Jones
Thank you for your letter dated 12 February 1991, the contents of
which I have noted and have read with care.
Whilst I would not for one moment question the seriousness with which
you view the points raised, I do not think that it is either right
or appropriate for me to enter into a dialogue with you regarding
the issue which you have raised.
However, in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I do have
to say that it is not my intention to call either Dr Ashton or.
Dr Phillips.
I have also read your penultimate paragraph. Whether or not you
apply for a judicial review is a matter entirely for you and/or your
                .........        , hould comment on this either.

The Director of Public Prosecution,
c/o Ms. D. Fipps,
CPS Mersey & Lancashire Region,
7th Floor South,
Royal Liver Building,
Liverpool,
L3 1NH.

Dear Director of Public Prosecution,

         We are members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group and have been trying
with great difficulty and stress to come to terms with the tragic death of our young Son at the
disaster. We hoped to have carried on with our lives as best we could knowing that it was a
disaster that could possibly have been avoided if certain steps had been taken. Then,
Hillsborough became a reality once again on the television for all to see and although we
never watched this programme, we found it difficult to avoid all the ’talk' about it.

        Now we feel strongly that in the light of the totally contradictory evidence that has
brought to our attention, the events of Hillsborough should be re-examined so that the people
responsible can be brought to justice and to ensure that this must never ever happen again.
Maybe then part of us can be at peace.

                                      Yours sincerely,             ^     . > .

Dear M r and Mrs O’Neill


Thank you for your recent letter which was received in this office on 14 January 1997.

The tragic events at Hillsborough took place in the area of CPS Humber and I have therefore
passed your letter to M r Donald Adams, Chief Crown Prosecutor of CPS Humber Area who
will reply as soon as possible.

In the meantime may I add my own sympathy for the great loss you have suffered.

Yours sincerely




Geoff Saul
Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutor

 Mr & Mrs K O’Neill



                                                                   DWA/ALP/G1




Dear Mr and Mrs O’Neill

Your recent letter sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, care of the Liverpool office
of the Crown Prosecution Service, has been sent to me as you will be aware from the letter
of acknowledgement you received from the Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutor, Mr
Geoff Saul. I do hope I have got your status right in addressing this letter.

Although I am responsible for the Area which covers Hillsborough, all matters arising from
the tragic events were dealt with by Central Casework, who are based for this purpose at
York. A number of other letters have been received along similar lines to yours and it will
be appropriate if they are considered together.

I am therefore passing your letter on to Mr Peter Pearson at Central Casework and he will
reply to you shortly. I am sorry that I have had to write to you to say that your letter has
been sent on to somebody else yet again.

In the meantime please accept my sympathy for the tragic loss of your son.

Yours sincerely




Donald W Adams
Chief Crown Prosecutor

Dear Madam

As members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, we wish to request that the events of
Hillsborough be re-examined in the light of the totally contradictory evidence that came to our
attention during Granada’s research for the recent Jimmy McGovern “Hillsborough” programme.

We lost our son, aged 18, in the tragedy, and owe it to his memory, and all the other people who
lost their lives that day, to seek to bring out the truth.

Yours faithfully

      Hillsborough Enquiry

       I refer to our recent telephone conversation.

      As a result of the recent drama/documentary on this unfortunate
      incident, this office has received four separate letters from
      families that were addressed to the Director, asking her to re­
      open the inquests in this case in the light of the "new evidence"
      uncovered by the programme.

      For the time being simple acknowledgement letters, with the
      promise of a more substantive reply to follow have been sent to
      the families concerned.

      For your information letters were received from

                          Mr & Mrs Joynes
                          The Roberts family
                          J.W.Saunders
                          Mr.G.W.Wright

      In our view the way forward is for this office to view the
      programme shown and then to receive a briefing from your office
      as to what, if anything, the programme has added in the way of
      material facts that might not have been placed before the Courts
      previously.

      To this end I would be grateful if you could arrange for a copy
      of the programme to be forwarded to this office, this will be
      studied and then arrangements made for yourself and Chief
      Superintendent Lowe to either attend this office, or we travel
      to you in order that this aspect can be put in its proper
      c ontext.

       In order to avoid prolonging uncertainty in the mind of the
       families I would suggest that the meeting take place within the
       next two to three w e e k s .

       I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Madam,


I enclose herewith a letter which I sent to Mr Howard. As most of the points I am concerned
about are contained in this letter; I would like you to consider what I have to say, and perhaps
let me have your comments.




Yours faithfully



Pvose   Robinson
24th December 1996


Dear Mr Howard,

I am writing as one of the families who you were kind enough to see in the House of
Commons. May I say, I felt you were very sincere in what you said to us. I thank you for this.
I would identify myself to you as the lady who first spoke to you regarding police investigating
police.

I took careful note of your speech in the house, when you rightly said we had already had four
enquiries. You said at one point, that all the evidence was available to all the bodies concerned
during those enquiries. Our argument is, that although it was available it wasn't all used in
those enquiries. The police carefully selected what was used, and did not bring all the evidence
forward. Likewise with the coroners inquest, He said to me on a local radio phone in; he had
thousands of witnesses to call on, but he selected the witnesses to be called,( possibly under
police pressure), and most of the witnesses were pro-police. One particular witness (the so
called land lord) who wasn't a land lord at all, was found to be a complete liar, and the jury
were told to dismiss his evidence at a later date. A few fans were called to give their evidence,
mainly young lads (my sons friend amongst them) they were systematically tom apart by a
team of barristers, as if they were on trial, many were in tears, as they felt they had let the
victims down. This was supposed to be a inquest, not a trial. I knew of many professional
people, who swore statements to the police, but were never called to give evidence at any of
the enquiries.

Talking about the inquest, yet again, the cut off time of 3.15 was totally inappropriate,
therefore invalidating the inquests. How can an inquest be legal, when many of the victims
were still alive up to 4 pm (evidence can be supplied)
Talking about the disaster itself, how can the police justify stopping ambulances and
paramedics to reach dying people. The police said they were fighting yes - fighting for their
lives, why were they denied help ?

Whilst this was going on, lines of police officers were on the pitch doing nothing - or
according to them separating the supporters. It was the supporters who saved lives, and
sprang into action immediately to help. How dare the Sun newspaper say otherwise,but then
the evidence for those reports came from the police..

Are you also aware that when some of the perimeter gates burst open under pressure, the
police offers pushed the people back in again, and locked them in. How many died because of
this ? One man, pleading for help as his young son died in his arms, was ignored.

As the disaster unfolded, the police realising their complete lack of control, immediately began
to shift the blame. Alcohol tests were taken on all of the victims, even children. Why weren't
the police tested for alcohol? It might have explained their incompetence. Many were known
to be in the hospitality suite, and one particular senior officer was thought to have a drink
problem. (Check this out) In a car accident, who do they breathalise, the driver or the victim?
Later on, about 5 p.m. many of the people searching for their loved ones (knowing they were
dead in the gym) having been told this by fans who had carried them there, were sent on a wild
goose chase to hospitals, mortuaries etc.; this gave the police time to get their 'stories straight,
and to make sure nothing derogatory was put in their notebooks. Our loved ones were just
laid on the floor without dignity. Why were they not sent to hospital, or the new health centre?
Why was a disaster plan not put into action? Could it be that it would have uncovered the
truth. Within minutes of identifying my sons body, my husband and I were interrogated by the
police. We had committed no crime, neither had my son. The only kindness shown to us on
that terrible night was from a social worker, and the ordinary citizens of Sheffield. How can
you call this British Justice, it makes me ashamed to be British. In what other occupation can
people be so negligent, as to cause the death of 96 people, and be allowed to retire to avoid
disciplinary action, plus to get their full pension and walk into another job.My son was a 17
year old hard working apprentice,he had never been in trouble, and we loved him dearly along
with our four other lovely children. His death was not an accident, and I will never accept it
was. My son was in the care of the South Yorkshire police, and through recklessness they
failed in their duty of care to my son, and the other 95 victims.

I would like you to acknowledge you have read this letter, because if you read it, you cannot
possibly say there is to be no further enquiry. I do have faith in you, because you came across
as a very sincere gentleman. There have been many miscarriages of justice during the last
decade, mainly caused by police perverting the course of justice, this is just one more. Please
see that it is put right

Dear Madam.

              ReHillsborough          Disaster

It is with great concern that we write to you regarding the evidence of criminal misconduct
in the suppression of evidence arising out of the contents of the affidavit of Roger
Houldsworth of 25th November 1996.
W e call upon you to commence criminal proceedings on the basis that the statement of
Roger Houldsworth contains allegations that material evidence was destroyed or
concealed.
He directly contradicts what some of the South Yokshire police told the jury. W e have no
need to remind you that a person who destroys or conceals evidence knowing it may be
material to legal proceedings, commits the offence of attempting to pervert the course of
justice, it is on this point we call upon you to set up a criminal enquiry
Our son died on that terrible day 15th April 1989. w e shall not rest untill every answer to
every question is given TRUTHFULLY.

Dear Mrs Mills,

We, the family of Graham John Roberts, killed at Hillsborough, 15
April 1989 - aged 24 years, are writing to you to ask if you will
reopen the inquiry into this disaster? Me feel that so far there
has been no justice.  As well as the concerns already highlighted
by the TV programme "Hillsborough" , and the comments expressed, by
Mr Trevor Hicks, Chairman of our Support Group, we have a number
of further points we wish to bring to your attention.

The first information we received in April 1990 regarding Graham
was "A Report into the death of.." which states Graham died at
16.25 hours - the 3.15pm cut off time for information would mean
that Graham was not dead for his inquest.  We received two
conflicting reports from police constables who thought they dealt
with Graham,  One stated Graham was wearing a sleeveless T shirt,
the other that Graham had no shirt on at all.  Neither of these
descriptions fit with the clothing Graham was wearing on the day.
Me have no information what-so-ever regarding what happened to
Graham on that day once he had been forced apart from his
friends.

In spite of phoning the emergency numbers continually, and,
although Graham was identified by one of his friends at 2.00am on
the Sunday, we were not informed of Graham's death until his
friends had driven back from Sheffield at 6.00am,  In fact it was
Graham's friends who had to break the tragic news to us, even
though they had pleaded with the Sheffield police to let us know,
as they did not feel able to do so themselves.

Prior to the first inquest we sent two questions to the coroner
(copy attached) however, he refused our wish for these questions
be asked.  Please, please will you allow us and all the other
bereaved families to find out what happened on that day?   I 'm
sure you can understand why we need to know the truth.   If it is
within your power to insist on the reopening of the inquiry, we
all sincerely hope and pray you will do so.

Thanking you in anticipation for your attention to this letter.

Yours sincerely,

                       ,2 x                    i   r   i‘   5   ,   '' '

        Questions arising from Summary - Reference Number 79


        1,   In paragraph 16 of the Summary it is stated that Police

        Constable 1715 Best hepled to carry Mr Roberts into Leppings Lane

        and at the time believed Mr Roberts to be breathing.          Despite

        this, he left Mr Roberts to assist others.      Why was no basic

        first aid carried out by the Officer , and why was Mr Roberts

        left without attention?

        Did the lack of provision by the Officer of essential first aid

        such as placing Mr Roberts in a recovery position,     loosening his

        clothing and providing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, contribute

        to Mr Roberts' death?

        2.   Police Constable 620 Yates in paragraph 15 of the Summary is

        stated to have formed the view that when he saw Mr Roberts at the

        rear of the West Stand, he had formed the opinion that Mr Roberts

        was dead, and therefore left him where he had found him.

        However, Police Constable 1715 Best has stated that when he found

        Mr Roberts at the rear of the West Stand, he believed him to be

        breathing.   These statements are clearly in conflict.        What steps

        were taken by the two officers in question to ensure that they

        reached the correct assumption as to Mr Roberts1 state at that

        time?

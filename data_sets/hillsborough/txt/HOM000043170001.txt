                  HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER I8g§jSY

     Thank you for your note of 4th September.          As you knew, I have

only just returned from leave.

     It seems to me that it would be sensible for the Treasury

Solicitor to approach Lord Justice Taylor about the question of

taxation.    Perhaps the next step should be for you to have aTwO**<4

with Mr Brummell who carried out the Treasury Solicitor's functions

in relation to the Inquiry.    If you had any difficulty, I would

happy to intervene.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER ENQUIRY

1.   On my return from leave today I found a letter from Miss
Steel of the Hillsborough Steering Committee about the costs of
the representation of the injured and bereaved. My first instinct
was to send the letter on to the Treasury Solicitor, but since the
fourth paragraph seems to imply that he may already have been
involved, I thought that I should send it on to you.

2.   To my knowledge, Lord Justice Taylor has not been formally
involved in sorting out those costs which he was inclined to
recommend should be met from public funds. I would be happy to
approach him, but since I am now 'functus officio' I am not sure
that it would be right for me to raise this with him, though I
should be glad to be kept in touch.

3.   In the meantime, I have sent   a short holding acknowledgement
to Miss steel.

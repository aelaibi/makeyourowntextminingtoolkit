Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moynihan
which has been passed to this department in view of our
responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I
apologise for the delay in replying to you.

Unfortunately I am unable to send you a copy of Lord Justice
Taylor's Final Report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.
However, it is available for Her Majesty's Stationery Office
bookshops (code no ISBN 0 10 109622 4) at Â£10.50. Your
nearest HMSO is at 9-21 Princess Street, Manchester, M60 8AS
(061 834 72).  I hope this information is of use to you.

                                                               Yours sincerely

         Dear Mr Moynihan


                                                                            studying a BTBC
         I am a student from

         National Diploma in Leisure Studies.            For one of my Sport and Physical

         Recreation assignmentsy    I have chosen           to study Football Ground Safety

         as I have had an interest in this subject since the wake of the

         Hillsborough Disaster.    X would be very greatful if you could send me

         any relevant information on this very debatable issue,


         Yours in anticipation of a reply.

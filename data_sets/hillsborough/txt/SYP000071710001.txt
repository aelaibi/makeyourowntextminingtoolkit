                     way.       On the away matches         I travel as a                  y x \ board the official

                    Anfield travel           club c o a c h e s / there are normally

                    who travel         on the away coaches,      however       if more than two coaches


p&*t        ' travel away then there are                                                     employed one for

                    each coach.

                    The arran,3errient's f or Saturday         15th April       1989 w ere that four coaches

                    were due to leave from the SHANKLEY GATES entrance ANFIELD at 11.30

                    ■^md the four coaches were      provided by_a company called                         "SELWYNS"    of/''

                                  together with                                                          the

            were employed that day to travel on these four coaches.

The system operated by the ANFIELD Travel Club is that supporters

apply to become a member of the official                travel   club.    They are then

given a membership card with their name and photograph on,                     this card

must   be carried on the coaches and must be used to purchase the ticket

for the coach for the particular match in question,                  this system

operated as normal        on Saturday 15th April         1989, there are however         no

actual seat allocations         if you obtain a     ticket then you are

able to sit anywhere on the coach.

On Saturday      15th April    1989 the coaches
                                              arrived at 11.15am.  I recall
                                                 osdU j    IL—
on that     particular day a lad called COL.IN ASHCiTOFT was one of the

first to arrive.          I remember COLIN because he has travelled with me

many times before                                                               I also

knew him to be from WARRINGTON as on p'Cher days                 I have dropped him off

from the coach near to home,

The    coaches    left at about   11.30, COLIN ASHCROFT was seated in my

coach.      We arrived in SHEFFIELD and parked in HALIFAX ROAD at about

c. .10pm.    We were delayed s 1 ightly-'tm route due to traffic delays on

the M&2.

On our arrival all the supporters left the coach and walked down to

Hillsborough Stadium,          I personally held a ticket for the West S t a n d .

I. made my way to the Leppings Lane entrance at Hillsborough Stadium

and arrived there at a b o u t 2.40pm.       When I arrived th^fe was a mass of

supporters trying to get into the terrace e n t r a n c e / o f Leppings L a n e ,

I could see there was a very bad crush outside /h o s e                  turnstiles to

the extent       that   people were   climbing   into        turnstiles trying to get

out of the       crush.    I got through my turnstile        relatively easily and            I

then made my way up the stairs to the seats,                however at the top of

the stairs       I went   to the toilet.   As I stood at the urinal            I looked

out of the       toilet   window which was open.         I could see from my
                                                                                             PAGE          3
                                                                                             S'1597

               position the rear of the Leppings, Lane terraced turnstiles.             As I

               watched I noticed a unif ormejr pol i ceman open one of the exit gates

               adjacent to these turnstyfes,           there were two stewards at the gate, but

               they did not assist         in opening the gate.      I cannot describe the

.        U&    policeman.       As the gate was opened I saw s.everal hundred fans pour

    Ufyr* »4    into the ground,       they all    ran in and all   ran straight towards the

0       J - U p o s i t i o n where   I knew the tunnel entrance to the terraces to be.         I

    fV f / ' thought      in my own mind that this action could cause problems simply

               due to the numbers being           let in and the way they charged to the

               tunnel.      I then saw a policeman on horseback, force his horse across

               the front of the gate blocking the fans from getting in, then several

                policemen shut the g ate from inside the ground.            I then made my way to

               n>y seat   in the West Stand.        As I took up my seat,    I noticed the

               ^ p 1ayers were already out on the pitch but the match had not started.

               Shortly after kick o f f I became aware of problems           in the Lepping Lane

                central   terraces as fans began to climb over tKe front fences onto the

                pitch and I then saw a policeman run on^^th^/p'itch and stop the g a m e .

                I could see that the        problem in the terraces was "due to crushing but I

               thought    people were being injured rather than being killed,          I watched

               as things developed but was unable to do anything to assist.              I

               eventually left the g^g^tnd of my own accord at 4pm a nd made my way

               back to the coaches.

               At about 5.15pm after the majority of fans had returned to the coaches
&
               we made them get onto the coaches           in order to check for missing

               persons.      Initially four       people were missing from my coach but by

               5.30pm all     the fans on my coach had returned except COLIN ASHCROFT,                no

               one had seen him or could say where he went on leaving the coach.

               The coach eventually left SHEFFIELD at 5.40pm a nd we returned to

               ANFIELD arriving at about 8.00pm.

               I am unable t<3 add anything furthei/ about COLIN ASHCROFT except to say
                                                                                                        PAGE

         he    was    a    quiet    lad   who   kept    himself   to    himself,   he   had   no   friends

         amongst          those    who    travel   with   the   club.

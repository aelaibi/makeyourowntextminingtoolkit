  I wrote to Mr Fallon recently describing what we have been told by the South Yorkshire
  Police about the release o f still pictures from their videotape showing the temporary mortuary
  which was set up ui the gymnasium at the Hillsborough Football Ground. AmonTother
     ags Jny le'“ er said that the Police do not release to relatives stills from this videotape which

 You have since telephoned me to say that this is not correct and that there have been
 occasions when the police have released to relatives still pictures from the video which show
 more than one body. I have pm this point to the police (without specifying you ^ h e
                                                                                         source


 In response the police have confirmed that their policy is as it was described in my letter
 They say that we do where it is possible edit the video stills showing scenes from the
 temporary mortuary so that only one body is visible, but this is not possible on all occasions

^s llfio m ^ e mortuary video which shows apart o f a second body where it was impossible to
 blank it out without destroying the picture c o n t e n t m p o s s w i e to

I hope this explanation is helpful.

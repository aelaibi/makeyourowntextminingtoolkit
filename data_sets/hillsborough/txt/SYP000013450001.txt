                                   Hillsborough Inquiry

                      It was a relief to know that you are associated
       with this important investigation.

                      May I be allowed to make one plea?   Could the
       report give specific recommendations regarding medical personnel
       and equipment for these large matches?

                      It would appear, from what Ashton and Phillips said,
       that first-aid staff and equipment were sadly deficient or non-existent
       on the day.
                      Bearing in mind that many of the deceased must have
       been suffering from respiratory decompensation due to ethanol and/or
       tobacco, surely airways and mobile oxygen should have been avail­
       able as a minimum back-up.   A defibrillator is expensive but air­
       ways (with or without compression bags) are cheap;    an aspirator
       (to deal with inhaled vomit) costs £81.   (Viz enclosures).

                      I do so hope these matters will be given detailed
       attention.

It was a great pleasure to hear from you again even though the
circumstances that caused you to write are so tragic.

I feel sure that Lord Justice Taylor will want to check evidence
concerning first-aid equipment and the wider aspect of adequately
trained personnel. To that end, I will sake your letter available to
those in the Enquiry who are taking care of that aspect,
I am most grateful to you for writing. I hear your name mentioned from
time to time ~ always in a most complimentary mode * and it is good to
know that you are still so active and so successful.

With best regards.

It was a great pleasure to hear from you again even thought the
circumstances that caused you to write are so tragic*

X feel aura that Lord Justice Taylor will want to check evidence
concerning first-aid equipment and the wider aspect of adequately
trained personnel, To that end, I will make your letter available to
those in the Enquiry who are taking care of that aspect*

I am most grateful to you for writing* I hear your naae mentioned from
time to tiae - always in a moat complimentary mode ~ and it is good to
know that you are still so active and so successful.

With hast regards.

                                          Hillsborough Inquiry

                          It was a relief to know that you are associated
           with this important investigation.

                          May I be allowed to make one plea?   Could the
           report give specific recommendations regarding medical personnel
           and equipment for these large matches?

                          It would appear, from what Ashton and Phillips said,
           that first-aid staff and equipment were sadly deficient or non-existent
           on the day.

                          Bearing in mind that many of the deceased must have
           been suffering from respiratory decompensation due to ethanol and/or
           tobacco, surely airways and mobile oxygen should have been avail­
           able as a minimum back-up.   A defibrillator is expensive but air­
           ways (with or without compression bags) are cheap;   an aspirator
           (to deal with inhaled vomit) costs £81.  (Viz enclosures).

                            I do so hope these matters will be given detailed
           attention.

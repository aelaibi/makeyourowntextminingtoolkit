            time     I was         under       the       impression                that     trouble         was       being     experienced,

            within       the       ground          re    fighting.




            At    approximately                1505          hrs    I       received        an    order       to      attend        immediately

            inside       the       ground          and       entered          via    the      Leppings          Lane        entrance.           No

            further          instructions                were       received             after      this      point.         I then           entered

            via    the       main    entrance                and    made       my    way      towards         the       courtyard             area.      Once

            inside       I was       confronted                by       a    hostile        and     emotional            crowd,          shouting         and

            screaming             words       such       as    "MURDERING                B A S T A R D S / ^ ’T H I S    IS A L L        YOUR       FAULT'1

            appeared          dead.       Most          were       receiving             mouth      to     mouth        resuscitation                which

eventually              got/up             and    left       the        area.          I then          assisted           w K n    bodies          laid

upon       t he    fljpor         at       this       location              by    picking             thenfup        and     laying          them       on

the    pitclvitself.                       Access       to     the          pitch          was    gained        by    walking           through          a

small       gate        at       this       time.       My     next          recollection                 is    of    climbing              onto    t he

pitch       and        attempting                to    tear        down          the       fencing       surrounding               pens       3    and       4

to    no    gain.           I then          returned           to       a    gap       in       the    fencing        that        had       been

previously              torn          down       and    began           transporting                   bodies        from     pen       3    and    4

onto       the     pitch.             This       was    very        d i f f i c uJ/C a s              limbs     were       interwined              and

this       fact        coupled             with       the    dead           weight          made       pulling        them        apart       almost

impossible.                 I    cannot          recall        exactly                how       many    bodies        were        male,       female

or    children              but       can    remember              bodies             of    each       type.     All       but     one       of    the

bodies        I    carried             out       appeared           dead,             often       covered        in       vomit        or    urine.

They       appeared              blue       in    complexion,                    eyes       were       often     open       and

were       completely                 limp.       The       body        that          appeared          initially           alive

i m m e d i a t e 1y        1a p s e d      into       unconsiousness                       when       placed        onto     the       pi t ch     and

officers           receiving                him       immediately                 attempted             to     perform        resuscitation.

I    cannot        recall             if    these       persons              were          police,       or     ambulancmen                 but

they       were        in       uniform.          I have           no       recollection                of     the    time        at    this       point

but    do    remember                 that       after       we     had          cleared          the    bodies           onto     the

pitch       myself              and    other          officers              stood          at    the    fence        on    the     pitch

perimeter              in       order       to    prevent           persons                from       entering        onto        the       pitch.

I noticed              at       this       time       and    throughout                    several       periods           that        day    that

there       was        prevailant                smell       of     alcohol                in    the    ai r . W h i 1 st         removing

bodies        it       was       noticable             that        much          of    the       vomit       upon     the     bodies          was

wiped       onto        our       own       clothing.              Again,             the       substances           appeared           to    consist

predominantly                    of    alcohol.             W h i 1st        standing             on    the     fence        the       crowd       could

be    seen        to    become             increasingly                 agitated                and    hostile        and     myself          and

other       officers              retreated             to     a    point             past       the    goal     onto        the       pitch,

facing       the       crowd       in    the       Leppings          Lane       end.        At       this       point       a    number             of

supporters             were    on       the    pitch          as    well.       A     cordon          of       Police       officers                was

stretched          across          the       pitch       at    approximately                    the       half       way    line.          I

recall       an    order       being          made       far       the    officers              to    replace          supporters                   back

into    the       stand.       This          was    fletly          refused           to    be       carried          out,       as       the

order       was    dangerous             and       cratentially               explosive.                  At    around          this       time          I

was    in    company          with       Pc/265E          Sapsford.             This        is       the       first       time       I    recall

either       talking          to    & t y h e ing        with       another          officer.              We    decided          to       stay

together          as    the    crowd          was    extremely                hostile           and       appeared          ready          to

attack       us    and    it       was       thought          that       we    would        be       best       defended          by

protecting             each    other.          The       crowd       appeared              to    become          ever       increasingly

hostile       and       there       appeared             to    be    an       increasing              number          of    isolated

incidents          between          police          and       supporters.              I saw          a    man       strike       an       officer

of    senior       rank       and       also       saw    a    number          of    supporters                 running          down          the

stand       towards       the       pitch.          1 also          saw       other        supporters                climbing             down       the

balcony       onto       the       ground          tar race         as    if    preparing                 to    fight,          and    my self

at    the    very       least       seiVious         injury.             At    this        point          an    annoucernent               was

calm    and       to    co-operate             with       the       police.          The        supporters             appeared                to

only    slightly          so.       However          shortly             afterwards              a    second          announcement                   was

made    by    the      match        organisers                requesting             supporters                 to    retain          tickets

and    to    remain       in       position          until          otherwise              directed             by    the       Police.             The

crowd       then       started          to    dissipate             and       vacate        the       stands          to    both          myself

not    searched.                I again          returned       to       the       Leppings          Lane       stand       and

collected             Police             Officers       equipment             that       had       been       discarded,          and

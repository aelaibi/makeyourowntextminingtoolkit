STRATEGY FOR IMPLEMENTING ALL SEATING


You will be interested in the attached note from the All Party
Football Group on progress on implementation of all-seating at
football clubs. It raises the issue of whether there should be
an overall plan for implementing all seating.     As you know at
present there is no such plan and in allocating Pool Betting Duty
monies the Football Trust operates on a first come first serve
basis.   Since the FLA has now made clear its commitment on
all-seating accommodation at football stadia I wonder if there is
scope for it to take the lead in drawing up a strategy for
implementing all-seating in line with the Taylor timetable,
identifying priorities.     This can only be done by a body
independent of football and able to assess the plans put to it by
League clubs.
 I accept there is likely to be a timing problem since the FLA
'could only draw up such a strategy after its Inspectorate had
 completed its programme of ground inspections next year.   In the
 meantime there seems little alternative to a first come first
 serve approach by the Trust with the priority of course being the
 first and second division clubs.
I would be grateful for your views.  If you consider this to be a
proposal worth pursuing then I would of course be grateful if you
raise it with the FLA and let me know their reaction.

Yours sincerely




IJOHN VAUGHAN

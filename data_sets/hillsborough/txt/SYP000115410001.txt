being      pushed             in an         effort          to    reach         the     turnstiles.                    At     on e       point,

attempts         were          made         to      close        the      wrought         iron         gates          to    relieve            the

pressure         but          on     each         occasion            it w a s      pushed            back.            At     one        p oint      I

saw    what      appeared                  to     be a      can       being       thrown             through          the     air.         It

narrowly         missed              Constable              Stanbridge              but      its       contents             scattered             over

him and         those          around             him.       I        remember         thinking "Thank                     goodness            he        w as

■wearing        his       reinforced                 hat".

Eventually               we     were        able       to    f o r m a .c o m p l e t e              line       of    horses         from

building         line           to     building             line,         but     even       then,          people          were         attempting

to    push      between and                     under       the       horses        with         a    complete             disregard            for

their      safety.                  Tfygse        that      had       got      past     the          line       coj»C'inued to             p us h a n d

all     requests              to      be    patient          were         ignored.

There      was       a brief               t im e    when        one      ho r s e , >Prom fear,                     moved        out     of     line

and     there        was        a     surge         towards           the      turnstiles.                  This        was       quickly

filled         but       as     I looked             over        at    t his      p o i nt       and       I saw        the       gate     on     the

left      of    the       turnstiles                 open,            I a s s u m e d that            it h a d       been      breached.                  A

short      time          later         the        gates      were         closed         and         the c r u s h      appeared            to

At    about      1 50 5         hours           I heard          o v er     the     radio            that       there       were         problems

 There was a brief time when one horse, from fear, moved


 out of line and there was a surge towards tb*. turnstiles.

need arose.



We rema ined at this location until it was decided t

 evacuate the ground.     Mounted officers were then deplx

 At approximately 1820 hours mounted officers were ’stood

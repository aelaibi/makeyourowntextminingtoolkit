Dear Ms Kennah
RE: JONATHON OWENS
Thank you for your letter of 11 February 1991.
I think maybe the simplest way of overcoming this problem is for
you to obtain a proper statement from Jonathon's father stating
the position regarding the ticket, that can then be presented to
the Jury under Rule 37.
You will of course appreciate that this cannot alter the evidence
of Mr Robertson.
Yours sincerely



S L POPPER

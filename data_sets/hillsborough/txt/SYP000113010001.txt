                At   10am W e d n e s d a y     22 M a r c h       1 989       I attended           a    planning         meeting        at

                At   10 a m W e d n e s d a y     29 M a r c h      1 9 89      I ha d a m e e t i n g          with Superintendent

                ensure        these     were     progressing             satisfactorily.

                At   2 . 3 0 pm on      10 A p r i l    1989       I had        a meeting            with      the   Sector

The     purpose          of    this was            to    g ive     a full       briefing         to   supervisory

officers and              then        f or     t h e m to        have   th e    opportunity           to    examine         their

the     ground.

I conducted              t he m a i n        briefing            with Superintendent Murray                        and   then       the

respective           area Superintendents                          held       their     own    briefings,            in a n d

around        the    ground,             dealing more              specifically with                  their    ne e d s ,    and

requirements              of       their       areas        of    responsibility.

At     10 a m S a t u r d a y          15 A p r i l      1 989     I briefed          the     officers        on     duty    for

th e    semi    final          ti e      in the N o r t h S t a n d            of    th e H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l

It w a s      a shortened                version         of t he        previous        d a y ’s b r i e f i n g .

Superintendent                 Murray,           Detective             Sergeant       Charlesworth and                Inspector

On     completion             of     th e     briefing           I spoke       with     officers         in the       ground and

toured        the    a r e a.

I re-entered              th e       ground        about         t.15pm and          in due      course made             my way       to

the P o l i c e      Control             Box     about        1.50pm and            liaised with Superintendent

Murray.

We     left a s h o r t            time       la t e r   to      see    the    referee        and     linesmen        to a d v i s e

them     of    our       emergency             procedures.

T h e y were        on    the        pitch and           eventually            they     left a n d we         followed          them

to     the    official's               room.

On     leaving       there           about       2p m we         returned       to    the P o l i c e      Control        Box   and

I had a general                   d i s c u s s i o n w i t h Mr.          J a c k s o n about        the     operation,

w h i c h was        progressing            s a t i s f a c t o r i l y at         this    sta ge .          He    left          a    little

while      later.

About     2.30pm,            when        examining        t he    ground           situation,             I noted           that       the

S pion Kop was               almost        full    with        the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t           fans,          and       that

was     th e    general           view     in    respect         of    their        other       areas        of    the       ground.

A number         of L i v e r p o o l       supporters            had       obtained         tickets          for       t he S p i o n

Kop and were               accommodated             in th e N o r t h E a s t             part       of    this        section             of

th e    ground.            They were            segregated            from       the    Nottingham Forest

supporters            by a        line     of    police        officers.

The     North Stand               for     Liverpool        supporters               was    possibly           half          f ull      at

this     time,        th e    West S t a n d was           filling,              but    there        was     space          at       the

front     and        sides        of     the Le pp ing s         Lane       Terrace.            I asked           for a          tannoy

message         to    be     relayed        for     fans       to m o v e        forward and              spread along                 the

terrace.

I can      recall          about         this    time S u p e r i n t e n d e n t         Marshall           asked          for

Leppings         Lane        to    be     closed and           saw     bn     the C C T V m o n i t o r           the       crowd

situation and a SYPTE                       double        decker           bus     passing.

I was aware            of a c r o w d           build     up but           traffic        was    still        able          to       flow and

I questioned               in m y m i n d        t he    need     for       th e    cl o s u r e .

At     this     time       there         must    have     been        some       difficulty           in     closing             the       r oa d

because         I remember               more    than     one     request           for    this       to     be    d o n e as

though         the   first         had     not    been     implemented.

I was     aware        from        th e    CCTV monitor               of    th e    increasing             number           of

supporters           in L e p p i n g s         Lane and         in t h o s e w a i t i n g          to e n t e r       the          ground.

Whilst         examining           th e    situation           outside           I visually made an assesment

from     the C o n t r o l         Box     of    the w a y       in w h i c h       the    ground was              filling             and

asked Superintendent                       Murray        for     his a s s e s s m e n t        of    th e    situation,

bearing         in m i n d        th e    crowd    outside and                the      space     inside           at    this          time.

This was         about       2.30pm and             he    said        that       with     half an          hour        to    kick          off
                                                                                                                                PAGE

we     should       get        t h e m all     in on time.

About        this     time        I asked Superintendent                       Murray        to    c l a r i f y w i t h me              the

circumstances                  under w h i c h we w o u l d             consider        delaying          t he     kick     off*

We     had    previously agreed                    that     if t h e r e w a s a n           identifiable              problem,

eg.     a serious              incident,          accident         on    the m o t o r w a y       or    fog     o n the

Pennines         which would              prevent         l a rg e      numbers        of    f a ns a r r i v i n g      on t i m e

we     should       consider           a d e l a y as       opposed         to    those who             had     been     brought

to     the a r e a w i t h i n a           reasonable           time       but    had       chosen       no t     to e n t e r           the

g r o u n d as      soon as           possible.

I    took     the     view        t h a t at      this    time,         w i t h all     the       information

available,            there        were      no    grounds         to    delay        the    kick       off.

B etween S.30pm and S.40pm                          the     crowd        continued           to    increase and                 I

monitored           th e       Liverpool          fans    on th e        Spion Kop           and actions             being           taken

by     officers        t he r e .

I examined            the       s i t u a t i o n at     the L e p p i n g s      Lane       end    of    the       ground           from

th e    CCTV monitor                and    saw     the     increasing            crowd       situation.

I was        aware     that         ac tion was          being       taken       to    increase          th e     number            of

officers         at    this         l o c a t i o n as    horses         and     reserve          serials         were     being

directed         to a s s i s t        by C o n t r o l     Room        personnel.

In a d d i t i o n ,       a    tanpoy message              was      being       relayed           to           the c r o w d       outside

at     the L e p p i n g s        Lane    end      to e a s e      back an d          not    to    push       forward against

th e    turnstiles.

About        2.40pm        the      radio      devel op ed a fault an d                     there       were      obvious

communication                  difficulties.

A    request        was        made    fo r a C o m m u n i c a t i o n s        Officer           to           attendand                repair

the     fault       and        he a r r i v e d a l m o s t     immediately.

He     restored        communications                   a n d we     were able          to    contact           officers             once

more.

The     crowd was              continuing          to    increase         at     the    Leppings          Lane       end

turnstiles,            and Superintendent                     Marshall           asked       for PC B u x t o n          to a t t e n d

In a d d i t i o n a t      2.44pm           I requested a                 traffic          mobile        to a s s i s t          and    for

continued         tannoy messages                   to t h e         crowds        outside          to    relieve            the

pressure        upon       the    turnstiles.

The    crowd      had      by now        increased              considerably and                    f ans       were       beginning           to

climb over           the w a l l s       i nt o     the        ground.

The    crowd s i t u a t i o n was                changing           rapidly,          it    h ad      increased             in

numbers,        Superintendent                    Marshall           had asked          for a v e h i c l e w i t h a P A

facility,         tannoy messages                   were        being         relayed        to e a s e         pressure,

Mounted        officers          were        having        difficulty and                   extra        resources            had       been

sent     to a s s i s t .

I looked at           the       situation           on the L e p p i n g s             Lane       terrace and                saw     there

was    r o o m for        supportrs,              and    considered              because          of     th e    deteriorating

situation whether                 or     not       to d e l a y        th e     kick    off       to e a s e         the

difficulties.               I looked              through           the C o n t r o l       Box     window           to m y       r i ght

and    saw a      half      circle           of    p r es s     photoraphers                on the        p i t c h at        the

players'        tunnel,          obviously waiting                      for      the    teams          to a p p e a r ,       a n d at

that     point,       whilst          considering               th e     position,           the       first         team     ran out

onto    the     pitch.

I considered              this    option           had been            removed.

I l o o k e d at      the       CCTV     camera          trained           on    the s e r v i c e        road at            the

Leppings        Lane       end    showing Gate                  C,     and a Mounted                officer            was    in s om e

d i f f i c u l t y as     his    horse           was    being         jostled         by the          crowd.

It w a s a b o u t        this    time,           14.47        pm,     that      the    first m e s s a g e             cam e      over       the

radio     from S u p e r i n t e n d e n t          Marshall            with a         request           to     open       the     ga te s.

I again        l o o k e d at     th e       CCTV monitor               showing         Gate        C and my            immediate

reaction was              not    to    do     this.            We    had      supporters            outside            the    ground

who    may     not    have       tickets,           some ma y           be      drunk       or w o r s e        f or    dr i n k ,      they

requests.            To    open       th e    gates       and allow              them       into       th e     ground would

defeat        our     objective               that     no one w o u l d        get    in w i t h o u t    a ticket,             who

was    drunk         or m a y      be     carrying          weapons.

The     crowd si t u a t i o n was                  extremely          difficult       and     this      was an       unusual

request,         and whilst               I was        considering           th e    position,        assessing            the

space        in th e       ground and               l o o k i n g at    the C CTV monitor,               I saw Gate C

burst        open and         supporters               enter      the    concourse          a r e a at    the    rear       of    the

Leppings         Lane        stand a n d terrace.

I remember            thinking,               ’the     g a t e ’s o p e n a n y w a y ' a      I had      not    given

permission            bu t    at    that        point a M o u n t e d          officer        retrieved         the

situation and                closed           the    gate.

A    further message                ca me       over      the     radio      from Superi n t e n d e n t         Marshall             to

open     the     gates        and       he u s e d w o r d s       to    the     effect       that    if th e      gates         were

no t    opened        someone           was     going       to    be    killed.

This     was     an urgent              message          which     conveyed          to m e    by the       tone      of    his

voice        that     this        was     a    serious        s i t u a t i o n and was a de m an d             rather          than

a    request.

The     previous           thoughts            crossed my min d              once a g a i n abo ut          monitoring            and

control         of    supporters               entering          the    ground.

It w a s a s e r i o u s           step        to    take.        I l o o k e d at     the C C T V m o n i t o r       ~ there

was     crushing           outside,            supporters          were      climbing         over    the    turnstile

w al l s ,    officers            were        under      pressure.

On     the    inside         of    th e       ground      there        was   space      in the       terrace,         there       was

space        on the        inside         of    the      turnstiles          in the      concourse,          and      r oom to

ease     th e    situation.

If the        gates        were     opened           there       may    be   crushing and            injury      on the

inside        but     the m e s s a g e         I was       receiving          from    the     outside       was      t h at

unless        I opened            the     gates and           eased      the     pressure       people       would         be

seriously            injured        or        killed.

Superintendent                Marshall              is a v e r y       experienced          police       officer       and       if

he w a n t e d       the     gates        opened,         which        is no t      normally a        consideration,
                                                                                                                              PAGE

then    the       situation must                   be v e r y   serious         in de ed.

Mhi.l't I a m          considering             the     position and             considering             the     options

Superintendent                Murray          said     to me,

"Mr.    Duckenfield,                   are    you     going      to     open    the       gates?"

I remember             standing          there       and     saying my          thoughts aloud                so    t h at

others,        if      they       heard       it,    would       realise        it w a s a c o n s i d e r e d

decision.              I s aid,

"If    there's          likely          to    bs    serious        injury       or       death     I've    no      option       but

to    open     the      gates          - open       the     gates."

Superintendent                Murray          passed this             message.

About     this         time       I heard another                radio mes sag e            from     someone         who      said

words     to      the     effect,

"It    does       not m a t t e r        whether          you    open     the     gates       or    not,      this     gate's

going     in a n y w a y . "

I was     advised            this       was    'A*     Gate.

I took       t hi s       to m e a n         that crowd         pressure         on a       particular             gate      was such

that     it w a s         in d a n g e r of          collapsing          and    people        being       injured.

My    immediate           reaction            to    that     was      that     if a g a t e        collapsed         due      to

crowd     pressure            those          immediately           in f r o n t      of    the     gate    would       fall        and

no    doubt       be      injured.            In     addition,          those     falling may             be    tra m p l e d upon

The    gate       to      the     N o r t h S ta nd was         opened and               I immediately             issued

instructions              for      extra       resources           to    be d e p l o y e d      into     that      area      to

provide        cover         on    the       landings        and      prevent        a    pitch     invasion          from      non

ticket       holders.

I also       asked        f or     manpower           for    the      perimeter           track     to m o n i t o r      the

p o s i t i on.

I watched           the L e p p i n g s        Lane       terrace        intently          for a n y      developments              as

almost       full,        but     there        was    still          some     r o o m at        the     front          of     th e    two

wing       pens.

onto       the     perimeter           track and a handful                        of     people        were       coming          out      on

to    the    track        and     walking           towards          gate     1.         They        seemed       to     be    calm and

appeared           to    stand        aimlessly         on the         track           without         any    direction.                 The

policewoman              standing            at Gate         1, w h o w a s         only a few yards                     away,        w as

totally          unaware         of    their        presence.              There         was     r o o m at       the       front       of

this       pen a n d      there        was      a need        to     open     this        g a te a n d a l l o w            these       peopl

into       th is    part     of       t he    ground.          Chief         Inspector               McRobbie          who     was      in

the Control              Room     in       civilian          clothing         went        down        on to       t he      track       to

assist        her a n d      draw          he r a t t e n t i o n     to w h a t         was     happening.

There       was     an    increasing               number       of    people           coming         onto    the        track        from

Gates       3 and 4 area.                    No r a d i o     traffic         was        being        received and                I was

still       unable        to a s s e s s        the    situation             bu t      considered            there may               have

been a        pitch       invasion            or    t ha t    people         were        being        taken       out       for      re­

location           in the        two       wing     pens.

I asked          for     Superintendent                Greenwood             to     go    to L e p p i n g s       Lane         end and

find       o ut w h a t    was        happening.              I saw        him      coming           from    the       players*

tunnel,          walking         along        the     perimeter            track         towards        th e P o l i c e          Control

Box    and       the     incident            behind      the L e p p i n g s           Lane      end    goal.            An

increasing              number        of     people     were         now     being        helped        on    to       the      track

through          the     gates        and     some were            climbing            o ve r    the    perimeter              fencing

on    to    the     tr a c k .

The    supporters            from          this     location were                 now     spilling           on to          the      track

and were           standing           on     the    grass       behind        t he       touch        line.        I was          not

aware       of a n y      radio        messages          but       then      saw S u p e rintendent                    Greenwood

standing           head and           shoulders         above         t he    people            at    the    back        of     the     goal,

presumably              standing           on a n a d v e r t i s i n g       hoarding and waving                           his arms.

He was wa v in g           hi s a r m s         and    crossing            t h e m as       he d i d        so,    Which

should       be    stopped and              I sent S u p e r i n t e n d e n t            Murray        from the            Control

Room    on to          t he    track      to     stop       th e g a m e .        I then       saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Greenwood          running           onto      the     p i t c h to        s t o p the       game.       Superintendent

Murray       then       returned          to     the C o n t r o l         Room.

I saw Of fic er s              trying       to     indicate           to    fans     in the          rear     of     th e    pens       to

move    back.

People       were       spilling          o nt o     t he    pitch and were                  moving      further            across

and    towards          the     centre         line.         I was         still     unaware          of a n y       radio

traffic       and       exactly what               the      p r o b l e m w a s , but         some      people        were        now

sitting       on the           pitc h.

The    Assistant              Chief      Constable            (Operations)             Mr.     Jackson         j o i n e d me       in

the Control             Box     and      asked       for     an app ra is al           of     the     situation.               I was

unable       to    give an a cc u r a t e a c c o u n t                of w h a t      the     situat io n was               oth e r

than a       possible           pitch       invasion which                  had    resulted           in us        stopping         the

game.

The    Asistant           Chief        Constable            (Operations)            went        to    the     pitch and a

short while             later        returned.

Superintendent                 M u r r a y was       asked       to    return        to      the     pitch a nd         try and

ge t   it    cleared           so    that      from      th e C o n t r o l       Box we        could ass e ss              the

situation,             e s p e c i a l l y as      now      people         appeared          to be on         th e    pitch who

were    injured.

An ambulance              was       requested          but     I was        unaware          of a n y    radio mes sa ge

situation.

It w a s     difficult              to a s s e s s     as    the      crowd was           flowing        onto        the     pitch       in

increasing             numbers,         police         officers            were    present,          and      there         was a

movement          of    supporters             towards         t he    centre       line.

I was       concerned about                 th e     crowd      situation:               a    difficult            situation was

developing             and we        could       not     control           th e   pitch.           It w a s    necessary            to

form a        cordon           to     continue          segregation and                 further         assistance           was

requested            to     help with             the    increasing             injuries        I could          see       in f r o n t

of me        from        the C o n t r o l        Box.

I called           for      'Operation S u p p o r t ’.                   in     turn     I was      aware       of       a request

aware        of    the      g r a v i t y of       the    situation.

I then        began         to      give     instructions                to    the C o n t r o l     Room       staff       in

I asked           for     the       Casulaty Bureau                 to    be    se t    up,    to w a r n       hospitals          of

Mr.     Jackson           supplemented my                 requests,              asking Superintendent                      Torr      to

of     the    enquiry.                I asked       for a C o u n s e l l i n g          Service          and Victims

Support           Staff.

I was        aware        of a        request       for w i r e          cutters        and    following             on    f r o m t ha t

Whilst        all        this       was     taking       place       I a s k e d PC R y a n          to    continue

broadcasting                for       calm among          the       supporters           and    for       them       to    clear      the

pitch        so we        could        determine          what       people        were       injured and where

because           th e    fans        were     milling        around and               obstructing             the    vie w.

Advertising               hoardings            were      by n o w        being     broken       up for          us e as

towards           th e    exit        by    the    police       room.

Fans    were        distressed               and a single            ambulance            was      in     position          behind

Superintendent               Murray            returned         to    the     Police Control                    Box     and    t o l d me

that     there were           many         injuries          and      possibly           some       fatalities.

I was      later       requested               to a t t e n d     the B o a r d R o o m w i t h Mr.                   Jackson,         the

I was      told    by       on e    gentleman            that        he     had    seen       two     dead       supporters            on

the     pitch.

I related         th e      s i t u a t i o n as        I saw        it at        that      time,      and       that     in m y       view

t he    game    would        have         to    be    postponed             but    t h at     I did        not w a n t        t hi s

communicating               to     th e    crowd.

The     reasons        for       this      were       that      they may           create        an addition al                public

order      p r o b l e m - at        this         stage      I did          not    have       the m a n p o w e r        to    deal

with     this - and              it w a s       essential            that     all       the    casualties               and    dead

were     removed         from       th e       area    before         any announcements                     were        made.

It w a s    agreed          the     game        would      be     postponed             but    t hat       no    o ne    in the

crowd w oul d          be    told         until       I gave         permission.               M r . Jackson             reinforced

th is,     a n d we      very       quickly           left.

I returned         to       t he P o l i c e         Control         Box     wi th ACC         (Operations)               and

continued         to m o n i t o r         the       situation.              The    rescue          was     progressing,               we

now     had f a ta li ti es          and a temporary mortuary                               had been a r r a n g e d             in the

gymnasium.

I was approached                   in the         Police        Control           Box    by Mr.        C l o u g h a n d Mr.

Dalgleish.

They     asked     for       an assessment                 of     the       situation and whether                        or    not     the

game     was     postponed.                 I told        them       it w a s m y     intention          to    postpone            the

game     but a s k e d        them        not     to    tell     anyone       and     gave my        reasons           for    this.

Mr .    Clough        left         but    I a s k e d Mr.        Dalgleish           to m a k e    an announcement                  to

the Li v er p oo l           fans        fo r    calm an d       to    bear    with        us for      the     time       b ein g .

It     is m y    view        that        this was         beneficial          to     the    operation.

The     rescue        operation             progressed and               eventually,          about         4pm     t hat

afternoon,            there         was     only       on e    casualty awaiting              transportation                  to

hospital         and        th e    point        had a r r i v e d wh ere          the     crowd     could        be    told       of

th e    situation.

I asked         for a n a s s u r a n c e          that        all    trains       and     buses     were     available             to

transport            th e    supporters            away        from the       ground,        all     available            officers

were     patrolling                the    streets         and    that     we were          ready     fo r     the      crowd

dispersal.

The     final        ambulance            left     the        ground and an announcement                       was      made       by

Superintendent                Murray            to th e       crowd    that    the m a t c h       had      been       postponed

and     they were            asked        to     leave.

The     crowd a p p l a u d e d           the     decision and            left       without       any major            difficulty.

After      the       ground         and     the    surrounding            area       had    cleared Chief

Superintendent                 Mole       arrived         and     took    over       responsibility               for     the

ground.

I left      the       Police         Control           Box     w i t h Mr.    Jackson        and wa lked across                    the

pitch     to     the P o l i c e          Room.         We m e t      w i t h Mr.     Barron,        a Director              of

Sheffield Wednesday Football                                  Club,    and    passed        comment         about       the

disaster         —    he w a s       in t e a r s       but     praised       th e    police       operation.

I left      the       football            ground        for     Force     Headquarters             about       5.15pm,

together         with        th e    Assistant            Chief       Constable          (Operations)             Mr.     Jackson

and Superintendent                       Marshall.

On arrival            at     Force        H e a d q u a r t e r s , about      5.45pm,         I met wi t h            th e D e p u t y

About     9pm        that     evening            I left F o r c e        Headquarters             f or N i a g a r a P o l i c e

not           opened           someone           was      going       to       be      killed.

This            was       an     urgent          message           which           conveyed              to me                by   the     tone       of          his

voice                 that     this       was     a      serious       situation                    and was                   a demand          rather             than

a      request.

The           previous            thoughts               crossed my mind                     once         again about                      monitoring                   and

control                 of     supporters              entering            the         ground-

It w a s ’a .serious                        s t e p to         take.           I looked              at      the              CCTV monitor                        there

was          crushing             outside,             supporters               were         climbing                    over        the       turnstile

walls,                 officers           were        under        pressure.

On          the        inside        of     the       ground         there          was      space            in the               terrace,           there was

space                 on th e     inside          of     the       turnstiles                in the               concourse,                   and    room             to

ease            the      situation.

If          the, g a t e s        were       opened            there       may         be    crushing                   and        injury        on the

inside, but                    the m e s s a g e         I was        receiving                from          the              outside          was    t h at

unless                 I opened the               gates        and     eased            the        pressure                    people          would       be

seriously                    injured         or       killed.

then     th e     situation must                    be v e r y s e r i o u s        indeed.

Whift     I am         considering              the     position and                considfering t h e           options

Superintendent                 Murray          said     to me,

"Mr.     Duckerif i e l d , ; a r e            you     going     to        open     the     gates?"                                    ^

I remember             standing          there         and     saying        my'thoughts             aloud       so   that

others,         if     they       heard        it,     would     realise            it w a s   a .considered

decision.              I said,

"If    t h e r e ’s l i k e l y         to     be    serious          injury        or    d e a t h I ’ve no     option        but

to    open      the      gates         ~ open        the     gates."

Superintendent                 Murray          passed        this      message.

About      this        time       I heard another                 radio          message       from    someone          who     said

words      Ua     th e     effect,             ’

" IJ/aoes         hot      matter        whether           you open          th e    gates      or    not,       this    gate's

I wa s     advised          this        was      'A"     Gatg/f       j

My    immediate            reaction            to    that was          that       if a g a t e       collapsed          du e    to

crowd      pressure            those         immediately              in f r o n t     of    the     gate      would     fall        and

no    doubt       be     injured.              In a d d i t i o n ,        those     falling         may    be    trampled           upon

The    gate       to     the      North        Stand       was    opened and              I immediately               issued

instructions               fo r    extra        resources             to    be    deployed         into     that      area      to

I also asked               for     rtianpower f o r            th e    perimeter            track     to m o n i t o r     the

I watched            the L e p p i n g s        Lane       terrace          intently         for a n y      developments              as

communicating               to    the     crowd.

It w a s    agreed          the    game w o u l d           be    postponed            but    t h at       no    on e    in the

game      was     postponed.            I told        them      it w a s      my    intention             to   postpone               the

ga m e    but a s k e d     them       not    to    tell      anyone         And    gave my          reasons          for        this.

Mr.      Cloufh      left       but    I a s k e d Mr.        Dalgleish            to m a k e a n ' a n n o u n c e m e n t            to

It     is m y v i e w      that       this    was     beneficial             to    the    operation.

The      rescue     operation           progressed and                eventually,              about       4pm    that                     t

t he     situation.

I a s k e d ’for        an assurance            that      all       trains        and    buses       were      available               to

transport           the    supporters          away       from       the g r o u n d ,        all    available             officers

The      final      ambulance          left     the      ground        and    an a n n o u n c e m e n t       was m ade              by

Superintendent              Murray          to th e      crowd       that     the m a t c h         had    been       postponed

and      they were         aiked       to    leave.

The      crowd ap pl a u d e d         the    decision and              left       without a n y           m a j o r :difficulty

At   10    am Wednesday,          22   March    1989,    I   attended       a    planning meeting     at

Hammerton Road Police Station,                  chaired by Chief Superintendent Mole,                 to

discuss the organisation of the F. A. Cup Semi Final tie between Liverpool

and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs.



On   Monday,       27    March     1989,   I was   promoted        Chief Superintendent         of   'F'

Division and assumed responsibilities for the forthcoming football match.



In   the    period which followed              leading to the        semi       final I liaised with

Assistant      Chief         Constable      (Operations)       Mr.      Jackson       regarding      the

arrangements.



At   10 am Wednesday,             29 March 1989,        I had a meeting with Superintendent

Murray, Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector Sewell in my office to discuss

the operational order and our arrangements for the day and to ensure these

were progressing satisfactorily.



At   2.30     pm        on   10    April   1989    I     had   a     meeting       with   the   Sector
#

    Superintendents,      representatives   from    'D'   Division,    Road    Traffic    and

    British Transport Police to discuss our arrangements.



    At 2 pm Wednesday,      12 April 1989, I held a press conference at Hammerton

    Road Police Station and met with media representatives.



    At 10 am Friday, 14 April 1989, I held a pre match briefing in the North

    Stand at the Hillsborough Football Stadium for officers of Inspector and

    above.    See Appendix 'A'.



    The purpose of this was to give a full briefing to supervisory officers and

    then for them to have the opportunity to examine their respective areas of

    responsibility and familiarise themselves with the ground.



    I conducted    the main briefing with Superintendent          Murray,      and then   the

    respective area Superintendents held their own briefings, in and around the

    ground,   dealing more specificially with their needs, and requirements of

    their areas of responsibility.



    At 10 am Saturday,      15 April 1989, I briefed the officers on duty for the

    semi final tie in the North Stand of the Hillsborough Football Stadium.

    See Appendix 'B'.



    It was a shortened version of the previous day's briefing.                Superintendent

    Murray,   Detective    Sergeant Charlesworth and Inspector Sewell            also dealt

    with matters    such as Emergency Evacuation Procedure,           Crime Intelligence,

    and Administration.




                                            - 2 -
On   completion   of the briefing I spoke with officers   in the ground and

toured the area.



I re-entered the ground about 1.15 pm and in due course made my way to the

Police Control Box about 1.50 pm and liaised with Superintendent Murray.



We left a short time later to see the referee and linesmen to advise them

of our emergency procedures.



They ..were on the pitch and eventually they left and we followed them to the

official's room.



On leaving there about 2 pm we returned to the Police Control Box and met

with Mr. Jackson, Assistant Chief Constable (Operations).



In the Control Box were the regular operators - PS Goddard, PC Ryan and PC

Bichard.



I had a general discussion with Mr. Jackson about the operation, which was

progressing satisfactorily at this stage.   He left a little while later.



About 2.30 pm, when examining the ground situation, I noted that the Spion

Kop was almost full with the Nottingham Forest fans, and that was the

general view in respect of their other areas of the ground.



A number of Liverpool supporters had obtained tickets for the Spion Kop and

were accommodated in the North East part of this section of the ground.

They were segregated from the Nottingham Forest     supporters by a line of
•   *


        police officers.



        The North Stand for Liverpool supporters was possibly half full at this

        time,   the West Stand was filling,      but there was         space at the front and

        sides   of the Leppings Lane Terrace.            I asked for   a tannoy message to be

        relayed for fans to move forward and spread along the terrace.



        I can recall about this time Superintendent Marshall asked for Leppings

        Lane to be closed and saw on the CCTV monitor the crowd situation and a

        SYPTE.double decker bus passing.



        I was   aware of a crowd build up buttraffic was still able            to flow   and I

        questioned in my mind the need for the closure.



        At   this   time there must have   been some difficulty in closing           the road

        because I remember more than one request            for this to be done as though the

        first had not been implemented.



        I was aware from the CCTV monitor of the increasing number of supporters in

        Leppings Lane and in those waiting to enter the ground.              Whilst examining

        the situation outside I visually made an assessment from the Control Box of

        the way in which the ground was filling andasked Superintendent             Murray for

        his assessment of the situation, bearing            in mind thecrowd outside and   the

        space inside at this time.



        This was about 2.30 pm and he said that with half an hour to kick off we

        should get them all in on time.




                                             -   4   -

    •   '    .



            About    this   time     I    asked    Superintendent         Murray    to    clarify with me         the

            circumstances under which we would consider delaying the kick off.



            We had      previously agreed that if there was an identifiable problem, e.g. a

            serious incident,          accident on the motorway or fog on the Pennines which

            would prevent large numbers of fans arriving on time we should consider a

            delay    as    opposed       to    those    who   had   been brought         to    the   area within    a

            reasonable time but had chosen not to enter the ground as soon as possible.



            I took the view that at this time, with all the information available,

            there were no grounds to delay the kick off.



            Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd continued to increase and I monitored

            the Liverpool fans on the Spion Kop and actions being taken by officers

            there..



            I examined the situation at the Leppings Lane End of the ground from the

            CCTV monitor and saw the increasing crowd situation.



            I was aware that action was being taken to increase the number of officers

            at   this     location     as      horses   and reserve       serials were being directed               to

            assist by Control Room personnel.



            In addition, a tannoy message was being relayed to the crowd outside at the

            Leppings      Lane   end      to    ease    back   and      not   to   push       forward   against    the

            turnstiles.



                                                                - 5 -
About   2.40    pm   the   radio    developed     a fault   and    there   were    obvious

communication difficulties.



A request was made for a Communications Officer to attend and repair the

fault and he arrived almost immediately.



He restored communications and we were able to contact officers once more.



The crowd was continuing to increase at the Leppings Lane end turnstiles,

and Superintendent Marshall asked for PC Buxton to attend with the Land

Rover which is equipped with a public address facility.



In addition,     at 2.44 pm, I requested a traffic mobile to assist and for

continued tannoy messages to the crowds outside to                relieve the pressure

upon the turnstiles.



The   crowd had      by now increased considerably and fans were beginning to

climb over the walls       into the ground.



The   crowd    situation   was   changing rapidly,     ithad   increased   in     numbers,

Superintendent       Marshall had   asked   for   a vehicle    with   a P.A.      facility,

tannoy messages were being relayed to ease pressure, Mounted officers were

having difficulty and extra resources had been sent to assist.



I looked at the situation on the Leppings Lane terrace and saw there was

room for supporters, and considered because of              the deteriorating     situation

whether or not       to delay the kick off to ease          the difficulties.     I looked
through the Control Box window to my right and saw a half circle of press

photographers on the pitch at the players'           tunnel, obviously waiting for

the teams to appear, and at that point, whilst considering the position,

the first team ran out onto the pitch.



I considered this option had been removed.



I looked at the CCTV camera trained on the service road at the Leppings

Lane end showing Gate C, and a Mounted officer was in some difficulty as

his horse was being jostled by the crowd.



It was about this time,         14.47 pm,    that the first message came over the

radio from Superintendent Marshall with a request to open the gates .



I again looked at the CCTV monitor showing Gate C and my immediate reaction

was not to do this.      We had supporters outside the ground who may not have

tickets, some may be drunk or worse for drink, they were not co-operating

with the police nor responding to our requests.                 To open the gates and

allow them into the ground would defeat our objective that no one would get

in without a ticket, who was drunk or may be carrying weapons.



The   crowd    situation' was    extremely    difficult   and    this   was   an   unusual

request, and whilst I was considering the position, assessing the space in

the ground and looking at the CCTV monitor, I saw Gate C burst open and

supporters enter the concourse area at the rear of the Leppings Lane stand

and terrace.



I remember thinking,     'the gate's open anyway': I had not given permission



                                            - 7 -
but at that point a Mounted Officer retrieved the situation and closed the

gate.



A further message came over the radio from Superintendent Marshall to open

the.gates and he used words to the effect that if the gates were not opened

someone was going to be killed.



This was an urgent message which conveyed to me by the tone of his voice

that this was a serious situation and was a demand rather than a request.



The     previous   thoughts    crossed my mind   once   again   about    monitoring   and

control of supporters entering the ground.



It was a serious step to take.          I looked at the CCTV monitor - there was

crushing     outside,   supporters    were   climbing   over    the    turnstile   walls,

officers were under pressure.



On the inside of the ground there was space in the terrace, there was space

on the inside of the turnstiles in the concourse,               and room to ease the

situation.



If the gates were opened there may be crushing and injury on the inside but

the message I was receiving from the outside was that unless I opened the

gates and eased the pressure people would be seriously injured or killed.



Superintendent      Marshall    is a very experienced police          officer and if he

wanted the gates opened, which is not normally a consideration,                then the

situation must be very serious indeed.

        Whilst     I    am   considering   the   position   and   considering   the   options

        Superintendent Murray said to m e ,



        "Mr. Duckenfield, are you going to open the gates"?



        I remember standing there and saying my thoughts aloud           so that others, if

        they heard it, would realise it was a considered decision.         I said,



        "If there's likely to be serious injury or death I've no option but to open

        the gates - open the gates".



        Superintendent Murray passed this message.



        About this time I heard another radio message from someone who said words

        to the effect,



        "It does not matter whether you open the gates or not, this gate's going in

        anyway".



        I was advised this was 'A' Gate.



        I took this to mean that crowd pressure on a particular gate was such that

        it was in danger of collapsing and people being injured.



        My immediate reaction to that was that if a gate collapsed due to crowd

        pressure those immediately in front of the gate would fall and no doubt be

        injured.       In addition, those falling may be trampled upon.



                                                 - 9 -

       The     gate    to    theNorth     Stand    was   opened   and         I   immediately      issued

       instructions for extra resources to be deployed into that area to provide

       cover on the landings and prevent a pitch invasion from non ticket holders.



       I also asked for manpower for the perimeter track to monitor the position.



       I watched the Leppings Lane                terrace intently      for   any developments as a

       result of the gates opening.



       In taking stock of the situation I looked at the West Stand and it appeared

       full.     The centre two pens of the terrace appeared to be almost full, but

       there was still some room at the front of the two wing pens.



       I saw a PC opening either gates 3 or 4 from the Leppings Lane terrace onto

       the perimeter track and a handful of people were coming out on to the track

       and walking towards gate 1.                They seemed to be calm and appeared to stand

       aimlessly on the track without any direction.                    The policewoman standing at

       Gate    1,     who   was    only   a few yards     away,   was    totally unaware      of    their
                                                                                          I
       presence.       There was room at the front of this pen and there was a need to

       open this       gate and     allow these people into this part of the ground.               Chief

       Inspector       McRobbiewho was in the Control Room in                 civilian clothing went

       down on to the             track to assist her and draw her attention to what was

       happening.



       There was an increasing number of people coming onto the track from Gates 3

       and 4 area.          No radio traffic was being received and I was still unable to

       assess the situation but considered there may have been a pitch invasion or



                                                      - 10 -
that people were being taken out for re-location in the two wing pens.



I asked for Superintendent Greenwood to go to Leppings Lane end and find

out     what   was    happening.     I   saw him   coming     fromthe players'    tunnel,

walking along         the perimeter track towards thePolice Control           Box and the

incident behind the Leppings Lane end goal.             An increasing number of people

were now being helped on to the             track through the gates and some were

climbing over the perimeter fencing on to the track.



The supporters        from this location were now spilling on to the track and

were standing on the grass behind the touch line.                 I was not aware of any

radio messages        but   then   saw Superintendent       Greenwood   standing head and

shoulders above the people at the back of the goal, presumably standing on

an advertising hoarding and waving his arms.



He was waving         his arms andcrossing them as he did          so, whichindicated to

me he wanted the game to be stopped.               I agreed the game should be stopped

and I sent Superintendent Murray from the Control Room on to the track to

stop the game.         I then saw Superintendent Greenwood running onto the pitch

to stop the game.        Superintendent Murray then returned to the Control Room.



I saw officers trying to indicate to fans in the rear of the pens to move

back.



People were       spilling onto     the pitch and were moving further across and

towards the centre line.            I was   still unaware of any radio traffic and

exactly    what      the problem was,    but some people were now sitting on the

pitch.



                                            - 11 -
 The Assistant Chief Constable            (Operations) Mr.          Jackson joined me in the

 Control Box and asked for an appraisal of the situation.                        I was unable to

 give an accurate account of what the situation was other than a possible

 pitch invasion which had resulted in us stopping the game.



 The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) went to the pitch and a short

 while later returned.



  Superintendent Murray was asked to return to the pitch and try and get it

  cleared    so   that   from    the   Control    Box   we    could    assess    the   situation,

,, especially as now people appeared to be on the pitch who were injured.



  An ambulance was requested but I was unaware of any radio message asking

  for this and was still relying on my visual assessment of the situation.



  It was    difficult    to assess     as the crowd was         flowing onto the pitch in

  increasing numbers, police officers were present, and there was a movement

  of supporters towards the centre line.



  I   was   concerned    about   the    crowd    situation:     a    difficult    situation   was

  developing and we could not control the pitch.                It was necessary to form a

  cordon to continue segregation and further assistance was requested to help

  with the increasing injuries I could see in front of me from the Control

  Box.



  I called for 'Operation Support' .             In turn I was aware of a request for a

  fleet of ambulances, and             as a result of that message I became aware of



                                            - 12 -
the gravity of the situation.



I then began to give instructions to the Control Room staff in conjunction

with Mr. Jackson for the implementation of the Major Disaster Plan.



I asked for the Casualty Bureau to be set up,              to warn hospitals of the

large number of injuries, any doctors in the ground to Leppings Lane goal

for   deployment, 'off   duty   police     officers   to   be   called   to   duty   and

rendezvous at Hammerton Road Police Station.



Mr. Jackson supplemented my requests, asking Superintendent Torr to attend

in respect of the Casualty Bureau; Detective Chief Superintendent Addis to

attend to co-ordinate the investigation side of the enquiry.             I asked for a

Counselling Service and Victims Support Staff.



I was aware of a request for wire cutters and following on from that the

attendance of the Fire Service.




Whilst all this was taking place I asked PC Ryan to continue broadcasting

for calm among the supporters and for them to clear the pitch so we could

determine what people' were injured and where because the fans were milling

around and obstructing the view.



Advertising hoardings were by now being broken up for use as stretchers and

injured people were being removed across the pitch towards the exit by the

police room.

       Fans were   distressed and a single   ambulance was   in position behind the

       Leppings Lane goal.



       The Fire Service cleared a gangway near the Police Control Box in front of

       the South Stand to remove casualties from the ground by a more expedient

       route.



       Superintendent Murray returned to the Police Control Box and told me that

       there were many injuries and possibly some fatalities.



       I was later requested to attend the Board Room with Mr. Jackson, the ACC

       (Operations), and left Superintendent Murray in charge of the operation in

       Police Control.



       We attended the Board Room within the Directors Lounge at the football club

       and saw officials of both clubs and the F.A.



       I was asked for an assessment of the situation and I told them there had

       been a serious incident and a large number of casualties.



       I was told by one gentleman that he had seen two dead supporters on the

       pitch.



       I related the situation as I saw it at that time, and that in my view the

       game would have to be postponed but that I did not want this communicating

       to the crowd.



       The reasons for this were that they may create an additional public order



                                         - 14 -

            problem - at this stage I did not have the manpower to deal with this - and

            it was essential that all the casualties and dead were removed from the

            area before any announcements were made.



            It was agreed the game would be postponed but that no one in the crowd

            would be told until I gave permission.          Mr. Jackson reinforced this, and we

            very quickly left.



            I returned to the Police Control Box with ACC (Operations) and continued to

            monitor the situation.       The rescue was progressing, we now had fatalities

            and a temporary mortuary had been arranged in the gymnasium.



            I was approached in the Police Control Box by Mr. Clough and Mr. Dalgleish.



            They asked for       an assessment of the situation and whether or not the game

            was postponed.         I told them it was my intention to postpone the game            but

            asked them not       to tell anyone and gave my reasons for this.



            Mr. Clough left but I asked         Mr. Dalgleish to make an announcement to the

            Liverpool fans for calm and to bear with us for the time being.



            It is my view that this was beneficial to the operation.



            The rescue operation progressed and eventually, about 4 pm that afternoon,

            there was   only one casualty awaiting transportation to hospital and the

            point had arrived where the crowd could be told of the situation.



            I asked   for   an    assurance   that   all   trains   and buses   were   available    to



                                                     - 15 -

              transport the supporters away from the ground, all available officers were

              patrolling the streets and that we were ready for the crowd dispersal.



              The    final      ambulance   left   the    ground     and   an   announcement   was   made   by

              Superintendent Murray to the crowd that the match had been postponed and

              they were asked to leave.



              The crowd applauded the decision and left without any major difficulty.



              After., the ground and the surrounding area had cleared Chief Superintendent

              Mole arrived and took over responsibility for the ground.



              I left the Police Control Box with Mr. Jackson and walked across the pitch

              to    the    Police   Room.    We    met    with Mr.    Barron,    a Director of Sheffield

              Wednesday Football Club, and passed comment about the disaster - he was in

              tears but praised the police operation.



              I left the football ground for Force Headquarters about 5-15 pm, together

              with        the   Assistant    Chief       Constable     (Operations)     Mr.    Jackson      and

              Superintendent Marshall.



              On arrival        at Force 'Headquarters,       about    5-^5 pm, I met with the Deputy

              Chief Constable, Mr. Hayes, and in due course the Chief Constable.



              About 9 pm that evening I left Force Headquarters for Niagara Police Sports

              Ground to meet the Minister for Sport who was due to arrive by helicopter

              to meet with the Chief Constable.

    He arrived about 10.20 pm and I escorted him    to the football groundwhere

    he met with Mr. Wright, the Chief Constable.



    I was present whilst he toured the ground and met   with the press.



    When he concluded his visit to the footballstadium,     I   escorted him   to

    Force Headquarters to see Mr. Hayes, the Deputy Chief Constable.



    I returned to the Police Sports & Social Club at Niagara and counselled

    officers who had been involved in the events that afternoon who had just

    retired from duty.



    I eventually returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and went off duty at

    1.30 am.

            they say they will                not    be allowed         into the       ground.

            Ladies- and G e n t l e m e n



            The     event      tomorrow           is the FA Cup Semi                    Final    beteen Liv e r p o o l      and

            N o t t i n g h a m Forest.             The      kick off          is at 3 o ’clock           this a f t e r n o o n and

            the     gates will              be open at            12    noon.



            However,          there will             i nevitably           be a number          of supporters who arrive

            e arly and we             shall       have a certain number                       of gates      in all     parts     of the

            ground thay will                 be     capable            of opening        from    1 1   am and we will

            end e a v o u r    to get         people         into       the ground as quickly as                  possible.



            I must      stress         that       if s upporters               do not     have a -ticket          then w h a tever

            they     say they will                ‘
                                                  n ot      be a l l o w e d    into     the ground.



            Tha ground has a capacity of 3 4 , 0 0 0                                  people.     It     is an a l l - t i c k e t

            m a t c h and all          tickets             have    been sold so there                  is no   room for anyone

            who does          not have a ticket                    because we will              break     safely     limits.



            The     stadium has             been d i v i d e d to ensure m a x i m u m s e g r e g a t i o n a n d               to

that     end w hich          is the Leppings' Lane End.



The N o t t i n g h a m Forest           Supporters           have    been a l l oc a t e d tickets              -for the

Spion-Kop,           which      is on my         right?       and    the S outh S t a n d „ w h i c h          is

To ensure          that      suppo r t e r s     from N o t t i n g h a m . F o r e s t      do not     flow along

the     back      of the S o u t h S tand and                towards L e p p i n g s Lane End we have

created a sterile                 a rea along         the     back of that              stand.



Tickets are            c o l o u r- co de d and       clearly        identified for              the sections           of

the g r o u n d , and w h e n a sked for advice you should examine                                       the     ticket

and give          i n f o r m a t i o n a c c o r d i n g 1y .    Copies     of the tickets              are     on

                 a little       different.           Buses will        be    parked outside            the ground      in

        S a f e t y of s u p p o r t e r s   in this   ground   is p a r a m o u n t .

        No b o d y gets     in w i t h o u t a ticket.

        N o b o d y takes a drink or banners              into the ground and            nobody goes   in

        who    is drunk.

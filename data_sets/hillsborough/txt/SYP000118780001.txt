Noticed       Spion          Hop       two    thirds          full.           West          Stand        and       North       Stand

virtually             empty       in    comparison.                 My       attention              at       this     time      was          drawn

to    the    North          Stand       end       of    the       Spion       Kop       which        was       occupied             by

numerous          Liverpool             fans.

I remained             in    this       location             (my    unit          still        being          on    S / B ) when             I

received          a    message          to    attend          at    the       turnstiles                 Leppings             Lane       with

full    unit.

On    arrival          at    'A"       gate       there       were       a    lot       of     people          milling          about             who

had    come       through          the       turnstiles.                 Inspector                  Bennett           was on         t o p of t h e

wall    assisting             supporters                who       were       climbing               over        it.        I was

approached             several          times          by    fans    who          physically                 (by    poking          me       etc.)

and    verbally             abused       me.       Some       were       saying             "You'll           have       to    do    something

outside,          people          are    getting             crushed          or       someone           will       be    killed."

Others       screamed             "Open       the       bloody       gates             before        you       kill       somebody."

The    majority             smelt       strongly             of    intoxicants                and        the       smell       seemed             to

fill    the       air.

Although          I did       not       receive             any    requests             for     ambulances                or    medical

treatment             I noticed          that          several       of       these          fans        were       holding          their

chests       and       sides       and       were       physically                hurting.               I    realised          there             were

obvious       problems             outside.                 There    was          no    access           from       *A * or         'B*          gates

because       of       the    build          up    of       fans    outside.                 I therefore                 started             to     make

my    way    to       'C ' g a t e      being          continually                abused            on       the    way. W h i l e               en r o u t e

1    heard    a       message          over       the       radio    "Open             the     gates          at    the       rear       of

Leppings          Lane       Terraces".                 I hurried             towards           C    gate          and    once       outside

my    attention             was    immediately                drawn          to    the       crowds           attempting              to         get

through       the       turnstiles.                    Leppings          Lane          at    this        time       was       just       a       sea    of

people.           The       fans       were       shouting          and       screaming              as       they       were       being

crushed       against             the    barriers.                 Other          officers           were          trying       to       puli

some    of    the        fans      under          the       barriers          who       had     tickets             in    their          hands.

I    immediately             went       to    their          assistance.                    The: f a n s       we     pulled          out         were

                                                                                                                                         R239

fed     through          ',C*    gate       via    the       horses       who       were       outside          that       gate.              At

this     time       I noticed           that       there       were       several             hundred       fans          on    t he

bridge        at    Leppings           Lane       and    Superintendent                   Marshall          was          stood          on    t he

bridge        parapet.,           I d o n ’t k n o w          how    many       fans          went    through             "C        gate          at

this     time       because           I was       too    busy       pulling          fans       out    of       the       queue.              I

wasn't        aware       of     any    sudden          surge,        I then             looked       across             the    queues

and     saw    'B*       gate     open.           The    crush       seemed          to       subside       quite          a    lot          when

the     fans       went     through          but    the       gate    was       only          open    for       a       short       space             of

time.

I    then     heard       a message           via       the    radio          requesting             all    personnel                   to    come

inside        the       ground.         I    immediately             went       and       joined       my       serial          who          were

at     "A"    gate.        We     ran       down    the       back    of       the       North       Stand          through             the       first

aisle        and    down        the    steps       of    the    stand          leading          to    the       pitch.              On

entering           the    ground        I saw       a    cordon       of       police          officers             on    the       field

near     to    the       Leppings           Lane    goal       and    a       lot    of       fans    milling             about          on       t he

perimeter           track        and    field.           I    immediately                thought       there             had    been          a

pitch        invasion.            With       my    serial       we    were          to    strengthen                the    cordon.

It w a s      not       until     a    short       time       later       a    police          officer          came       to       me       and

said     people          are     dying       in    there,       we'll          have       to    do    something,                    I

immediately              went     to    the       fence       and    saw       people          crushed          up       against             it.

Some     appeared           to    be    in    a    bad       way.     No.       4    safety          gate       was       open          and       I

immediately              went     to    assist          police       officers             who    were       trying             to       drag

fans     through          it.

The     fans       I helped           through       were       badly          shaken,          apart       from          one    who          needed

resuscitation              and        looked       in a       bad    way       but       this    was       carried             out       by       a

St .    Johns       Officer.            I am       unable       to    say       if       he    died    as       I       left    him          in

the     care       of    that     officer          and       another          police          officer,              I    cannot

describe           him    and     have       policed          football          matches          at    Hillsborough                      on       and

off     for    20       years,         I have       never       seen          Leppings          Lane       so       congested                near

to     kick    off       time,         I am       familiar          with       the       layout       of    the          ground.
                                                                                                                    page   :

  I am    unable          to    say    what      time    the    turnstiles         were    opened.

  The    radio -communications                    were    intermittent            but    I h a d n ’t g o t   an    ear

  piece       so   I am        unable      to    comment       on   the    overall       reception      but    th e

  noise       from    the       crowd      was    deafening         and    I had    to    put   my   radio     to     my

  ear    to    hear.

  I have       never       been       to   a match       where      we    have    been    so    overwhelmed         by

  thousands          of    fans       at   the    last    minute.          They    were    determined         to    get    in

  the    ground       at       all    costs.

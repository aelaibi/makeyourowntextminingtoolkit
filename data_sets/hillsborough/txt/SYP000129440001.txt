Rugby League Grounds


Please find attached information in respect of the two Rugby League
Clubs in South Yorkshire which are to attract designation under the
above Act.

In respect of Owlerton Stadium a subsequent visit revealed that improve­
ment was necessary to means of escape from a Judges box positioned
in the roof of the stand but this is only used in connection with
Speedway and Dog Racing events and would probably not be within the
scope of the proposed designating order.

The Don Rugby Ground is to be made subject of a more detailed inspection
and a copy of any report produced will of course be sent to your
Department.

       Further to your request for information regarding the undermentioned sports
       ground.

       Don Rugby Ground,
       Tatters field,
       Bentley Road,
       Bentley,
       Doncaster.

       Construction - Brick walls steel framed, roof asbestos sheeting on steel
                      trussing, terrace - part timber, part concrete.

       Me»"s of Escape -    Satisfactory from the terrace area, however, the number of
                            unit widths of exit from the stand should be increased and an
                            improvement could be made to the underside of the stand by
                            providing some degree of fire resistance between the licensed
                            bar and the terrace.

       This ground is to be the subject of a more detailed report at a later date.

                                As you are aware, it is the policy for the Officer Working Parties to make
                                routine inspections of the Football League Grounds in South Yorkshire
. :   ..          -             twice yearly, roughly on a summer/winter basis.

              ■   ' -/.i        Accordingly, arrangements have' now been made for the following
                                inspections to take place

                                Date                                           e and Ground

                                                                         the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

                                Wednesday 23rd February 1983             2.30 p.m. at the Millmoor Ground of the
                                                                         Rotherham United Football Club Ltd

                                Thursday 24th February 1983               2.30 p.m. at the Bramall Lane"Ground of
                                                                          the Sheffield United Football Club Ltd

                                Perhaps you would kindly arrange to be represented at both Headquarters
                                and Divisional levels as usual.

                                So far as the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club Ltd. is
                                concerned, you will recall that this was inspected as rec^tly as
                                21st December. Unless you have any views to the contrary,''I intend to
                                regard that visit as the routine winter visit.                 _

                                This leaves the Belle Vue Ground of the Doncaster Rovers Football Club
                                Ltd. As you will recall, it appeared in October, 1982, that the Club were
                                now anxious for the Officer Working Party to prepare a Report on the
                                Ground for them. However, since that date, the climate has cooled,
                                possibly connected with the on-going discussions between the Clubs and the
                                Police Authority on police charges. As it appears likely that these will
                                soon be concluded to the Clubs' advantage, I will raise the Safety of
                                Sports Grounds Act aspect again with the Club shortly. The Ground is not,
                                of course, yet designated by the Secretary of State. Accordingly, in
                                the absence of conditions being sue# that there is a need;for the County
                                Council to seek an emergency order under Section 10 of the Act from a
                                Magistrates Court, real progress can only be made with the Club*s
                                voluntary co-operation.   -

Subject       Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975                                           Date             23.1.81



            ^ Confirming the recent telephone conversations between our respective
            ^'offices, I recently contacted the League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire
             /to suggest, that a twice-yearly regular programme of visits, to their grounds
             by the Officer Working Parties should be introduced* namely, early in..the
              calendar year and also in the middle of the year. The reasons for doing
              so given to the Clubs.were, firstly, to maintain public confidence in their
              safety at football grounds and, secondly, to obviate the real possibility
              of Club’s carrying out works which may prove abortive or require additional
             work on designation.

              Whilst it is appreciated that the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club is
              currently in a different position to the other four Cliibs f(having,been
              already designated and issued with a General Safety- Certificate), as
              discussed, the following arrangements have been agreed:-

                       Tuesday,                 10.00 a.m.                         Hillsborough Stadium

              first round of routine visits.

further to tha telephone conversation between your Mr, Vaughan
and my Senior Fire Prevention Officer I encloae a copy of the
draft report for comment submitted in another Authority area
to a ground designated under the above Act. It would aaem a
reasonable method of providing detail to non-deeignated clube
within South Yorkshire following surveys which it ia hoped we
will be permitted to undertake in the near future.

Unfortunately I need to arrange the return of the document in
the near future and therefore request that it be returned.

Safety of SporteGround* Act 1§7S                                    2.1,79



I thank you for your letter dated 22nd December, 1978, end the copy
latter ofthe Building Surveyor of tha ShsffisldPlatropolitan
District Council.

It would seem eesentiel that the officers of the County Council and
Metropolitan District Council involved in the production of the
general safety certificate required by the Sheffield Wednesday
football Club wider the above Act, undertaks a comprehsnsive survey
of the ground. I feel sure that it would be beneficial to the Club
if« initially, each depertment acted in unison in this raspset
rether than eeperately and I would Make the nscesaary arrangementa
with my officers for this to be achieved.

A copy of the report of each department ehould be provided to eech
involved department to enabls problems to bs discusssd so that an
accepted approach might bs determined and consolidated into a single
report which ehould be forwarded to the Club.

This report, together with that of Dr. Eaetwood, would form the
baeis of e further meeting with officials of the Club as differences
of opinion, if any, would have been identified.

It is my opinion that the nscessary comprshenaiv* survey could not
be undertaken satisfactorily without plan drawings. In this respect
I refer to paragraph 1.3 of the 'green code's

"The problem of crowd safety at football grounde ie complex and
cannot be solved sisply by ensuring that each component of a ground,
such es stairs, passages or sections of terracing, ie satisfactory
in itsslf. The inter-relation of components is essentials they
ehould be compatible end combine to form a balanced unit".

Following the receipt of drawings I suggsst that Officsrs msst to
agrss on identification procedures. In order thet each department
ie eble to identify perto of the ground in a uniform manner, I
would prefer to have etanda and terraceo clearly identified, exit
routee, peeeeges, gangways, gateweye, doors, etc., numbered in e
consecutive manner and stairways lettered.

Officars of the County Council and Metropolitan District Council
havs visitsd ths ground and I bslieve that further vifiite should
be pert of the comprehensive survey. Findings from visits othsr
than the survey referred to will be limited and if wa involve
ouraalvae in eoneultation with the Club following the submission
of Dr. Eaatweod'a report with limited information this could
prove unfortunate in the longterm.

As previouely mentioned I prefer to await the provision of the
plan drawings which havs already bean requested and if any
action can be taken to expedite this mattes it would ba
appreciated.

As decided at the meeting of the Working P a rty on 4th A pril, 1978, the
Sheffield United Football Club had been supplied with a copy of the Notes for
Guidance of A pplicants for Safety C ertificates and requested to supply the
n ec essary inform ation in the standard form and type req u ired by the County
Council.

The correspondence with the Club since (copies of which had been circulated
to the Working P arty) showed that all of the plans which the Club had supplied
to the County Council at various stages had been retu rn ed to them. As would
be seen from the late st le tte r which the County Council had sent to the Club
(dated 8th August, 1978), an offer had been made for the Working P a rty to
m eet the Club to review the situation on a p relim in a ry basis without any kind
of com m itm ent by the Club. No reply had yet been received from the Club.

specified in the Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) O rd er, 1978 by which
the Club had to make application.

T h ere was no tim e lim it specified in the Act in which the County Council had
to determ ine the application, but it was understood that the intention was that any
n ec essa ry w orks should be c a rrie d out in the close seaso n in the sp rin g /su m m e r
next y ear.

The Club had been requested by le tte r dated 13th Septem ber, 1978, to supply the
n ec essa ry inform ation in the standard form and type req u ired by the County
Council se t out in the Notes for Guidance of Applicants for Safety C e rtific ates.

l_j______ Method of Working

F o r the benefit of those rep resen tativ es attending the Working P a rty for the
f irs t tim e, it was recalled that the County C ouncil's powers and duties under
the Act had been delegated to the F ire Service Com m ittee. At a m eeting on
8th Jan u ary , 1976, that Com m ittee had decided that its functions should be
ex ercised initially through officer Working P a rtie s for each of the Borough
Council a r e a s , consisting of rep resen tativ es of the F ire Service, the Police
and Building Surveyors of the Borough Council, with co-ordination being under­
taken by the County C ouncil's A dm inistration D epartm ent. An agreed division
of respo nsibility for the various asp ects of the Act was contained in a Schedule
previously circu lated .

2 . ______ G eneral   Safety C ertificate

The A dm inistration D epartm ent had already circulated a draft G eneral Safety
C ertificate which it was intended to subm it to the F ire Service Com m ittee for
approval as the standard South Y orkshire County Council G eneral Safety
C ertificate.

The W orking P a rty d iscussed the observations put forw ard on the d raft, and
agreed on the am endm ents which should be made.

IT WAS AGREED - T hat the A dm inistration D epartm ent would p rep are and
circu late a second d raft G eneral Safety C ertificate for consideration by the
Working P a rty with a view to subm ission for approval by the F ire Service
Com m ittee a t th e ir Novem ber meeting.
3.        Sheffield United Football Club Ltd.

As decided at the m eeting of the W orking P a rty on 4th A pril, 1978, the
Sheffield United Football Club had been supplied with a copy of the Notes for
Guidance of Applicants fo r Safety C ertificates and requested to supply the
n e c e ssa ry inform ation in the standard form and type req u ired by the County
Council.

The correspondence with the Club since (copies of which had been circulated
to the Working Party) showed that all of the plans which the Club had supplied
to the County Council at various stages had been retu rn ed to them . As would
be seen from the la te st le tte r which the County Council had sent to the Club
(dated 8th August, 1978), an offer had been made fo r the W orking P a rty to
m eet the Club to review the situation on a p relim in ary basis without any kind
of com m itm ent by the Club. No rep ly had yet been received from the Club.

jL______ Sheffield W ednesday Football Club Ltd.

Following the designation by the S ecretary of State of the H illsborough Stadium,
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd had forw arded a form al application
dated 8th Septem ber, 1978 (copy circu lated to Working Party) for a G eneral
Safety C ertificate. T his was well in advance of the date of 1 st Jan u ary , 1979,
specified in the Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) O rd er, 1978 by which
the Club had to make application.

T h ere was no tim e lim it specified in the Act in which the County Council had
to d eterm ine the application, but it was understood that the intention was that any
n ecessary works should be c a rrie d out in the close season in the sp rin g /su m m e r
next y e a r.

The Club had been requested by le tte r dated 13th Septem ber, 1978, to supply the
n e c e ssa ry inform ation in the standard form and type required by the County
Council se t out in the Notes fo r Guidance of Applicants for Safety C e rtific a te s.

(O     use the address system for Police purposes and such purposes will have
       priority over the Specified Activity.

       I note in Part II, Paragraph 2 of the certificate that the holder shall
       not allow‘'spectators" to be admitted to the stadium unless a specified
       activity is taking place.    I think consideration should be given to the
     ^ fact that this would preclude the club from opening the ground to sell
      '"tickets, for example, when a football match is not taking place or to
       use the premises for o ther purposes than during the football season,
       which is often the case with Sheffield Wednesday.

     ( I would also like to draw your attention to Paragraph 9 of Part II of
       the proposed certificate, which deals with fire exit doors and other
       matters and allows for gates to be locked, provided that each door or
       gate is manned at all times by a steward who has a key.   I am not
       altogether happy about fire exit doors being allowed to be locked, although
       there may be very good grounds for allowing this practice.

      Finally, I would draw.your attention to the fact that there does not
      appear to be provision in the certificate for laying down the maximum
      number of people who may be allowed to attend specified activities, and
      I would expect that the capacity of the ground should be stated and the
      numbers that are allowed to be in particular parts of the ground.  A guide
      to this was done in 1970, when the Hillsborough stadium was examined and
      a report on crowd capacity was prepared by Husband     & Co.,     Consulting
      Engineers, and the conclusions in that report were agreed by the then
      Chief Constable, Mr. Barker, the overall capacity being 55,000.


      Yours faithfully

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

    I have received the Club's application, signed by the Chairman, for a General Safety
    Certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975.

    For your information, the County Council had heard nothing from the H o m e Office
    since early August and the receipt of the Club's application prompted a telephone
    enquiry of the H o m e Office who revealed the existence of their letter dated 23rd August
    to both Clubs and Local Authorities. As this had evidently been received by the
    Club but not by the County Council, I asked for a copy to be forwarded on, and this has
    been received today.

    It is hoped that a meeting of the Officer's Working Party (involving the Police, the
    Fire Service, the District Council Building Surveyor) will be held shortly to give
    preliminary consideration to the matter, after which I will get in touch with you. In
    the meantime, you will recall that I enclosed with m y letter of 20th July, 1978, a Note
    on the type of detailed information and plans which the County Council will require for
    consideration of the application.

                                                   Yours faithfully,




                                                   Chief Executive

        Dear Sir

        HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO. 136/78 - THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS
        (DESIGNATION) ORDER 1978

       The first designation order under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act was made in 1976,
        n a m i n g the international football grounds and those of the clubs in the First
        Division of the Football League, and this was followed by a further order made last
        year naming the grounds of the clubs promoted into the First Division at the end
        of the 1976/77 football season.       As will be seen from the enclosed copy, an order
        has now been made (S.I. 1978 No. 1091), designating under the Act, with effect
        from 1 January 1979, the grounds of two of the clubs which were promoted to the
        First Division at the end of last season (the ground of the other promoted club,
    ' ' Tottenham Hotspur FC., having already been designated in the 1976 order); and
        also the ground of Sheffield Wednesday FC by virtue of its quasi international
        use.       The grounds of the clubs which were relegated from the First to the Second
        Divisiori remain subject to their relevant designation orders.

        2.   Guidance as to the procedures to be followed in dealing with applications
        for general safety certificates and special safety certificates was provided in
        Home Office Circulars No. 130/76 of 26 August 1976 and No. 187/76 of
        8 December 1976 respectively.

        3.   Local authorities may feel that a similar pattern of timing may be applied
        as was adopted for the football grounds designated under the previous orders and
        that depending on the condition of the stadium and having regard to the powers
        available to them under section 10 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 to
        deal with cases of severe risk, the issue of a general safety certificate might
        with advantage be deferred until after the next close season ie, in the case of
        these 3 clubs not before August 1979. ' In order to give the clubs every opportunity
        to carry out the necessary work beforehand, however, local authorities will wish
        to bear in mind that clubs will need to be notified at the earliest possible date -
        preferably well before the end of the playing season - of the work which is
        coneidered necessary to ensure reasonable safety for spectators.

        *f.  For your information a copy is enclosed of the letter (but without the
        enclosures forwarded to you in 1976) which has been sent to the 3 clubs whose
        grounds have now been designated.

    Dear Sir

    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT:
    DESIGNATION ORDER 1978

    The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (a copy of which is enclosed) implemented
    the main recommendations contained in the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd
    Safety at Sports Grounds which was prepared by Lord Wheatley following the serious
    accident at Ibrox Park football ground in 1971.   The main instrument of control
    under the Act is the general safety certificate which will be needed by every
    sports stadium which is the subject of a designation order.   The county council,
    by means of the certificate, will be able to impose such terms and conditions as
    are necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the ground having regard
    to all the circumstances.

   2.   The international association and rugby, union football grounds and those of
   the clubs in the First Division of the Football League and in the Scottish Premier
   Division were designated in orders made in 1976, which were followed by further
   orders made last year naming the grounds of clubs promoted into the First Division
   and into the Scottish Premier Division at the end of the 1976/77 football season.
   As will be seen from the enclosed copy, an order has now been made designating
   under the Act the grounds of two of the clubs promoted to the First Division at
   the end of last season (the ground of the other promoted club, Tottenham Hotspur FC,
   having been designated in the 1976 order) and also the ground of Sheffield
   Wednesday FC by virtue of its quasi international use.    Your ground is included.

   3. It is an offence under Section 12(1) of the Act to admit spectators to a
   designated stadium after the date on which the designation order relating to it
   comes into operation unless an application for a general safety certificate has been
   made.   Any such application should therefore be made before 1 January 1979 when
   the designation order becomes effective.   For this purpose one of the enclosed
   application forms should be completed and sent with supporting documents (as
   indicated in paragraph 1 of Appendix A to this letter) to the county council.    The
   application then falls to be dealt with in accordance with the Act and the Safety
   of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 (copy enclosed).

        Once the application has been made, and pending the issue of a general safety
   certificate, spectators may continue to be admitted to your ground as at present.
   As will be seen from the enclosed copy of a Home Office Circular to the Chief
   Executives of County Councils, attention has been drawn to the advantage, in
   appropriate cases, of deferring the issue of the certificates until the beeinnin* of
   the 1979/80 season.
5»   Guidance as to the procedure to be followed on Blatters connected with your
application for a general safety certificate is set out in Appendix A to this
letter.

SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES
                                                                    •

6.   After a general safety certificate has been issued, the need could arise
for an event which is not covered by the terms and conditions in that certificate
either b e c a m e the activity itself is not named therein or the terms and
conditions normally applicable to that activity are considered inappropriate for
the special occasion in question.      The Act provides for special safety certificates
for this purpose and guidance on the procedural matters concerning them is contained
in Appendix B to this letter.

7.   It should be borne in mind that, except with the permission of the local
authority, an application for a special safety certificate must be made at least
3 months before the event.   This period is necessary to ensure that no person will
be deprived of his rights of appeal under the Act, in cases where the full
procedure for which the Act and Regulations provide requires to be accommodated.
The period can therefore be relaxed only in cases where it is apparent that individual
stages of the procedure will not be required,.eg where the applicant has already
been accepted as a qualified person.   It has also been necessary, in order to keep
the length of the required notice down to an acceptable level, to apply a strict
limit to the time available for each stage of an application for a special safety
certificate.

8.   In the light of the foregoing considerations, clubs and local authorities will
no doubt consider that the need for special safety certificates should as far as
possible be reduced by widening the scope of the general safety certificate on the
basis suggested in paragraph 6 and 7 of Appendix A but that, where they continue to
be required, applications should normally be made by the holder of the general
safety certificate (rather than the independent promoter of the special event),
giving as much notice as possible.

9.   Once a general safety certificate is in being, all the requirements relating
to special safety certificates including the requirements of at least 3 months
notice automatically have effect.   Clubs will wish to bear in mind the possible
difficulties that could arise if a special event were scheduled to be held at the
ground within 3 months of the grant of the general certificate.   Local authorities
should therefore be made aware of any such event which has already been arranged or
which is arranged within the next 6 months or so, so that they may as far as
possible provide for the requirements for that event to be covered in the general
safety certificate.   Otherwise there could be insufficient time remaining for a
special certificate to be considered.

FEES

10.   Section 6(1)(b) of the Act provides for regulations to be made as regards
the fees to be charged in respect of applications for safety certificates, and in
accordance with the general policy that local authorities should be able to charge
economic fees for the work undertaken, Regulation 14 provides accordingly.   However,
by affording clubs an opportunity to co-operate to the full by, say, preparing
plans, checking crush barriers etc, local authorities should not in the normal
course find it necessary to charge fees representing more than 17 man/days work.

11.   A copy of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) which was published
in December 1976 is enclosed for your convenience.

12.   A copy of this letter has been sent to the Chief Executive of the County
Council for your area.

APPENDIX A

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The Regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall be
made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the like
effect.   Copies of the form are being made available to potential applicants and they
are being advised of the need to provide such information in support of their applica­
tion as will enable the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act. In
particular, the application should be accompanied by detailed information as to the
structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, including plans of the stadium, certificates
relating to the testing of crush barriers and evidence of the applicant’s status.
It is, however, open to a local authority, under section 3(*0 of the Act, to require,
by notice in writing, such further information of this kind as it may consider
necessary to enable it to determine the terms and conditions to be included in the
certificate.

2.   On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local
authority must first determine w hether the applicant is a quali fied person, ie a
person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and
conditions to be imposed in the certificate.    If it considers him to be such a person
the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.
In the case of a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not
paramount, the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.
In any event, it seems prima facie unlikely that an application for a general safety
certificate would be mad© by an unqualified person.    There is, however, a right of
appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is not a
qualified person (see paragraph 10 ).

3.   The local authority is required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of
any application for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate
Chief Officer of Police and b u ild in g authority, and must consult them about the
terms and conditions to be included in the certificate*         In framing such conditions,
local authorities will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines
set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football).         In this connection
local a u th o r itie s are reminded that, as has been stressed on previous occasions,
this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be rigidly applied
regardless of individual circumstances.         The maximum flexibility should be maintained
to take account of the different circumstances at individual grounds deriving from
differences in such matters as age, size and mode of construction.         In this regard,
it should also be noted that the Act provides that the terms and conditions should
be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety" and it would be
unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute safety of everyone
attending the sports stadium.

     It is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the local
authority and the club in the process of drawing up the certificate conditions.
In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is rarely filled to capacity, the
local authority may consider it proper to base its requirements on actual levels of
attendance over a given period rather than on maximum capacity.   On the rare
occasions on which a capacity crowd could be expected, separate provision might be
made for this contingency on the lines indicated in paragraph 7 below.   Again, if




                                          1
a stand were found to be structurally weak, the local authority might, in
consultation with the club, offer the choice of having any necessary remedial works
carried out_or_of restricting admission to the stand until it had been strengthened.

5.     As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content of a
safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the individual
case.     Accordingly, a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate.   It
must however contain full details of the terms and conditions imposed including,
in particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and have annexed
to it a plan of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be
framed. The certificate when first issued may contain restrictive* conditions which
can then be relaxed or deleted by amendment of the certificate.     The local authority
may find it convenient to list, in an annex forming part of the certificate, such
modifications as will be subsequently permitted, eg in the form of a statement of
the increased spectator activities to be allowed for the separate sections of the
ground when the various stages are completed, of any future works programme for the
ground which has been agreed with the club.     Care must be taken not to exclude from
tfriA certificate any restriction germane to current conditions, since section 5(3)
of the Act provides for an interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State
against the inclusion of anything in, or the omission of anything ffcom, a safety
certificate, and these rights must not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of
 the form of the certificate.

6.   As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the Act
provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different activities.
Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a football ground, in
cases where it is also used from time to time to stage other events it would be
desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special safety certificates, if
the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were to be included in the
general certificate.   It is suggested that any such events for which it is
considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided into 2 classes:

      (1)    Those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
             stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;

      (2 )   Biose of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
             concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being
             given over to spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and
             conditions will have to be devised.   It is not, of course, necessary
             to provide for these contingencies in cases where no clear need is
             foreseen by the stadium authorities.

7.    Thttre may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable
 to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a
 special event, such as a cup tie of a "local Derby", is expected to attract
 significantly more than the usual attendance.    In the case especially of cup
-replays these special events may arise with only a few days’ notice, within which
 it would not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure
 appropriate to the grant of a special safety certificate.    In order to o v e r c o f N ^
 this difficulty, it would seem desirable for the local authorities and clubs to
 seek to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions
 which might be appropriate to such occasions, eg the admission of increased numbers
 to certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed, that
 notice is given to the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their
 incorporation in the general safety certificate*
8.   Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to th®
determination of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal
amendment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder
of the certificate or of the local authority (see section k{2) of the Act) and will
presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the original
certificate.   It will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities and clubs
for a close liaison to be maintained after the issue of the certificate and certainly
while any further works of safety measures are being carried out.   It is likely to
be in the clubs' financial interest to get the safety certificate amended as
soon as possible after work has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure
that the local authority is kept informed of progress.   For ita part the local
authority will no doubt wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following
completion of the work, the certificate can be amended without delay.

9.   After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the
transfer of the certificate to another person.   Similarly, while a local authority
is considering an application for a certificate and before the certificate has
been granted, it may be asked to substitute some person other than the original
applicant as the person to whom the certificate should be granted.   These are,
however, likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certificates,
where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club by an authorised
official of the club.   However, if it does happen, the local authority will be
required in both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified
person.   Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the regulations
relating to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply
together with any necessary appeals procedure.   In the second case, there is no
reason why the local authority should not treat the application in all respects as
a new application and process it from the point it had already reached.

10. In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety
certificate against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see
paragraph 2 above), which, of course ,1 applies also in the case of a proposed
transfer of a certificate, the Act provides a further right of appeal to any
"interested party" (which term includes the holder of the safety certificate)
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.     The
regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of
any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following receipt of a notice of
the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified,
the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating
in the locality.

11. In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or
amending a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain
specified "interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press.
It is regretted that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of
advertising, but, since Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition
which it provides of "interested party", no other means could be found of ensuring
that all persons who might validly claim to be "interested parties" within the
meaning of the Act should be able to acquaint themselves with the local authority’s
decision, and failure to bring the decision to their notice could result in a
denial of their rights of appeal or of a hearing by the Secretary of State.    For
the same reason a similar obligation has been imposed on an appellant (by
Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing to
appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section 5(*0 °f
the Act is required to give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.




                                     3
12. Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the appeal.
It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with Regulation 8(9), to
inform the Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether it wishes to oppose
the appeal.   With any such notice, the local authority is required to submit its
reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state whether it wishes a
hearing under section 5 (*0 of the Act.  (The procedure governing the conduct of
all such hearings is set out in Regulation 10.)

13. It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to
order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in Regulation 12.

    APPENDIX B

    SAFKTY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

    PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


    1.   The regulations provide that an;r application for a safety certificate shall
    be made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the
    like effect.   Copies of the form have been made available to potential applicants.
    Part II of the form and its frontispiece should be completed in the case of
    applications for special safety certificates.    In any case where an application for
    a special safety certificate is not made by the holder of the general safety
    certificate, it should be accompanied by evidence of the applicant's status.
    Details of any planned changes to the normal standing and seating arrangements for
    spectators should be provided, together with such further information in support
    of the application as is considered necessary to enable the local authority to
    discharge its functions under the Act.    However, it is open to a local authority,
    under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, b y notice in writing, any further       M
    information of this kind which they may think it necessary to have to enable them
    to determine the terms and conditions to be included in the special safety
    certificate.

    2.   A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates is
    that, once ttelocal authority has determined that an applicant is a qualified person,
    the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory, whereas the issue of a
    special safety certificate remains at its discretion.   But an applicant has a right
    of appeal to the Secretary of State against a refusal (see following p arag rap h s for
    details).

    3.    An application for a special safety certificate should normally be made at
    least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
    discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied that
    the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
    Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser period
    eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person.    On receipt of an
    application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
    determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be i n ^ ^
    a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed in
    the certificate.    The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make this
    determination within 14 days of receiving the application.    There is a right of
    appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is not a
    qualified person (see paragraph 9), and, under regulation 5» the applicant must be
     furnished with the reasons for such a determination.

    4.   It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused
    on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person.   This decision
    must, in accordance with regulation 6, be made within 28 days of the receipt of the
    application, not only in cases where the local authority has determined that the
    applicant is a qualified person but also in those where it has determined that he
    is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to be considered.   There is also
    a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds other than a determination that the
    applicant is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9)»   In the event of such a
    refusal, the local authority is again required, under regulation 6, to give the
    applicant the reasons for its decision.




                                           1
5»   When the first two stages have been completed, should it have been decided that
a special safety certificate should be issued, the local authority is required, by
section 3(3) of tbs Act, to send a copy of the application to the chief officer of
police and to the building authority and to consult them about the terms and
conditions to be included in the certificate.    The special safety certificate must,
in accordance with regulation 6(2), then be issued not less than 28 days before the
proposed event is due to take place.

6.   The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary
according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
certificate would not be appropriate.   (In suitable cases, however, regard may
be had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)
on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 °f the note relating to the "Procedure
Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates1’ at Appendix A.)  Any
special safety certificate must, however, contain full details of the terms and
conditions imposed, including in particular the matters referred to in section 2(2)
of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where appropriate by
reference to the plan attached to the general safety certificate.
            i
7.    Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determination
of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amendment of
the certificate.    This may be on the application of the holder of the
certificate or at the discretion of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the
Act).    This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
certificate,otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has been
issued well in advance of the event to which it relates.    Any such amendment must,
however, be publicised as indicated In paragraph 10 below.

8e   Considerations of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate
to another person an equally unlikely contingency.   Any possible difficulties in
this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the general
safety certificate applies for the special certificate.    Nevertheless, should an
application for transfer be made, the local authority must decide within 14 days
if the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it decides to the
contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating to giving notice of,
and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will the appropriate appeals
procedure, should the need arise.   In the case of an application for transfer
before a special safety certificate has actually been issued, there is no reason
why the local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new
application and process it from the point already reached.

9.   Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a determina­
tion that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3) and against the
refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4).    In addition the Act
provides (in section 5(3)) a right of appeal to any ’’interested party" against the
inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety'certificate
or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.    Bie regulations
provide that, in the case of a special safety certificate, notice of any such
appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice of the local
authority’s decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified, the
publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper circulating in
the locality.

10. As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so to
amend it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also to

Further to your memorandum regarding the draft Safety Certificate to be
issued lay the County Council I wish to make the following observations
and will be available for discussion as requested.

Paragraph 3 (e)

It is felt that public collections ou^rt to be approved by theCounty
Council to enable some form of control to be applied.

Paragraph 5 (i)

The inclusion of "as soon as possible thereafter" after 14 days would
appear to weaken the 14 day requirements.

Paragraph 6

Comments as for Paragraph 5 (1)*

Paragraph 7

The requirements to aigapoat the First Aid Hoorn may be unnecessary
as experience has shown that persona who are unwell are referred quickly
to stewards, first aid men or police men who are aware of its location.

Paragraph 9

Referwere to "means of escape" principles and as such should be with the
agreement of the Chief Pire Officer,
The second sentence suggests that doors may be locked and manned by a
steward with a key. This is not considered favourable and there are
alternative arrangements which may be put in hand to serve the requirements
of this situation.
It is considered preferable that the time in minutes prior to the end of
a specified activity when gates should be opened should be identified
(between 10-15 minutes), as the ability to have them opened earlier, if
necessary, is contained in the remainder of the paragraph.

Exit signs forming parts of the means of escape should be referred to

          4th August 1978


          Dear

          SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

          I thank you for your letter dated 1st August 1978, regarding the content of
          the draft of the proposed certificate.

          It would seem that the Chief Constable has more influence in the safety
          provisions in your area than here.   His involvement in defining the number
          of first aid assistants required and the provision of exit signs seems
          particularly strange, but as some local policy decision has evidently been
          established in this respect, it would seem improper of me to make further
          comment.

          With regard to paragraph 9, I must inform you that I am not in favour of
          exit doors or gates for spectators being locked.   I do accept that there
          is a need for security at such places and that fastenings will be necessary,
          but the time taken to locate the key and unfasten and remove the lock whilst
          a large crowd, possibly in an excited state, due to an emergency situation,
          descends upon the steward, is likely to be excessive under these circum­
          stances.

          Whilst not wishing to preach "Leicestershire ways” we have found that this
          problem can be overcome in a way that has satisfied the football club.    I
          enclose a simple sketch drawing which indicates how a swivel bar held in
          brackets will provide security on gates whether they open in an inward or
          outward direction, but give easy opening facilities when required.   When
          the stadium is closed to the public the gate may be locked and this can also
          be achieved as indicated on the sketch plan.

         This method of securing gates has been in use for numerous seasons without
         any problems.

         Locally we have required stewards, readily identifiable by dress, to be in
         attendance on exits throughout the time that spectators are in the Stadium,
         two where a gate has been accepted opening inwards and one where a gate
         opens outwards.

                                                                                                                         / continued
                                                                          !      sow     rH YORKSHIRE

The above was the paragraph on which I had particularly strong feelings,
but the following are also slight differences to your proposals.

In paragraph 3(e) we felt that public collections should be approved by
the County Council to enable some form of control to be applied.

In paragraph 5(i) at least 14 days was considered necessary by the Police
to enable the necessary calculations for Police Officer requirements to be
made and plans established.

In paragraph 6 "at least 14 days'* would agree with the above comment whilst
"or as soon as possible thereafter" weakens the "at least 14 days" require­
ment.

With reference to paragraph 7, we have not signposted the first aid room
from all parts of the stadium as experience has shown that persons who are
unwell are referred quickly to stewards, first aid men or policemen who
are aware of its location.   Signposting suggests that spectators will be
allowed to seek out the first aid roan without supervision which could
reduce control.

With further reference to paragraph 9, it is considered preferable that the
time in minutes prior to the end of a specified activity when gates should
be opened should be specified (between 10 to 15 minutes) as the ability to
have them opened earlier, if necessary, is contained in the remainder of
your requirement.

In sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 10, I note the requirement that exit signs
shall be illuminated by both main and emergency lighting systems.

When adequate natural light is available I think that the requirement to illu­
minate exit signs is unrealistic.   Subject to the size of lettering being
sufficient (0.3 m (1 ft.) or 0.45 m (1*6") ), I believe that natural light
will normally suffice.

It is reasonable, in my opinion, to equate the need for such illumination to
the need to put on the floodlighting system to assist the players.

The illumination of such signs on the failure of the main lighting under any
circumstances is realistic and a matter with which I agree.

It will be realised from the above that this authority's requirement in this
respect differs slightly with that proposed by foiar authority.

In paragraph 12(1) I believe that the word "will" should be added between
"which" and "be" on line 1.   I note no provision of paragraph 13.

I do not believe that the certificate under this Act will supersede any
requirement of the Licensing Justices relating to the sale of intoxicating
liquor in the Stadium.   Although the principle established by paragraph 20(1)
is agreed, to be absolutely correct we have preferred to add "or as allowed
by the Licensing Justices" to our condition.

It is possibly a little naive of me but I was not aware that any grounds in
South Yorkshire had been designated tinder the Safety of Sports Grounds Act,
1975, but the general terms and conditions which you have forwarded to me
have much to be commended.

I hope that my observations are considered useful.

    D ear Mr. Walker,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

    I thank you for your le tte r dated 2nd August, 1978.

    I re g re t that a search of the files has not revealed any specific reference to the
    fact that M r. Fox and his colleagues indicated that they would be prepared to
    accept the plans of the B ram all Lane Stand and New South Stand. However, I note
    your rem ark s that the scale and detail of these plans should not p resent any
    problem in the preparation of single line drawings. This being so, and provided
    the plans relate to what actually exists and not m erely what was proposed, I see
    no real problem to the plans being accepted.

    If you feel it would be useful, I would be m ore than happy to arrange for the
    Officer Working P arty to m eet yourself and such other officials of the Club as
    you feel necessary to review the situation on a prelim inary basis without any
    kind of commitment by the Club.

                                                             Yours sincerely,

    Dear Mr. Walker,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

     I thank you for your le tte r of 26th July, 1978.

    As you say, Mr. Fox did endeavour to arrange for my A rchitectural and Building
    Services Division to commence work on the preparation of single line drawings.
    However, this proved to be m ore difficult than had been envisaged, due both to the
    numerous different scale plans forwarded at various stages and to staffing
    difficulties in the Division. Certainly, they had been nowhere near completed by
    the time the Division were instructed not to take any further action following the
    Club (in September 1976) deciding not to proceed.

    In the circum stances, I would agree with your suggestion that it might be as well
    if all the plans in my possession were to be returned to you, complete, for a full
    review and discussion of the situation.

    I look forward to hearing fu rth er from you.

                                             Yours sincerely,




                                             Chief Executive.

Dear Mr. Mallett,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

I refer to your letters of l^th April, 20th June and 20th July, 1 9 7 8 . We
are aware that tax relief is available under Section ^9 of the Finance
(No. 2) Act, 1975 for expenditure in connection with the safety certificate
for sports grounds which have been designated under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act, 1975« We are also aware that an amendment in connection with,
the current finance bill will extend this concession to similar expenditure
incurred since 1st August, 1975 in respect of grounds not yet designated.

My Directors are still considering your earlier letters and it may be that we
would ask, in view of the problems associated with the plans submitted to you
to date, that these are returned to us, complete, for a full review and
discussion of the situation to take place with you and other interested parties
involved.
                                       i
Accordingly, please assure us that these are readily available if required.
We would remind you that Mr. Fox, the Administrative assistant dealing with
the earlier submission and his colleagues from other departments indicated
that they would be prepared, on the Council's behalf, to accept certain plans
already on file, i.e. the Bramall Lane Stand and New South Stand, would you
confirm that this is still acceptable.

I will write to you again indicating whether the Club intends to proceed
informally under the Act when my Directors have reached a decision, which
will be during the next two months.

Yours sincerely,______

Dear Sir
                        Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975


You will recall at the last meeting of Metropolitan County
Secretaries held in Newcastle, I distributed copies of a
draft Certificate which had been prepared in my Department,
I have now had further thoughts about the form of the draft
and have amended it slightly. A copy of the amended draft
is enclosed. Do you have any observations about the new
form of draft?
You will notice that one alteration removes the disclaimer and
the new certificate now certifies that the Stadium is reasonably
safe for spectators provided that the terms and conditions
imposed are complied with. I am making sure that the GMC's
insurers either confirm that the existing policies cover the
GMC .in respect of any claim arising from a person injured
at a certified stadium and at which stadium certain precautions
are found to be inadequate. If any additional premium is
thought to be payable as a result of providing such insurance
cover, I feel that such annual premium in respect of each stadium
should be capitalised and added to the application fee. Do
you have any observations about this point?

I also feel that there should be insurance cover to meet claims
by any persons injured in sports grounds in circumstances
where the Authority knew there was a risk of danger but took
  no action or inadequate action under Section 10 of the Act.

Do your Authority have any further views about fees? The current
view of Officers in the GMC is that each application will require
29 man-days to deal with. Tyne & Wear are of the opinion that
each application will require 60 man-days.

Please let me know if you have any comments to make about the above
or any other matters concerning the enforcement of the Act.


                                      Yours faithfully,

                   With regard to the question of insurance cover in respect of any claim arising from a person
                   injured a t a certified stadium , and in respect of no or inadequate action under SectionMXJ,
                   the County T reasurer has discussed this with the County Council's in su rers, and has been
                   assured that we are covered by our existing p olicies ( and that no estiva premium would
                   be payable.

                   On the question of fe e s , our Working Party have had two long d iscu ssion s on th is, and
                   decided,           unanimously t that they would favour a standard fee of about £700, based
                   on the salary of a P .0 .1 (c ) officer for 17 man/<&ys. In recommending th is, they w ere
                   fully cognisant of the likelihood that it would tzikc considerably more time than th is. The
                   County T reasurer, however, somewhat predictably, takes the view that w© should charge
                   in full for actual work done* However, a s we have no grounds in South Yorkshire which
                   a re within the fir st Designation Order, the Treasurer seem s inclined to keep h is options
                   open by deferring a report to the appropriate Committee until som e firm decisions have
                   been made by Local Authorities who have F irst Division grounds in their a rea s.

Subject     Safety in Sports Ground Regulations 1976                                  Date    1 Nov 1976


            With reg ard to the recent d isc u ssions, between M essrs Fox and Monks, of
            your D epartm ent, and Mr|             of my D epartm ent, in resp ect of the above,
            I set out below an estim ated unit cost for s e rv ic e s to be provided, and my
            re se rv a tio n s, from a financial viewpoint, on the fu rth er action required before
            the regulations a r e enforced in th is a re a .

            The charge for an APT & C officer of your D epartm ent should be 8. 9p per
            hour p e r £100 sa la ry . The built in overhead's elem ent of th is paym ent has
            been based on the 1976/77 Revenue E stim ates fo r D epartm ent of A dm inistration,
            and while the sa lary /o v erh ead s ratio rem ains constant then the above
            form ula will autom atically take account of each y e a r's inflation. This figure
            should not be regard ed as firm a t this stage in the light of fu rth e r asp ects which
            need to be considered.
            An example of the charge to be made under this form ula would b e:-

            Grade POl (c) - say £6,369 p er annum
            ch arg e p er hour   8.9p x 6, 369 = £5.67
                                         100
            charge for 17 m an/days work
                                                                                        I V/
            £5.67 x (37 x 17) =                      £713
                     5                                                                  \l
            It should be noted that the basic 8.9p does not include any elem ent of
            c le ric a l support or superv isory staff; th erefo re, tim e spent by these persons
            would need to be sep arately costed in addition to the m ain ch arg e, if stadium
            authorities a re to be charged on an economic b asis.

           I feel, however, that, before any costs can be finalised, a policy decision
           should.be taken by County Council as to whether it should be on an economic
           b a sis o r that this function be treated as a " se rv ic e " and an ap p ro p riate fixed
           charge decided. At th is point, may I draw your attention to paragraph 14 of
           SI 1263, which sta te s that the charge should not be in excess of the work
           actually done. F u rth e rm o re , as an exam ple of past policy, the County Council
           m akes an economic charge for F ire Brigade Special S erv ices, other than those
           on hum anitarian ground. In addition, in making a decision, the County Council
           should be aw are of the d istric t co u n cils’ req u irem en ts, from a financial
           viewpoint, as otherw ise the County Council could possibly recoup from, the
           stadium authorities le ss than that sum required by the d is tric t councils.

                NOTES FOR GUIDANCE OF HOLDERS OF
                     SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   It .is important that you should-know all the provisions of
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. This Act does not
specify what is required at your Stadium..This information will
be found in the booklet "Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds ^
Act" (as amended) obtainavle from HMSO. This booklet is not
a legal document, but the type of Safety Certificate issued
to you wj 11 be determined by the Local Authoncy with
reference to it. Unless, therefore, your Stadium meets
the requirements of the booklet for the number of spectators
which you wish to admit, the Certificate will only permit a
lesser number' to be admitted. .

2.    The A c t I creates several offences
      (a)   contravening any term or condition of a
            Safety Certificate;
      (b)   admitting spectators to a Stadium when a
            Safety Certificate is not in force or nas
            no*t boon appli6d for* or in con’tr&VG'rrtxon of
            a Court Order;
      (c)   failing to give notice of alterations .or
            extensions to a Stadium;

      (a)   obstructing an authorised officer.
     All offences carry a maximum penalty of £400 fine (on
summary conviction. The first two offences also carry penalties
of either a fine or a maximum of two years imprisonment
on conviction by indictment.
3.   Note that, in addition to the requirements of the
Safety Certificate you are also required to comply with
general statutory provisions. For example, although the
Safety Certificate permits collections as an ancillary activity
to football matches, you may also need the consent of the
District Authority in accordance with regulations before
collections. You will also need Justices Licences for the
sale of intoxicating drinks, planning consent and conserrc under
the Building Regulations,

 4.   Changes of Conditions
      Authorised officers have power to inspect premises to which
 the Act applies to see whether conditions therein have changed
 to the extent that the safety measures for spectators are
 diminished.
 5.   Regardless of this, however, you must inform the Local
 Authority in advance if you are proposing to make alterations or
 extensions to the Stadium and any of its installations which
 may affect the safety of spectators and obtain all necessary
 planning consents etc.
Rights of Appeal

                           Dear Mr. Mallett,

                                                                        Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

                                 I refer to your letter of the 28th July.   At ray Directors' Board
                          Meeting last Thursday, the Directors considered the matter of proceeding
                          further on the work for designation and as the club do not fall within
                          the arabit of the first designation order, i.e. the work to be completed
                          by the end of the next playing season, they have decided for the time
                          being to leave it in abeyance.

                                 I am sure you will appreciate it is a most costly exercise to
                           provide the information, siirveys, etc. necessary and it is an expenditure
                           the club can ill afford.

                                                                                                                      Yours sincerely,

          With reference to Mr.          telephone conversation with Mr.           yesterday,
          I confirm that a tetter has been received from the A ssociation of Metropolitan
          A uthorities, intimating that the Home Secretary has revised his original
          intention, and now proposes to restrfc&the fir st designation order, to be made
          next month, to international and first division grounds.

          M r.      has, however, spoken to the Secretary of the Sheffield United Football
          Club, and he w ishes tis to proceed, rather than leave the matter in abeyance,
          ia the hope that the work w ill be complete or virtually complete by the tim e the
          second designation order is made. Accordingly , when the single line scale
          drawings which are being prepared are available, I w ill call a meeting of the
          working party to examine them and fix a date for the commencement of the
          detailed inspection.

          I also confirm that Mr.        las inspected the Stainforth Greyhound Stadium and
          has found that the reconstruction^plans for which w ere approved in 1975, has
          recently commenced. I think we should examine the plans, and hold a meeting
          of the Doncaster Area Working Party to ensure that if any al|e»s£iaji® to plans
          are required to comply with the requirem ents of the A ct, the developers are
          notified before they proceed too far with the reconstruction work. I am informed
          by the manager of the stadium that a se t of plans is held by your Doncaster
          Divisional O ffice, and I shall be glad if you w ill have a look at them and Inform
          Mr.       when you are ready for a meeting to be convened.

on Monday last, I confirm that the attendance at Owlerton Stadium has been agreed
by the Working Party at a maximum of 11,000, made up as follows

(-)    Panorama Bar                                                200
       Sealing in front of Panorama Bar                          1,200
(C)    Popular Enclosure                                         2,800

This figure has been arrived at having regard only to the considerations of
structural safety and means of escape in an. emergency, the question of lighting,
fire precautions, fire warning systems etc. to be dealt with when a more detailed
inspection is made, and is conditional on manned barriers being established at
the following points

(a)    At the west end of the closed south terrace, adjoining the Greyhound
       Bar.

(b)    At the east end of the closed south terrace, to prevent access from
       spectators on the Far Terrace.

(c)J At tfe northern end of the Far Terrace, approximat ely two metres
     from the Sportsman's Tavern, so as to allow an emergency means of
     escape between the barrier find the Tavern, from the Popular Enclosure.

                                    2,


It was agreed that when the following works have been carried out to the
satisfaction of the Working Party, admission to the Greyhound Terrace could
be increased from 800 to 1,800;-

(a)   The removal, or alteration of the solid barrier in the centre of the
      Greyhound Terrace, to the satisfaction of the Chief Building Surveyor
      of the Sheffield City Council.

(b)   The formation of an emergency means of escape at the rear of the
      Greyhound Terrace, leading to a concrete apron and steps outside,
      in view of the nature of the existing terrain. Details to be agreed with
      the Chief Fire Officer.

(c)   The addition of steps to the concrete apron outside the emergency exit
      from the Greyhound Bar.

(d)   Work to increase the fire resistance of the Greyhound Bar, which has an
      unprotected limber floor, supported on unprotected R.S.J's over the beer
      and liquor stores and general stores. Such work to be to the satisfaction
      of the Chief Fire Officer and the Chief Building Surveyor of the Sheffield
      City Council.

The carrying out of this work would, therefore, increase the agreed capacity of
the Stadium to 12,000, and as mentioned at the meeting on Monday last, this
figure could be increased further by the carrying out of further works, such as
the provision of crush barriers on the Popular Enclosure and the Greyhound
Terrace, and the provision of satisfactory concrete terracing on the South
Terrace, but these are matters which will be dealt with on the projected detailed
inspection, after which you would be informed of the exact nature of the works
required , and the numbers by which they would increase the capacity of the
Stadium, so that you would be in a position to judge the economic viability of
each improvement.

Will you please let m e know when it will be convenient for the detailed inspection,
which it is anticipated will not take iess than two days, to be carried out.

                                    Yours faithfully,

       the Safety of Sports Grounds Act'*, obtainable from Her Majesty's

       Stationary Office.     The following points are particularly important,

       but reference should be made to the Act itself for authoritative

       Meeting of forking Party on Safety of Sports Grounds Act. 1975



Sheffield Sports Stadium. Owlerton

Folloxfing on the request from the Sheffield Sports Stadium Limited for a safety
certificate covering an attendance of 15,000 for "stock car" racingcommencing
10.5.76., a survey was carried out at the ground on the 13th April, 1976. In
attendance at this survey xfere representatives of the Police and Fire Brigades,
together with Mr. Fox representing the South Yorkshire County, Messrs. Kills and
Sheriff (Building Surveyors Division, Sheffield M.D.C.) and representatives of
the stadium management.

The stadium was looked              at from two aspects

1.    Opening of "stock car" racing with a first meeting on 10th May, 1976, and
      involving a request to increase the maximum attendance from a previously
      agreed 1 2 , 5 0 0 to 15,000.

2.    The requirements which would be required before a certificate under the
      "Safety in Sports Grounds Act, 1975” could be issued, with a view to the
      management carrying out a phased programme of repairs and improvements over
      a period.

No clear decisions were taken following the survey but a further meeting of the
Working Party was arranged for 2.00 p.m. on the 23rd April, 1976, in the Building
Surveyor's Office., Town Hall, Sheffield.

The following matters need to be discussed and decisions made at this meeting:-

(a)   With regard to Item 1 above, a survey carried out in 1973 by the Local
      Authority and a consultant employed by the operators resulted in some
      strengthening work to remove structural defects, and while these certainly
      fulfilled the very limited aims, they did not involve a complete structural
      assessment, or full assessment for crowd safety, fire safety, means of escape
      etc., but as a result of it a crowd limitation of 1 2 , 5 0 0 was agreed.

      As no further work has been carried out there would certainly seem to be no
      basis for any increase in that figure and, indeed, the indications are that
      possibly a reduced figure should be imposed.

(b)   With regard to Item 2 above, no plans or details have been provided by the
      operators and these would obviously be required before any survey leading to
      possible certification could be undertaken.

(c)   Certain points became obvious during the very limited and quick survey which
      was carried out which indicated that further work would certainly be required
      in the following areas

      The two bar/restaurants do not meet the requirements with regard to surface
      spread of flame or fire resistance, and i;he bar at the south end (Sherwood)
      has an unprotected timber floor supported on unprotected R.S.J's over the
      beer/liquor stores and general stores.

      The crush barriers generally consist only of 2-j4' diameter tubular construction
      which appears inadequate to withstand the specified forces, and they are below
      the height recommended in the guide.

      The south terrace is in an extremely dilapidated condition and is stated not
      to be used. Arrangements will be needed to ensure that access could not be
      gained to this area.

      In the eastern terrace the slope, rise and going of the terracing appear to
                                                                              %«
                                     -   2 -



    meet the requirements, but in the western terrace the treads slope towards
    the ground and this is considered to represent a danger in crowd conditions,

    With regard to this stand the escape distance from the seated area appears
    to be excessive and there is a degree of obstruction at' one of the final
    exits.

    The race notice board at the south end appears, on a visual inspection, to
    be rather dilapidated and further examination is required.

Prom all of the above it is obvious that a full ‘structural survey of the whole
stadium will be required, and it would seem that the operators should consider
appointing their consultants to do this in conjunction with the surveys carried
out by the responsible authorities.

This note only takes into account the comments from the very quick survey carried
out by the building authority representatives, and no doubt the Police and Fire
Brigade representatives will have points to add to it. It will, however, provid^^
sufficient information for the Working Pssrty to arrive at some decisions on the
Joints in question.

REPORT OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE                                 FIRE SERVICE COMMITTEE
                                                              8TH JANUARY 1976


               SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT ,1 9 7 5


With referen ce to my rep o rt to this Com m ittee on the 6th November, 1975, furth er
consideration has been given to the detailed arrangem ents which it will be necessary
to im plem ent once the S ecretary of State has begun to designate sports stadia as
requiring safety ce rtific ate s under Section 1 of the Act. D iscussions have taken
place between rep resen tativ es of the A dm inistration D epartm ent, the P olice, and
the F ire Service, when it was agreed that because of the considerable amount of
liaison work which w ill be n ecessary between the respective sp ecialist d ep artm en ts,
i . e . , P olice, F ire , and Building Inspectors of D istrict Councils, it is desirable
that the work of co-ordination should be undertaken by the A dm inistration
D epartm ent.

F rom initial consultations which have taken p la c e , it would appear that the S ecretary of
State, in his f irs t designation o rd er, will not, ap art from c e rta in international
grounds, go beyond 1st and 2nd Division football grounds, and th erefo re the only
one with which the County Council will be concerned in the f irs t instance will be the
Sheffield United ground. P resum ably it is intended, at a la te r date, to designate
the grounds of clubs in low er Divisions, and th ere would appear to be no reason
why the County Council should not, in due co u rse, if they think it desirab le, ask the
S ecretary of State to include other sp o rts stadia in subsequent O rd ers.

Because of the County Council's lim ited initial involvement, it is s till my opinion
that no in crease in sta ff will be required, but this m ust be qualified by the proviso
that the situation w ill need to be kept under observation, and a fu rth er re p o rt will
be made if it is n e c e ssa ry to rev ise this opinion as a re su lt of the designation of
fu rth er sp o rts stad ia by the S ecretary of State.

It has become obvious from initial discussions, that safety certificate s will n e cessarily
be lengthy and complex docum ents, containing many conditions, and it is accordingly
proposed to se t up working p a rtie s of officers from the A dm inistration Departm ent,
P o lice, F ire Service, and the D istric t Council, in each D istric t, to m eet when the
various disciplines concerned have c a rrie d out th e ir inspections and form ulated
th eir recom m endations, in o rd e r to se ttle the form of the safety certificate to be
subm itted to Com m ittee.

The Act provides that the County Council have a duty, when an application for a safety
ce rtific ate is received to determ ine w hether the applicant is a p erso n likely to be in
a position to prev en t contraventions of the te rm s and conditions of the certificate.
Your officers a re of the opinion that, certain ly so fa r as football grounds a re
concerned, applications should be subm itted by the perso n in beneficial occupation
of the p rem ises concerned.



                                  -   1   -
A fter a safety certificate has been issued, it will be necessary, from tim e to tim e,
to c a rry out inspections to ensure that the conditions a re being com plied with.
The frequency of th ese inspections will obviously have a bearing on the staffing
situation, but it is suggested that a detailed check should be made a t the end of each
season, followed by another about a month before the s ta r t of the next season
to ensure that any d ep artu res from the requirem ents of the certificate found on the
fo rm er inspection have been rectified. A part from th is, it is felt that a couple
of m ore g eneral checks during the season should be adequate.

The County Council, the appropriate D istrict Council and the Chief Constable a re
empowered to authorise en try of th eir officers to sp o rts stadia for the purpose
of m a k in g inspections. A fu rth er re p o rt on this and on the question of fixing fees
(if any) to b e charged for applications will be subm itted a t a la te r date.

In an em ergency situation, where there is a ris k to sp ectato rs, the County Council
has the pow er to apply to a M ag istrates1 Court for an O rd er prohibiting o r re stric tin g
the adm ission of sp ectato rs until steps have been taken to reduce the ris k to a
reasonable level. Even with v ery careful m onitoring of all sporting activities
taking place in the County, it will not be possible to p red ict ev ery potentially
dangerous situation, which m ay becom e apparent a t sh o rt not! ce, and too late to
p e rm it the making of an application to the M agistrates to lim it the gate ( e . g . , if
B arnsley played on a Saturday a t Leeds in the F . A . Cup and d rew , and the replay
was on the following Tuesday). It w ill be n ecessary , th erefo re, for your officers
to examine the situation in an endeavour to identify a ll potentially dangerous
sp o rts grounds, and if n ecessary , make applications in resp e c t of them as they a re
identified.

To su m m arise, th erefo re, the Com m ittee a re asked to adopt the following
recom m endations: -


1.     That the work of co-ordination be undertaken by the A dm inistration
       D epartm ent.                                                                              (

2.     T hat working p a rtie s of officers be constituted for each D istrict, as
       outlined in this rep o rt.

3.     T hat the suggested frequency of inspections be approved.

Dear Sir,

|H0ME OFFICE CIRCULAR No. 5/1986 - SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS

As requested in Home Office Circular No. 5/1986, I have
enclosed the proformas Annex C.   These have been completed
in respect of all premises within South Yorkshire and cover
undesignated outdoor sports stadia and grounds with stands
with a capacity for over 500 persons and indoor sports
premises used to accommodate more than 500 spectators.

In completing the proforma for the outdoor premises listed,
it should be appreciated that many of them will rarely
ever accommodate that number in practice.

Yours faithfully,

Dear S i r ,

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR No. 5/1986 - SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS

As requested in H o m e 'Office Circular No. 5/1986, I have
enclosed the proformas Annex C.     These have been completed
in respect of all premises within South Yorkshire and cover
undesignated outdoor sports stadia and grounds with stands
with a capacity for over 500 persons and indoor sports
premises used to accommodate more than 500 spectators.
                               •          .
In completing the profprma for the outdoor premises listed,
it should be appreciated that many of them will rarely
ever accommodate that number in practice.

Yours faithfully,




Chief Fire Officer

 Dear Sir

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

 I attach for your information a copy of a letter dated 7 February 1986 to
 Doncaster Rovers Football Club in respect of the Rossington end of the
 ground.

 The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Mr W Jackson, has also asked
 if you would think it appropriate to have a meeting to discuss the
 'Popplewell Final Recommendations', inviting the Fire Service and perhaps
 legal representatives of the district councils.

 Yours faithfully




 Superintendent
 (Operations)

  Dear Sir

  I refer to your letter dated 21 January 1986 in respect of the
  Rossington end of the ground.

 As indicated by the Safety of Sports Grounds Act Officer Working
 Party in the minutes of the meeting dated 2 August 1985, public order
 problems will certainly be created if visiting supporters have to be
 accommodated in any other part of the ground. It was therefore felt
 necessary, in addition to other ground improvements, to construct two
 new pens at the Rossington end capable of securely holding 2000
 visiting spectators.

 Having regard to present segregation problems within the ground, it
 is not possible to acconrnodate more than 1000 visiting supporters
 unless the second pen is to be provided.

 Whilst there may be few occasions on which you could anticipate more than
 1000 visiting supporters attending at present, I would not be able to
 exceed this figure unless these further inprovements are made at the
 ground, thereby ensuring spectator segregation and safety.

 Yours faithfully

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Background

Wheatley Report

1.   The terms of the Inquiry extended to sports grounds generally but because the
immediate concern at the time related to soccer grounds, its Report concentrated
on crowd safety in such grounds, and included Rugby Union and Rugby League grounds.
Lord Wheatley had no doubt, that the then existing controls over safety at
football grounds were inadequate.    He found that the voluntary system of certifi­
cation of grounds introduced by the Football Association some years previously laid
down no requirements as to the competence of persons who carried out the annual
inspections of grounds and there were no guidelines to assist those persons in
their assessment of safety standards.    Moreover, a review of the statutory provisions
relevant to the safety of spectators at football grounds convinced Lord Wheatley
that the law also fell short of providing proper and effective control over
football grounds as a whole.     The building regulations, for example, provide for
the basic structural safety of new buildings within a football ground but they do
                                                                not apply to existing
buildings, except where alterations are to be carried out, nor do they apply to a
ground as a whole.   In any case, most football grounds were built before national
building regulations were introduced.


2.   Lord Wheatley concluded that only a specially devised statutory scheme could
ensure comprehensive controls at football grounds in the interests of safety and he
recommended a statutory licensing system.    He proposed that these controls should
be introduced by stages, the larger or more important grounds, broadly speaking,
being dealt with first.   Lord Wheatley also recommended that there should be a
right of appeal for the clubs concerned against any decision of the licensing
authority.   The Report showed Lord Wheatley's awareness of the need to reconcile
the paramount aim of ensuring the safety of spectators with what would be reasonable
and practicable for the clubs.


3.   Lord Wheatley also provided, as a technical appendix to his report, guidelines
to safety standards at football grounds designed to assist the local authorities
in their task of enforcement.




                                     i
Consultations on the Report

4.   When the Report was published, those bodies mainly concerned, including the
local authority associations and the football authorities, were consulted about
Lord Wheatley's proposals.    The football authorities made it clear that they were
apprehensive at the financial implications for the clubs, but there was general
agreement with the proposals themselves.    Detailed consultations were held on the
guidelines contained in the technical appendix to the Report and these, duly
amended, were finally published by the Home Departments in November 1973 as a
special booklet, "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds".     It was revised in 1975
in the light of practical experience of its application and specifically targeted
on football grounds.


Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)

5.   The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force.     Its primary
purpose is to set out principles or guidelines which the local authorities will
no doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.     The Guide therefore deals
with matters such as the provision of adequate entrances and exits, means of
escape, the slope of terracing, the strength and siting of crush barriers, the
construction of staircases, and measures to ensure the safe movement of spectators
both under normal and emergency conditions.    The Guide is not a set of requirements
to be rigidly applied, regardless of individual circumstances.     As Lord Wheatley
recognised, it is important to maintain the maximum flexibility in any system of
control so as to take account of the differing circumstances at individual grounds:
factors such as age, size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to
ground.


6.   While the basic principles set out in the Guide are relevant to all sports
stadia, modifications may well be necessary where sports other than football are
involved.


General Approach to the Act

7.   The main instrument of control under the Act is the safety certificate issued by
the local authority.   A safety certificate is needed in respect of every stadium
which is the subject of a designation order, made by the Secretary of State.        The
certificate enables the local authority to impose such terms and conditions as
are necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the stadium in question.
8.    The approach to designation was based on a phased programme so that the more
important grounds regularly attracting the largest attendances were dealt with
first.     The international stadia at which soccer and Rugby Union were played plus
stadia used by soccer clubs in Division 1 of the Football League Were designated
in 1976.    This was followed in 1979 by designation of stadia of clubs in
Division 2 of the League and thereafter on promotion of a club to Division 2.
Following the    fire   at Bradford City FC in May 1985 all the remaining stadia
liable to designation used by clubs in Divisions 3 and 4 of the Football League,
and qualifying stadia of clubs in Division 1 and 2 of the Rugby League were
designated.


Substance of the Act

9.    The first 5 sections establish the main system of control under        the   Act,that
is to say, the    safety certificate, issued by the local authority for      the   areain
which the stadium is situated, which is required for every sports stadium desig­
nated for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.


10.   Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate        any   sports
stadium having accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators as requiring a
safety certificate.     Safety certificates are of two kinds, general and special.
A general safety certificate is the main continuing form of control and is issued
for an indefinite period in respect of a specified activity or activities
regularly taking place at the stadium.     A special safety certificate may be issued
at the discretion of the local authority for a special event or other circumstances
not covered by the general safety certificate.     Such an event might be an evangel­
istic rally which might call for special arrangements if, for example, seating were
provided for the congregation on the playing area.     A special safety certificate
can be issued only in respect of a sports stadium for which a general safety
certificate is already in force.


11.   The contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section 2 . The local
authority is empowered to include in the certificate such terms and conditions as
are necessary to secure, at the stadium in question, a reasonable degree of safety.
Without prejudice to this general power, the section requires certificates to contain
terms and conditions relating to major matters such as entrances and exits, means of
escape in emergency, the number, strength and situation of crush barriers, and the
maximum number of spectators who may be admitted to the stadium or any part of it.
To remove any possibility of doubt, sub-section (3) makes it clear that a certificate
may include a condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance and
the maintenance of safety.
12.   An earlier Bill, introduced in 1973, limited the terms and conditions
imposed under a safety certificate to what was necessary to secure a reasonable
degree for'Members of the public." There was some difficulty over this term
because it might have excluded, for example, members of supporters' clubs.        This
particular problem was by the definition of "spectator" in section 17, that is,
any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.     On the other hand,
it seemed     right that all the peole present on the occasion of a match or other
activity for which a ground has a certificate should be taken into account for the
purpose of the safety certificate, for example, people using a squash court or
other facilities at the ground.     Accordingly, the general power of the local
authority under section 2(1) to include in a safety certificate such terms or
conditions as are necessary omits any reference to people and speaks only of
securing "reasonable safety at the stadium", (although the terms "safety", as
defined in section 17, does not include danger arising from participation in a
sport).     Certain provisions must, however, be specifically linked with spectators
(who are, after all, the people the Act is mainly designed to protect and who will
be greatly in the majority).     Thus section 2(2) requires the certificate to state
the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted.




13.   Section 3 sets out the broad procedure to be followed when a local authority
receives an application for a safety certificate.     It requires them to determine
whether an applicant is, in their opinion, a qualified person, ie a person likely
to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions imposed
in the certificate.     If so, they are then under a duty to issue a general safety
certificate to him.     In this respect, the general safety certificate is different
from the fire certificate issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971:     the latter
is issued only after necessary safety works have been completed, whilst the
safety certificate under this Act can be issued almost from the outset, and is an
instrument of continuing control.    The issue of a special safety certificate,
however, is left to the discretion of the local authority, as already explained,
because only they can judge whether it is appropriate to issue it for the special
occasion in question.


14.   In Metropolitan Counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
authority is required to send a copy of any application for a certificate to the
police and the Fire Authority, and must consult them about the terms and conditions
to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere a copy must be sent to, and
consultation take place with, the police and the Building Authority.     The need
for such consultation is self-evident:     there must be close co-ordination of the
interests of the different authorities directly concerned with different aspects
of safety at football grounds.


15.   Section 4 provides for the amendment, replacement, transfer, surrender and
cancellation of safety certificates.     It is of primary importance that a local
authority should have power to amend a safety certificate where it appears
appropriate for them to do so, for example, if they find in the course of a
routine inspection that a part of a ground has become so dangerous as to demand an
immediate restriction on its use or some other necessary safeguard.     Again, they
must have power to relax a requirement where, for example, certain improvements
have been carried out to make this possible.


      Section 5 provides for appeals by interested parties against decisions or
requirements of the local authority in connection with safety certificates.       Appeals
lie to the Secretary of State, who has power to set up a formal inquiry.


17.   Section 6(2) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to
the safety of spectators at sports grounds.     This is in the nature of a reserve
power which could be used, for example, to give backing to requirements of the
local authorities which in the light of experience had been shown to be essential.
This section also empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations for various
other purposes connected with the Act.    To date no regulations have been made
under this sub-section.


18.   Section 7 provides for some supplementary matters on determinations and
appeals. Sub-sections (1) and (2) provide for the deemed withdrawal of an applica­
tion for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate when a local authority
determines that a person is not, or has ceased to be, qualified to hold it.     The
section also provides for the suspension of a condition in a certificate pending
determination of an appeal against the inclusion of that condition, although a
court, on the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition
remain in force pending the determination of the appeal.
19.   The holder of a general safety certificate is required by section 8 to
notify the local authority of any proposed alteration or extension of a stadium.
The purpose of the clause is to guard against any alterations being made, without
the local authority’s knowledge, which might affect the safety of spectators.


20.   Section 9 provides for the harmonisation of the Act with other legislation
which may affect sports stadia.


21.   Section 10 is an important power which authorities should not feel inhibited
from using where the danger to spectators are such that use of the ground, or part
of it, should be prohibited or restricted.   Should a magistrates' court, on the
application of a local authority, consider that the risk to spectators at any
sports ground is so great that their admission should be prohibited or restricted
until remedial action has been taken, the court may make an order accordingly.
This power applies to any sports stadium or ground, whether or not it is designated
as requiring a safety certificate.(;:;Miere a general or special safety certificate
is in force, local authorities may prefer to remedy an unsatisfactory situation
by amending the certificate, in cases where there is sufficient time to do so.
In respect of sports grounds and the smaller stadia, consultations between the
local authority and the club would usually be expected to secure, on a voluntary
basis, a reasonable standard of safety; however, where management appears to be
unwilling to undertake the necessary measures or is slow to act on advice, this
additional power can be used.


22.   Section 11 confers rights of entry and inspection on persons appointed by the
local authority and others involved in the task of ensuring crowd safety at sports
grounds.   Section 12 deals with offences and penalties.


23-   Section 13 deals mainly with civil liability.   Its purpose is to make clear
that while nothing in the Act itself confers a right of action in respect of a
contravention of regulations or of conditions in a safety certificate, the existing
rights of a spectator injured at a football stadium to bring an action for negli­
gence against the occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.


24.   The Secretary of State is empowered by section 15 to extend to classes of
sports grounds other than sports stadia such provisions of the Act as are not
already expressed to apply to them.   For example, it enables the Secretary of
State by order to extend the safety certificate procedure to such places as
race-courses. Only a class of sports ground may be the subject of an extension
order under this clause:   an individual sports ground (other than a stadium)
cannot be designated until section 1 of the Act has been applied by an order
under section 15 to the class of sports ground to whichit belongs. To date,
the powers under this section have not been used.


25.   Section 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications, to the
Crown.   Section 17 deals with interpretation.


26.   Section 18 provides that orders and regulations,except commencement orders,
made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution procedure.    It also
imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, before making any orders or regulations,
except commencement orders or orders relating to the Isles of Scilly, to consult
with such persons as appear to him requisite.
                                                                 ANNEX C


SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES

1.   The Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 provide that any application
for a safety certificate shall be made in the form contained in the Schedule to
the Regulations or a form to the like effect.    An application should be accompanied
by detailed information as to the structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, includ­
ing plans of the stadium, certificates relating to the testing of crush barriers
and evidence of the applicant's status.     It is, however, open to a local authority,
under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice in writing, such further
information of this kind as it may consider necessary to enable it to determine
the terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.


2.   On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local
authority must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a
person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and con­
ditions to be imposed in the certificate.     If it considers him to be such a person
the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.
In the case of a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not
paramount, the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.
In any event, it seems prima facie unlikely that an application for a general
safety certificate would be made by an unqualified person.     There is, however, a
right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is
not a qualified person (see paragraph 10).


3.   In Metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
authority is required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of any appli­
cation for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chief
Officer of Police and the fire authority, and must consult them about the terms
and conditions to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere in England and Wales
the local authority must send a copy to and consult with the Chief Officer of
Police and the building authority.   In framing such conditions, local authorities
will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines set out in the
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.   In this connection local authorities are
reminded that, this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be
rigidly applied regardless of individual circumstances.     The maximum flexibility
should be maintained to take account of the different circumstances of individual
grounds deriving from differences in such matters as age, size and mode of con­
struction.   In this regard, it should also be noted that the Act provides that the
terms and conditions should be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reason­
able safety" and it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek
the absolute safety of everyone attending the sports stadium.


4.   It is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the
local authority and the stadium representatives in the process of drawing up the
certificate conditions.     In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is
rarely filled to capacity, the local authority may consider it proper to base its
requirements on actual levels of attendance over a given period rather than on
maximum capacity.     On the rare occasions on which a capacity crowd could be
expected, separate provision might be made for this contingency on the lines
indicated in paragraph 7 below.     Again, if a stand were found to be structurally
weak, the local authority might, in consultation with the stadium representatives,
offer the choice of having any necessary remedial works carried out or of restrict­
ing admission to the stand until it had been strengthened.


5.   As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content of a
safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the indivi­
dual case.     Accordingly, a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate.
It must however contain full details of the terms and conditions imposed including,

in particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and have annexed

to it a plan of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be

framed.    The certificate when first issued may contain restrictive conditions which

can then be relaxed or deleted by amendment of the certificate.     The local

authority may find it convenient to list, in a covering letter to the certificate,

such modifications as will be subsequently permitted, eg in the form of a state­
ment of the increased spectator capacities;   to be allowed for the separate sections

of the ground when the various stages ©f any future .works programme

agreed with the stadium authorities are'completed.     This arrangement , by

excluding from the certificate itself propoised conditions which would
apply only to future works, should serve to obviate confusion. At the same time,
however, care must be taken not to exclude from the certificate any restriction
germane to current conditions, since section 5(3) of the Act provides for an
interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State against the inclusion of
anything     in, or the omission of anything from, a safety certificate, and these
rights must not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of the form of the
certificate.
6.   As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the
Act provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different
activities.    Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a foot­
ball ground, in cases where it is also used from time to time to stage other
events it would be desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special
safety certificates, if the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were
to be included in the general certificate.    It is suggested that any such events
for which it is considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided into
2 classes:-


     1.   those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
     stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;


     2.   those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
     concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being given
     over to    spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and conditions
     will have to be devised.    It is not, of course, necessary to provide for
     these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen by the stadium
     authorities.


7.   There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable
to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a
special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected vo attract signi­
ficantly more than the usual attendance.     In the case especially of cup replays
these special events may arise with only a few days' notice, within which it would
not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to
the grant of a special safety certificate.    In order to overcome this difficulty,
it would seem desirable for the local authorities and stadium authorities to seek
to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions which
might be appropriate to such occasions, eg the admission of increased numbers to
certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed, that
notice is given to the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their
incorporation in the general safety certificate.


8.   Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determina­
tion of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend­
ment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of
the certificate or of the.local authority (see section 4(2) of the Act) and will
presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the
original certificate.    It will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities
and clubs/stadium authorities for a close liaison to be maintained after the
issue of the certificate and certainly while any further works of safety measures
are being carried out.   It is likely to be in the stadium operators' financial
interest to get the safety certificate amended as soon as possible after work
has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure that the local authority
is kept informed of progress.   For   its part the local authority will no doubt
wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion of the
work, the certificate can be amended without delay.


9.    After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the
transfer of the certificate to another person.   Similarly, while a local
authority is considering an appliOation for a certificate and before the certifi­
cate has been granted, it may be asked to substitute some person other than the
original applicant as the person to whom the certificate should be granted.      These
are, however, likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certifi­
cates, where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club or a stadium
organisation by an authorised official of the club or representative of the
organisation.   However, if it does happen, the local authority will be required in
both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified person.
Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the regulations to
giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply together with
any necessary appeals procedure.   In the second case, there is no reason why the
local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new applica­
tion in the terms of the original one and process it from the point it had already
reached.


10.   In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety
certificate against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see
paragraph 2 above), which, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed
transfer of a certificate, the Act provides a further right o£ appeal to any
"interested party" (which term includes the holder of the safety certificate)
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.      The
regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of
any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following receipt of a notice of
the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified,
the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating
in the locality.
11.   In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or
amending a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain
specified "interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press.
It is regretted that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of
advertising, but, since Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition
which it provides of "interested party", no other means could be found of ensuring
that all persons who might validly claim to be "interested parties" within the
meaning of the Act should be able to acquaint themselves with the local authority's
decision, and failure to bring the decision to their notice could result in a
denial of their rights of a p p e a l Or of a hearing by the Secretary of State. For
the same reason a similar obligation has been imposed on an appellant (by
Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing to
appear before a person appointed by ;the Secretary of State under Section 5(4) of
the Act is required to give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.


12.   Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
appeal.   It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with Regulation
8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether it
wishes to oppose the appeal.    With any such notice, the local authority is
required to submit its reasons add any relevant supporting documents and to state
whether it wishes a hearing under Section 5      of the Act.   (The procedure govern­
ing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in Regulation 10.)


13-   It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary,     to
order a public inquiry under Section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
In such a case, the procedure to be followed     is laid down in Regulation 12.

14.   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
practice of copying to the Home Office newly issued or amended safety certificates.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall
be made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the
like effect.     Part II of the form and its frontispiece should be completed in the
case of applications for special safety certificates.     In any case where an
application for a special safety certificate is not made by the holder of the
general safety certificate, it should be accompanied by evidence of the appli­
cant's status.     Details of any planned changes to the normal standing and seating
arrangements for spectators should be provided, together with such further
information in support of the application as is considered necessary to enable
the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act.     However, it is
open to a local authority, under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice
in writing, any further information of this kind which they may think it
necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions to be
included in the special safety certificate.


2.   A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates
is that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant is a quali­
fied person, the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory,
whereas the issue of a special safety certificate remains at its discretion.
But an applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against a
refusal (see following paragraphs for details).


3.   An application for a special safety certificate should normally be made at
least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied
that the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser period,
eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person.     On receipt of an
application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be
in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed
in the certificate.     The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make
this determination within 14 days of receiving the application.     There is a
right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant
is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9), and, under regulation 5, the
applicant must be furnished with the reasons for such a determination.
4.   It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused
on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person.    This
decision must, in accordance with regulation 6, be made within 28 days of the
receipt of the application, not only in cases where the local authority has
determined that the applicant is a qualified person but also in those where
it has determined that he is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to
be considered.    There is also a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds
other than a determination that the applicant is not a qualified person (see
paragraph 9).    In the event of such a refusal, therefore, the local authority is
again required, under regulation 6, to give the applicant the reasons for its
decision.


5.   When the first 2 stages have been completed, should it have been decided
that a special safety certificate should be issued, the local authority in
metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) is required, by
section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the Chief Officer
of Police and to the fire authority and to consult them about the terms and
conditions to be included in the certificate.    Elsewhere in England and Wales
the local authority must send a copy to, and consult with, the Chief Officer of
Police and the building authority.    The special safety certificate must, in
accordance with regulation 6(2), then be issued not less than 28 days before
the proposed event is due to take place.


6.   The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary
according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
certificate would not be appropriate.    (In suitable cases, however, regard may
be had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(Football) on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 of the paper relating to the
"Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates".)    Any
special safety certificate must, however, contain full details of the terms
and conditions imposed, including in particular the matters referred to in
section 2(2) of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where
appropriate by reference to the plan attached to the general safety cartificate.


7.   Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the deter­
mination of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal
amendment of the certificate.    This may be on the application of the holder of
the certificate or at the discretion of the local authority (see section 4(2)
of the Act).    This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
certificate, otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has
been issued well in advance of the event to which it relates.     Any such amend­
ment must, however, be publicised as in paragraph 10 below.


8.    Considerations of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate
to another person an equally unlikely contingency.    Any possible difficulties
in this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the
general safety certificate applies for the special certificate.     Nevertheless,
should an application for transfer be made, the local authority must decide
within 14 days if the proposed trafrs^eree is a qualified person and, if it
decides to the contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating
to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will
the appropriate appeals procedure, Should the need arise.     In the case of an
application for transfer before a special safety certificate has actually been
issued, there is no reason why the j-ocal authority should not treat the applica­
tion in all respects as a new application in the terms of the original and pro­
cess it from the point already reached.


9.    Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a deter­
mination that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3) and against
the refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4).     In addition the
Act provides (in section 5(3))a right of appeal to any "interested party"
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.
The regulations provide that, in the case of a special safety certificate, notice
of any such appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice
of the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not
notified, the publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper
circulating in the locality.


10.   As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so
to amend it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also
to advertise its action in the press.     A similar obligation falls on an appellant
(under regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wish­
ing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section
5(4) of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement.
(The reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the
paper relating to the 'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety
Certificates'.)
11.   Any appellant is required (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
appeal.   It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation
8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it
wishes to oppose the appeal.   With any such notice, the local authority is
required to submit its reason^ and any relevant supporting documents and to
state whether it wishes a hearing under section 5(4) of the Act.   (The pro­
cedure governing the conduct of ail. Such hearings is set out in regulation 10.)


12.   It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary,
to order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any
appeal.   In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in
regulation 12.


13*   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
practice of copying to the Home Office any special safety certificates issued.

Dear Sir

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION

1.   The purpose of this letter is to inform you of the effects on the Safety of        __
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) of Local Government reorganisation in the Metropolitan
counties and Greater London brought about by the Local Government Act 1985.

2.   With effect from 1 April 1986 responsibility for administering the SSGA 1975 will,
in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London, transfer to the appropriate
Metropolitan District Council (MDC) or London Borough (the "successor" authorities).
They will be responsible for, among other things, the issue of and amendments to safety
certificates. A consequential effect of Local Government reorganisation is that the
Current certificating authorities in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London are
not in the meantime empowered to issue or amend safety certificates for any period
commencing on or after 1 April 1986. Such certificates or amendments will fall to be
issued by the successor authorities. It is therefore in the interests of applicants
in these areas to ensure that applications for special safety certificates, or amendments
to existing certificates, which are to come into effect on or after 1 April 1986 are
copied to the appropriate successor authority who should be kept informed of developments
and progress so as to be in a position to assume responsibility for the case in question
with the minimum of delay and inconvenience.

                                                                 Yours faithfully

Dear Sir

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 5/1986

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS: COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY
AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS: FINAL REPORT (CMND   9710   )

The Final Report of the Committee of Inquiry set up by the Home
Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland following the
events of 11 May 1985 at Bradford City FC and Birmingham City FC
has now been published.  The purpose of this circular is, first,
to inform recipients of the recommendations contained in the Final
Report and the Government's response to them; and, secondly, to
seek the assistance and cooperation of local authorities and chief
fire officers with a view to introducing new safety measures in line
with the Report's recommendations.

Final Report of the Committee of Inquiry

2.   The Final Report amends and expands upon the recommendations
contained in the Inquiry's Interim Report (Cmnd 9585) published last
July.   It stresses the need for improved safety to be effected
urgently and draws attention to the additional hazards posed by
crowd violence at some sporting events.   These questions are subject
to separate consideration: this circular is concerned however with
safety matters only.
3.  Attached at    Annex A is a list of the recommendations of the
Final Report.   They supplement those contained in the Interim
Report and supercede the provisional recommendations it contained.
At Annex P is a c o p y of the Home Secretary's oral statement to
Parliament responding to the Final Report.

4.   Of the 9 recommendations on safety (recommendation 6 refers to
Scotland only) recommendations 1, 7, 8 and 9 are longer term
proposals to amend either the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
 (SSGA) or the Fire Precautions Act 1971 (FPA).  The latter,
recipients will know, is already the subject of an uncompleted
review contained in the consultative document issued in July 1985
and upon which comments Were invited by 31 December 1985.    The
Government accepts the aims behind the Inquiry's approach to both
Acts and proposes to issue as soon as possible a consultation
document as to the best means of achieving them.   This document will
outline solutions inter alia by taking account both of the further
factual information sought at paragraphs 10 and 11 below which was
not available to the Inquiry and of the comments made on the proposals
on the FPA in the July consultative document.   The upshot therefore   ^
will be integrated proposals for the most effective form of safety
provision in accordance with the principles recommended by the
Inquiry.

5.  The objective behind Recommendation 4 is also accepted and con ­
sultations will be undertaken with HSE and DOE with the aim of
clarifying the interface between the responsibilities of the authorities
concerned.   Recommendation 10 (building regulations) is being
considered by the Department of the Environment (DOE).

SSGA: extension of   designation

6.  As a result of the Government's acceptance of Recommendation 2 of
the Final Report, the Home Secretary now proposes generally to extend
designation under the SSGA 1975 to stadia and grounds with acco mmo d­
ation for over 10,000 spectators at which soccer or rugby union or
rugby league or cricket is played.   Consultation letters have been
sent to the sporting bodies concerned seeking comments and information
on the venues liable to be affected. Details of these, as known to      M
the Home Office, are contained at Annex B.   With the exception of      %
rugby union the information is based on responses received to HM
Chief Inspector of Fire Services' letter to chief fire officers of
21 August 1985 (No 11/1985).   The information for rugby union includes
data provided by the Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union.
Where information differs from that given by chief fire officers, the
larger figure for spectator capacity has been used.

7.  It is hoped that consultation with the sporting authorities will
help resolve any points which might arise about the grounds and stadia
affected. Local authorities to whom this circular is addressed are
asked to check if there are any sports stadia or sports grounds in
their area with accommodation for over 10,000 spectators at which rugby
union or rugby league or soccer or cricket is played but which have
been omitted from Annex B. Details of any such stadia or grounds
should be passed to the Home Office as soon as possible, giving the
full name and address of the stadium or ground in question, name and
address of the principal occupier, approximate spectator capacity and
the use to which the venue is put. This information can be passed by
telephone on 01 213 5566 if this is more convenient.
E.R
   Timing

   8.  Timing of the further designations as mentioned in paragraphs 6
   and 7 above under the SSGA is subject to the consultation process which
   will include views expressed by the local authority associations.
   A phased programme may be necessary but it is intended to complete
   designation by the summer of 1986.

   Guide to Safety   at Sports Grounds   (Football)   (the "Green Guide")

   9.  The Green Guide is being revised along the lines recommended by
   the Inquiry and it is hoped, after consultation with interested bodies,
   to have a new edition of the Guide published before the 1986/87 seasons.
   Until then the advice in the existing Guide can continue to be followed
   as appropriate for all spectator sports.  It is not intended to change
   the present status of the Green Guide.

   Further controls over safety in   sports premises

Jfe 10.   The Government has also accepted the need for some further safety
    controls to be applied to other sports stadia and grounds with stands
    holding over 500; and to indoor sports premises when   they are used  to
    accommodate more than 500 spectators (Final Report recommendations 3
    and 5-); As a first step to considering how best to proceed, further
    information is required to permit evaluation of the nature and number
    of the premises involved.   Some information has already been provided
    (or may be available) as a result of the surveys carried out in response
    to DCO letter 11/1985 (seeking information on sports stadia with an
    overall capacity of over 5,000; sports grounds with constructed ac co m­
    modation -for more than 5,000; and indoor arenas with a spectator
    capacity of over 1,000).   The information now sought overlaps with
    but is not identical to that previously given, so in an attempt to
    ease the administrative burden and to ensure consistency of response,
    those to whom this circular is addressed are asked to provide the
    information on the proforma at Annex 0.   Chief executives will no doubt
    wish to discuss with chief fire officers who is best placed to carry
    out this work.

   11.   For the purpose of this exercise indoor sports premises included
   in the return should be confined to those premises where.,, either on
   a regular or infrequent basis, sports events or otff^factivities take
   place for which accommodation is provided for more than 500 spectators.


   12.   To ensure that there is no short term gap in safety cover chief
   fire officers and, where appropriate, other members of the local
   authority safety team are asked to inspect those outdoor sports
   venues coming within the scope of recommendation 3 which   were not
   inspected   as part  of the earlier  exercise, and those indoor sports
   premises coming within the   scope  of recommendation  5 which have not
E.R.
       been inspected in the last twelve months whether or not they are
       subject to entertainments licensing legislation.  The purpose of
       these inspections would be to advise management on additional
       measures necessary to secure satisfactory standards of safety, and
       to consider emergency action where necessary under section 10 of
       either the SSGA or FPA as appropriate.  Similarly, chief, executives
       and chief fire officers are asked to keep under review the other
       outdoor premises previously inspected with the object of maintaining
       safety standards at those venues, even though they are not being
       designated under the SSGA.

       13.  Finally, it would be appreciated if the returns (Annex C) could
       be sent in as soon as possible and in any event not later than
       21 February 1986 so that preparatory work can begin. The returns ,
       should be addressed   t o .

   14.  The Home Secretary recognises the efforts already made by both
   chief fire officers and local authorities generally to improve safety
   at sports grounds and is deeply grateful for all that has been done,
   it is appreciated that these latest tasks will be an additional but
   not, it is hoped, a substantial burden given the work already under­
   taken in many areas to improve spectator safety at sporting venues.

       15.  An additional copy of this circular is enclosed for the chief
       fire officer.   In view of  local government
         reorganisation.    copies have also been sent to the chief executives
       of Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs, and to the
       Joint Fire and Civil Defence Authorities.    In addition, copies of
       this circular have also been sent to non-Metropolitan District
       Councils because of their responsibility for licensing some events
       in indoor sports premises under the Local Government (Miscellaneous
       Provisions ) Act 1982.

       16.    Any enquiries should be directed to:

   So far, happily, the figures this season show an !
improvement in the number of arrests and ejections from '
football grounds. Our measures against hooliganism
should have a cumulative effect, but it is too soon to be
satisfied. We have to deal not only with hooliganism, but
with safety; not only with football grounds, but with sports
grounds in general. Thanks in large part to Mr. Justice
Popplewell and his colleagues, I believe that we are on the
right track.

                       The final report* of the Committee of Inquiry choired by
  Mr Justice Popplewell into crowd safety and control at sports grounds
   is published today.



                    The report concludes that further precautions are urgently required
  to assure a proper standard of safety for the public at sporting events and
  makes fifteen recommendations to this end,                     (See list attached),


                   The recommendations cov&r both safety and crowc control, and

 the paramount need is to protect the public by improving safety standards and
 thereby restoring confidence among those who attend sporting events.                      This
 means that effective steps should be taken quickly*.                     The report stresses

roads within a quarter o f a mile o f a sports ground should be kept entirely free o f parked vehicles. (Paragrap
3.35)
  5. Consideration should be given to making it a criminal offence in England and Wales to have a smoke
bomb or similar device at sports grounds. (Paragraph 3.42)
  6. Those managing sports grounds not governed by safety certificates should give serious consideration
with the assistance o f fire authorities, to the presence in a ground o f suitable fire fighting equipment. (Paragraph
3.54)
 A S i c wards at all sports grounds should be trained in fire fighting. (Paragraph 3.55)

 * / « designated grounds it should be a term o f the safety certificate that an adequate first-aid room should
 be provided. (Paragraph 3.65)
   9 There should be urgent consultation between the Health & Safety Executive and the fire authorities and
 local authorities as to how best to coordinate and communicate their inspections and reports. (Paragraph
 3.95)
   10 Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire precautions and fire-fighting (see Recom­
 mendation 7 above) but should also be trained in how best to help the police in evacuation (Paragraph 3.104)

    11. Paragraph 6.14.6 o f the Green Guide should be amended to read: “All exit gates should be manned
 at all times while the ground is used by the public and be capable o f being opened immediately from inside by
 anyone in an emergency.” (Paragraph 3.111)
     12. The Green Guide should be amended to contain a specific provision, in relation to stewards,
    (i) that they should be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation
        (see also Recommendations 7 and 10);
   (ii) that they should be given written instructions about the action to be taken in cases of emergency;
  (iii) that they should receive practical instruction and training appropriate to their responsibility,
  ( m that no one should be employed as a steward unless they have been so instructed and trained; and

     16. Fire Authorities should identify and visit all sports stadia in their areas and should prohibit or restrict
  the use of any stands which, in their view, constitute a risk to spectators because of the inadequacy ol the
  fire precautions. (Paragraph 3.142)

                                                           49
   17. In order to ensure a complete record o f sports grounds a local registration system should be set up.
( Paragraph 3.151)

   18. Consideration should be given as how best to deal with temporary stands and marquees. ( Paragraphs
3.151)

  19. The next edition o f the Green Guide should make it clear that it applies to all sports ground. ( Paragraphs
3.154)

   20. Urgent consideration should be given to introducing a membership system in England and Wales so as

  21. Closed circuit television should be introduced at League football grounds in England and Wales and in
the Premier Division in Scotland. (Paragraph 6.54)

  22. There should be a specific offence in England and Wales o f throwing a missile at sports grounds,
(Paragraph 6.57)

  23. Football clubs should review their arrangements fo r entry and the organisation o f their turnstiles.
(Paragraph 6.62)

  24. Consideration should be given to the design o f a standard, efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.
(Paragraph 6.63)
Provisional Recommendations (To be reviewed in the Final Report)      *

    1. I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should be given the unfettered right
o f search before entry to football grounds by statute. (Paragraph 3.41)

   2. I am minded to recommend that Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971 should be amended with
a view to giving the Fire Authority power in cases other than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional.
(Paragraph 3.61)

    3. Linked with the above, I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to introducing
legislation giving powers for the Fire Authority to apply to the High Court fo r an injunction (or to the Court
o f Session fo r an interdict in Scotland) under Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971. (Paragraph 3.61)

   4. I am minded to recommend that Section 10 o f the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975 should be
amended in like manner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations
2 and 3) and an application to the High Court for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for an interdict
in Scotland) should be an alternative remedy. (Paragraph 3.76)

  5. I am minded to recommend that the Secretary o f State should exercise his powers to designate all
spdrts grounds, whatever their size, to include indoor as well as outdoor activities. (Paragraphs 3.145)

  6. I am minded to recommend immediate designation o f any ground capable o f holding over 5,000
spectators, to cover all sports grounds, not merely football grounds. (Paragraph 3.146)

  7. I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to providing the police with additional
 owers o f arrest under the Public Order Act 1936. (Paragraph 6.66)

  8. I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to creating a specific offence o f chanting
obscene or racialist abuse at a sports ground. (Paragraph 6.67)

Chairman

W O R K IN G G R O U P ON T H E G R E E N G U ID E
   E l. Shortly after publication of your Interim R eport you asked me to establish a Working Group of
appropriately qualified scientifical and technical persons who had practical experience of safety at sports
grounds to assist the Inquiry in its task of reviewing the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(the “ Green G u id e ” )- As you know, and with the kind cooperation of the Home Office, Scottish Office,
Department o f Environment, local authority associations and technical consultants to the Inquiry, I was
able to form such a group and this met for a full week (23-28 September) under my Chairmanship.

  E2. Our terms of reference were'. “ To review the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(Football) - “ the Green Guide” - and to make recommendations to the Committee of Inquiry on Crowd
Safety and Control at Sports Grounds as to amendments or additions considered necessary to the Green
Guide published in 1976.” A record of the membership of the G roup appears later in this appendix.

   E3. I am pleased to be able to report that the W orking G roup completed its work satisfactorily and that
it was found possible on the final day of the G ro up ’s week to reach general agreement on the various
recommendations for changes which we wished to see made to the Guide. I have since prepared a self-
contained note o f these points and have put the G rou p’s deliberations into the form of recommendations
for you. This note is set out below for your consideration. I support these recommendations.

   E4. As you will see there are, in total, some 63 recommendations. This should not be taken in any way,
however, as an adverse judgment upon the current Guide. The substantive advice in the Guide stood up
remarkably well to a week o f detailed scrutiny by experts and fully justifies the high esteem and confidence
in which it is generally - and internationally - held.

   E5. It remains only for me to record my gratitude to the members of the G roup who gave up so much
of their valuable time to assist the Committee in its task; to my fellow Assessor, M r Alan Goodson, for
his encouragement, support and practical advice throughout the week; and to M r M ark de Pulford for his
excellent work as Secretary.
                                                                                     M AR TIN K ILLORAN
                                                                                 Fire Assessor to the Inquiry


                                       R E PO R T AND R EC OM M ENDATIONS

           S T R U C T U R E OF T H E G R E E N G U ID E
              E6 The Working G roup was dissatisfied with the structure of the current Guide and recom-
 Rec 1     mends that the Green Guide should be reorganised so as to reflect more closely the needs o f its
           target audience. (The G roup agreed that the target audience of the Guide comprises: (a) sports
           ground management in designated and undesignated grounds; (b) engineers, designers and others
           engaged in the improvement, design appraisal or refurbishment of sports stadia to certificable
           standards: and (c) local authorities responsible for enforcing the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act
           1975.) The G roup considered that, following a general introduction which describes the scope of
           the Guide, sets the scene and briefly discusses the nature and extent of risks to the public at
           sports grounds, the guidance should be re-arranged so as to deal first with general management
           responsibilities and major planning and design matters. (Guidance on these matters should, where
           practicable, include methods for assessing the general safety condition of a ground and the need
           for detailed drawings and plans.) The succeeding categories of detailed guidance should each be
           preceded by a statement of the general functional requirement or aim and should include as much
           appraisal, flow and other diagrams as may conveniently be arranged. The Group considered that
           a possible scheme for the categories of advice in the Green Guide was: Fire (to include a checklist
           and appraisal flow diagram and reference to the need for professional advice), Structural Appraisa
           (to include a method for appraising existing structures and reference to the need for professional
           advice), G round Control and G round Management (to identify responsibilities and duties), and
           Inspections, Tests and Maintenance.
Rec 2     E7. The Group also recommends that consideration should be given to the production by the
        Home Office, or other appropriate body, o f summary documents, training aids and seminars fo r
        sports ground management explaining the provisions o f the Green Guide and their application.

        IN T R O D U C TIO N
          E8. The current Guide is aimed at soccer and rugby grounds (GG (Green Guide, 1976 Edition,
        paragraph): 1:1).


           The G roup decided that many of the recommendations in the Green Guide are relevant to
Rec 3   outdoor sports other than football and recommends that the Introduction should say that the
         Guide is applicable as a code o f good practice fo r all sports grounds. The Green Guide should
Rec 4   make it clear, however, that it does not cover measures to ensure the safety o f spectators from
         hazards presented by the sport itself.

           E9. The G roup noted that the references in the Guide to the Building Regulations for England
        and Wales would need to be revised and brought up to date. It was further noted that in Scotland,
        the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations gave requirements for the construction, alteration,
        extension and change o f use of buildings, and included standards in respect of means of escape
        from fire including emergency lighting, access for fire-fighters as well as structural fire precautions.
        The G roup recommends that full account should be taken of national Building Regulations in
        the Green Guide.

        ID E N T IFIC A TIO N O F PROBLEM S
           E10. The current Guide discerns three particular types of safety problem to be considered
        within a football ground and its immediate surroundings (GG: 2.1 to 2.4): (a) those physical
        hazards which may cause individuals to trip, slip or fall; (b) crowd pressures which may be built
        up in normal circumstances (particularly on terraces and exit routes); and (c) crowd pressures
        which may be built up under abnormal conditions. The G roup considered that this analysis was
        correct. However, it felt that the need to tackle these problems should be covered in a new self-
        contained section defining, in general terms, good safety design in sports stadia and enumerating
        other important needs such as managing and controlling crowds, maintaining effective fire
        precautions, making proper provision for the disabled and achieving a reasonable standard of
Rec 5   comfort and convenience for spectators. Accordingly, the G roup recommends the incorporation
        o f a new self-contained section on good safety design in sports stadia.

        G E N E R A L C O N STR U C T IO N
           E l l . The current Guide recommends that all components and installations should be designed,
        constructed, installed and maintained so as “ to perform safely their required functions” and that
        they should be in accordance with good engineering and building practice, especially as set out
        in all revelant British Standards and Codes of Practice (GG: 3.1).

           The G roup approved this recommendation but felt that the reference to British Standards
        might be improved so as to identify those parts o f British Standards which are wholly applicable
Rec 6   in the circumstances o f the case. The G roup recommends that references in the Guide to British
        Standards should be improved accordingly                            ~.          ....

           E12. The current Guide recommends that all electrical installations should comply with the
        current edition o f the regulations of the Institution o f Electrical Engineers (GG: 3.2). The G roup
Rec 7   considered that it would be reasonable in some circumstances for the enforcing authority to accept
        a certificate o f satisfaction fro m a chartered electrical engineer in lieu o f fu ll compliance with current
        I EE Regulations and recommends that the Guide so advises. The G roup also recommends a
Rec 8   reference to B S 5266: Pt 1 in respect o f emergency lighting.

          E13. The current Guide recommends that all parts o f the ground used by the general public
        should have a minimum headroom o f 2.4 metres (GG: 3.5).

           The G roup could find no clear foundation for this advice and, accordingly, recommends that
Rec 9   in respect o f headroom the Guide should simply advise conformity to appropriate building regulations.


                                                        78
          INSPECTIONS A N D TESTS
             E14. The current Guide recommends:
            (i) A detailed annual inspection to ensure compliance with the Green Guide (GG: 4,1);

           00 A general visual inspection following each event for damage which might create a potential
                hazard (GG: 4.2); and,
           (iii) Testing o f crush barriers in accordance with the Guide on installation and subsequently,
                 normally, at intervals o f several years (GG: 4.3).

Rec 10       The G rou p recommends that the routine general visual inspection by management advised in the
           Guide should also cover features which might reduce the degree o f fire protection offered'a n d that
Rec 11    there should also be a warning in the Guide against storing hazardous materials under or near stands.
Rec 12    The G roup also recommends that consideration should be given to the inclusion o f additional
           guidance to certifying authorities as to the frequency and content o f inspections.

Rec 13      E15. The G roup recommends that regular emergency evacuation drills fo r members o f sta ff
          should be recommended in the Guide.

              E l 6. On the testing of crush barriers (GG: 4.3 and Appendix C o f the Guide) the G roup had
           before it no evidence that the current guidance had permitted dangerous or defective crush
          'barriers. However, it seemed to a minority o f the G roup that certain anomalies exist in the current
           recommendations in the Green Guide as to load factors and testing (for example the table of
           strengths for new crush barriers permitted a different design strength for the bars arid posts than
           for the foundations); and there was some evidence that enforcing authorities were unclear as to
Rec 14     the correct procedures. The G roup recommends that representatives o f the local authorities, the
           Home Office and appropriately qualified advisers should, together, review the Guide’s recommenda­
           tions on the design and testing o f crush barriers in more detail with a view to clarifying the guidance
           in future editions o f the Guide (see also paragraph 28 below).

Rec 15       E l 7. The G roup further recommends that the Guide should advise th at any automatic fire
          protection equipment or emergency lighting system should be tested regularly in accordance with
          relevant British Standard codes o f practice.

          IN G R ESS TO T H E G R O U N D
            E l 8. The Guide currently recommends that the number and location o f turnstiles should be
          planned to achieve the smallest crowd waiting for admission that is consistent with the rate at
          which spectators can be distributed inside the ground (GG: 5.1). The G roup recommends that
Rec 16    more detailed guidance to management as to contingency planning in the event o f unusual pressures
          and frustrations (including a reference to the value o f centralised computer-based monitoring)
Rec 17    should be given. The G roup further recommends that the Guide emphasise that turnstiles are not
          acceptable as a means o f escape fro m a ground.                     -           -• •

             E19. The G roup considered it desirable that the Guide should specify a notional maximum
Rec 18    free flow rate past a turnstile. The G roup recommends that further consideration be given to
          defining a maximum notional flow rate past turnstiles fo r incorporation in a future edition o f the
          Green Guide.

             E20. The Guide currently recommends that fences forming the boundary to a ground should
           be of “ appropriate height and strength” to avoid spectators gatecrashing (GG: 5.2). The G roup
Rec 19    recommends that boundary walls and gates and any other structure forming part o f the boundary
          should also be o f appropriate height and strength to avoid gatecrashing.

          EGRESS FROM T H E G R O U N D
             E21. Currently, Section 6 of the Guide makes a num ber of general recommendations as to
          egress from a sports grounds (GG: 6.1 to 6.13). The G roup was generally content with these but
          recommends that the wording in paragraph 6.13 of the Guide should be revised to make it clear
Rec 20,   that escape routes are not to be regarded as an alternative provision only fo r use in emergency. The
Rec 21    G roup further recommends that guidance should be included to the effect that doors on exit
Rec 22    routes should always open outwards; and that, where practicable, exit gates should be sited adjacent
          to entrances.

Rec 23       E22. The G roup recommends that a study should be undertaken o f the current use and effectiveness
          o f the exit route signposting and exit marking systems recommended in the Green Guide ( GG: 6.6),
          and that consideration should be given to commissioning further research in this area.

          TERRACES AN D STANDS

          Safe capacity of terraces
              E23. The Guide currently suggests that the exits from each areas of spectator accommodation
           should be so designed that the spectator can leave that area in eight minutes or less (GG: 6.5).
Rec 24     The G roup concluded that this so-called “eight minute rule" was concerned solely with the effect
           o f crowd turbulence (arising from delays in evacuating specator accommodation) on the rate o f
          flow. It was not related to emergency evacuation time criteria (see paragraph 32 below) and the
           Group recommends that the Guide should make this clear.


          Terrace packing densities
            E24. The Guide recommends packing densities between the limits of 27 and 54 persons per
          10m2 depending on the condition of the terrace or slope and on the extent to which crush barriers
          conform to the Green Guide guidelines on spacing (GG: 15.4). Recommended flow rates from
          the terraces are given at paragraph 16 of the Guide.

             The G roup concluded that the flow rates and permissible spectator densities in the Guide were
           satisfactory and reasonable when taken as a whole and that they accorded with experience.
Rec 25    However, the G roup recommends that flow rate and packing criteria and their relationship ( if
           any) with those criteria given in respect o f emergency evacuation and crowd turbulences should be
           set out and explained more clearly in the Guide and that further advice should be given as to how
           interpolation between the wide limits suggested in respect o f terrace packing densities may properly
Rec 26    be carried out. The Group further recommends that consideration be given to the possibility o f a
           separate detailed study o f the possible casualties which might be attributable to high packing
           densities.

          Terrace steps and viewing slopes
             E25. The G roup was content with the Guide’s recommendations in respect of terrace steps and
Rec 27    viewing slopes (GG: 7.4). The G roup recommends, however, that the surfaces o f terrace steps and
Rec 28    viewing slopes should be even as well as non-slip and that the way in which the maximum desirable
           gradient is specified in the Guide should be improved.

          Terrace gangways
            E26. The Guide states that the aim in respect o f terrace gangways should be to ensure that
          every spectator on a terrace is within 12 metres of a gangway or of an exit. (GG: 7.5). The Guide
          further indicates that gangways should be sunk.
            The G roup felt that although these recommendations were generally satisfactory, reasons
          should be given for the basic aim stated in paragraph 7.5 of the Guide. Furthermore, it would
Rec 29    be preferable to state the safety objective behind the current recommendation to sink gangways so
          that it could be met in other ways. The G roup recommends accordingly.

          Division of spectator accommodation
            E27. The Guide currently recommends the division of a ground into sections to prevent major
          migrations by spectators, and into sub-sections to minimise the sway and surge of spectators
          (GG: 7.6). The G roup recommends that the Guide should limit the application o f its guidance on
          segregation to terraces at football grounds (See recommendation 57 below).

          Crush barriers and other physical restraints on movements
Rec 30,      E28. The Group recommends that the Guide should should explain that brick walls and similar


                                                       80
         rather than to stipulate more stringent criteria in respect of notional values. However, represen­
         tatives of the Fire Research Station felt that the 2} minutes should be regarded as a maximum;
         they believed that although individual circumstances might conceivably justify increasing the
         figure, it was not currently possible to assign quantitative values to active or passive fire protection
         measures with sufficient precision to enable specific relaxations to be advocated in the Guide with
         any degree of confidence. A majority of the G roup believed that the notional 8 minutes upper
         limit indicated in the Guide, although lacking any very clear or relevant technical rationale, was
         reasonable and should be retained. Nevertheless, it was the firm view of a minority including Mr
         Platt that 8 minutes is too long a period to allow for the evacuation of any stand under emergency
         conditions and that, although relaxation of the 2 } minutes figure might be reasonable in individual
         circumstances, it would be misleading to specify an upper limit in the Green Guide.

           The consensus was that the enforcing authority should decide on relaxations in the light of
         professional experience and individual safety circumstances of a particular ground, but that the
Rec 41   Green Guide should offer more guidance as to what latitude was permissible on evacuation times
         and the circumstances to take into account. In particular, the Green Guide should emphasise that
         escape routes should be designed or chosen so that they provide progressive reduction in difficulty
         or danger to people using them and regard should be had to the likely accumulation o f smoke and
Rec 42   combustion products in those routes. The G roup recommends that consideration should be given
         to devising a more scientific method fo r assessing the evacuation o f a stand under emergency
         conditions.

         Fire protection and fire-fighting equipment

Rec 43     E33. The G roup considered that there was currently insufficient evidence as to the value fo r life
         safety o f automatic fire protection equipment fo r the Green Guide to encourage trade-offs between
         such equipment and structural fire protection measures. Any implications that such trade-offs
         were permissible should be removed from the current Guide (eg GG: 10.2). A majority of the
         Group rejected also the idea that the Green Guide should suggest similar relaxations where
         management expertise and vigilance were at a high level.


Rec 44     On fire detection and fire-fighting equipment, the G roup recommends that reference should be
         made to relevant British Standards such as B S 5839: Part 1, B S 5306: Parts 1 and 3 and B S 5423.
         The G roup considered that it was an inefficient and undesirable use of resources for manned fire
         appliances to attend all matches.

           E34. On roof venting, the G roup felt that with some stand roof configurations, appropriate
         venting and curtaining arrangements might offer a means o f reducing the spread of fire. It was
         agreed however that the science of fire and smoke venting was highly complex and that it was
         not appropriate for the Guide to offer more than a general reference to the issue. However, the
Rec 45   G roup felt that some advice on roof venting should be offered in the Green Guide along the lines
         of that proposed by the Fire Research Station in work commissioned by tfae-Inqutey,. It was
         agreed that the priority in the Guide was to recommend effective fire precautions relating to the
         early stages of a fire.

         Access for emergency vehicles
           E35. The G roup agreed that the Guide’s recommendations as to access for emergency vehicles
         (GG: 11.30) were soundly based. It was noted that the Interim Report recommendation that
         vehicular parking be banned within quarter o f a mile of a sports ground (when it was in use) had
Rec 46   been made on a “ where practicable” basis. The G roup recommends that the qualification "where
         necessary" should be added to the current Guide's recommendations on access fo r emegency vehicles.

         Hazardous materials
            E36. The consensus was that it was not practicable for the Guide to offer detailed advice on
         fire spread hazards associated with particular materials. Nevertheless, the G roup recommends
Rec 47   that consultation with expert fire advisers should be indicated in the Guide where substantial use
         of, fo r example, polymer seating is contemplated or o f artificial pitches where forward escape onto
         the pitch might be necessary. (See also recommendation 35 above).


                                                       82
          C O M M U N IC A TIO N S
            E37. The Green Guide currently recommends that precise requirements for communications
          within a particular ground be determined after consultation with the police (GG: 17). The Guide
          goes on to give examples of the arrangements likely to be needed at larger grounds. The G roup
          considered that this advice and the way in which it was expressed was generally satisfactory.
Rec 48,   However, the G roup recommends that the advice as to central control points should not be confined
Rec 49    to the largest   g r o u n d s   a n d   that the Guide sh ould em phasise the need f o r grou nd m anagem ent and
Rec 50    responsibility to be centralised accordingly. The G roup also believed that it would be desirable in
          larger grounds i f public address systems perm itted messages to be directed towards specific zones
          o f the ground. The Group recommends accordingly.

            E38. On emergency audible alarms, the use o f coded messages found little support in the
          Group. The need was rather to communicate essential information effectively to the crowd. For
Rec 51    that purpose, a clear system o f communications covering all the various conceivable crises, including
          the facility to stop the event, should be devised in consultation with the emergency services. The
          G roup recommends that guidance to this effect should be incorporated in the Green Guide.
          Further study was required before pre-set formulae messages could be recommended in the Guide.
          However, it was clear that such messages should be in the active mode, that they should be
          directed towards persons from whom a response is required, and that they should be delivered
Rec 52    authoritatively by trained controllers. The G roup considered that there was a need for standard
          guidance covering the use o f public address systems fo r emergency purposes. The Group recommends
          that consideration be given to this.

             E39. The G roup considered that the development and operational experience of closed circuit
          television (CCTV) facilities was too little advanced to enable the Guide to be prescriptive as to
          particular systems. However, it was noted that CCTV appeared to have significant value in crime
          prevention and detection and that it had a considerable role to play in aiding emergency
          evacuations, police management information and crowd control. The G roup therefore recom-
Rec 53    mends that the provision o f C C T V systems should be encouraged in the Guide.

           C RO W D BEHAVIOUR
             E40. Advice on crowd behaviour is currently set out in the Green Guide in the form of
           recommendations of an earlier working party on crowd behaviour (GG: 18). The G roup recom-
Rec 54     mends that the advice fo r management currently presented at paragraph 18 of the Guide should
           be re-organised and expanded so as to explain more fully the major problems and principles of
           crowd control and then go on to elaborate the various methods available which may be relevant
           in certain situations at sports grounds and of the circumstances under which these might be
           appropriate (see also recommendation (1) above).

Rec 55       E41. The G roup also recommends that the Guide should emphasise the value o f effective planning
           before events, debriefing exercises and fu ll liaison with the police, in order to predict and prevent
           trouble. In particular, the Guide should stress the desirability of identifying in advance, against
           the local historical background and known travel arrangements, the likely size and nature of the
           crowd.

Rec 56      E42. The G roup further recommends that the Guide makes it clear that the responsibility fo r
          pre-planning and liaison lies with club management subject only to the point that the disposition
          of operational police resources is the sole responsibility of individual chief constables.

              E43. There was considerable discussion in the G roup of the segregation issue which, it was
           agreed, had major implications for planning. The consensus was that clear differentiation of
           opposing fans (with ancillary facilities) remained the only viable and prudent course so long as
           crowd violence remained at current levels; and that the best way to achieve such differentiation
           was by spatial separation and physical containment of opposing groups. The G roup was anxious,
           however, that segregation should not be encouraged other than where local circumstances made
 Rec 57    it absolutely necessary. In particular, at the present time segregation should not be advocated fo r
           sports other than soccer. The G roup recommends accordingly. (See also paragraph 27 above).

 Rec 58     E44. The G roup agreed that certain fire precautions measures, for example plasterboard fire



                                                                    83
          separation and fire protection equipment, might be vulnerable to vandalism and that certificating
          authorities should be advised to take this into account where appropriate. The G roup recommends
          accordingly.

            E45. On ticketing, the G roup agreed that this was not an effective means of crowd control
Rec 59    unless clubs ensured that their arrangements fo r the issue and allocation o f tickets were as efficient
          and effective as possible. The G roup recommends that this latter point be strongly emphasised in
          the Green Guide.

Rec 60       E46. On alcohol, the G roup recommends that the guidance on alcohol (GG: 18.4) should be
          reworded to make clear that an im portant objective was to reduce potential missiles and also that
          the police should be consulted over arrangements for the sale of alcohol at grounds. A reference
          to the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 was also needed.

           E47. The G roup were content with the material on police facilities given in the Green Guide
Rec 61   (GG: 17.8) but considered that the Guide should advise adequate vehicular access fo r the unobrusive
         removal o f detainees and secure detention rooms at appropriate grounds. The G roup recommends
         accordingly.

          O TH ER M A N A G EM EN T RESPONSIBILITIES
Rec 62       E48. The G roup was strongly in favour o f the creation of a new section in the Green Guide on
          management responsibilities and recommends that consideration should be given to this. The
          G roup considered that it would be helpful if such a section could incorporate a form of
          checklist of necessary tasks organised under broad headings such as: Pre-planning for Emergency
          Procedures, Training of Stewards and First-aid Facilities/Other Medical Provisions. A reference
          to the need for management structure to reflect such responsibilities, preferably including the
          designation of a named individual to take responsibility for the proper execution of such duties,
          was also highly desirable.

            E49. On the question of the relative responsibilities of the police and stewards, the G roup felt
Rec 63   that the Guide ought to make it plain that it was the club’s responsibility to control and manage
          spectators in normal circumstances and that the police presence (if there was one) was to deal with
          the law and order problems and provide support and leadership in emergencies. The G roup
          recommends accordingly. It was noted that there now existed considerable material on the training
          and deployment of stewards and staff likely to be involved in emergency situations.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975                              2S/11/85


In reply to your Note of 19th November, the original system of Officer
Working Parties was set up by          and approved by the Fire Service
Committee on 8th January, 1976 (see attached Extract from Minutes and
Report).

I cameoolito the scene in 1978 when           retired.

The attached Schedule sets out the division of responsibilities in order
to avoid duplication and division of resources.

The Offices Working, Parties normally carry out "summer" and "winter"
inspections of tlie Grounds and meet more frequently if there are any
alterations or developments or if a Ground is designated.

In the last twelve Mon t hs , there have been 26 meetings of the Officer
Working Parties (2 it: Harnsleyj >'5 at Doncaster, 2 at Rotherham and 14 at
Sheffield).

REPORT OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE                                FIRE SERVICE COMMITTEE
                                                             8TH JANUARY 1976


              SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975


With referen ce to my re p o rt to this Committee on the 6th November, 1975, fu rth er
consideration has been given to the detailed arrangem ents which it will be n ecessary
to im plem ent once the S ecretary of State has begun to designate sp prts stad ia as
requiring safety certificates under Section 1 of the Act. D iscussions have taken
place between rep resen tativ es of the A dm inistration Departm ent, the P olice, and
the F ire Service, when it was agreed that because of the considerable amount of
liaison w ork which will be n ecessary between the respective sp e cialist departm ents,
i . e . , P olice, F ire , and Building Inspectors of D istrict Councils, it is desirab le
that the work of co-ordination should be undertaken by the A dm inistration
D epartm ent.

From initial consultations which have taken place, it would appear that the S ecretary of
State, in h is f irs t designation o rd e r, w ill not, ap art from certain international
grounds, go beyond 1 st and 2nd Division football grounds, and therefo re the only
one with which the County Council will be concerned in the f irs t instance w ill be the
Sheffield United ground. P resu m ab ly it is intended, at a la te r date, to designate
the grounds of clubs in lower Divisions, and th ere would appear to be no reaso n
why the County Council should not, in due course, if they think it d esirab le, ask the
S ecretary of State to include other sp o rts stadia in subsequent O rd e rs.

Because of the County Council's lim ited initial involvement, it is still my opinion
that no in crease in staff will be req uired , but this m ust be qualified by the proviso
that the situation w ill need to be kept under observation, and a fu rth er re p o rt will
be made if it is n e cessary to rev ise this opinion as a re su lt of the designation of
fu rth er sp o rts stad ia by the S ecretary of State.

It has becom e obvious from initial discussions, that safety certificates will n ecessarily
be lengthy and complex documents, containing many conditions, and it is accordingly
proposed to s e t up working p artie s of officers from the A dm inistration Departm ent,
P olice, F ire Service, and the D istrict Council, in each D istrict, to m eet when the
various disciplines concerned have c a rrie d out th e ir inspections and form ulated
th e ir recom m endations, in o rd e r to se ttle the form of the safety certificate to be
subm itted to C om m ittee.

The Act provides that the County Council have a duty, when an application for a safety
certificate is received to determ ine whether the applicant is a p erso n likely to be in
a position to prevent contraventions of the term s and conditions of the certificate.
Your officers a re of the opinion that, certain ly so fa r as football grounds a re
concerned, applications should be subm itted by the p erso n in beneficial occupation
of the p re m ise s concerned.



                                  -   1   -
A fter a safety certificate has been issued, it will be necessary , from tim e to tim e,
to c a rry out inspections to ensure that the conditions a re being complied with.
The frequency of these inspections will obviously have a bearing on the staffing
situation, but it is suggested that a detailed check should be made a t the end of each
season, followed by another about a month before the s ta r t of the next season
to ensure that any d ep artu res from the requirem ents of the certificate found on the
fo rm er inspection have been rectified. A part from this, it is felt that a couple
of m ore general checks during the season should be adequate.

The County Council, the appropriate D istrict Council and the Chief Constable are
empowered to authorise entry of th eir officers to sp orts stadia for the purpose
of making inspections. A fu rth er re p o rt on this and on the question of fixing fees
(if any) to be charged for applications w ill be subm itted a t a la te r date.

In an em ergency situation, where there is a ris k to sp e ctato rs, the County Council
has the power to apply to a M ag istrates' Court for an O rd er prohibiting o r restric tin g
the adm ission of sp ectators until steps have been taken to reduce the ris k to a
reasonable level. Even with v ery careful m onitoring of all sporting activities
taking place in the County, it will not be possible to p red ict every potentially
dangerous situation, which may become apparent at sh o rt n o tice, and too late to
p e rm it the making of an application to the M agistrates to lim it the gate ( e . g . , if
 B arnsley played on a Saturday at Leeds in the F .A . Cup and drew , and the replay
 was on the following Tuesday). It will be necessary , th erefo re, for your officers
 to exam ine the situation in an endeavour to identify all potentially dangerous
 sp o rts grounds, and if n ecessary , make applications in re sp e c t of them as they a re
 identified.

 To su m m arise, th erefo re, the Com m ittee a re asked to adopt the following
 recom m endations: -


 1.      That the work of co-ordination be undertaken by the A dm inistration
         D epartm ent.

 2.      T hat working p a rtie s of officers be constituted for each D istrict, as
         outlined in this rep o rt.

 3.      T hat the suggested frequency of inspections be approved.

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 54/1985
SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS
A.  COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND
    CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS - INTERIM REPORT (Cmnd 9585)
B.  CHIEF FIRE OFFICER REPORTS


1.  The Interim Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety
and Control at Sports Grounds set up by the Home Secretary following
the events of 11 May at Bradford City FC and Birmingham City FC has
now been published.  The purpose of this circular is, first, to
inform recipients of the recommendations of the Inquiry and the
Government's response to them; and, secondly, to urge recipients to
respond quickly and constructively to the spirit of the
recommendations in order to improve, as necessary, existing safety
and crowd control measures at sports g r o un d s.

A.   COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS                        GR O U N D S

2.  The Report concludes that the Bradford fire was caused accide-nfra’l
and comments that, had the safety advice contained in the Home Office
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) '(the 'Green Guide') been
followed, the tragedy would not have occurred.   On the Birmingham City
FC incident, the Report concludes that the disorder was the product
of violence by both sets of fans to a degree which the police could
not reasonably have foreseen.

3.  Attached at Annex A is a copy of the text of the Home Secretary’s
oral statement to Parliament on 2*J July responding to the Inquiry's
Interim Report and at Annex B a copy of his more detailed written
statement.  The latter sets out each of the Report's recommendations,
including the provisional recommendations, and the Government's
responses to them.  All this material has been circulated to the
governing bodies of the major sports in England and Wales listed
at Annex C in the expectation that they will advise their members
to continue to co-operate by assisting in the implementation of the
Inquiry's recommendations.

       A number of the Report's recommendations have implications
for the responsibilities of local authorities, chief fire officers
and chief officers of police.  They are all accordingly invited to
                                                                               /cons ider.

7.     Consultations with the AHA and ACC will take place with th<-
object of determining how best local registration of sports g r c n d s
might be achieved (Recommendation 17).     As for the nature of
materials used in construction of new stands (Recommendation 1 3 ),
it is suggested that building and planning authorities continue
their present practices unless a n d !until further advice is received.

B.    CHIEF FIRE OFFICERS REPORTS ON SPORTS GROUNDS

8.  The Home Secretary has expressed his gratitude to chief fire
officers for the prompt and efficient manner in which the survey
of sports grounds has been carried out - see Annex A.   Work on
analysing the reports' is continuing in the Home Office and a digest
of them will be submitted to the Inquiry.   The Home Secretary's
statements indicate the important results of the surveys on which
immediate action has been taken by brigades.

9-  It is appreciated that, in responding to Her Majesty's Chief
Inspector of Fire Services' letter of 16 May to chief fire officers
some brigades were only able to concentrate inspections on
uncertificated sports stadia with accommodation for more than 10,000
spectators (i.e. which could be designated under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975).  However, a large number of brigades in whose
area there were fewer sports grounds of this capacity were able to
extend their inspections to sports grounds with accommodation for
far fewer than 10,000 spectators    Section 10 of the 1975 Act is
applicable to sports grounds            ve of the number of spectators
accommodated and it is important that those brigades which have not
so far inspected sports grounds with accommodation for less than
10,000 spectators should do so as priorities and resources permit
so that stands which represent, a serious fire hazard can be
identified and remedial action taken (Recommendation 16).

10.  An extra copy of this    circular and Annexes is attached for chief
fire officers.  In view of    the provisions of s . 16 of the Local
Government Act 1985 copies    are being sent also to the Chief
Executives of metropolitan    district councils and London boroughs.

11.   Any enquiries should   be directed to -

 effectiveness next season. In England and W ales tbe
  Association o f C hief Police Officers has introduced a new
  system for exchanging inform ation about tbe conduct o f
  fans, which should assist in anticipating and preventing
  trouble. Three o f the Home Office photographic vehicles
  will be available to be deployed at football m atches,
  together w ith two experimental higb-<lefinition tripod-
  mounted cam eras. This is in addition to tbe £500,000
  worth of closed circuit television equipm ent purchased
  through funds provided by tbe Football Trust.

 INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS
 INTERIM REPORT JULY 1985 ( CMND 9565 )




GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO RECOf^ENDATIONS




GROUND MANAGEMENT


RECOMMENDATIONS


1•       Evacuation procedures should be a matter of police training-
and form part of the briefing by police officer? before a football
match.    (Paragraph 3-9)-



2.       The local authority team responsible for issuing safety
certificates in respect of designated grounds should, as heretofore,
include police officers.      (Paragraph 3.15)



Certificating authorities and chief officers of police will be
invited to act upon these recommendations (see also Recommendation 10),




RECOMMEN DATIONS


6.       Those managing sports grounds not governed by safety certificates
should give serious consideration, with the assistance of fire authorities,
to the presence in a ground of suitable fire fighting equipment.
(Paragraph 3-5*0


7.       Stewards at all sports grounds should be trained in fire fighting.
(Paragraph 3.55)


8.       In designat-ed grounds it should be a terra of the safety certificate
that an adequate first-aid room should be provided.     (Paragraph 3.99)




                                       1
 10•    Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
 precauti ons and fire-fighting (see Recommendation 7 above) but should
 also be trained in how best to help the police in evacuation.
 (Paragraph 3-10*0


        Suitable and adequate exits should be provided in all sports
 grounds.   (Paragraph 3-138)

15.    No smoking should take place in combustible stands, that this
should be a condition of entry to the ground thst signs to that effect
should be prominently displayed ana this should be a condition of
entry to the ground.   (Paragraph 3.1*U)


 The relevant sports authorities will be invited to draw the attention
 of sports grounds managers to these recommendations, and certificating
 authorities will be asked to consider reflecting the recommendations
 in new or amended safety certificates as appropriate in the case of
 designated grounds.   The fire and police services will be asked to stand
ready to advise on equipment and assist with training as appropriate.




RECOMMENDATION


9.     There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety
Executive and the fire authorities and local authorities as to how best
t;e co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and reports.
(Paragraph 3-95)


The HSE has appointed a member of it3 Exeoulive to review liaison
arrangements between its Inspectors and the fire authorities.    He will
consult Government Departments and others in this review, the results of
which will be made public.




RECOMMENDATION


^ •    Fire Authorities should identify and visit all sports stadia, in their
areas and should prohibit or restrict the. use or any stands which, in their
view, constitute a risk to spectators because of the inadequacy of the fire '
precautions. (Paragraph 3.1*42)
J.


       Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales were invited by the Home Secretary
       on 16 May to inspect all sports grounds and were reminded of the powers
      available to them to take emergency action if, in their view, fire hazards
      constituting a risk to spectators are revealed.   The Secretary of State
      for Scotland similarly asked Firemasters to inspect sports grounds in Scotland.
      Reports received show that fire brlgpdes have not hesitated to recommend
      emergency action where necessary, including in a number of cases a prohibition
      on the use of stands or a restriction on the number of spectators allowed
      into them.




0     RECOMMENDATION


      17•    In order to ensure a complete record of sports grounds a
      local registration system should be set up.   (Paragraph 3-150)


     Consultation will take place with the local authority associations to
     establish how such records may best be compiled and maintained.     The
     recent visits of the fire brigades ‘'see Recorrcnendation 16) should have
     in practice marshalled much of the relevant data already.




     STRUCTURES


     RECOMMENDATION


     13-    Building of new permanent stands of combustible materials
     should be prohibited as a general rule.   (Paragraph 3.132)


     This recommendation will be given speedy and urgent consideration
     by the Departments who are responsible for building regulations.




                                      3
    GREEN GUIDE


    RECOMMENDATIONS


- *4.      The Green Guide should be amended to include in Paragraph 11 a
  provision that, wherever practicable, roads within a quarter of a
 mile of a sports ground should be kept entirely free of parked vehicles.
  (Paragraph 3.35?


          Paragraph 6.1^.6 of the   Green Guid--? snould De amended to reod:
 "All exit gates should be manned at all times while the ground is used
 ky the public and be canal;le of being opened irenediately frcn insi ci
 by anyone in an emergency.”    (Paragraph 3.111)


 I-*      The Green Guide should be amended to contain a specific provision,
 in relation to stewards,


          {j.)    that they should be trained and instructed to
          deal with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation
          (see also Recommendations 7 and 10),


          (ii)    that they should be given written instructions
          about the action to be taken in cases of emergency;


          (iii)   that they should receive practical instruction
r        and training appropriate to their responsibility;


         (iv)     that no one should be employed as a steward
         unless they have been so instructed and trained; and


         (v)      that they should be adequate in number, physically
         and mentally capable of performing their duties, effectively
         deployed, effectively supervised and readily identifiable.
        (Paragraph 3-117)


19•      The next edition of tne Green Guide should ruake it clear
that it applies to all sports grounds.     (Paragraph 3-15*4)
 These points will be noted fcr inclusion in the next edition of the Green
 Guide which will be needed after the Inquiry's final report is received.
 Action will not however depend upon the availability of a fresh edition and
 certificating authorities and chief officers of police (Recommendation *0
 will be invited to take such steps as are open to them now.




 CROWD MANAGEMENT


 RECOMMENDATIONS


 5•     Consideration should be given to making it a-criminal offence
 in England and Wales to have a smoke bomb or similar device at sports
 grounds.   (Paragraph 3 .*12)


 22-    There should be a specific offence of throwing a missile at
 sports grounds. (Paragraph 6.57)


The case for inviting Parliament to create new criminal offences on
these lines will be studied urgently in connection with the Government's
intention of introducing legislation in the next session of Parliament
following its r_view of the law relating to public order.




RECOMMENDATIONS


20.    Urgent consideration should be given by football clubs in
England and Wales to introducing membership system so as to exclude
visiting fans.     (Paragraph 6.^8)


23.    Football clubs should review their arrangements for entry and
the organisation of their turnstiles.    (Paragraph 6.62)


Both these recommendations are for football authorities and clubs, but the
Government hopes that they will be given serious consideration.    The
Government has been encouraging the Football Association and the Football
League to introduce a scheme of membership cards and the options are currently-
     being considered in a Footbsjl League worKiri£ group; thst Diroup's
     attention will therefore be drawn to the Ir:;uiry’s Pecc-nrnendjtion 2 0 .
     The governing bodies' attention will alro be drawr: to Recommendation 23
     which might be influenced by decisions upon Recommendation 2 0 .

 RECOMMENDATION,


3-        Early attention should be given tv the Home Office r-irectorate

suitable personal radic for the police. (Faracrarh 3. "5-)


18-      Consideration should be given as hov best to deal with temporary
stands and marquees        (Paragraph 3-151)


2*4-      Considerationshould be given to the design                          of astandard,
efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.                  (Paragraph 6 .6 3 )


Each of these will be studied as the Inquiry advises.                              Recommendations
18 and 2*4 may best be taken forward in the context of the Inquiry's next
stage and when it turns to examine the Green Guide as a whole.
 PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS


 (To be reviewed in the Final Report)


 1.     I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should
 be given the unfettered right of search before entry to football grounds by
 Statute.'   (Paragraph 3-^1)


 2.     I am minded    to recommend that Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971
 should be amended with a view to giving the Fire Authority power in cases other
 than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional     (Paragraph 3-61)


 3-     Linked with the above, I am     winded to recommend that consideration
 should be given to introducing legislation giving powers for the Fire Authority
 to apply to the High Court for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for
an interdict in Scotland) under Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
 (Paragraph 3.61)


*4.     I am minded     to recommend that Section 10 of the Safety at Sports Grounds
Act 1975 should be amended in like manner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions
Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations 2 and 3) and an application to the
High Court for an injunction (cr to the Court of Session for an interdict in
Scotland) should be an alternative remedy.      (Paragraph 3-76)


5.      I am minded to recommend that the Secretary cf State shou11 exercise his
powers to designate all sports grounds, whatever their size to include indoor
as well as outdoor activities.     (Paragraph 3.1*15)


6.    I am minded     to recommend immediate designation of anyground
capable of holding over 5,000 spectators, to cover all sports grounds,
not merely football grounds.      (Paragraph 3.1*46)


7-    I am minded     to recommend that consideration should be given   to
providing the police with additional powers of arrest under the
Public Order Act, 1936.    (Paragraph 6.66)


8.    I am minded     to recommend that consideration should be given   to
creating a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse
at a sports ground. (Paragraph 6.67)


These are noted and the Government will stand by to assist the
Inquiry in its further consideration of the matters.

1.   The Chairman Mr. Naylor welcomed the new members to the
     Committee and outlined the terms of reference and the aims
     of the Committee.

2.   Minutes of the meeting held in County Hall London on the
     22nd October 1 9 8 2 .

     These minutes were for information only as they had
     previously been circulated and corrected.

     R eports

     Mr.                asked members if they had any problems which
     t h e y w i s h e d to raise or items which they thought might
     interest the Committee.

     Mr. _______ (Cleveland) indicated that his Authority was
     unhappy with the way in which one of the designated clubs
     in his area was letting things slide.    He informed the
     Committee that a meeting had been arranged with a view to
     limiting the capacity of the ground.

     General discussion took place regarding testing, inspections
     etc. and the general view which emerged was that barrier
     tests have been maintained annually on a percentage basis.
     Most clubs are required to furnish structural and electrical
     certificates.  Grounds are inspected at least annually by
     the Fire Service, Police and Engineers, either together or
     individually.

     A number of members were concerned about Stewarding of the
     ground and considered the steward system- tended to break
     down for a variety of reasons.  It was generally felt that
     properly trained stewards possibly with certificates of
     competence were necessary.  Where training was given by the
     local Authority this was mainly carried out by the Fire
     Service.

     Discussion took place on the value of electrically controlled
     gates, |          (Tyne and Wear) said that the system
     installed at the Newcastle ground had now been abandoned
     after failures. |           |(Suffolk) stated that the system
     installed at the Ipswich ground was very successful and was
     operated from the police control box.   The cost was around
     £7,000.               (Lancashire) said that his Authority
     had been quoted £1,000 per gate plus cost of external wiring
     and equipment.

     It was raised that the design of electrically operated doors
     should consider such items as power, power failure, alarm
     system and also the possibility that if 25 people pushed
     against the gate it would open even if electrically locked.
     This final item was objected to on the same grounds as that
     of installing panic bolts.  That is, that any form of door
     opening device which could be operated by spectators could
     lead to them opening the doors to allow other people into
     the ground thus causing even more problems.
                            - 3 -



     It was agreed that for the benefit of Authorities new to
     the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, a list of Authorities
     who already had designated grounds would be circulated to
     enable the new Authorities to contact others who may have
     dealt with similar problems in the past and would be able
     to give advice on the form of the Certificate .

     Roller shutter and sliding doors were discussed and although
     these were frowned upon in the Act some Authorities accepted
     them until they could be replaced.

     Discussion took place on the point made by
     (Lancashire) that some club directors felt tney were not
     getting the same consideration as other clubs.  It was
     generally agreed that Authorities used the same basic guide
     lines but although there were similarities in grounds, the
     conditions with respect to the features of the grounds,
     particularly in respect of timber stands, were not the same,
     and therefore each case had to be treated on its merits.

5.   "Post Bradford"

     This item was combined with item 6 "Clause 1.5".    Discussion
     commenced with a summary by              (W. Yorkshire) of the
     situation in his Authority since the fire at Bradford City
     F.C.   Bradford City was non-designated ground.   In order
     that the club could apply for a grant to assist with the
     rebuilding of the timber stand roof, the County Council had
     inspected the ground and sent a letter to the club.    A number
     of items were included in the letter including reference to
     the litter beneath the stand.   The Authority has since been
     •criticised for not taking action but the application of
     Section 10 implies the action should be reasonable.    It is
     easy to be wise after the event but prior to the fire it was
     not felt to be reasonable to apply for a Section 10 Order
     with only one game to be played that season.    The work to
     refurbish the stand was to commence in the week following
     the final game.

     West Yorkshire have made about 16 recommendations to the
     Popplewell enquiry.  The main recommendations are as follows:-

     1)   All ground should be designated.

     2)   All timber floored stands should be phased out.

     3)   All exits should be colour coded with alternative    routes
              indicated on tickets.

     4)   All stewards to be trained by the Fire Service and be
          issued with a certificate of competence.

     5)   Before a game is played a nominated Director should
          certify to the referee that the terms of the certificate
          have been complied with.
     6)   Counties should continue to be responsible not the
          District Councils.
           felt that the events at Bradford have raised
the following questions

1)   Would Authorities use Section 10 ?

2)   How many Authorities have used Section 10 ?

3)   How rigorously will the code be used?   Here]____________
     cited the case at Keighley RLFC, who have a timber stanc
     with rooms beneath.  It is possible by means of the
     removal of the front pallisade to make easy egress from
     the stand to the pitch.  However, there is no fire
     resistance in the rooms beneath the seating area and the
     cost to provide adequate fire protection would be high.
     This raises the problem.  Should the club be forced to
     provide the fire .protection or have the stand closed
     or, is the easy means of escape considered to be adequate?
     This type of problem will face Authorities in the future.

Following the Report by                         (Norfolk) was
invited to speak on "Clause l.b".   He raised the point that
since Bradford, his Authority had checked the Norwich City
ground which had been previously designated.   He reported
that his Authority had originally accepted a post and
corrugated iron external boundary fence, parts of which have
since been rebuilt to an acceptable standard.   Would it be
reasonable to allow replacement over a period of time as was
at first envisaged?  On this particular inspection it was
found that there were problems with stewarding but probably
lack of communication was to blame.

With regard to the perimeter fence)           |(East Sussex)
said that his Authority included a clause in the Certificate
regarding the renewal over a period of the external perimeter
fence.

A question was then asked about the loading used for a perimeter
fence or w a l l . General agreement was that this should be the
5 KN/M load.                  indicated that crush barriers have
been erected adjacent to exit gates to keep the crowd away
from the perimeter wall.

Discussion then took place regarding inspections and problems
with implications on non-designated grounds.

            (GMC) reported that the Greater Manchester Council
had decided that 48 grounds should be inspected.    These were
for a variety of sports including cricket, greyhound racing,
speedway etc.               [(Nottingham) stated that his
Authority were carrying out similar inspections but expressed
his concern about liability for non-designated grounds such
as Trent Bridge.                   (GLC) said his Authority
had recommended to the Popplewell enquiry that the limit per
designation should be reduced from 10,000 to 3,000.    GLC
have inspected 30 grounds so far with a further 100 or so to
go.  They have produced a form of letter which indicates w<?rk
to be done immediately, work to be done over a period and work
which is recommended.
                          - 5 -


                (West Midlands) indicated that his legal section
     were saying that the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
     (Football) only applied to football grounds and other grounds
     should be subject to the previous Guide.  Also the legal
     section were looking for a statement that the ground is "safe"
     whereas the inspectors of the ground are only willing to
     state that the ground does or does not comply with the Code.
     This is a source of conflict.

     Most Authorities appear to be using the football guide and
                |(Cleveland) commented that his Authority were a
     little wary of involvement with non-designated clubs at the
     moment as again the question "is the ground safe?" was raised
     and this is impossible to answer categorically.   Some
     Authorities have a manpower problem with regard to structural
     inspections while others like Kent have inspected a large
     number of g r o un ds.

                (Humberside) wondered if rather than await problems
     Authorities should search out grounds which could fall into
     the Section 10 category.    He also wondered if non-designated
     grounds should be inspected as his Authority has pulled back
     from inspecting so far, although the Fire Service are
     inspecting under Fire Service Regulations in accordance with
     the Home Office letter.    Discussion revealed that many
     Authorities are inspecting non-designated grounds which lead
     to the feeling that, where clubs with non-designated grounds
     expected a large crowd i.e. cup matches or similar, the
     match should be played on the nearest designated ground.
                  (West Midlands) gave the example that at Walsall
     some 2. years ago a wall collapsed when there were 20,000
     spectators on the ground.    Since then any matches with over
     10,000 spectators are played on nearby grounds.     Newport
     County were hoping to achieve an 18,000 limit on their
     ground but the crowd at Bournemouth was fixed at a low level.
     It was considered to be vital that maximum capacity crowds
     were all ticket,                 ((Hertfordshire) pointed out
     that even with all ticket matches there could be some
     spectators left outside the ground without tickets who could
     cause a problem.    Watford hold back 2 to 3,000 tickets in
     case of such an emergency.

     It was agreed that each Authority should send the Secretary
     a summary of its method of dealing with non-designated
     grounds for distribution to all members.

7)   Stability of Brick Walls

                 (West Midlands) cited the case at Birmingham
     where there was a riot at the match.   The ground was not
     cleared until an hour after the game and during that time
     the police charged some Leeds supporters who retreated into
     an area not normally used and put pressure on a wall which
     collapsed.   This raised the point that should any wall,
     regardless of its location, be able to support crowd pressure?
     The wall which collapsed was 9 inches thick but it was pointed
     out that even a wall 18 inches thick was suspect at 6 feet
     high.
                               -   6 -


      Discussion raised the point of reasonableness and a suggestion
      made was that barriers would possibly be a more economical
      way of keeping spectators away from support walls.  It was
      agreed that walls should be checked for the corresponding
      forces parallel and at right angles to the flow depending
      upon location.

8.    Testing of Handrailing

      Testing of handrailing appeared to have more practical
      difficulties than the testing of barriers but discussion
      revealed that handrailing should be tested wherever possible.

9.    Implications of Non-Designated Grounds

      This matter had been dealt with during the earlier discussion.

10)   Licensing fees

                 (Norfolk) said his Authority charged the actual'
      costs for the certificate but expressed his concern regarding
      non-designated grounds which did not require a certificate
      and also the annual cost after the issue of a Certificate.

                  (West Yorkshire) explained that his Authority
      cnargea tne economic rate for the certificate and also
      charged the costs thereafter.              (West Midlands)
      agreed that his Authority made the same charges but was not
      really sure what to do about non-designated grounds. General
      discussion revealed the feeling that at this stage there was
      no method of recovering costs from non-designated grounds
      while many other Authorities such as Lancashire, GMC and GLC
      did not make annual charges.  Some like Nottinghamshire and
      South Yorkshire did not charge at all.

11)   Any Other Business

      a)                (Lancashire) informed the Committee that his
           Authority were at present studying preliminary plans for
           acovered "Super Bowl" type stadium at Blackpool which
           would not only house the football club but would be a
           multipurpose centre.

      b)   Responsibility for Testing

                        |(Derbyshire) raised the point that his
           Authority, m common with others, accept a certificate
           from Consultants that barriers have been tested.     In
           spite of this he wondered who was responsible for the
           results.   It emerged from discussion that it was believed
           to be the Authorities' responsibility to ensure the
           competence of the Consultant.              (Humberside)
           said one of his clubs had bought a testnig machine and
           the Authority required a Chartered Engineer to carry out
           the tests.
     c)   Stewarding

                      (West Yorkshire) informed the Working Party
          that his Authority were in the process of producing a
          training schedule for stewards and pointed out that the
          Guide to Pop Concerts was useful in this respect.

     d)   Next Meeting

          It was agreed that a further meeting should be called
          after the implications of the Popplewell enquiry become
          known.

Dear Sir

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 54/1985
SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS
A. COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND
    CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS - INTERIM REPORT (Cmnd 9585)
B. CHIEF FIRE OFFICER REPORTS


1. The Interim Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety
and Control at Sports Grounds set up by the Home Secretary following
the events of 11 May at Bradford City FC and Birmingham City FC has
now been published.  The purpose of this circular is, first, to
inform recipients of the recommendations of the Inquiry and the
Government's response to them; and, secondly, to urge recipients to
respond quickly and constructively to the spirit of the
recommendations in order to improve, as necessary, existing safety
and crowd control measures at sports grounds.

A.    COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS

2. The Report concludes that the Bradford fire was caused accidentally
and comments that, had the safety advice contained in the Home Office
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) (the 'Green Guide') been
followed, the tragedy would not have occurred.  On the Birmingham City
FC incident, the Report concludes that the disorder was the product
of violence by both sets of fans to a degree which the police could
not reasonably have foreseen.

3. Attached at Annex A is a copy of the text of the Home Secretary's
oral statement to Parliament on 2M July responding to the Inquiry's
Interim Report and at Annex B a copy of his more detailed written
statement.  The latter sets out each of the Report's recommendations,
including the provisional recommendations, and the Government's
responses to them.  All this material has been circulated to the
governing bodies of the major sports in England and Wales listed
at Annex C in the expectation that they will advise their members
to continue to co-operate by assisting in the implementation of the
Inquiry's recommendations.

^.     A number of the Report's recommendations have implications
for the responsibilities of local authorities, chief fire officers
and chief officers of police.  They are all accordingly invited to
                                                                                        /consider.
                                                                      t
                                   - 2 -




consider as a matter of urgency what steps they should take as
necessary in their particular local circumstances to give effect -
where possible in time for the start of the 1 9 8 5 / 8 6 football
season - to the recommendations that relate to their responsibilities.
Although a number of the points will have already been dealt with
either as a result of the recent exercise by chief fire officers
(see Part B below) or, in the case of designated stadia, by existing
safety certificate conditions, certificating authorities are nonetheless
requested to review their certification procedures and existing
certificates so as to incorporate as necessary the Inquiry's interim
recommendations.  In so doing, authorities should bear in mind that
it is not considered that action upon the Inquiry's recommended
amendments to the Greei Guide should wait upon the issue of the next
edition of the Green Guide.   (This will not be prepared until after
the Final Report is received.)

5.     The specific points for consideration by the responsible
authorities are as follows:

(a)   Certificating authorities are asked to -
      (i)      ensure that the police form part of the issuing
                team for safety certificates (Recommendation 1);

      (ii)     consider inclusion of a condition within safety
                certificates for adequate first-aid facilities
                (Recommendation 8 );

      (iii)    consult chief fire officers over the adequacy of
                exits at all sports grounds with the aim of
                reflecting the advice in new or existing safety
                certificates as necessary, bearing in mind
                spectator numbers to be permitted into the ground
                or part of the ground and in the case of non-
                designated grounds and the emergency procedures
                under section 10 of the 1975 Act (Recommendation 14);

      (iv)     for designated stadia, consider the feasibility of
                including a smoking prohibition as a safety
                certificate condition where stands made of
                combustible materials are in use (Recommendation 15);

      (v)      give preliminary thought to how best a sports ground
                register might be set up and used - see also
                paragraph 7 below (Recommendation 17);

      (vi)     consider with the emergency services and appropriate
                authorities the practicability and enforcement of a
                no-parking zone around sports grounds when an event
                is likely to attract significant crowds (Recommendation 4);

      (vii)    consider whether safety certificate conditions relating
                to manned exits require amplification or amendment, and
                how best to implement (e.g. protection of stewards by a
                police presence on exit gates) and ensure compliance
                (Recommendation 11); and

      (viii)   review for inclusion in new and existing safety
               certificates suitable requirements relating to
               training and instruction of stewards (Recommendation 12).

                                                                   /(b).

 (b)   Chief Fire Officers are asked to -

       (i)     c o n s u l t and a d v i s e management o f n o n - d e s i g n a t e d
                s p o r t s g r o u n d s on t h e p r e s e n c e , l o c a t i o n a n d

                stan d ard s adopted fo r s a fe ty c e r t i f i c a t i o n a t
                d e s i g n a t e d g ro u n d s a s th e y a r d s t i c k ) (Recommendation   6);

       (ii)    by arrangement with sports grounds managers, give
                assistance in fire-fighting training for stewards
                (Recommendations 7, 10 and 1 2 );

       (ill)   advise sports grounds management and local authorities
                on the adequacy and suitability of exits at sports
                grounds in relation to the spectator numbers
                permitted to attend the ground or part of the
                ground (Recommendation 14); and

       (iv)    continue, as necessary, inspections of uncertificated
                stadia to assess the need to restrict or prohibit for
                reasons of fire safety the number of spectators at a
                ground or particular part of a ground (Recommendation 16)
                see also paragraphs 6 and 9 below.

 (O    Chief Officers of Police are asked to -

               consider how evacuation procedures at individual
               grounds can best be incorporated into police
               training and form part of pre-event briefing
               (Recommendation 1 );

       (ii)    continue provision for police representation within
                local authority teams for issuing safety certificates
                (Recommendation 2);

       (iii)   consult the management of sports grounds where a
                police presence is required at an event (or events)
                for crowd control within the ground about the
                training of stewards on how best to assist the
               police in an evacuation (Recommendation 1 0 ); and

       (iv)    consider, in collaboration with the local authority
                (see 3 (a)(vii) above) and sports grounds management,
               how to assist in manning exit gates.

6 . As regards designated stadia, certificating authorities in
collaboration with chief fire officers and chief officers of police
will no doubt wish to consider whether, following the Home Office
letter on designation of 19 July to Chief Executives, the best way
   *ff*ct quickly some of the Interim Report's recommendations
(particularly where structural alterations are involved) will be to
set a lower spectator ceiling based on the normal level of attendance,
rather than the nominal maximum capacity.  Many sports grounds and
stadia which do not fall within the present scope of designation
under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 will have already been
inspected by chief fire officers.  It is hoped that supplementary
advice on such matters as fire fighting equipment, training in
fire fighting and evacuation procedures will be given to the
management and staff of sports grounds as needed in the knowledge
of the power to take emergency action where necessary.

                                                                                   n   -

7.     Consultations with the AMA and ACC will take place with the
object of determining how best local registration of sports grcvnds
might be achieved (Recommendation 17).  As for the nature of
materials used in construction of new stands (Recommendation 13),
it is suggested that building and planning authorities continue
their present practices unless and until further advice is received.

B.    CHIEF FIRE OFFICERS REPORTS ON SPORTS GROUNDS

8 . The Horae Secretary has expressed his gratitude to chief fire
officers for the prompt and efficient manner in which the survey
of sports grounds has been carried out - see Annex A.   Work on
analysing the reports is continuing in the Home Office and a digest
of them will be submitted to the Inquiry.   The Home Secretary's
statements indicate the important results of the surveys on which
immediate action has been taken by brigades.

9.  It is appreciated that, in responding to Her Majesty's Chief
Inspector of Fire Services' letter of 16 May to chief fire o f f i c e r s ^
some brigades were only able to concentrate inspections on
uncertificated sports stadia with accommodation for more than 10,000
spectators (i.e. which could be designated under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975).  However, a large number of brigades in whose
area there were fewer sports grounds of this capacity were able to
extend their inspections to sports grounds with accommodation for
far fewer than 10,000 spectators.  Section 10 of the 1975 Act is
applicable to sports grounds irrespective of the number of spectators
accommodated and it is important that those brigades which have not
so far inspected sports grounds with accommodation for less than
10,000 spectators should do so as priorities and resources permit
so that stands which represent a serious fire hazard can be
identified and remedial action taken (Recommendation 1 6 ).

10.  An extra copy of this    circular and Annexes is attached for chief
fire officers.  In view of    the provisions of s. 16 of the Local
Government Act 1985 copies    are being sent also to the Chief
Executives of metropolitan    district councils and London boroughs.

11.   Any enquiries should be directed to -

     Secondly, all uncertificated grounds o f the third and

athletics grounds has been inspected.
    Chief fire officers and fire masters have sent copies o f
their findings to the management o f tbe sports grounds
showing what remedial measures have to be taken. In
tome cases, this will involve tbe complete closure o f a

Local authorities and local fire authorities have sufficient
statutory powers to ensure that essential fire safety
requirements are complied with. These will in no way be
affected by the separate proposals directed towards
 streamlining the present law on fire precautions published
yesterday in a consultative document and which I am
 inviting tbe inquiry also to consider in tbe context o f its
 work.

  effectiveness next season. In England and Wales the
  Association o f Chief Police Officers has introduced a new
  system for exchanging information about tbe conduct of
  fans, which should assist in anticipating and preventing
  trouble. Three o f tbe Home Office photographic vehicles

INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS
INTERIM REPORT JULY 1985 ( CMND 9585 )




GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS




GROUND MANAGEMENT


RECOMMENDATIONS


1.       Evacuation procedures should be a matter of police training
and form part of the briefing by police officers before a football
match.    (Paragraph 3-9).



2.       The local authority team responsible for issuing safety
certificates in respect of designated grounds should, as heretofore,
include police officers.     (Paragraph 3.15)



Certificating authorities and chief officers of police will be
invited to act upon these recommendations (see also Reconinendation 10).




RECOMMENDATIONS


6*       Those managing sports grounds not governed by safety certificates
should give serious consideration, with the assistance of fire authorities,
to the presence in a ground of suitable fire fighting equipment.
(Paragraph 3.5*0


7.       Stewards at all sports grounds should be trained in fire fighting.
(Paragraph 3.55)


®*       In designated grounds it should be a term of the safety certificate
that an adequate first-aid room should be provided.    (Paragraph 3.99)
 10.    Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
 precautions and fire-fighting (see Recommendation 7 above) but should
 also be trained in how best to help the police in evacuation.
 (Paragraph 3-10*0


1*J.   Suitable and adequate exits should be provided in all sports
grounds.   (Paragraph 3.138)

15.    No smoking should take place in combustible stands, that this
should be a condition of entry to the ground that signs to that effect
should be prominently displayed and this should be a condition of
entry to the ground.    (Paragraph 3.1^1)


The relevant sports authorities will be invited to draw the attention
of sports grounds managers to these reoonmendations, and certificating
authorities will be asked to consider reflecting the recommendations
in new or amended safety certificates as appropriate in the case of
designated grounds.    The fire and police services will be asked to stand
ready to advise on equipment and assist with training as appropriate.




RECOMMENDATION


9.     There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety
Executive and the fire authorities and local authorities as to how best
to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and reports.
(Paragraph 3.95)


The HSE has appointed a member of its Executive to review liaison
arrangements between its inspectors and the fire authorities.    He will
consult Goverrment Departments and others in this review, the results of
which will be made public.




RECOMMENDATION


16•    Fire Authorities should identify and visit all sports stadia in their
areas and should prohibit or restrict the use of any stands which, in their
view, constitute a risk to spectators because of the inadequacy of the fire
precautions. (Paragraph 3.1^2)
9




     Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales were invited by the Home Secretary
     on 16 Msy to inspect all sports grounds and were reminded of the powers
     available to them to take emergency action if, in their view, fire hazards
     constituting a risk to spectators are revealed.   The Secretary of State
     for Scotland similarly asked Firemasters to inspect sports grounds in Scotland.
     Reports received show that fire brl^Kfes have not hesitated to recommend
     emergency action where necessary, including in a number of cases a prohibition
     on the use of stands or a restriction on the number of spectators allowed
     into them.




    RECOMMENDATION


    17.    In order to ensure a complete record of sports grounds a
    local registration system should be set up.   (Paragraph 3-150)


    Consultation will take place with the local authority associations to
    establish how such records may best be compiled and maintained.     The
    recent visits of the fire brigades ^see Recommendation 16) should have
    in practice marshalled much of the relevant data already.




    STRUCTURES


    RECOMMENDATION


    13.    Building of new permanent stands of combustible materials
    should be prohibited as a general rule.   (Paragraph 3.132)


    This recommendation will be given speedy and urgent consideration
    by the Departments who are responsible for building regulations.
 GREEN GUIDE


 RECOMMENDATIONS


 4.    The Green Guide should be amended to include in Paragraph 11 a
 provision that, wherever practicable, roads within a quarter of a
 mile of a sports ground should be kept entirely free of parked vehicles.
 (Paragraph 3.35)


 H-    Paragraph 6.1**.6 of the   Green Guide snould De amended to read:
 "All exit gates should be manned at all times while the ground is used
 by the public and be capable of being opened immediately frcn inside
 by anyone in an emergency.n   (Paragraph 3.111)


12.    The Green Guide should be amended to contain a specific provision,
in relation to stewards,


       (i)      that they should be trained and instructed to
       deal with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation
       (see also Recommendations 7 and 10);


       (ii)    that they should be given written instructions
       about the action to be taken in cases of emergency;


       (iii)   that they should receive practical instruction
       and training appropriate to their responsibility;


       (iv)    that no one should be employed as a steward
       unless they have been so instructed and trained; and


       (v)     that they should be adequate in number, physically
       and mentally capable of performing their duties, effectively
       deployed, effectively supervised and readily identifiable.
      (Paragraph 3.117)


19.   The next edition of the Green Guide should make it clear
that it applies to all sports grounds. (Paragraph 3.154)
These points will be noted for inclusion in the next edition of the Green
Guide which will be needed after the Inquiry's final report is received.
Action will not however depend upon the availability of a fresh edition and
certificating authorities and chief officers of police (Recommendation *0
will be invited to take such steps as are open to them now.




CROWD MANAGEMENT


RECOMMENDATIONS


5.     Consideration should be given to making it a criminal offence
in England and Wales to have a smoke bomb or similar device at sports
grounds.   (Paragraph 3.^2)


22.    There should be a specific offence of throwing a missile at
sports grounds. (Paragraph 6.57)


The case for inviting Parliament to create new criminal offences on
these lines will be studied urgently in connection with the Government's
intention of introducing legislation in the next session of Parliament
following its review of the law relating to public order.




RECOMMENDATIONS


20.    Urgent consideration should be given by football clubs in
England and Wales to introducing membership system so as to exclude
visiting fans.     (Paragraph 6.48)


23.    Football clubs should review their arrangements for entry and
the organisation of their turnstiles.   (Paragraph 6.62)


Both these recommendations are for football authorities and clubs, but the
Government hopes that they will be given serious consideration.    The
Government has been encouraging the Football Association and the Football
League to introduce a scheme of membership cards and the options are currently
     being considered in a Footbeil League working group: that group's
     attention will therefore be drawn to the Inquiry's FecoramendJtion 20.
  The governing bodies' attention will also be drawn to Recommendation 23
  which might be influenced by decisions upon Recommendation 20.




 'RECOMMENDATION


 ^ *       Closed circuit television should be introduced at League football
 grounds in England and Wales ana in tbe Pry-suer Division in Scot land.
 (Paragraph 6.54)


 The Football Trust has allocated £500,000 for the provision of CCTV equipm
 in League grounds during tii* 19*3-^ season.      Ins T r e t ’s attention, a m ’
 that of the Football Associations and the Fco':bail Leagues, wilil be drawn
 to this recommendation.




MISCELLANEOUS


RECOMMENDATION,Q


3.       Early attention should be given by the Home Office Directorate
of Telecommunications to consider the practicality of producing a more
suitable personal radio for the police.      (Paragraph 3-3?)


18.      Consideration should be given as hov best to deal with temporary
stands and marquees      (Paragraph 3.151)


24.      Consideration should be given to the design of a standard,
efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.      (Paragraph 6 .63)


Each of these will be studied as the Inquiry advises.       Recommendations
18 and 24 may best be taken forward in the context of the Inquiry's next
stage and when it turns to examine the Green Guide as a whole.
PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS


(To be reviewed in the Final Report)


1.     I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should
be given the unfettered right of search before entry to football grounds by
statute.'   (Paragraph 3-^1)


2.     I am minded     to recommend that Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971
should be amended with a view to giving the Fire Authority pcwer in cases other
than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional      (Paragraph 3-61)


3-    Linked with the above, I am      minded to recommend that consideration
should be given to introducing legislation giving powers for the Fire Authority
to apply to the High Court for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for
an interdict in Scotland) under Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
(Paragraph 3-61)


       I           am minded   to recommend that Section 10 of the Safety at Sports Grou
Act 1975 should be amended in like manner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions
Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations 2 and 3) and an application to the
High Court for an injunction (cr to the Court of Session for an interdict in
Scotland) should be an alternative remedy.      (Paragraph 3-76)


5.     I am minded to recommend that the Secretary of State should exercise his
powers to designate all sports grounds, whatever their size to include indoor
as well as outdoor activities.     (Paragraph 3.1^5)


6.    I am minded to recommend immediate designation of any ground
capable of holding over 5,000 spectators, to cover all sports grounds,
not merely football grounds.     (Paragraph 3.1^6)


7-    I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to
providing the police with additional powers of arrest under the
Public Order Act, 1936-    (Paragraph 6 .66 )


8.    I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to
creating a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse
at a sports ground. (Paragraph 6.67)


These are noted and the Government will stand by to assist the
Inquiry in its further consideration of the matters.

Dear Sir

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: DESIGNATION ORDER 1985
3RD AND 4TH DIVISIONS OF THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE

1.   You will no doubt already be aware that the Home Secretary in his statement
of 13 May to the House of Commons about the incidents at Bradford City FC and
Birmingham City FC explained that he intended to extend designation under the
Act to the remaining grounds of clubs in Divisions 3 ®nd 4 of theFootball
League; and that in a subsequent statement in the House of Commons on 6 June, in
reply to a Question by Mr Alton MP, the Home Secretary announced that designation
would also be extended to comparable grounds of clubs in Divisions I and II of
the Rugby League.

2.   The Designation Order covering all the remaining undesignated grounds of
clubs in the 3rd and 4th Divisons of the Football League that qualify for
designation under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 has now been laid before
Parliament and this letter is concerned only with the effect of that Order.
(A separate Order covering the relevant Division I and II Rugby League grounds
has also been made and separate letters are being sent to the Chief Executives
of those authorities affected by this second stage of the designation programme.)

3.   I enclose accordingly a copy of the Order (SI 1063/85) which comes into
effect on 9 August 1985, after which date it will be an offence for those
responsible for the ground to admit spectators unless an application has previously
been made for a general safety certificate under the Act. As you will see, the
ground of the following club in your area has been designated:

     Doncaster

4.   The explanatory notes on the procedures to be followed in dealing with
applications for general safety certificates and special safety certificates,
provided in Home Office Circulars Nos. 130/76 of 25 August 1976 and 187/76 of
8 December 1976 respectively, remain generally applicable except for the last
sentence of paragraph 7 of Home Office Circular No. 130/76. This gave some
indication of the man/days ordinarily likely to be involved in the issue of a
safety certificate. Experience over the years in which the Act has now been in
operation indicates, however, that the amount of work involved for an authority
before the issue of a safety certificate can in practice vary so widely depending
on the local circumstances that it is considered unrealistic to attempt any
general guidance on this point.
5.   On the question of timing, the object in bringing the Order into effect at
this early date (as compared with the more leisurely timetable under previous
designation orders) is to ensure that the certification authorities will have
power to impose interim restrictions on spectator ceilings or other safety
measures before the start of the next football season, if this is considered
necessary in the interests of safety. In such circumstances, the appropriate
spectator ceiling included in the certificate could sensibly be seen as essentially
an interim measure to meet immediate perceived risks and as thus reflecting what
could reasonably be allowed on the basis of existing facilities and resources at
the ground. This would leave for further consideration at a later stage the
nature and scope of any remedial work needed in order to allow appropriate
upward revision of the ceiling and/or modification of other interim restrictions
(possibly in stages) by way of the issue of amended certificates as and when the
work is done.

6 . Guidance on certification procedures generally, including possible ways and
means of dealing with the sort of staged approach suggested above, special
occasions and special safety certificates, is given in the explanatory Annexes
to HO Circulars Nos. 130 and 187 of 1976 - copies of which are enclosed for your
convenience, together with a copy of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(Football) to which reference is made in the first of these circulars.

7.   Also enclosed for your information, are copies of the letters which have
been sent to the football clubs about their responsibilities in this connexion.
A copy of "Appendices A and B" referred to in these letters is not enclosed
because they are the same as the Annexes to Home Office Circulars Nos. 130/76
and 187/76 .

                                                  Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: DESIGNATION ORDER 1985
3RD AND 4TH DIVISIONS OF THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE

1.   The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (a copy of which is enclosed) gave
effect to the main recommendations contained in the Report of the Inquiry into
Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds which was prepared by Lord Wheatley following the
serious accident at Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971* The main instrument of
control under the Act is the general safety certificate which is required for
any sports stadium that is the subject of a designation order; and the relevant
county council has power to impose such terms and conditions under the safety
certificate as are considered necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of
safety at the ground, having regard to all the circumstances.

2.   In this connexion, you will be aware that since 1976, designation has been
extended, firstly to the grounds of clubs playing in the 1st Division of the
Football League and to certain so-called international grounds; then to the
grounds of clubs in the 2nd Division; and that more recently, following the
tragic incidents at Bradford City FC and Birmingham City FC grounds of 11 May,
the Home Secretary announced, in a statement to the House of Commons on 13 May
1985, that designation under the Act would now be extended to all the remaining
(as yet undesignated) grounds of clubs in the 3rd and 4th Divisions of the
Football League.

3 . The Designation Order (SI No. 1063/1985), a copy of which is enclosed,
has now been laid before Parliament. The Order comes into effect on 9 August
1985, after which date it will be an offenceunder s.12(1) of the Act for those
responsible for the ground to admit spectators unless an application has been
made for a general safety certificate under the Act.

4*     As you will see, your ground is one of those included in the Order, and
this   means that after 9 August no spectators can be admitted to fixtures at
your   ground unless an application for a general safety certificate has already
been   lodged with the county council.

General Safety Certificates

5 . For this purpose, one of the enclosed application forms should be completed
and sent with the supporting documents (as indicated in paragraph 1 of Appendix
A to this letter), to the County Council. The application then falls to be
dealt with in accordance with the.,Act and the Safety of Sports Grounds (Regulations)
1976 (copy enclosed).
6.   Once application has been made, and pending the issue of a general safety
certificate, spectators may continue to be admitted to your ground as at present;
the timing of the issue of a certificate is entirely a matter for the local
authority to decide. But you will appreciate that the object in bringing the
Order into effect at this early date (as compared with the more leisurely
timetable under previous designation orders) is to ensure that the certification
authorities will have power to impose interim restrictions on spectator ceilings
or other safety measures before the start of the next football season, if this
is considered necessary in the interests of safety. In such circumstances, it
has been suggested to authorities that the appropriate spectator ceiling included
in the certificate would be seen as essentially an interim measure to meet
immediate perceived risks and as thus reflecting what could reasonably be
allowed on the basis of existing facilities and resources of the ground. This
would leave for further consideration at a later stage the nature and scope of
any remedial work that might be needed in order to allow appropriate upward
revision of the ceiling and/or modification of other interim restrictions
(possibly in stages) by way of the issue of amended certificates as and when the
work was done. It is suggested accordingly that you may find it sensible as a
first step to approach the authority with a view to establishing what interim
spectator ceiling might be acceptable on the basis of existing facilities and
resources, if it is not practicable for the time being to achieve the standards
of facilities or resources considered necesary in the interests of spectator
safety in order to permit maximum capacity usageof the stadium.

7.   Guidance as to the procedure to be followed on matters connected with your
application for a general safety certificate is set out in Appendix A to this
letter: paragraphs 3 to 7 will be of particular interest in relation to the sort
of staged approach suggested above, with particular reference to the problems of
special occasions or special circumstances.

Special Safety Certificates

8.   Appendix B covers the procedures for special safety certificates. After a
general safety certificate has been issued, the need could arise for an event
which is not covered by the terms and conditions in that certificate either
because the activity itself is not named therein or because the terms and
conditions normally applicable to that activity are considered inappropriate for
the special occasion in question. The Act provides for special safety certificates
for this purpose and guidance on the procedural matters concerning them is
contained in Appendix B of this letter.

9.   It should be borne in mind that, except with the permission of the local
authority, an application for a special safety certificate must be made at least
3 months before the event. This period is necessary to ensure that no person
will be deprived of his rights of appeal under the Act, in cases where the full
procedure, for which the Act and Regulations provide, requires to be accommodated.
The period can therefore be relaxed only in cases where it is apparent that
individual stages of the procedure will not be required, e.g. where the applicant
has already been accepted as a qualified person. It has also been necessary, in
order to keep the length of the required notice down to an acceptable level, to
apply a strict limit to the time available for each stage of an application for
a special safety certificate.

10. In the light of the foregoing considerations, clubs and local authorities
will no doubt consider that the needs for special safety certificates should as
far as possible be reduced by widening the scope of the general safety certificate
on the basis suggested in paragraphs 6 and 7 of Appendix A but that, where they
continue to be required, applications should normally be made by the holder of
the general safety certificate (gather than the independent promoter of the
special event), giving as much notice as possible.
Special events: desirability of provision being made in the general safety
certificate

11. Once a general safety certificate is in being, all the requirements relating
to a special safety certificate, including the requirement of at least 3 months'
notice, automatically have effect. Clubs will wish to bear in mind the possible
difficulties that could arise if a special event were scheduled to be held at
the ground within 3 months of the grant of the general certificate. Local
authorities should therefore be made aware of any such event which has already
been arranged or which is arranged within the next 6 months or so, so that they
may as far as possible provide for the requirements for the event to be covered
in the general safety certificate. Otherwise, there could be insufficient time
remaining for a special certificate to be considered.

Fees

12. Section 6(1)(b) of the Act provides for regulations to be made as regards
the fees to be charged in respect of applications for safety certificates, and
in accordance with the general policy that local authorities should be able to
charge economic fees for the work undertaken. Regulation 14 provides accordingly.

AMEX


SAFETT OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall
be made in the fora contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the
like effect. Copies of the form were enclosed with the Home Office letter of
26 August 1976 to clubs and stadium authorities. Part II of the form and its
frontispiece should be completed in the case of applications for special safety
certificates. In any case where an application for a special safety certificate
is not made by the holder of the general safety certificate, it should be
accompanied by evidence of the applicant's status. Details of any planned changes
to the normal standing and seating arrangements for spectators should be provided,
together with such further information in support of the application as is
considered necessary to enable the local authority to discharge its functions under
the Act. However, it is open to a local authority, under section 314) of the Act,
to require, by notice in writing, any further information of this kind which they
may think it necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions
to be included in the special safety certificate.

2.   A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates is
that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant is a qualified
person, the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory, whereas the
issue of a special safety certificate remains at its discretion. 3ut an applicant
has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against a refusal (see following
paragraphs for details).

3#   An application for a special safety certificate should normally be nade at
least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied that
the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser period
eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person. On receipt of an
application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
deteimine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be in
a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed in
the certificate. The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make this
determination within 14 days of receiving the application. There is a right of
appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is not a
qualified person (see paragraph 9 ), and, under regulation 5 , the applicant must be
furnished with the reasons for such a determination.

4.   It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused
on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person. This decision
must, in accordance with regulation 6 , be made within 28 days of the receipt of th
application, not only in cases where the local authority has determined that the
applicant is a qualified person but also in those where it has determined that he
is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to be considered. There is also
right of appeal against a refusal on grounds other than a determination that the
applicant is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9). In the event of such a
refusal, therefore, the local authority is again required, under regulation 6 , to
give the applicant the reasons for its decision.
5.   When the first tiro stages have been completed, should it have been decided
that a special safety certificate should be issued, the local authority is
required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the
chief officer of police and to the building authority and to consult them about
the terms and conditions to be included in the certificate. The special safety
certificate must, in accordance with regulation 6 (2 ), then be issued not less
than 28 days before the proposed event is doe to take place.

6 . The fora and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary
according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
certificate would not be appropriate, (in suitable cases, however, regard may
be had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
iFootball) on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 of the paper relating to the
"Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates’'.) Any special
safety certificate must, however, contain, full details of the terms and conditions
imposed, including in particular the matters referred to in section 2 (2 ) of the
Act, and as required by section 2(4-) should be framed where appropriate by
reference to the plan attached to the general safety certificate.

(P.   Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determina­
 tion of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend­
 ment of the certificate. This may be on the application of the holder of the
 certificate or at the discretion of the local authority (see section 412? of the
 Act). This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
 certificate, otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has been
 issued well in advance of the event to which it relates. Any such amendment must,
 however, be publicised as in paragraph t o below.

 8.   Considerations: of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate
 to another person an equally unlikely contingency. Any possible difficulties in
 this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the general
 safety certificate applies for the special certificate. Nevertheless, should an
 application for transfer be made, the local authority must decide within 14 days
 if the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it decides to the
 contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating to giving notice of,
 and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will the appropriate appeals
procedure* should the need arise. In the case of an application for transfer
pbefore a special safety certificate has actually been iasued, there is no reason
 why the local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new
 application in the terms of the original and process it from the point already
 reached.

9 . Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a determina­
tion that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3 ) and against the
refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4). In addition the Act
provides (in section 5 (3 )) a right of appeal to any "interested party* against the
inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety certificate or
against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate. The regulations
provide that, in the ease of a special safety certificate, notice of any such
appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice of the local
authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified, the
publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper circulating in
the locality.
10* As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so to mm
it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also to
advertise its action in the press. A similar obligation falls on an appellant
(under regulation 8 (7 )) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing
to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section 5(4)
of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement. (The
reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the paper
relating to the 'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety
Certificates'.)

11. Any appellant is required (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice Of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the appeal
It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation 8(9), to
inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it wishes to ^
oppose the appeal. With any such notice, the local authority i3 required to"
submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state whether it
wishes a hearing under section 5(4) of the Act. ^The procedure governing the
conduct of all such hearings is set out in regulation 10).

12. It isalso open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to
order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in regulation 12.

Dear Sir

HOIS C5TIC3 CIKCITLAH NO* 1 3 0 / 7 6

SAFETY OF SPORTS GEOtJNDS ACT 1975s
F1SST DESIGNATION 0RD3R A2<D ACCC2PANYING REGULATIONS

    The intention was expressed in Hone Office Circular No* 150/1975 of issuing, ^
wfe course, further guidance on the procedure to be followed when a ground is designated
under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 as requiring a . safety certificate. As
will be seen from the enclosed cosy, an order has now been cade (SI 197o Mo. 125^)
designating under the Act, with effect from 1 January 1977, the international association
and rugby union football grounds and those of the clubs in the first division o* the
football league.

2. It is an offence under section 12(1) of the Act to adint spectators to a designated
stadium after the date on wtiich the designation order relating to it cccies into
operation) unless an application for a general safety certificate has been nade and net
subsequently withdrawn or deemed to have been withdrawn. In consequence, therefore,
of this order, the local authorities for the areas in which the grounds are situated
may expect to receive by the date of operation applications for the grant of general
safety certificates under the Act, which will thereupon fall to be dealt with in
accordance with the Act and the regulations, also enclosed cade under section b(1) of
the Act (SI 1 9 7 6 No. 12b3).

 Z . Guidance as to the procedure to be followed, in conformity with the regulations,
0    dealing with applications for general safety certificates is set out in the annex
 to this circular.

     It is not proposed at this stage to issue guidance as to the procedure toi be
 followed in connection with the grant of special safety certificates, since, under
 Section 5(2) of the Act, such certificates are not required until general safety
 certificates are in operation. Further guidance for this purpose will accordingly be
 deferred until nearer the date when a need for special safety certificates say arise.
 There is, however, one tactor regarding the issue of such certificates v m c h rcay have
 a bearing on the date of the introduction of a general saiety certificate and to winch
 regard stiould accordingly be paid. Once a general safety certificate has been issued,
 a person wishing to conduct an activity calling for the issue of a special saiety
 certificate must'comply with all the 'requirer.ents relating to such certificates laid
 dowr in the regulations. Where, therefore, such an event has already been arranged,
 local’authorities nay wish to consider,'where appropriate, the desirability oi not
 issuing a general certificate until after the event has taken place.

 5* The regulations provide specific tir.e lirdts for the deteroination of applications
 for special safety certificates, but this is not the case as regards general sa:ety
 certificates. Although local authorities and the clubs and other organisations operating
 stadia will no doubt have done as r.uch pre-planning as possible, it is -assumed that the
 surveys and consultations involved in determining suitable terms and conditions will,
 jb cany cases, still extend over several weeks, so tnat it will not be practicable,
 especially should anpe-Llate proceedings arise, to bring certificates into eifect
 significantly in advance of the end of the 19?b/77 season. In thece.circumstances,
 and where a club or stadiuo corpany wishes to take advantage of the close season to
 carry out structural vork which will have tne efiect of significantly altering the
 terns and conditions which would otherwise have applied, local authorities nay ieel that,
 depending on the condition of the stadiun ana having regard to the powers already
 available to aeal with cases of severe risk, the caxicua advantage is to be gained by
 deferring the issue of a certificate until the beginning of the 1$77/78 season so as
 to enable as cucn work as possible to be done.In this way, it    is hoped that it will
 normally be possible for a sufficient neasure of agreement to be reached between the
 interested parties to obviate the need for appeals against the terns and conditions
 imposed.

 6* It is suggested in paragraph 3 of the annex that local authorities will wish to keep
 in mind tne guidelines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds when framing the
 conditions which they consicer snould be incluaed in the safety certificate. Soxe of
 these recosrr.endnticns have been revised in the light of the experience gained in applying
 the^uidelines duriiig the past year or so. The Guide is being reprinted and sr.ould be
 avalKtble well before the first designation order becoaes effective; a copy >411 be sent
 to you as soon as it becor.es available. A list of the proposed arrendsents to the Guide
 is attached for reference in the meaatiee.

 7* Section 6(1)(b) of the Act enables the Secretary of State to rake regulations
 authorising local authorities to deterains the fees which nay be charged in respect of
 applications for safety certificates. In the discharge of this power, Regulation 1*t
 provides that such charges say be sade in respect ef applications for the issue or
 amendment of safety certificates, but that they shall not exceed an anount comensurate
 with the work actually and reasonably done. As regards the issue of a general safety
 certificate it is hoped that, by affording stadium authorities an opportunity to co-operat
 to the full, by eg preparing plans, checking crush barriers, etc, local authorities should
 in the nornsal course, not find it necessary to charge fees representing more than 17
 man/days' work,

  8* The clubs and stadiua authorities whose sports grounds are nar.ed in the designation
  order have been advised about their position. A copy of that letter is enclosed for
  yout information. The note appended to the letter and cc/ering the procedure regarding
  ap^Pcations fcr general safety certificates is in the sane terir.s as the annex to this
i circular*

 9» A further copy of this circular is enclosed for the information of the Chief
 Financial Officer*

      SAFSTYJDF SPORTS Gi?OUNDS ACT 1975
        *
      PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GEJERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES

      1.   The Regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall be
      made in the fern contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a fern to the like
      effect. Copies of the fora are being made available to potential applicants and they
      are being advised of the need to provide such information in support of their applica­
      tion as will enable the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act. In
      particular, the application should be accompanied by detailed information as to the
      structure, capacity, etc of the stadiua, including plans of the stadiua, certificates
      relating to the testing of crush barriers and evidence of the applicant's status. It
      is, however, open to a local authority, under section 3(*+) of the Act, to require, by
      notice in writing, such further information of this kind as it may consider necessary
      to enable it to determine the terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.

      2.     On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local authority
      must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely
      to be in a position to prevent contravention of the teras and conditions to be imposed
      in the certificate. If it considers him to be such a person the authority is then
      under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to hia. In the case of a geraral
      safety certificate, where considerations of time are not paramount, the regulations
      ittpse no specific tine limit for such & determination. In any event, it seems
      P R i e unlikely that an application for a general safety certificate would be made by
      an unqualified person. There is, however, a right of appeal against a determination
      by a local authority that an applicant is not a qualified person (see paragraph 10).

      3.    The local authority is required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of
      any application for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chief
      Officer of Police and building authority, and oust consult them about tho terms and
      conditions to bo included in the certificate. In framing such conditions, local
      authorities will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines set out i
      the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds. In this connection local authorities are
      reminded that, as was pointed out in paragraph 6 of the Annex to Eoae Office Circular
      No.150/1975, this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be rigidly
      applied regardless of individual circumstances. The eaximun flexibility should be
      maintained to take account of the different circumstances at individual grounds deriv­
      ing from differences in such matters as age, size end mode of construction. In this
      regard, it should also be noted that the Act provides that the terms and conditions
      should be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety11 and it would be
         reasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute safety of everyone
  t      tending the sports stadium.

...        It is envisaged that there will be & good deal of consultation between the local
      authority and the stadiua representatives in the process of drawing up the certificate
      conditions. In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is rarely filled to
      capacity, the local authority may consider it proper to base its requirements on actur-
      levels of attendance over a given period rather than on maximum capacity. On the rare
      occasions on which a capacity crowd could be expected, separate prevision ci?ht be cr.c
      for this contingency on the lines indicated in paragraph 7 below. Again, if’a stand
      vere found to be structurally weak, the local authority might, in consultation with th
      stadiua representatives, offer the choice of having any necessary remedial works
      carried out or of restricting adaission to the stand until it had been strengthened.

      5* < As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the fora and content of a
      safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the individual
      caso. Accordingly, a standard fora of certificate vould not be appropriate. It must
      however contain full details of the terms and conditions imrosed including, in
      particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and hare acnered to it
      a plan of the stadiua by reference to which the terms and conditions will be framed.-

convenient to list, in a covering letter to the certificate, ouch oodificaticns aa
v i U be subsequently permitted, eg in the fora of a statement of the increased spectator
activities to be allowed for the separate sections of the ground when the various
stages are comploUid, of any future works programme for the ground which has been
agreed with the stadium authorities. This arrangement, by excluding from the certif-'
icate itself proposed conditions which would apply only to future works, should servo
to obviate confusion* At the same time, however, care oust be taken not to exclude
from the certificate any restriction germane to current conditions, since section 5 0 )
of the Act provides for an interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State againnt
the inclusion of anything in, or the omission of anything from, a safety certificate,
•ad these rights oust not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of the fora cf the
certificate*

6.    As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the Act
provides that different terms and conditions may bo included for different activities.
Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a football ground, in
eases where it is also used from time to time to stage other events it would be desir­
able, and in many cases obviate the need for special safety certificates, if the terss
and conditions appropriate to those events were to be included in the general certif­
icate. It is suggested that any such events for which it is considered desirable to
VOAV
   ivide night conveniently be divided into 2 classes:
V
     (1 )   those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
            stadiua for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;

     (2)    Those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
            eoacerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being
            given over to spectator accommodation and for which separate teras and
            conditions will have to be devised. It is not, of course, necessary to
            provide for these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen
            fay tbe stadiua authorities.

?.    There may also be circumstances in which the teras and conditions applicable to
the normal activity of the stadiua may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a special
event, such as a cup tie or a ’’local Derby”, is expected to attract significantly acre
than the usual attendance. In the case especially of cup replays these special eventa
ttay arise with only a few days' notice, within which it would not be possible to
accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to the grant of a special
safety certificate. In order to overcome this difficulty, it would seem desirable for
   e local authorities and stadiua authorities to seek to work out in advance the
«  difications to the normal teres.and conditions which might be appropriate to such
occasions, eg the adaission of increased numbers to certain areas on the condition
that extra stewards and police are employed, that notice is given to the local
authority, and so on, and to provide for their incorporation in the general safety
certificate.

8.    Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determination of
any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amendment of the
certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of the certificate or
of the local authority (see section *»(2) of the Act) and will presumably reflect
changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the original certificate. It
will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities and clubs/stadium authorities
for a close liaison to be maintained after the issue of the certificate and certainly
while any further works of safety measures are being carried out. It is likely to be
in the etaii.ua operators’ finanical interest to get the safety certificate amended as
soofi as possible after work has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure that,
the local authority is kept inforaed of progress. For its part the local authority
will no doubt wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion
of the work, the certificate can be amended without delay.

 ■'      After a certificate has been granted, as application aay oe case ior m * u w i a . n
   cf the certificate to another person. 'Sirail«rly, while a local authority ie consiaerin;
   as application for a certificate and before the certificate has been granted, it cay be
   asked to substitute soae person other than the original applicant as the person to whora
   the certificate should be granted. These are, however, likely to be rare occurrences
   is the case of general safety certificates, where an application will normally be cade
   os behalf of a club or a stadiua organisation by an authorised official of the club
   or representative of the organisation. However, if it does happen, the local authority
   will be required in both cases to determine whether the substituted n0 2 ir.ee is a
   qualified person. Thereafter, is the first case, the procedure laid down in the
   regulations relating to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will
   apply together with aay necessary appeals procedure. In the second case, there is no
 . reason why the local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a
   new application is the tenns of the original one and process it froa the point it had
■ -.already reached.

   10. Is addition to the right of appeal by as applicant for a general safety certificat
   against the deteroination that he is not a qualified person (see paragraph 2 above),
   which, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed transfer of a certificate, the
   Act provides a further right of appeal to any "interested party'1 (which tera includes
 . the holder of the safety certificate) against the inclusion of anything in or the
   omission of anything frcr. a safety certificate or against a refusal to aaend or replace
     safety certificate. The regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety
    ertificate, notice of any such apcaal shall be given within 26 davs following receipt
   of a notice of the local authority's decision, or, is the case of persons who are not
   notified, the publication by the local authority of its decision is a newspaper
   circulating is the locality.

     11. In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or aaendir.
     a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain specified
     "interested parties" and also to advertise their action is the press. It is regretted
    that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of advertising, but, since
     Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition which it provides of
     "interested party", so other means could be found of ensuring that all persons who nigi
    validly claim to be "interested parties" within the meaning of the Act should be able
     to acquaint themselves with the local authority's decision, and failure to bring the
    decision to their notice could result in a denial of their rights of appeal or of a
    hearing by the Secretary of State. For the ease reason a siailar obligation has been
     imposed on an appellant (by Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, asd
    a person wishing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under
^ s e c t i o n 5(^) of the Act is required to give notice within 28 days of such advertiseaesl

     12. Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority notice
     Of appeal, accoapsnied by the relevant documents appertaining to the appeal. It will
   > then be for the local authority, in accordance with Segulation 8(9), to*infora the
     Secretary of State in writing within 2 8 days whether it wishes to oppose the appeal.
     With any' such notice, the local authority is required to submit its reasons andany
     relevant supporting documents and to state whether it wishes a hearing under section 5
... of the Act. (The procedure governing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in
    Regulation 10.)

• 15. It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to order
  a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal. Is such a
  case, the procedure to be followed is 1-iid down is Regulatioa 12.

Dear Sir, ■

SAFETY AT SPORTS STADIA

In reply to your letter dated 16th May, 1985 requesting information on crowd
safety arrangements at sports stadia, please find below details of the current
situation within South Yorkshire.

Designated Grounds

(1)   Sheffield Wednesday F.C. - Certificate issued under the Safety of Sports
      Grounds Act 1975 on 21st December, 1979.

      Following the fire at Bradford, the club are to completely cover the timber
      floor which forms part of the Main Stand with steel sheeting before the
      commencement of the 1985/86 season and are considering either to replace
      the existing timber underdrawing to the asbestos roof with metal sheeting
      or provide a new non combustible roof before the commencement of the 1986/87
      season. ■                                                      ■■

(2)   Sheffield United F,C* - Designated at th# commencement of the 1984/85 season.
      Certificate under the Act not yet issued.

      Most areas of the stadium are either satisfactory or are undergoing improvement
      to "Green Guide" standard prior to commencement of the 1985/86 season. The
      only area of concern is a section of the old main stand which comprises
      timber decking to the seated area with no fire resisting separation from
      the area underneath which houses the o l d dressing rooms, offices etc., aad
      are constructed entirely of timber.

      Improvements have already been made by:

      (a)   a reduction in the nunber of seats in the timber section.

      (b)   additional means of escape forward onto the playing ar«*|

      (c)   the provision of automatic fire detection to'ill areas beneath the
            timber section, and

      (d)   the provision of fire separation at strategic points to prevent lateral
            spread of fire and smoke along the access levels on the underside
            of the stand.
Home Office                                                 4th July, 1985

      Other matters still being considered are the provision of further fire
      separation to the underside of the stand, the removal of any unnecessary
      timber structure and cladding to reduce the fire      and the treatment
      of remaining timber with flame retardant paint.

(3)   Barnsley F.C. - Certificate issued under the Act on 25th February, 1985.
      No additional work has been considered necessary.

(4)   Rotherham United F.C. - Certificate issued under the Act on 20th February,
      1984. No additional work has been considered necessary.

Undesignated Ground

Doncaster Rovers F.C. - A phasedprograraae of redevelopment of this stadium
had been revealed to th® County Council in February this year with a view to
Implementing same, starfcing in the close season prior to commencement of the
1985/86 season.

The aim is to complete certain improvements which will be in accordBtice with
the "Qreen Guide" prior to the start of the new season and will allow a much
reduced crowd capacity of approximately 8 ,0 0 0 . This work will incorporate
the observations mads by the Fire Service in respect of the main stand which
is of timber construction, in a report made early this year,

Further work, as completed will Increase the crowd capacity to a maximum of
approximately 16,000*

Since 1979, irrespective of whether they were designated or not, the five
grounds referred to above have been inspected twice per year on a routine basis
by the Joint Officer Working Party set up by the County Council and consisting
of representatives from the County Council, Police, local Authority - Building
Control Section and the Fire Service.

With undeaignated grounds, the visits were done on a goodwill basis by agreeoisi
with the clubs concerned. All clubs were made aware as to tow their grounds
fell below the "Green Guide8 standard mid reduced crowd capacities were agreed.
These capacity figures have been subject to continual re-assessment to compensate
for either completion of work necessary to comply with the "Green Guide" or
gases (e.g. cup games and local derbies) where large crowds were anticipated*

Each individual discipline of the Joint Officer Working Party has been in close
contact with the clubs concerned throughout this period to monitor progress of
any works carried out.

Other Sports Stadia and Grounds

Since the fire at Bradford, all sports stadia and grounds in South Yorkshire
have been inspected by Fire Prevention Officers. These include horse and
greyhound racing, speedway, cricket, rugby and football grounds, whether
subject to designation under the Act or not.

The Inspections took into account matters such as construction and capacity of
Stands, means of escape, fire service access, water supplies for firefighting
purposes, fire procedures and firefighting equipment.

                                  ''   ■■ ■




Is the main, the inspections revealed that there is little need for
concern but reports wer® necessary in respect of four stadia having
timber stands, the main concern being poor housekeeping.

                                      THE HYDRO-REMOTE FIREMAN                         IJune 1985

1.     HY D R O - the automatic remote controlled hydrant, a unique device developed
       to put out fires completely automatically in unmanned buildings or
       by remote control in crowded areas.

2. The HY DR O is ideally suited for use on oil and gas ri»gs, in pumping
    stations, hotels, warehouses and most public and commercial buildings.

3.     The Hydro is particularly suitable for sports grounds where its
       links to close circuit TV monitors enables one ma n to control the device
       remotely and accurately and direct w a t e r to the point where
       a fire has started. No need to w a i t for a Fire Brigade to arrive -
       fires can be tackled quickly and safely.

4. The Hydro has a diffuser jet whi ch can spread wa t e r over a wide
    area, equally the jet can be directed onto one person
    or small group of troublemakers, with ou t affect in g innocent bystanders.

       The soaking w e t hooligans could be identified easily by the public
       authorities.

5.     With the benefit of hindsight it is apparent that both the Bradford City
       fire AND the Liverpool/Juventus disasters could have been avoided by the
       use of the HYDRO. Both disasters happened, too quickly for conventional
       equipment to be used.

6.     Fire and hooligans can be controlled remotely and safely within seconds
       by use of the HYDRO.

At rcqutitti tt Friday's meeting held in London, I set out below the current
position in South Yorkshire:-

1.     "Winter" and "Summer" inspection* by the multi-discipline Officer
       forking Parties have been carried out of the five Football League
       Grounds in the County irrespective of th* designation and
       certification position since 1979.

2.      ThreecaBthe five Football League Clubs have been granted General
        Safety Certificates by the County Council; the fourth (Sheffield
        United) has been designated but the certificate has not yet been
        granted, whilst the fifth (DoncastarRovers - in the Third Division)
     '■ has yet to be designated,:/;.;

3.     Active consultat ions have started with Doncaster lovers in view of
       the Secretary of State's announcement but, at the moment, other
       Stadia have received only the fire precaution visit requested by
       Che Home Office circular letter dated 16th May to Chief Fire
       Officers (the Chief Fire Officer advises that fhera are soraa 30
       atadla in the county biit the Majority of these by 'far fall short
     ’ of the 10,000 spectator accommodation figure).

Dear John,
             res Mr.
                 _p~                   j D axuaiw v

     I don't know whether or not the County Council can help
with the publicising of an invention which has been developed
b y p r i m a r i l y in the first instance for putting
fires out at football grounds, like that which happened at
Bradford, and also for crowd control in football grounds, but
it is also' capable of being developed in case of fire in
unmanned buildings or in oil rigs, gas rigs, pumping stations,
etc.

              li a s borrowed money from Barnsley Enterprise and
I believe                  have also                  to develop
the idea and this is now ready for piauuicdi demonstration,
and I wondered if anyone or any Committee within the South
Yorkshire County Council could help to promote the idea which
he has, as I think he is on to a winner.

     The spin-off in the area, of course, would mean that
someone would have to manufacture it quickly and install it
so it would create employment.

     I am attaching a copy of what would probably turn out to
be the contents of an advertisement leaflet which does give
some idea of what it is all about.

     Mr.      is hoping to arrange a practical demonstration
at one of the footbsll grounds, probably Barnsley, but he
could actually meet people and show a model of what he has
developed and explain how the system works so that if there
is a Committee at South Yorkshire County Council he would be
prepared to come along and meet them.

     I would be grateful for any help which you can give.

                                               Yours sincerely,



                                                  A l l e n M cK ay

Mr. J.C. Harris,
Chief Executive,
South Yorkshire County Council.
                               HYDRO


This unique HYDRO has been developed for putting fires out by Remote
Control or completely Automatically in the case of Fire in unmanned
buildings     Oil Rigs, Gas Rigs, Pumping Stations and most Commercial
and Public Buildings over night.


The Remote Control means One man in a television monitor room can
put out fires in any part of a building.    It would be especially
advantageous at Sports Grounds where it could be used not only for
fires but Specific parts of a crowd for Hooligan Control purposes.


This method of Hooliganism control is well established, by using a
Defuser Jet   can be very accurate ie: to One person.


Indeed this would also serve a dual purpose from a Police point of
view they would know exactly who the trouble makers were 2 stress
the Jet can be accurately controlled remotely so KO Danger to
innocent or otherwise people, but simply a method of control and
identification of trouble makers.   ( as they would be soaking wet ).


With benefit of Hindsight I am sure you will agree that both the
Bradford Fire and Liverpool/Italy Disasters could have been nipped
in the Bud by the use of THE HYDRO, in view of the fact that both
disasters were over very quickly before conventional fire control
apparatus portable of otherwise could be brought to bear.


On the spot reconisation of the situation both Fire and Hooliganism
can be controlled remotely within Seconds    plus the fact that
Knowledge that the Hooligans can be stopped and recognised after
would be a very good deterrent. --------------

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughanj


 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                          Football Ground Safety
             I think you will be interested to read this article about
 the Heysel Stadium.   I mentioned to you that the crush barriers
 were far too sparse. It will be seen from the photograph that
 they were on a 'hit-miss1 pattern with more 'miss' than 'hit'.
     The picture of the corroded base of a barrier is quite
 revealing.   Once the steel reinforcement becomes debonded from
 the concrete the strength will be only a tiny fraction of that
 of the original. In this particular case it even has a hole
 through the post!


                                                                            Yours sincerely,

Additional Activities at Football Grounds
a)   General

     (i)       Mr.        asked the opinion of the committee
               regarding a new stand which had been constructed
               at Brighton A.F.C. which contained boxes, restaurant
               etc. He wished to know if activities such as parties
               etc. held on days other than match days should be
               covered by the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.
               After discussion it was agreed that unless the
               function was connected with an approved activity
               using the field of play it need not necessarily
               be considered under the Act.
     (ii)      Mr.      has received from one of his clubs a long
               list of activities which they consider should be
               covered by the Act and he asked if anyone else had
               received a similar request. The only other Authority
               to have received such a request was the G.L.C. Other
               Authorities received requests for each event in turn.
b)   Floodlit Cricket

         Mr.  asked if any Authority had experience of floodlit
     cricKet.

     Mr.     described his association with Bristol City F.C.
     who have allowed floodlit cricket to be played on their
     ground for two years. No problems have1 occurred with the
     crowd as the ground capacity was in excess of the attendance.
     An interesting point was that netting was erected at critical
     points in the ground where the cricket pitch was rather close
     to one of the stands. To the question of who decides that
     netting should be erected Mr.P^   answered that the club usually
     instigated the proposals due to their concern about any damage
     which may occur.   General points with regard to floodlit
     cricket were-:—.
     (i)       that any sport has hazards and this is understood
                by spectators.

     (ii)      could be more danger to spectators due to darkness
                beneath stands but dangerous areas could be protected
                by netting if possible.

     (iii)     Ice hockey does not take any special precautions to
               protect spectators.
     With regard to certification it was agreed that the special
     certificate would be in the same form as the General Certificate
     and would not need any special conditions, Mr.        1said
     his Authority had added cricket to the certificate without any
     changes.
     A short discussion took place regarding responsibility for
     sporting events. Two examples were given. A spectator had ‘
     tried without success to sue Watford F.C. after his son was
     hit in the mouth by a football. Mr.I            quoted the
     fexa:mpre of people who were injured when xney stood b'y a M now ri
     bad bend on the motor racing circuit. It was ruled that they
     knew the risks when they stood there.
3.   c)   Tennis

          No difficulties were forseen with this activity.

     d)   Baseball
          Mr.|______ |quoted that baseball had been held at Grimsby F.C.
          and considered that it was the clubs responsibility to ensure
          the game was safe. A discussion then took place on the
          general point of whether other activities should be considered
          or not. It was agreed that the clubs needed all the help they
          can get particularly as Mr.I          [pointed out that his
          International ground was only used, lour times a year. Mr.
          felt that a disclaimer regarding the Authorities responsibility
          for the safety aspects of other activities could be introduced.

     e)   Athletics
          It was considered that field events would cause problems but
          that the rules of the Athletics Association would cover this.

     f)   Rugby and Hockey
          These sports were considered to.be similar to football from
          the aspect of the Act.
     g)   Pop Concerts
          Mr.        referred to the report of a Rolling Stones Concert
          held atSt. James ’ Park, Newcastle and pointed     out that the
          problems which arose were in general due to drunkenness.
          The capacity allowed at St. James' Park for the pop concert
          was the   same as that for a football match while Mr.
          and Mr.          found that capacities in their grounds were
          less.
          Mr.     gave an example of a Rolling Stones concert held at
          the Bristol City F.C. Ground.        The capacity was assessed on
          exits and this was more than for a normal football match.
          For the greater part of the day there were only a relatively
          small number of spectators with capacity only being reached
          when the Stones appeared. There were no crowd problems. One
          problem which did occur was with the safety barrier around the
          pitch perimeter. This barrier had to be crossed and a 7 metre
          long ramp was proposed ending in steps down to the terracing.
          As the steps were in line with the ramp this produced hesitation
          at the top of the steps and it was felt that there could be
          problems if an emergency occurred. A solution would be to
          put a barrier across the top of the ramp and run the steps both
          right and left of the ramp. Details of the proposed structures
          were only given three days before the concert and the calcula­
          tions arrived after the staging. It should be pointed out to
          the organisers of the concert that the calculations and details
          of proposed structures should be submitted at an early date.
          A firework display was proposed to end the concert. This was
          not allowed inside the ground but was held in a nearby park.
          The Local Authority is now prosecuting the organisers for
          excessive noise. M r . | p o i n t e d out that a special
          certificate requires three mohths notice           Mr.        said the
          original inJjgjntiqji. ;
                                 was to. assist thjg^ Cl.ub§ but ...now they ask.

continued.
Mr.         and Mr.          both adhere to the G.L.C.
"Pop ooue- although Mr.          (pointed out that a
Music Licence only requires da aays notice.

Mr. |
    _________ ^nd Mr.■_________ have a lower density on the
terracing for a pop concert although       Mr.       saia
that   the police are so far objecting     to spectators usingthe
pitch.

During discussion concerning the use of the pitch by
spectators at Pop concerts the following points emerged

(i)     Crowding onto the pitch adjacent to the stage was
        and accepted part of pop concert behaviour.
(ii)    Wide exit routes on each side of the stage as
         recommended in the"Pop Code" are vital in case
         of emergency.

(iii)   It was admitted that the police would have difficulty
         in entering a crowd in front of the stage but the
         spectators at a pop concert are in general reasonably
         well behaved unless incited by groups or they become
         restive if the main group is late. Consideration
         may have to be given to the type of     group it is
         intended should perform with a view to not approving
         some groups who incite the crowd.

(iv)    From experience it was felt that a low police profile
         is the best with order administered by the Clubs
         stewards and the organisers stewards.
        Mr.         told of a proposed pop concert at
        Manchester Uniteds' Ground for the weekend of the
        visit of the Pope to England which was cancelled
        because the District Council would not approve the
        noise levels which would occur at nearby houses.
Boxing and Wrestling

Mr.           [gave examples of boxing matches held at Arsenal
F .C 's Ground\ There was no problem with capacity as seating
was on the pitch and this seating governed the capacity.

Discussion then took place regarding the Miscellaneous
Provisions Act which comes into effect in January 1983
and takes licencing functions away from the Counties and
gives them to the Districts. Concern was expressed regarding
the operation of this Act and the Sports Grounds Act with
separate Authorities involved. Mr.          pointed out that
this situation had always applied in UTMTCT and after
initial problems a system of communication was devised which
seemed to be working.

Religeous Meetings

These meeting had been held on various grounds and capacity
is .rig.ju^^lem,.. .Provided that any temporary structures are
checked and approved there would appear to be no objection
to this type of activity.
j)   Markets

     Some clubs have had markets at weekends usually on the
     land adjacent to the ground. It was pointed out that
     during such a market the stand at Bristol Rovers F.C.
     Ground burned down and the fire engines were delayed
     by the market. It would appear that where a market or
     other activity is proposed access for emergency vehicles
     should be provided.
k)   Pop; Racing

     There is usually no problem with this activity as crowds are
     low although it was fou^d that the Clubs do not want to open
     up all the ground and so it is necessary to ensure that
     sufficient Exits are provided.
1)   Fireworks

     A firework display was held at Watford last year. Approval
     has been given provided certain conditions are complied with
     to hold a display at Bolton Wanderers ^’.C. Ground on 7th
     November. Notts* County F.C. have made a similar request
     but the Authority are concerned about the timber stands on
     the ground and have imposed the condition that no one
     should use these stands.       ‘
m)   Model Aircraft

     A request for an exhibition of model aircraft to be held
     prior to a match by Manchester United was approved provided
     controlled line aircraft only were used.
Any Other Business

a)   Periodic Testing of Barriers

     Mr»         [raised the point that some of his GltiU
     a 3 year test cycle was too short and should possi
     extended to 10. Although most Authorities adhered
     year cycle it was felt that provided the Authority
     there would appear to be no reason why the cycle
     increased. With regard to the testing of '.each ''barrier    v-v
     times Mr. Ashurst said he did not feel that this should be
     reduced as his experience was that the first test tended to be
     sometimes unrepresentative due to the "tightening up” of ^
     the parts of the barrier. The second test appeared to 1:
     real test with the third test as a confirmation,
b)   Inspection of Structures                                         \


     Due to difficulties in providing inspectors Authorities appear
     to be asking clubs to provide them with a certificate s;’
     by a qualified structural engineer. G.M.C., South Yc
     Staffordshire and G.L.C. followed this method,
o)   Wind Speed Gauges

     Where clubs had wind speed gauges installed the Authority
     had powers to prevent a match taking place over a certain ^)#ed
        So far these powers had not been used § * i d d o j u b t ■  '
           at exicessive wind speeds, it would be possible to d1
     football anyhow,                                            J
           *
•-I            *
      d)           Pitch Perimeter Fencing
                   The types of fencing in use were discussed to see if any one
                   type was used but it would appear that various types of fence
                   are used with a mesh or bar infill. There would appear to be
                   no uniformity.

      e)           Electric Scoreboard at Everton F.C. Ground
                   Mr,       of Merseyside C.C. asked the Secretary to raise the
                   matter regarding the Electric Scoreboard at Everton F.C.
                   Ground. This scoreboard is in need of repair and the Club
                   have requested Merseyside C.C. to assist them in obtaining
                   funds from the Football League. The League have said that
                   unless the Scoreboard is a requirement of the Safety Certifi­
                   cate they will not assist . Mr.|        said he is not minded
                   to impose such a requirement at t m s stage and asked the
                   opinion of the Working Party. After discussion the working
                   party tended to agree with Mr,        and felt that the
                   Authority could only make demand.s if the Scoreboard was dangerous,

      f)           Non-designated Grounds
                   Mr.|     [asked if Authorities had carried out inspections on
                   grounds which are not designated. Many authorities had
                   carried out limited inspections and given advice on a
                   goodwill basis.                        •
                   At the close of the meeting Mr       informed the Working
                   Party that it would be his last meeting as Chairman as he
                   was taking early retirement in the near future. The Working
                   Party expressed its thanks to Mr*      for his work over the
                   years and wished him a long healtny and happy

                   Mr.|    1then undertook the task of seeking a su
                   the County Surveyors Society if it is necessary
                   with the Working Party.

Dear Mr.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

You will be aware from the Minutes of the Community Liaison Steering Conmittee
of 11th April, 1985*. (confirmed fcy the Police Committee o n 2 9 t h April) and
the remarks made by Councillor G. H. M o o r e s a t the Police Committee m e t i n g on
3rd June that the Chairman of the Committee in particular is anxious to see
direct Elected Member involvement in "impfoving safety facilities at soccer
grounds for policemen and spectators alikeM .

Attempts have h««n made to explain to him that the County Council’s powers
and responsibilities under the Act are delegated to the Fire ServiceCommittee
who, in turn, Operate through Officer Working Parties for the four District
Council areas. As the Act requires the Police and the Building Authority to
be consulted, the Police and the Fire Service are represented at both
Headquarters and Divisional levels on each of the Officer Working Parties    and
the Building Authority at just District level, of course* with co-ordination
being undertaken by my staff.

The Fire Service Committee quite property requested a report for their
meeting today on the Safety of Sports Grounds position, and accepted the
attached joint report which the Chief Fire Office r a n d inyself submitted. No
reference was made to direct Elected Member involvement by the Fire Service
Committee.

There is absolutely no objection, of course, to the Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen
of the Divisional Liaison Committees visiting the appropriate football grounds
in company with their Divisional Commanders to see the facilities which exist
and hear of the problems which are encountered, as referred to in the
Community Liaison Steering Committee of 11th April, or to the Chairman and
Vice-Chairman of the Police Committee also visiting the grounds at the and of
June as I understand is now proposed.


                                                               Contid...

I am sure the Officer Working Parties will be more than happy to consider any
suggestions which might be forthcoming as a result of the Police Committee
Menber visits, but they cannot be more than suggestions.

Detailed drawings, plaaf and sped.fi cati o n s h a v e to be drawn up'If any
structural alterations and iaprovenents are proposed at any football ground
and considered, not only from the Safety of Sports Grounds aspect by the
Officer Working Parties, but from the Building Regulation/Planning Permission
points of view by the appropriate District Council.
To avoid possible misunderstanding, it may well be of assistance if your
Assistant Chief Constable (Operations), Mr.                   could informally
remind the Divisional Commanders of the position.      r

I would stress that nothing in this letter is intended to impinge on the day
to day operational control which the South Yorkshire Police quite properly
exercise at football matches.


                             Yours sincerely,

     FIRE PREVENTION - SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

     Following the Bradford Football Club disaster an urgent review of the
     sports grounds and stadia within the County was immediately commenced.
     The terms of reference of this review were:-

     (a)   to examine all sports grounds of whatever size or sporting activity;

     (b)   to particularly  examine   stands    and   accommodation         provided     for
           spectators or players;

     (c)   to give interim advice on any matter which gave rise to a risk
           of fire or emergency evacuation of the premises and to follow this
           with written recommendations if necessary;

     (d)   to reassess the provisions relating        to   fire    safety    at   the    four
           designated football grounds; and

     (e)   to assess the requirements of       the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
           1975 in respect of Doncaster        Football Club in the event of a
           Designating Order being made.

2.   The initial survey revealed a total of 30 sports grounds at which stands
     were provided for spectators and accommodation was provided for players
     and officials.  The majority of these grounds are considered satisfactory
     In four cases •recommendations have been made and negotiations are now
     taking place to remedy the faults which came to light during the
     inspections     wj JXX a btrd uH-U 1 K Mka;

     A more comprehensive survey is now under way to assess these grounds
     in accordance with a letter dated 16th May received from Horae Office
     (copy attached as Appendix "A").  The results of this survey will, where
     necessary, be forwarded to Home Office for the attentionof the Inquiry
     into Safety Sports Grounds being held under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice
     Popplewell.

4.    As the Committee will recall, the County Council's powers and duties under
      the Act are part of this Committee's terms of reference.   On 8th January,
      1976, the Committee decided that their functions should be exercised
      through Officer Working Parties for the four Borough Council areas,
      consisting of representatives of the Police, the Fire Service and the
      Building Inspectors of the Borough Councils, with co-ordination being
      undertaken by the Department of Administration.

5.    Of the five Football League Grounds in South Yorkshire, three (Barnsley
      Rotherham United and Sheffield Wednesday) have already been granted General
      Safety Certificates by the County Council under the Safety of Sports
      Grounds Act, 1975, following their designation by the Secretary of State
      and the carrying out of improvements.

6.    The Bramall Lane Ground of the Sheffield United Football Club Ltd. was
      designated by the Secretary of State in July, 1984 on the Club's
      promotion to the Second Division.  The Club has already carried out a number
      of improvements to the Ground, the remainder to be completed in the next
      few m o n t h s .

7.    Only the Belle Vue Ground of the Doncaster Rovers Football Club Ltd.
      currently remains undesignated (the Club remaining in the Third Division),-
      but the County Council is continuing to work on a goodwill basis with the
      Club and has provided certain advice.    The Home Secretary has of course,
      announced in the House of Com m ons that all Clubs in the Third and Fourth
      Divisions are now to be designated.

8.    The County Council has also since 1979 had a policy of "winter" and
      "summer" inspections of all five Football League Grounds by Officer
      Working Parties (comprising representatives of the Police, the Fire
      Service, the County Council and the District Council's Building Surveyor).
      Such inspections have been welcomed by the Football Clubs, who have always
      displayed a responsible attitude on safety matters.

9.    Naturally, the forthcoming "summer" inspections will take into account the
      lessons of the recent tragic events at Bradford and any revised advice and
      requirements which may be issued by the Home Office and/or information
      from Mr. Justice Popplewell's Inquiry..
                                                                 — 6 S 'S S   ^

To all Chief Fire Officers


 Dear Chief Officer


SAFETY AT SPORTS STADIA

 In the statement which the Home Secretary made to the House of
 Commons on Monday, 13 May about the fire tragedy at. Bradford City
 football ground, he said that he was asking chief fire officers
 immediately to visit uncertificated sports stadia in their areas
 to advise management on the steps they should take to secure proper
 standards of crowd safety in their particular circumstances.




 2.  I know that following the Bradford fire, many chief fire officers
 will have already begun to review fire safety at football stadia
 in their areas, and that others will have this matter in h a n d . The
 purpose of this letter is to ask you, in accordance with the Home
 Secretary's request, to arrange for visits to be made to all
 uncertificated sports stadia in your area to discuss fire safety
 arrangements with management. For this purpose you will wish to have
 regard to th-e definition of a "sports stadium" for the purposes of
 the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.    This is provided in section
 17 read in conjunction with section    1 of the Act.  But since the
 combined effect of the relevant definitions is a little complicated
 you may find it helpful to have ‘the   attached synthesis (see Annex)
 which sets out what the definitions    together comprise.   You will wish
 to note that the definition embraces stadia used for purposes other
 than football, eg athletics, cricket, tennis.    In his statement,
 the Home Secretary indicated that one of the maitters which would no
 doubt be discussed was the opening and locking of gates, and more
 generally chief fire officers will wish to bear in mind the advice
 contained in the Home Departments Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
 (Football) which was published in 1976 and is obtainable from HMSO.

3.  In carrying out these visits and discussions, chief officers
will wish to have regard to the Home Secretary's announcement that
he intends to designate all grounds in the Third and Fourth Divisions
of the Football League so that they become subject to the system of
safety certification under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
You will note from'the statement that the timing of implementation is
E.R.

       being urgently discussed with the football authorities, but in
       visiting such grounds fire authorities will want to consider, in
       the light of the Home Departments Guide to Safety at Sports^Grounds
       (Football) what measures they will be recommending when designation
       takes effect.

       4.  Although there are no immediate plans to designate other sports
       stadia under the 1975 Act, pending the results of the inquiry into
       the operation of the Act by Mr Justice Popplewell, which was also
       announced by the Home Secretary, chief fire officers will wish to
       bear in mind the provisions of section 10 of that Act.  If in the
       course of visits to these stadia it becomes apparent that there would
       be a serious risk to spectators in the event of fire and that
       appropriate remedial measures are not being taken, chief fire officers
       will wish to consider inviting their Council to take action under
       section 10 of the 1975 Act.

       5.  In his statement, the Home Secretary recognised that the visits
       to sports stadia would be the more comprehensive if chief fire             ^
       officers were accompanied by other members of the local authority
       safety teams, but to avoid any delay.he considered that the duty
       fell best initially on chief fire officers.  No doubt you will be
       liaising with the chief executive on this matter, and for this
       purpose I am sending a copy of this letter to him.^ A copy of this
       letter is also being sent to chief officers of police.

       6.  Mr Justice Popplewell has already indicated that he would find
       it helpful to his inquiry, and particularly in the context of making
       an interim report or recommendations as suggested in the Home
       Secretary's statement, to have an early indication of the outcome of
       the programme of visits to uncertificated sports stadia.   I should
       therefore be grateful if you would let me have reports on the number
       and types of uncertificated stadia in your area giving a brief out­
       line of the results of your visits and discussions with management
       and taking account of any views of other parts of the local authority
       safety team and the police.   This should include the extent to which
       the crowd safety arrangements of each stadium are regarded as
       satisfactory and, if not, the steps which are being^taken to make     Q
       them satisfactory.   (Priority should of course be given to those
       Third and Fourth Division grounds in your areas as yet undesignated
       Under the 1975 Act.)   It would be helpful if these reports could be
       sent to me progressively in stages as parts of the task are completed
       and copied to the Chief Executive, co-ordinator of the safety teams
       and the chief officer of police.   All reports should reach me not
       later than 12 July.   In the light of these preliminary reports,
       Mr Justice Popplewell may wish to seek further information.

       7.  I recognise that this task will represent an additional burden
       for your fire prevention department, and that it will probably be
       necessary to make short-term adjustments to your priorities.
       However, I know that I can rely on your cooperation to ensure that
       the fire service does all that it possibly can to prevent a
       repetition of the kind of tragedy which occurred in Bradford.

       8..   The Home Office will, of course,   keep local authorities informed
e;.r .




         of developments concerning the future designations which are to be
         made under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.




                                                   SIR PETER.. DARBY

SAFETY   AT SPORT S GROUNDS   ACT   1975


The effect of section 1 read with section 17 is that.a sports
stadium is defined as any place -


   where sports or other competitive activities take place
   in the open air; and

   where accommodation has been provided for spectators
   consisting of artificial structures or of natural
   structures that have been artificially modified for the
   purpose; and

   that accommodation wholly or substantially surrounds the
   area used for activities taking place on the ground; and

   in the opinion of the Secretary of State the stadium has
   accommodation of more than 10,000 spectators.
                                                                                                 AWEnvix

SOUTH YO RKS HI RE COUNTY COUNCIL

AP PENDIX TO COMMITTEE REPORT - FIRE PREVENTION - SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS

Safety of Sports Grounds Act             1975

1.   The   purpose   of    the   Act    is to make provisions          for safety at sports          stadia
     and other sports grounds.

2.   Power is given to the Secretary of State, under Section 1 of the Act,
     to make De signating Orders which wo ul d require sports stadia with
     capacities of more that 10,000 spectators to be covered by a safety
     certificate.   Under Section 6(2) he may make regulations for securing
     safety in sports grounds.  No such re gulations have been made to date.

     Note:     Sports  Stadium  and Sports Ground are defined in Section 17.
               They are different types of premises and are treated separately
               by the varying provisions of the A c t .

3.   The Secretary of State has made Des ignating Orders in respect of all
     1st Division and 2nd Division clubs and certain Rugby grounds.     As a
     result of these orders the grounds at Barnsley, Rotherham and Sheffield
     are all required to have safety certificates. Even if a club is relegated
     to the 3rd Division, as is the case with Rotherham, the requirements
     of the Act are still imposed.

4.   The Safety    Certificate,        which    is    the   principal         document      of   enforcement
     of the Act, must        contain:-

     (a)     terms and conditions necessary to secure r easonable                        safety;

     (b)     details of the m a x im um number of spectators admitted to the stadium;

     (c)     max imu m    number   of    spectators         admitted     to   d if ferent    parts   of   the
             stadium;

     (d)     the number and size of entrances,                exits and access to such entrances
             and exits;

     (e)     requirements to main tai n              such   entrances,    exits     and     access   thereto
             free from obstructions;

     (f)     the number,     strength and situation of crush barriers.

5.   Applications  for certificates are made to the County Council.   Terms
      and conditions imposed by the certificate are determi ne d by a joint
      officers worki ng party.  Such terms and conditions are drawn from an
     approved code of practice - The Green Code.
6.   There is an appeals procedure against             any decision of the County Council.

7.   Section 10 gives the County Council power to complain to a Magistrates'
     Court in any case where dangerous conditions exist.      The Court may
     prohibit the use of the whole or any part of a "Sports G r o un d"* un ti l
     work is carried out to reduce the danger.

8.   The County      Council   may   appoint   inspectors      to   enforce   the   provisions
     of the Act.

9.   Pines of up to £400 may be imposed for an offence if a person is found
     guilty on summary conviction or to a fine or imprisonment up to two
     years on convic tio n on indictment.

 To all Chief Fire Officers

 Dear Chief Officer


 SAFETY AT SPORTS STADIA

 In the statement which the Home Secretary made to the House of
 Commons on Monday, 13 May about the fire tragedy at Bradford City
 football ground, he said that he was asking chief fire officers
 immediately to visit uncertificated sports stadia in their areas
 to advise management on the steps they should take to secure proper
 standards of crowd safety in their particular circumstances.
 Although the statement has been widely reported in the media, I
 enclose, for your information, a copy of an extract from Hansard   *
 which also covers the exchange following the statement.

 2.     I know that following the Bradford fire, many chief fire officers
 will have already begun to review fire safety at football stadia
 in their areas, and that others will have this matter in hand. The
 purpose of this letter is to ask you, in accordance with the Home
 S e c r e t a r y ’s request, to arrange for visits to be made to all
 uncertificated sports stadia in your area to discuss fire safety
 arrangements with management. For this purpose you will wish to have
 regard to the definition of a "sports stadium" for the purposes of
 the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.            This is provided in section
 17 read in conjunction with section            1 of the Act.   But since the
 combined effect of the relevant definitions is a little complicated
 you may find it helpful to have the            attached synthesis (see Annex)
 which sets out what the definitions            together comprise.    You will wish
 to note that the definition embraces stadia used for purposes other
 than football, eg athletics, cricket, tennis.             In his statement,
 the Home Secretary indicated that one of the matters which would no
 doubt be discussed was the opening and locking of gates, and more
 generally chief fire officers will wish to bear in mind the advice
 contained in the Home Departments Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
 (Football) which was published in 1976 and is obtainable from HMSO.

 3.  In carrying out these visits and discussions, chief officers
 will wish to have regard to the Home S e c r e t a r y ’s announcement that
 he intends to designate all grounds in the Third and Fourth Divisions
 of the Football League so that they become subject to the system of
 safety certification under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
 You will note from the statement that the timing of implementation is

MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING

The minutes of the meeting held on 9 August 1 9 8 3 , which had been previously
circulated, were accepted as a true and accurate record. There were no matters
arising.

SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
- PROGRESS REPORT

Mr Vaughan, the Secretary of the working group examining and administering the
provisions of the Act, gave a brief history of what had been achieved in South
Yorkshire.

He drew attention to the condition contained within the general safety
certificate that 21 days notice must be given to the County Council of any
proposed alterations to the grounds. He was aware that this was not happening
and asked Club Secretaries to be mindful- of the fact that to fail to comply
with a condition of the certificate was an offence under the Act.

Chief Superintendent Carlin asked if there was still in existence a voluntary
code of safety adopted by Clubs not falling within the bounds of the Act, as
he was most disturbed at the condition of Doncaster Rovers ground. He was
worried that should disturbances occur in the ground there was a surfeit of
large pieces of concrete and other potential missiles which could be used by
unruly elements.

Mr Holloway agreed With Chief Superintendent Carlin that parts’of Belle Vue
were in need of immediate and extensive renovation and said that he was to have
a meeting with the Chairman of the Football Grounds Improvements Trust in order
to ascertain if there were monies available to Doncaster Rovers to improve their
ground.
                                           _ 2 -

    Chief Superintendent Carlin questioned the determination of the Directors at
    the Club, as improvements had been spokenof for a number of years  and nothing
    had been done. He reiterated his concern for the safety of policeofficers
    on duty in the stadium, and enquired of Mr Vaughan whether the County Council
    could assist.

 Mr Vaughan stated that as Doncaster Rovers did not qualify under the Act, the
 only way the County Council could help would be at the invitation of the Club,
 and any changes recommended would have to be undertaken at the Club's expense,
 but he did offer to visit Belle Vue, together with the other members of the
 working group should the Club so wish. Mr Holloway thankedMr Vaughan for the
 offer, which he felt would be accepted.

    Item discharged.

    1984/1985 SEASON

 The Chairman gave members a brief account of what he predicted for the
 forthcoming season as regards policing problems, stressing the possibility of
 recent lawlessness witnessed on picket lines being repeated at football grounds

•especially when teams from working mining areas such as Nottingham visited South
 Yorkshire.

- Mr Clement also warned members of the possibility of policing football matches
  with less officers than operationally desirable due to continuing heavy demands
  upon manpower.

    Chief Superintendent Broomhead recounted an incident at a match at Bramall Lane
    towards the end of last season when stones were thrown by the hooligan elemetTt
    in the crowd.

 Chief Superintendent Moseley wanted placing on record his appreciation of the
 efforts made by the Sheffield Wednesday Manager, Howard Wilkinson, in trying
 to prevent pitch invasions at the end of last season. He also informed members
 of the difficulties being faced by British Rail in respect of lack of rolling
 stock which would affect special trains to Wadsley Bridge Station, thereby
 increasing the number of supporters going through the city centre from the
 Midland Station to Hillsborough.

 Chief Superintendent Carlin asked Club Secretaries to make their supporters
 clubs aware of the difficulties faced by the police after games had finished.
 He referred particularly to travelling supporters stopping off in towns, usually
 for alcoholic refreshment, which sometimes resulted in confrontations with other
 supporters and then the police.

 Chief Superintendent Meadows agreed with Chief Superintendent Carlin, and
 informed the meeting that with the assistance of the British Transport Police
 and British Rail it was hoped that trains carrying supporters would be
 time-tabled so as not to arrive at stations such as Doncaster at the same time.

 The Chairman summed up by saying that although there had been signs during last
 season that the hooligan problem associated with football was declining he feared
 that the trend may not continue in the forthcoming season.

 Item discharged.

    SEGREGATION OF SPECTATORS

    Chief Superintendent Moseley introduced this item, outlining a problem occurring
    in the Leppings Lane stand at Hillsborough. Traditionally, the terracing at
    the Leppings Lane end had been allocated to 'away' supporters, but from
    time-to-time 'away' supporters had also been allowed in the stand. He was most
    concerned at the continuing sale of season tickets in the stand to Sheffield
    Wednesday supporters increasing the likelihood of confrontation. He asked for
    guidance as to interpretation of the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975, on this
    point.

    Mr Vaughan replied that the conditions for segregation of supporters contained
    in the Safety at Sports Grounds Act had been interpreted as applying to standing
    areas and he was of the opinion that it did not apply to seated parts of grounds.

    Mr Chester stated that Sheffield Wednesday were aware of the problem of home
    supporters in the West Stand and had tried to reduce the numbers of season ticket
    holders from over 200 last season to under 40 this forthcoming season. He
    pointed out the problems associated with this policy, as some of the season
    ticket holders had been using that stand since it was built for the 1966 World

•   Cup.

  The Chairman pointed out that as season tickets had already been sold to
- Sheffield Wednesday supporters for the West Stand, the potential for
  confrontation would have to be borne in mind when arrangements for policing
 matches were made.

    Item discharged.

    DUTIES OP STEWARDS

    Chief Superintendent Moseley also introduced this item, saying it had come to
    his notice that stewards were not fulfilling their duties and on occasions had
    removed their jackets and mingled with the crowd in order to avoid trouble.
    He was concerned with the abrogation of their responsibilities and asked Club
    Secretaries to make it clear to stewards what their duties entailed.

 The Chairman stated that it was better for the Clubs if minor disputes which
 need not involve the police were resolved by the stewards rather than resorting

♦to police intervention.

 Item discharged.

 ANY OTHER BUSINESS

 a.    Financial Arrangements for 1984/85 Season

The Assistant Chief Constable (Management Services), Mr Watson, stated that
it was the intention of the South Yorkshire Force to police the five football
league grounds in an identical manner to previous seasons. Divisional Commanders
would assess their manpower requirements for each game and deploy sufficient
police officers to ensure that there were no public order disturbances. The
Clubs would be charged as per the agreed formula based on the official attendance
at the match, irrespective of how many officers were actually used. He further
stated that with effect from 1 September 1984, it was expected that there would
be an approximate increase in charges of 4.8? to reflect a similar increase
in police pay.

There was no dissension from this proposed course of action and Mr Watson further
indicated that in respect of each game Clubs would be allowed 21 days to meet
the account rendered or legal proceedings to recover the charges would be
commenced.
                                             _   li   -



  Mr Chester stated that Clubs would have appreciated advance notice of the
  increased charges before setting their admission fees. Mr Watson replied that
  the review of police pay was based on a wages index (May to May figures) and
  these were not released until late July each year. To estimate the proposed
  increase would be dangerous as evidenced by the NUM dispute which had reduced
  the pay index from approximately 1% to h . 8 % this year.

  Item discharged.         j

  b.   Affairs of Football clubs Discussed
       in Police Committee

  Mr Chester asked that Clubs be forewarned about matters concerning them which
  were to be discussed at future Police Committee meetings. He stated that within
  an hour of the Police Committee meeting, the Clubs were being approached by
  the press and asked to comment about matters on which they had little or no
  information.

  Mr Vaughan replied that the County Council were aware of the problem and would
- look into it.

  Item discharged.


  The Chairman wished the Clubs a successful and prosperous forthcoming season
  and assured them of the continued support of the South Yorkshire .Police.


  There being no further business the meeting closed at 12.40 pm.

SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS IN SOUTH YORKSHI312


Of the five FootDail League Grounds in South Yorkshire, three (Barnsley,
Rotherham United and Sheffield Wednesday) have already been granted General
Safety Certificates by the County Council under the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act, 1975, following their designation by the Secretary of State On the
carrying out of improvements-

The Bramall Lane Ground of the Sheffield United Football Club Ltd. was designated
by the Secretary of State in July, 1984 on the Club’s promotion to the Second
Division. The Club has already carried out a number of improvements to the
Ground, the remainder to be completed during the 1985 close season.

Only the Belle Vue Ground of the Doncaster Rovers Football Club Ltd. remains
undesignated (the Club remaining in the Third Division), but the County Council
is continuing to work on a goodwill basis with the Club.

The County Council has also since 1979 had a policy of "winter" and "summer"
inspections of all five Football League Grounds by Officer Working Parties
(comprising representatives of the Police, the Fire Service, the County Council
arid the District Council's Building Surveyor). Such inspections have been welcomed
by the Football Clubs, who have always displayed a responsible attitude on safety
matters.

Naturally, the forthcoming "summer" inspections will take into account the lessons
of the recent tragic events at Bradford and any revised advice and requirements
which may be issued by the Home Office.

                         MINISTER FOR SPORT LAUNCHES PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROCESS
                                      ON SOCCER SPECTATOR VIOLENCE

Announcing         the        publication            today        of        a    Departmental                report        on     soccer      spectator
vi ol e nc e *,                                 Minister for Sport, said:-



       "Everyone          is     aware          of     the       Government's                determination                 to     do all       that     is

       possible,          with       the    football             authorities,                to    tackle          the        problem of ’football

       ho oliganism.' Working                   together,              we       have   taken       a     series          of    measures      which,    as

       the    report       concludes,           have       helped           to    limit      violence             associated         with     football.

       But    following         serious         incidents              towards the end of last                         season,       my Ministerial

       colleagues         and       I decided             that    the       time       had    come          for    a   review of our           approach

       and of the options                 for dealing with the problem.                                     We therefore set                up a working

       group       of    officials         from       the     four          Government            Departments            principally         concerned

       (Environment,            Foreign         and       Commonwealth             Office,          Home          Office       and   Transport)       and

       it is their advice which is being published as a report today.



       "The       Report       contains          the        collective             views          of     the       Official          Working    Group,

       although          on     particular             issues           the       advice           emanates            from       the    responsible

       Departments.             My    colleagues             and       I are       grateful            to    the       Working       Group    for    this

       report and in particular                       for        the    speed with which                     it was produced.                We pushed

       them hard as we thought                        it    important to form some views before a new domestic
      season opened.



        We accept the thrust of this report.                                     It is a reasonable and thorough assessment

      of     the    problem         and    of    the       possible             options.           It    rightly          endorses      the current

      partnership between the Government and the football authorities and the emphasis

      upon careful planning, preparation and coordination to deter and reduce violence.

      It     identifies         a    number          of    additional             measures             which       might        be   taken.         These

      measures          are    mainly      for       the     football            authorities,               but     we    stand      ready     to give

      all the help we can.                      I hope the Football Association, the Football League, the

      Football Trust and others concerned will think about these options seriously in
      the next few weeks, as we propose to do.




      *FOOTBALL SPECTATOR VIOLENCE - Report of an Official Working Group                                                             (HMSO £3.80p?
''What we are starting today is a process of consultation.                     Me in Government
will think carefully about this report and its advice to us.                He seek the views
of all th« other bodies involved, notably of course the football                   authorities.
 I wrote to the Chairman of the Football Association, the Football League and
the Football Trust                        two days ago, inviting them to join me over
the costing weeks to discuss it.


"We look also       for the views of the general public.              Football hooliganism
affects and concerns many people and we have chosen to publish this advice from
our officials as a Departmental report, in order to give as many people as
possible the opportunity to comment.             None of us would pretend that we have a
monopoly    on   ideas to    combat soccer spectator violence.             Other bodies and
individuals      have   different   experience    and   expertise   and    I    believe   it   is
important   to enable      everyone to make a contribution.           The start of a new
domestic season is the right time to start such a debate.                 I look forward to a
wide and fruitful one, inspired by this report, over the next three months."

                           SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS
               HOME SECRETARY STATEMENT ON POPPLEWELL INQUIRY


        The Government "accepts the need to strengthen urgently" the safety
    measures at sports grounds, the Home Secretary the Rt Hon Douglas Hurd
    CBE MP said today.   "Consultations will begin immediately with the sporting
    authorities and organisations concerned" with a view to extend
    designation this summer under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 to all grounds

    with spectator accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators at which
    soccer, rugby union, rugby league and cricket is played.

         All eligible Football League grounds hove already been designated as have
    Scottish premier league grounds, Rugby League Division one and two

    grounds and the three national Rugby Union stadia.

         The principle that safety controls should also be extended to other
    sports grounds with stands capable of holding over 500 spectators and
    to indoor sports facilities with accommodation for over 500 spectators
    where adequate controls do not already exist was also accepted by the
    Home Secretary.   The first step will be to establish the facts about
    those grounds and facilities affected and the full practical effects

    of the recommendations.

         The Home Secretary was responding to the Final Report of the Committee
    of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds set up following
    the fire at Bradford City football ground and the events at Birmingham City
    football ground last May.   He expressed the Government’s gratitude for the
    speed and conscientiousness with which the Chairman and his two assessors

    had discharged this difficult task.

         The Final Report makes 15 recommendations on crowd safety and control
    at sports grounds.   The full text of the Home Secretary’s response is
    attached giving details of the request to local authorities, and chief
fire officers to inspect as necessary both indoor and outdoor sports
premises and proposals to publish a consultative document on legislative
changes in order to achieve the objectives of the safety recommendations

of the Final Report.

     On the question of crowd control, the Home Secretary referred to
the steps already taken to strengthen the powers of the police and courts*,
in particular new police powers of search and arrest in the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act and on further measures, including a new offence
of disorderly conduct, proposed in the Public Order Bill.   He undertook
to look further at Mr Justice Popplewell’s recommendations when we have
had time to see how these measures worked in practice.   The latest figures
available suggest that in London so far this season there has been a
reduction of over kO per cent in the number of people arrested and

ejected; in Manchester the reduction is over 5C$.




 MOTE FOR EDITORS

      The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) implemented the main
 proposals of the Wheatley Report into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds
 established following an accident at Ibrox Park in 1971 when 66 people

 were killed and many more injured.

      Designation under the SSGA means that the owner or occupier of a
 stadium must apply to the local authority (county council) for a safety
 certificate if spectators are to be admitted to the stadium.

on    1 January          has      already extended                 the p o l i c e    powers      of    search         and

13.          When we       have      considered          these          inspections             we    shall          quickly

issue        a consultative               document       and       propose ways               of     achieving          the

objectives           of     the    Inquiry's          Final        Report,          fitting          this       into    the

 review        already under              way    on   the      future         of    the Fir e         Precautions

 Act.         Further       legislation may well                     prove         necessary.              There will           be

 no    avoidable           risk m e a n w h i l e     because            any necessary               emergency           action

 can     be    taken under           existing          powers.



 14.          So    far,     the     figures       this        season         show      a marked           improvement             in

 the     number       of    arrests         and    ejections             from      football           grounds.           Our

 measures           against        hooliganism           should          have      a cumulative               effect.          But

 it     is    too    soon     to     be    satisfied.              We    have      to d e a l        not    only with

 hooliganism              but w i t h      safety;         not       only with            football          grounds       but

                       SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

               Home Secretary welcomes Interim Report of
                          Committee of Inquiry


     "There is no single, simple method of making sports grounds safe and
free from violence," the Home Secretary, the Rt Hon Leon Brittan QC MP,
said today, "but I believe that the steps taken in the last few months,
coupled with the implementation of the important recommendations of Mr
Justice Popplewell's inquiry, have already made and will make a significant
contribution towards preserving football as a major spectator sport".

     The Home Secretary was responding to the publication of the Interim
Report by the committee which was established following the fire at
Bradford City football ground and the events at Birmingham City football
ground.   Paying tribute to the 'speedy, clear and thorough way in which
the Chairman and his two assessors have tackled this difficult and important
task' the Home Secretary said "No-one reading the report, or who followed
the public hearings in Bradford, can doubt that the Inquiry has investigated
these matters as thoroughly as possible".

     The Popplewell committee makes 32 recommendations (8 of them provisioned)
in its report; these recommendations, and the government's response to them,
are contained in a written statement also published today (copy attached).
In particular the government is asking local authorities, police and sports
authorities to respond immediately to the spirit of the recommendations to
improve safety arrangements at sports grounds.

     The Home Secretary went on however to report the actions already taken
in the immediate aftermath of the events at Bradford and Birmingham.        First,
under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act all qualifying grounds of clubs in
Divisions 3 and k of the Football League and Divisions 1 and 2 of the Rugby
League have been designated, requiring clubs to apply for safety certificates
before admitting any spectators.
                                   2



     Secondly reports received from Chief Fire Officers indicate that all
uncertificated grounds of the Association Football League and of the 1st
and 2nd Divisions of the Rugby League have been inspected.   Spectator
accommodation at the larger cricket grounds, Rugby Union grounds, race
courses, motor racing circuits, greyhound tracks, tennis clubs and athletics
grounds has also been inspected.   Chief Fire Officers have sent copies of
their findings to the management of those sports grounds visited, indicating
what remedial measures have to be taken.   In some cases this will involve
complete closure of a stand until rebuilding or remedial work has been
completed.

     Fire safety standards at most of the soccer and Rugby League grounds
have been found to be generally satisfactory but some improvements have been
shown to be required and a number of potentially serious fire hazards have
been revealed.   These include stands which are wholly or largely made of
timber, unprotected voids beneath timber floors in stands, combustible
materials stored beneath stands and inadequate gangways or final exit doors.

     Management of sports grounds have responded in a co-operative way and
have either set necessary work in hand or are considering how best to comply
with the requirements.   The attention of the governing bodies of the main
sporting activities is also being drawn to the Report's recommendations in
anticipation that full co-operation will continue to be given to ensure
proper spectator safety measures are in operation at all sports grounds.

     Thirdly the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Bill has been
passed and will be in force by the beginning of the football season.

     Fourthly, steps have been taken to enhance police effectiveness.
In England and Wales the Association of Chief Police Officers has introduced
a new system for exchanging information about the conduct of fans which
should assist in anticipating and preventing trouble.   Three of the Home
Office photographic vehicles will be available to be deployed at football
matches, together with 2 experimental high-definition tripod mounted cameras.
This is in addition to the £ 500,000 worth of equipment purchased through
funds provided by the Football Trust.

     Fifthly, the Minister for Sport has helped to promote and draw up a
Council of Europe Convention on Spectator Violence.
INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS
INTERIM REPORT JULY 1985 ( CMND 9585 )




GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS




GROUND MANAGEMENT


RECOMMENDATIONS


1.       Evacuation procedures should be a matter of police training
and form part of the briefing by police officers before a football
match.    (Paragraph 3-9)■



2.       The local authority team responsible for issuing safety
certificates in respect of designated grounds should, as heretofore,
include police officers.     (Paragraph 3-15)



Certificating authorities and chief officers of police will be
invited to act upon these recommendations (see also Recommendation 10).




RECOMMENDATIONS


6.       Those managing sports grounds not governed by safety certificates
should give serious consideration, with the assistance of fire authorities,
to the presence in a ground of suitable fire fighting equipment.
(Paragraph 3-5*0



7.       Stewards at all sports grounds should be trained in fire fighting.
(Paragraph 3.55)


8.       In designated grounds it should be a term of the safety certificate
that an adequate first-aid room should be provided.    (Paragraph 3.99)




                                       1
10.     Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
precautions and fire-fighting (see Recommendation 7 above) but should
also be trained in how best to help the police in evacuation.
(Paragraph 3-10*0


14.    Suitable and adequate exits should be provided in all sports
grounds.   (Paragraph 3.138)

15.   No smoking should take place In combustible stands, that this
should be a condition of entry to the ground that signs to that effect
should be prominently displayed and this should be a condition of
entry to the ground.    (Paragraph 3-l4l)

The relevant sports authorities will be invited to draw the attention
of sports grounds managers to these recommendations, and certificating
authorities will be asked to consider reflecting the recommendations
in new or amended safety certificates as appropriate in the case of
designated grounds. The fire and police services will be asked to stand
ready to advise on equipment and assist with training as appropriate.




RECOMMENDATION


9.     There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety
Executive and the fire authorities and local authorities as to how best
to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and reports.
(Paragraph 3-95)


The HSE has appointed a member of its Executive to review liaison
arrangements between its inspectors and the fire authorities. He will
consult Government Departments and others in this review, the results of
which will be made public.




RECOMMENDATION


16.    Fire Authorities should identify and visit all sports stadia in their
areas and should prohibit or restrict the use of any stands which, in their
view, constitute a risk to spectators because of the inadequacy of the fire
precautions.     (Paragraph 3-142)

                                     2
Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales were invited by the Horae Secretary
on 16 May to inspect all sports grounds and were reminded of the powers
available to them to take emergency action if, in their view, fire hazards
constituting a risk to spectators are revealed.   The Secretary of State
for Scotland similarly asked Firemasters to inspect sports grounds in Scotland.
Reports received show that fire brigades -have not hesitated to recommend
emergency action where necessary, including in a number of cases a prohibition
on the use of stands or a restriction on the number of spectators allowed
into them.




RECOMMENDATION


1?*    In order to ensure a complete record of sports grounds a
local registration system should be set up.   (Paragraph 3-150)


Consultation will take place with the local authority associations to
establish how such records may best be compiled and maintained.     The
recent visits of the fire brigades (see Recommendation 16) should have
in practice marshalled much of the relevant data already.




STRUCTURES


RECOMMENDATION


13-    Building of new permanent stands of combustible materials
should be prohibited as a general rule.   (Paragraph 3-132)


This recommendation will be given speedy and urgent consideration
by the Departments who are responsible for building regulations.




                                 3
 GREEN GUIDE


 RECOMMENDATIONS


 4.     The Green Guide should be amended to include in Paragraph 11 a
 provision that, wherever practicable, roads within a quarter of a
 mile of a sports ground should be kept entirely free of parked vehicles.
 (Paragraph 3-35)


 11.   Paragraph 6.14.6 of the    Green Guide should be amended to read:
 "All exit gates should be manned at all times while the ground is used
by the public and be capable of being opened immediately from inside .
by anyone in an emergency.11 (Paragraph 3-111)


12 -   The Green Guide should be amended to contain a specific provision,
in relation to stewards,


       (i)      that they   should be trained and instructed to
       deal with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation
       (see also Recommendations 7 and 10);


       (ii)     that they should be.given written instructions
       about the action to be taken in cases of emergency;


       (iii)    that they should receive practical instruction
       and training appropriate to their responsibility;


       (iv)    that no one should be employed as a steward
       unless they have been so instructed and trained; and


       (v)      that they should be adequate in number, physically
       and mentally capable of performing their duties, effectively
       deployed, effectively supervised and readily identifiable.
       (Paragraph 3,117)


19 -   The next edition of the Green Guide should make it clear
that it applies to all sports grounds.    (Paragraph 3-154)
These points will be noted for inclusion in the next edition of the Green
Guide which will be needed after the Inquiry's final report is received.
Action will not however depend upon the availability of a fresh edition and
certificating authorities and chief officers of police (Recommendation 4)
will be invited to take such steps as are open to them now.




CROWD MANAGEMENT


RECOMMENDATIONS


5.     Consideration should be given to making it a criminal offence
in England and Wales to have a smoke bomb or similar device at sports
grounds.   (Paragraph 3-42)


22.    There should be a specific offence of throwing a missile at
sports grounds. (Paragraph 6.57)


The case for inviting Parliament to create new criminal offences on
these lines will be studied urgently in connection with the Government's
intention of introducing legislation in the next session of Parliament
following its review of the law relating to public order.




RECOMMENDATIONS


20.    Urgent consideration should be given by football clubs in
England and Wales to introducing membership system so as to exclude
visiting fans.     (Paragraph 6.48)


23 -   Football clubs should review their arrangements for entry and
the organisation of their turnstiles.     (Paragraph 6.62)


Both these recommendations are for football authorities and clubs, but the
Government hopes that they will be given serious consideration.    The
Government has been encouraging the Football Association and the Football
League to introduce a scheme of membership cards and the options are currently



                                      5
being considered in a Football League working group: that group's
attention will therefore be drawn to the Inquiry's Recommendation 20.
The governing bodies' attention will also be drawn to Recommendation 23
which might be influenced by decisions upon Recommendation 20.




RECOMMENDATION


21 *   Closed circuit television should be introduced at League football
grounds in England and Wales and in the Premier Division in Scotland.
(Paragraph 6.54)


The Football Trust has allocated £500,000 for the provision of CCTV equipment
in League grounds during the 1985-86 season.    The Trust's attention, and
that of the Football Associations and the Football Leagues, will be drawn
to this recommendation.




MISCELLANEOUS


RECOMMENDATIONS


3.     Early attention should be given by the Home Office Directorate
of Telecommunications to consider the practicality of producing a more
suitable personal radio for the police.   (Paragraph 3.33)


18.    Consideration should be given as how best to deal with temporary
stands and marquees   (Paragraph 3.151)


24.    Consideration should be given to the design of a standard,
efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.   (Paragraph 6.63)


Each of these will be studied as the Inquiry advises.   Recommendations
18 and 24 may best be taken forward in the context of the Inquiry's next
stage and when it turns to examine the Green Guide as a whole.




                                 6
% ,PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS


    (To be reviewed in the Final Report)


    1.      I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should
    be given the unfettered right of search before entry to football grounds by
    s t a t u t e (Paragraph 3-41)


    2.     I am minded     to recommend that Section 10 of the   Fire Precautions Act 1971
    should be amended with a view to giving the Fire Authority power in cases other
    than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional      (Paragraph 3-61)


    3-     Linked with the above, I am       minded to recommend that consideration
    should be given to introducing legislation giving powers for the Fire Authority
    to apply to the High Court, for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for
    an interdict in Scotland) under Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
    (Paragraph 3-61)


    4.      I am minded     to recommend that Section 10 of the Safety at Sports Grounds
    Act 1975 should be amended in like manner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions
    Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations 2 and 3) and an application to the
    High Court for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for an interdict in
    Scotland) should be an alternative remedy.      (Paragraph 3-76)


    5.      I am minded to recommend that the Secretary of State should exercise his
    powers to designate all sports grounds, whatever their size to include indoor
    as well as outdoor activities.      (Paragraph 3-145)


    6.     I am minded to recommend immediate designation of any ground
    capable of holding over 5,000 spectators, to cover all sports grounds,
    not merely football grounds.       (Paragraph 3.146)


   7-       I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to
   providing the police with additional powers of arrest under the
   Public Order Act, 1936.       (Paragraph 6.66)


   8.       I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to
   creating a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse
   at a sports ground. (Paragraph 6.67)


   These are noted and the Government will stand by to assist the
   Inquiry in its further consideration of the matters.

      FOOTBALL SPECTATOR VIOLENCE - MEETING OF MINISTER'S WORKING GROUP


       Neil     Macfarlane,              Minister           for     Sport,       today       chaired       a    meeting
 of    the Working           Group       set     up       to co-ordinate measures to deal with foot­
 ball hooliganism.


        In a statement after the meeting Mr Macfarlane said:


        "My     Working          Group     today           continued       the       discussions       between            the
 Government           and       the     football           authorities          on    measures       to    be        taken,
 jointly       and        separately,          to     deal    with       the    problems       of    crowd          control
 and    safety        confronting              the    game.         The     Football         League       presented         a
 memorandum and reported specifically on membership cards.


        "The         issue        of     membership           cards        is    one     which        concerns            the
 responsibility              of        football       clubs        for     ensuring       safety      and       security
 within       their       own premises.               The     Government expects them to take that
 responsibility              seriously          and        regrets       the    delay.       I am     glad          to    note
 that     the       Football           League        has     established         a    Working       Group       to        give
 this    option           the    full     but       speedy        consideration          it requires.                I look
 forward        to    seeing           an 'early          report,       which    will    be    completed             by    the
 end of August.

        "In         the      meantime,           a        Government/football                package           is        being
 constructed           for the new season.                    The Government has already announced
 a range of actions, within its responsibilities,                                       to reduce and contain
 hooliganism.               There will          be a strengthened role for the Police, with
 new powers under the Public Order bill to be introduced next Session.
 Legislation              has     almost        completed            its        passage       in    Parliament              to
 restrict        alcohol           at     matches          and     on    journeys       to    and from         them;       we
 know* alcohol             can     incite       and        inflame       trouble.        I took the initiative
 to     agree       binding        measures          with     European          Governments         and    with          UEFA.
 A    Convention           has     been    agreed          upon     and    should       be adopted         very          soon;
 discussions              have     started          with     UEFA.To       meet      public         concern          about
 safety,       Divisions           3 and       4 Football           League clubs are to be designated
 under        the     Safety of           Sports           Grounds       Act;     Chief      Fire Officers               have
 been inspecting all sports grounds;                                and there is a full inquiry under
 Mr Justice Popplewell.                    His interim report will be available very soon.

          ALCOHOL AT FOOTBALL MATCHES; ’TOUGH BUT FAIR MEASURES’


           The Home Office today published a Bill to control the sale and
  possession of alcohol at and on the way to and from sporting events.
  Commenting on the Bill the Home Secretary, the Rt Hon Leon Brittan QC HP,
  said,

           "We are putting forward tough but fair measures which go to the
           heart of the problem of drunken behaviour and hooliganism at
           football grounds.   The Bill is based upon the current Scottish
           legislation, but also reflects the difference between football
           grounds in Scotland and those in Ehgland and Wales.

           "Broadly the Bill will make it an offence to possess alcohol
          when entering a football ground or in football coaches or trains
          on the way to a match.   Drunkenness in the ground or at the entrance
          to it will also be made illegal.   The sale of alcohol inside grounds
          will be tightly controlled, but clubs will be able to apply to local
          magistrates for an exemption order allowing them to sell alcohol
          in bars out of sight of the pitch: in considering the application
          magistrates will give particular regard to public order and safety
          considerations and the club's past record in this respect.

          "I have discussed these measures with HM Opposition and the Alliance
          parties and been assured of their agreement to^hem.      They share the
          Government's wish to do everything possible to remove this stain
          from a great British game."

 The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Bill

          The Bill's provisions will apply to designated sports grounds and
 designated sporting events. (It is expected that the Secretary of State's
 initial designation order will relate only to football grounds and matches,
 including, in particular, Football League Clubs and international fixtures).
                                  -   d. -




            Clause 1 prohibits drunkenness and the possession of drink on trains,
coaches and mini-buses on the way to or from a designated sporting event.
Offences in connection with possessing drink, drunkenness and possession of
a 'controlled container' at grounds are created by Clause 2.

            Clauses 3-5 place a general ban on the sale of alcohol within
designated sports grounds but provide for exemption orders to be granted
by magistrates if they are satisfied that public order and safety arrangements
would not be threatened.      Exemption orders will be valid for only five months
which means that football clubs obtaining exemptions early in the season will
need to reapply to the courts for fresh exeraptionsfor the second half of the
season.     Clause 6 empowers a police officer to close any bar in the ground if
trouble breaks out.      Clause 7 provides the police with the necessary powers
to enforce the provisions of the Bill and Clause 8 sets out the penalties.
These are outlined below.      Clause 9 includes an interpretation of the terms
used in the Bill; the main ones being:

            'designated sports ground' - means any place wholly or partly used
            for sporting events where accommodation is provided for spectators
            and which has been designated by the Secretary of State;
            'designated sporting event'- means any sporting event or proposed
            sporting event designated by the Secretary of State.

The provisions also apply to travel within England and Wales en route to
sports grounds and sporting events designated by the Secretary of State for
Scotland.     Matches played abroad may be designated for the purpose of
controlling drinking on special trains and coaches.      Clause 10 amends the
corresponding Scottish legislation. The major provisions of the Bill are as follows:
Possession of drink and drunkenness:
            on coaches, trains and mini-buses -
            Alcohol will be prohibited on a public service vehicle
            or railway passenger vehicle which is being used for the
            primary purpose of conveying passengers to or from a designated
            sporting event.
            offences -   it will be an offence knowingly to cause or permit
            intoxicating liquor to be carried on such a vehicle; the operator,
            hirer or his servant/agent will be liable (Cl(2))
                     -            a person who has intoxicating liquor in his possession
            while on such a vehicle will be guilty of an offence (Cl(3))
                         it will be an offence to be drunk on such a vehicle (Cl(4))
                                 - 3 -

        at sports grounds -
        Possession of intoxicating liquor or a 'controlled container'
         (i.e. a bottle, can or other portable container which is capable
        of causing injury) will be prohibited in any part of a designated
        sports ground from which the event may be directly viewed.
        offences -     it will be an offence to be in possession of intoxicating
        liquor or a controlled container at any time during the period of a
        designated sporting event in any part of the sports ground from which
         the event may be directly viewed ( c 2 ( 1 )(a)) or while entering or
         trying to enter the ground ( c 2 ( 1 )(b)).
                   -            a person who is drunk in any part of the ground during
         the period of a designated sporting event or who is drunk on entering
        a ground will be guilty of an offence (c2(2)).

Restricting the sale of drink within sports grounds
        The sale of intoxicating liquor will generally be prohibited during
         the period of a designated sporting event (c3(D)•       However, clause 3 (2)
        makes provision for a magistrates court to grant an exemption order for
         licensed premises or registered club premises inside the ground, but
         only in respect of areas out of sight of the pitch.1 In granting such
         an order the court must be satisfied that it is not likely to be
         detrimental to the orderly conduct or safety of spectators. (c3(6)).
         Where such an order already exists but a police inspector considers
         the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor at a particular designated
         sporting event is likely to be detrimental to the orderly conduct
         or safety of spectators, and it is impracticable for an application
         for variation of the order to be made to a magistrates court, he may
         give written notice to the holder of the order, (or- his designated
         representative) that the existing order should be modified or should
         cease to have effect (c3(7)«(9)).
         Clause 6(1) makes provision for any bar within a designated sports
         ground to be closed at any time during the course of a designated
         sporting event if it appears to a constable in uniform that the
         continued sale or supply of intoxicating liquor is detrimental to
         the orderly conduct or safety of spectators at that event.
        offences -     it will be an offence to sell or supply or to authorise
        the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor in contravention of conditions
        or restrictions imposed under Clause 3(10),
                                 _ 1+ _



                    - it will be an offence to fail to close a bar if required
         by a constable to do so (c6(2))

Powers of enforcement

         Clause 7 provides a police constable with powers to enter any part
         of a designated sports ground to enforce the provisions of the Act
         ( c7 ( 1 )), to search persons in or attempting to enter a ground (c7(2))
         to stop public service vehicles and to search such vehicles or
         railway passenger vehicles (c7(3))•

Penalties for offences

         Offences will be triable summarily.    For the offence of:
             being in possession of intoxicating liquor on a vehicle (c1(3))
             being in possession of intoxicating liquor in or on entry to a
         designated sports ground during a designated sporting event (c2(1))
             selling or supplying intoxicating liquor in contravention of
         restrictions and conditions (c3(10))
             failing to comply with the request of a constable to close a
         bar (c6(2))
              penalty is a fine not exceeding £*+00 or 3 months imprisonment
         or both.
         For the offence of knowingly causing or permitting intoxicating
         liquor to be carried on a vehicle; the penalty will be a fine not
         exceeding £1000 (c1(2))
         For the offences of:
         -   being drunk in a vehicle (cl(*0)
             being drunk in or on entry to a designated ground (c2(2))
         the penalty will be a fine not exceeding £100.

Amendment of Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980
         Clause 10 of the Bill contains amendments to Part V of the Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Act 1980.    It extends the provisions of section 69 in
relation to public-service vehicles to trains; and it applies the Act to
sporting events designated under the present Bill and to designated sporting
events outside Great Britain, so that travel in Scotland en route to designated
sporting events in England and Wales or outside Great Britain would be caught
under the Act.

Notes to Editors

A public service vehicle has the same meaning as in the Public Passenger
Vehicle Act 1981 and includes buses, coaches and mini-buses which are used
for hire or reward.




The Bill does not extend to Northern Ireland.

COUNTY HALL, BARNSLEY, SOUTH YORKSHIRE S702TN
No:   8 5 / 2 1 6/LM                             Date:           6 June 1985




SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


The majority of sports grounds in South Yorkshire are "satisfactory"

from a safety point of view according to South Yorkshire County Council

Chief Fire Officer Mr Harry Wright.     In a report to the County Council

Fire Service Committee Mr Wright said that     an iiiitial survey had

revealed a total of 30 sports grounds at which stands were provided

for spectators and accommodation provided for players and officials.

Only in four cases had recommendations been made for minor adjustments

and negotiations were now taking place to remedy the faults.


The report follows the recent Bradford City disaster in which more than

fifty people died.     The terms of reference of the review were to

examine all sports grounds of whatever size or sporting activity and to

give interim advice on any matter which gave rise     to a risk of fire or

emergency evacuation.    Mr Wright said of the four   grounds:    "I should

like to point out these faults are of a minor nature and are being

corrected with a tremendous amount of good will".     He added "I am

satisfied that any faults will be remedied by the     start of the next

season if they are not, necessary action will be taken to ensure the

safety of the public".


The forthcoming "Summer" Officer Working Parties inspections (comprising

representative of the Police, the Fire Service, the County Council and

the District Council's Building Surveyor) will take into account the

lessons of the recent tragic events at Bradford and any revised advice
and requirements which may be issued by the Home Office.

COUNTY COUNCIL DENIAL


South Yorkshire County Council yesterday, denied that they threatened to
close Rotherham United Football Club's Millmore ground, after investigations
in 1980, showed that more exits were required, in case of an emergency.


Former police Superintendent, Douglas Lock, in yesterdays edition o i     the
Morning Telegraph, 14 May 1985, said that when safety implementations had
been suggested by the Authority, "the directors were extrsmely reluctant to
do anything about it and we had to threaten to close the ground."


A County Council spokesman said, "To suggest that Rotherham United had to be
threatened is a misrepresentation of the situation.    There were differences
of opinion about the means of implementing improvements between the County
Council's Officer Working Parties and the directors of Rotherham United, but
these were discussed and resolved.     We never got to the stage where we were

 'banging the big druai'."


The County Council has, since 1979, had a policy of “winter” and "summer"
inspections of all five Football Leagui Grounds in South Yorkshire, by
 Officer Working Parties (comprising representatives of the Police, the
 Fire Brigade, the County Council and the District Council's Building Surveyor).
 Officer Working Parties have met with Rotherham United Football Club 23
 times since 1979.   Whilst former Superintendent Douglas Lock was a
 Sub-Divisional Commander at Rotherham for six months, he was not present at

 these meetings.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

I attach a copy of a Press Release issued by the County Council
today in response to requests for information by the media on
the situation in South Yorkshire following Saturday's tragic
events at Bradford.

It is reasonable to assume that revised advice and/or requirements
will be issued by the Home Office in the near future, and naturally
this will be taken into account at the forthcoming "summer"
inspections by the Officer Working parties.

In the meantime and recognising that the season has ended, I would
particularly stress the vital necessity for safety stewards to be
fully aware of and trained in their duties on the manning and
opening of doors and gates on egress routes and in the use of fire
fighting equipment.

                                                Yours faithfully,




                                                Chief Executive.

P . S. Could you kindly indicate whether the Club's development
proposals (outlined on a confidential basis at the meeting held
at the Ground on 30th January, 1985) are, in fact, to proceed.

I would add that the Building Authority advise that they hope to
be able to let me have their report on the existing Ground very
shortly.

SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS IN SOUTH YORKSHIRE


Of the f-ive Football League Grounds in South Yorkshire, three (Barnsley,
Rotherham United and Sheffield Wednesday) have already been granted General
Safety Certificates by the County Council under the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act, 1975, following their designation by the Secretary of State bn the
carrying out of improvements.

The Bramall Lane Ground of the Sheffield United Football Club Ltd. was designated
by the Secretary of State in July, 1984 on the Club's promotion to the Second
Division. The Club has already carried out a number of improvements to the
Ground, the remainder to be completed during the 1985 close season.

Only the Belle Vue Ground of the Doncaster Rovers Football Club Ltd. remains
undesignated (the Club remaining in the Third Division), but the County Council
is continuing to work on a goodwill basis with the Club.

The County Council has also since 1979 had a policy of "winter" and "summer"
inspections of all five Football League Grounds by Officer Working Parties
(comprising representatives of the Police, the Fire Service, the County Council
and the District Council's Building Surveyor). Such inspections have been welcomed
by the Football Clubs, who have always displayed a responsible attitude on safety
matters.

Naturally, the forthcoming "summer" inspections will take into account the lessons
of the recent tragic events at Bradford and any revised advice and requirements
which may be issued by the Home Office.

                                         SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

1.      Background

1.1     The Committee will recall that the County Council's powers and duties under
        this Act are delegated to this Committee. On 8th January, 1976, the
        Committee decided that any necessary detailed investigation should be
        undertaken by Officer Working Parties for each of the four Borough Council
        areas. These Officer Working Parties consist of representatives of the
        Fire Service, the Police, the Building Inspectors of the Borough Council,
        co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of Administration.

1.2     Whilst it is Parliament's intention that all sports grounds which have
        accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators should be subject to the
        provisions of the Act eventually, the only grounds designated by the Secretary
        of State to date as requiring General Safety Certificates from the appropriate
        County Council have been certain "International" grounds and those of clubs
        in the                                   Footbal 1 LeagueC ^u>o

                            SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL

      JOINT REPORT OF THE COUNTY SOLICITOR                   FIRE SERVICE COMMITTEE
      AND THE CHIEF FIRE OFFICER                             6TH FEBRUARY, 1986

                          SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

1.    Background

1.1   The Committee will recall that the County Council's powers and duties under
      this Act are delegated to this Committee. On 8th January, 1976, the
      Committee decided that any necessary detailed investigation should be
      undertaken by Officer Working Parties for each of the four Borough Council
      areas. These Officer Working Parties consist of representatives of the
      Fire Service, the Police, the Building Inspectors of the Borough Council,
      co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of Administration.

1.2   Whilst it is Parliament's intention that all sports grounds which have
      accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators should be subject to the
      provisions of the Act eventually, the only grounds designated by the
      Secretary of State to date as requiring General Safety Certificates from the
      appropriate County Council have been certain "International" grounds and
      those of clubs in the Football League (see separate Report on the "Popplewell
      Report" regarding further designations).

2.    Position in South Yorkshire

3.1 Following their designation by theSecretary    of State and detailed investi­
     gations and specialist advice given by the Officer Working Parties, General
     Safety Certificates have been granted as follows, after approval by the
     Committee:-

      Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield                  21st December, 1979.
      Wednesday Football Club pic.

      Millmoor Ground of the Rotherham United                20th February,   1984.
      Football Club Ltd.

      Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football                25th February, 1985.
      Club Ltd.

2.2   Following their promotion to the Second Division of the Football League, the
      Sheffield United Football Club Ltd. were designatedby the Secretary of State
      as requiring to apply to theCounty  Councilfor a General Safety Certificate
      by 1st January, 1985.

2.3   The Belle Vue   Ground of the Doncaster Rovers Football Club Ltd. was
      designated by   the Secretary of State as requiring to apply to the County
      Council for a   General Safety Certificate by 9th August, 1985, following the
      Bradford City   tragedy.

2.4   Both Clubs complied with these requirements, and have been undertaking works
      to meet the provisions of the Act in consultation with the Officer Working
      Parties.
5   All of the required works at the Sheffield United Ground will be completed
    shortly, and those at the Doncaster Rovers Ground concerned with fire
    precautions, fire detection and electrical (including emergency lighting)
    upgrading have been largely completed. The number and siting of the crush
    barriers at the Doncaster Rovers Ground have yet to receive attention.
    However, the Ground capacity has been reduced from a potential in the region
    of 30,000 (bearing in mind the area of the Ground if it fully complied with
    the Act) to 10,759    to take account of such factors.

    General Safety Certificates

1   The Committee on 3rd September, 1981, approved of minor amendments to the
    standard General Safety Certificate previously agreed (on 30th November,
    1978) to be used throughout the County.

2   Paragraph 9 of the standard General Safety Certificate contains provisions
    relating to the appointment of and duties of safety stewards. It is
    suggested that the following wording arising from the recommendations of
    the Popplewell Report should be substituted for parts (a), (b), (c) and (d)
    of the paragraph

    (i)      that they should be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency
             relating to fire or evacuation;
    (ii)     that they should be given written instructions about the action to
             be taken in cases of emergency;.
    (iii)    that they should receive practical instruction and training
             appropriate to their responsibility;
    (iv)     that no one should be employed as a steward unless they have been
             So instructed and trained; and
    (v)      that they should be adequate in' number, physically and mentally
             capable of performing their duties, effectively deployed,
             effectively supervised and readily identifiable.

3   The Committee is also requested to consider the question of whether a fee
    should be charged for the Certificates in view of previous decisions that
    no charge should be made to the Sheffield Wednesday, Rotherham United and
    Barnsley Football Clubs.

    Recommendation

    (i)      That the General Safety Certificate now submitted in respect of the
              Bramall Lane Ground, Sheffield, and the Interim General Safety
              Certificate in respect of the Belle Vue Ground, Doncaster, be
              approved, subject to the suggested amendments to paragraph 9
              relating to Safety Stewards.

    (ii)     That the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Committee be authorised
              to agree any amendments necessary should any of the requirements of
              the Certificates not be able to be complied with in full by the
              actual date of issue (such amendments not to reduce the overall
              level of safety to be required at either Ground).

    (jiii)   That the Committee make a decision as to whether a charge should be
             made to the Sheffield United Football Club Ltd. and the Doncaster
              Rovers Football Club Ltd. for the Certificates.         « < * ^

The Fire and Civil Defence Joint Authority have not made a decision about the
future of this project. Itwould in my view be unreasonable to incur
expenditure on acquiring the premises unless the agreement of the Joint Authority
has been obtained. The next meeting of the Joint Authority is cn 10th February.
Recommended that the agreement of the Fire and Civil Defence Joint Authority
be obtained before the acquisition of these premises proceeds.

FIRE PREVENTION - COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL
AT SPORTS GROUNDS - INTERIM REPORT

1.   As requested at the m e eti ng of the Fire Service Committee on 6th June,
     1985 I am now able to provide further information regarding the safety
     provisions in sports grounds within South Yorkshire.

2.   Following the events w hich occurred at the B radford City Football Ground
     on 11th May, 1985 a survey of sports grounds in South Yorkshire was unde r­
     taken to identify stadia to which the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
     might be applied should the safety standards be considered unsatisfactory.

     In addition to         the    5    major   football   club     grounds   the       survey      revealed
     stadia at :-

               9     Ass ociation football grounds
              10     Cricket grounds
               5     Rugby football grounds
               4     Greyhound tracks
               1     Joint speedway/greyhound/rugby ground
               1     Horse racing course
              40     General sports grounds

     The 40 sports grounds provide mi xed activities such as footba.ll, tennis,
     cricket, bowling, rugby and athletics.   Included in this number are both
     private clubs and others that are local authority controlled.

3.   Of the 70 grounds visited only 13 required attention.                              Work   to    improve
     the standard of fire safety has been agreed and includes                       :

        (i)   Fire proofing and means of escape wo rk at -

               (a)     Do ncaste r Greyhound Stadium.

               (b)     Dons Rugby Club, Bentley.

     t.iii)    Improved ho usekeeping and fire equipment at 9 stadia,                      all of which
               are considered to be of a satisfactory standard.

4.     A resolution to fire proof the main stand at the Hillsborough Stadium,
       Sheffield has been agreed and the major part of this work will be com­
       pleted before the start of the 1985/86 season. It has also been suggested
       that a new roof be provided for this stand and work has already commenced
       on the design and structural specification. It should be completed before
       the start of the 1986/87 season.

5.     Work is still progressing at the Bramall Lane G r o u n d , Sheffield with a
       view to the authority issuing a general safety certificate in the near
       future

6.      Doncaster Rovers Football Club have applied for a general safety     ^
        certificate following the coining into operation of the 1985 Designating   V!
        Order S.I.1985 : 1063. A considerable amount of work has already been^
        carried out to improve the fire resistance of the main stand and additional
        work is being undertaken to improve the final exits from the ground.

7.      Only the usual maintenance work is considered necessary at the Barnsley
        and Rotherham Football Club grounds.

8.      The Interim Report of Mr. Justice Popplewell became available to the
        County Fire Service early in August. It is a detailed document of
        almost 100 pages, including much technical data. The Report concludes
        that the Bradford fire was caused accidentally and that there were tvo
        causes of the fire and the resultant casualties; the presence of U t t e r
        under the seating and the absence of sufficient exits.   i.he keporu
        comments that, had the safety advice contained in the Home Office Guide
        to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) - the "Green Guide' - been
        followed, the tragedy would not have occurred. It must be added that, at
        that time, the Ground had not been designated by the Secretary of State
        under the Safety at Sports Grounds Act, 1975. As regards the
        Birmingham City incident, the Report concludes that a substantial number
        of Leeds United Fans, full of drink, had gone to Birmingham to cause
        trouble, and thereby sparked off the Birmingham City supporters whose
        subsequent behaviour was as bad as, if not worse than, that of the visiting
        supporters. The Report states that it is not possible to be sure how the
        brick wall came to fall, but feels that the most likely explanation was
         the surge of people.

9.      The Report makes a number of recommendations. These, together with the
        Government’s responses to them, are set out in Annexe B of the copy
        of Home Office Circular No. 54/1985 attached as an Appendix to this
        Report. To satisfy these recommendations, the Joint Officer Working
        Party has already discussed the implications with the Club Managements
        and steps have been taken to satisfy them.

 10.     It is considered that from this additional information now made available
         all reasonable steps considered necessary have been undertaken to ensure
         the safety of members of the general public at sports grounds in the
         County of South Yorkshire.

 11.     Following Mr. Justice Popplewell’s further detailed consideration of his
         findings and the production of a final report it is expected that the
         Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 will be amended and the content of
         the Green Guide modified. The effects of such changes will be reported
         to the Fire Service Committee when known.

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 54/1985
SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS
A.  COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND
    CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS - INTERIM REPORT             (Cmnd 9585)
B.  CHIEF FIRE OFFICER REPORTS


1.  The Interim Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety
and Control at Sports Grounds set up by the Home Secretary following
the events of 11 May at Brad ford City FC and Birmingham City FC has
now been published.  The purpose of this circular is, first, to
inform recipients of the recommendations of the Inquiry and the
Government's response to them; and, secondly, to urge recipients to
respond quickly and constructively to the spirit of the
recommendations in order to improve, as necessary, existing safety
and crowd control measures at sports grounds.

A.    COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS

2.  The Report concludes that the Bradford fire was caused accidentally
and comments that, had the safety advice contained in the Home Office
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) (the 'Green Guide') been
followed, the tragedy would not have occurred.  On the Birmingham City
FC incident, the Report concludes that the disorder was the product
of violence by both sets of fans to a degree which the police could
not reasonably have foreseen.

3.  Attached at Annex A is a copy of the text of the Home Secretary's
oral statement to Parliament on 24 July responding to the Inquiry's
Interim Report and at Annex B a copy of his more detailed written
statement.  The latter sets out each of the Report's recommendations,
including the provisional recommendations, and the Government's
responses to them.  All this material has been circulated to the
governing bodies of the major sports in England and Wales listed
at Annex C in the expectation that they will advise their members
to continue to co-operate by assisting in the implementation of the
Inquiry's recommendations.

4.     A number of the Report's recommendations have implications
for the responsibilities of local authorities, chief fire officers
and chief officers of police.  They are all accordingly invited to
                                                                              /consider.
                                   - 2 -




consider as a matter of urgency what steps they should take as
necessary in their particular local circumstances to give effect -
where possible in time for the start of the 1985/86 football
season - to the recommendations that relate to their responsibilities.
Although a number of the points will have already been dealt with
either as a result of the recent exercise by chief fire officers
(see Part B below) or, in the case of designated stadia, by existing
safety certificate conditions, certificating authorities are nonetheless
requested to review their certification procedures and e x i s t i n g
certificates so as to incorporate as necessary the Inquiry's interim
recommendations.  In so doing, authorities should bear in mind that
it is not considered that action upon the Inquiry's recommended
amendments to the Greei Guide should wait upon the issue of the next
edition of the Green Guide.   (This will not be prepared until after
the Final Report is received.)

5.     The specific points for consideration by the responsible
authorities are as follows:

(a )   Certificating authorities are asked to -
       (i)      ensure that the police form part of the issuing
                team for safety certificates (Recommendation 1);

       (ii)     consider inclusion of a condition within safety
                certificates for adequate first-aid facilities
                (Recommendation 8);

       (iii)    consult chief fire officers over the adequacy of
                exits at all sports grounds with the aim of
                reflecting the advice in new or existing safety
                certificates as necessary, bearing in mind
                spectator numbers to be permitted into the ground
                Or part of the ground and in the case of n o n ­
                designated grounds and the emergency procedures
                under section 10 of the 1975 Act (Recommendation 14);

       (iv)     for designated stadia, consider the feasibility of
                including a smoking prohibition as a safety
                certificate condition where stands made of
                combustible materials are in use (Recommendation 15);

       (v)      give preliminary thought to how best a sports ground
                register might be set up and used - see also
                paragraph 7 below (Recommendation 17);

       (vi)     consider with the emergency services and appropriate
                authorities the practicability and enforcement of a
                no-parking zone around sports grounds when an event
                is likely to attract significant crowds (Recommendation 4);

       (vii)    consider whether safety certificate conditions relating
                to manned exits require amplification or amendment, and
                how best to implement (e.g. protection of stewards by a
                police presence on exit gates) and ensure compliance
                (Recommendation 11);  and

       (viii)   review for inclusion in new and existing safety
                certificates suitable requirements relating to
                training and instruction of stewards (Recommendation 12).

                                                                   /(b).
                                    -   3   -




 (b )   Chief Fire Officers are asked to -

        (i)      consult and advise management of non-designated
                 sports grounds on the presence, location and
                 nature of fire-fighting equipment (using the
                 standards adopted for safety certification at
                 designated grounds as the yardstick) (Recommendation 6   );

        (ii)     by arrangement with sports grounds managers, give
                 assistance in fire-fighting training for stewards
                  (Recommendations 7, 10 and 12);

        (iii)   advise sports grounds management and local authorities
                 on the adequacy and suitability of exits at sports
                 grounds in relation to the spectator numbers
                 permitted to attend the ground or part of the
                 ground (Recommendation 14);  and

        (iv)    continue, as necessary, inspections of uncertificated
                 stadia to assess the need to restrict or prohibit for
                 reasons of fire safety the number of spectators at a
                 ground or particular part of a ground (Recommendation 16)
                 see also paragraphs 6 and 9 below.

(c )    Chief Officers of Police are asked to -

        (i)     consider how evacuation procedures    at individual
                 grounds can best be incorporated into police
                 training and form part of pre-event briefing
                 (Recommendation 1);

        (ii)    continue provision for police representation within
                 local authority teams for issuing safety certificates
                 (Recommendation 2);

        (iii)   consult the management of sports grounds where a
                 police presence is required at an event (or events)
                 for crowd control within the ground about the
                training of stewards on how best to assist the
                police in an evacuation (Recommendation 10);   and

        (iv)    consider, in collaboration with the local authority
                (see 3(a)(vii) above) and sports grounds management,
                how to assist in manning exit gates.

6.   As regards designated stadia, certificating authorities in
collaboration with chief fire officers and chief officers of police
will no doubt wish to consider whether, following the Home Office
letter on designation of 19 July to Chief Executives, the best way
to effect quickly some of the Interim Report's recommendations
(particularly where structural alterations are involved) will be to
set a lower spectator ceiling based on the normal level of attendance,
rather than the nominal maximum capacity.   Many sports grounds and
stadia which do not fall within the present scope of designation
under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 will have already been
inspected by chief fire officers.   It is hoped that supplementary
advice on such matters as fire fighting equipment, training in
fire fighting and evacuation procedures will be given to the
management and staff of sports grounds as needed in the knowledge
of the power to take emergency action where necessary.

                                                                 / 7 .
                                             -   4   -




7.     Consultations with the AMA and ACC will take place with thf-
object of determ i n i n g how best local registration of sports g r c ’ nds
might be achieved (Recommendation 17).       As for the nature of
materials used in construction of new stands (Recommendation 13),
it is suggested that building and planning authorities continue
their present practices unless and u n 1 5.1 further advice is receive: .

B.    CHIEF FIRE OFFICERS         REPORTS ON SPORTS             GROUNDS

8.     The Home S e c retary has expressed his gratitude to chief fire
officers for the prompt and efficient manner in which the survey
of sports grounds has been carried out - see Annex A.         Work on
an a l y s i n g the reports is continuing in the Home Office and a digest
of them will be submitted to the Inquiry.         The Home Secretary's
statements indicate the important results of the surveys on which
immediate action has been taken by brigades.

9.      It is a ppreciated that, in respo n d i n g to Her Majesty's Chief
Inspector of Fire Services' letter of 16 May to chief fire officers,
some brigades were only able to concentrate inspections on
u n c e r t i f i c a t e d sports stadia with accom m o d a t i o n for more than 10,000
spectat ors (i.e. which could be designated- unde^ the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975).               However, a large number of brigades in whose
area there were fewer sports grounds of this capacity were able to
extend their inspections to sports grounds with accommodation for
far fewer than 10,000 spectators.               Section 10 of the 1975 Act is
applica ble to sports grounds irrespective of the number of spectators
a c c o m mo dated and it is important that those brigades which have not
so far inspected sports grounds with accom m o d a t i o n for less than
10,000 spectators should do so as priorities and resources perr.it
so that stands which represent a serious fire hazard can be
identified and remedial action taken (Recommendation 16).

10.    An extra copy of this             circular and Annexes is attached for c h i e f
fire officers.    In view of             the provisions of s . 16 of the Local
Government Act 1985 copies               are being sent also to the Chief
E x ecutives of met r o p o l i t a n    district councils and London boroughs.

11.    Any enquiries       should       be directed      to -

      Secondly, all uncenificated grounds of the third and

addition, accommodation for spectators at the larger
cricket grounds, Rugby Union grounds, race courses,
motor racing tracks, greyhound tracks, tennis clubs and
athletics grounds has been inspected.
      Chief fire officers and firemasters have sent copies of
their findings to the management of the spons grounds
showing what remedial measures have to be taken. In
some cases, this will involve the complete closure of a
stand until rebuilding or remedial work has been
completed. In other cases, strict limits are being placed on
the number of spectators allowed into the stand. My hon.
Friend the Minister responsible for sport will be looking
further at die financial implications with the interests
 concerned in his working group on the financing of safety
 improvements. Managements have responded in a co­
 operative way and have either set necessary work in hand
 or are considering how to comply with the requirements.
 Local authorities and local fire authorities have sufficient
 statutory powers to ensure that essential fire safety
 requirements are complied with. These will in no way be
 affected by the separate proposals directed towards
  streamlining the present law on fire precautions published
 yesterday in a consultative document and which I am
  inviting the inquiry also to consider in the context of its
  work.
       My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland
  and I are grateful to chief fire officers and firemasters for
  the prompt, efficient and careful manner in which this
  survey has been carried out. A digest of the reports will
  be submitted to the inquiry.
       Thirdly, the House will, o f course, be aware o f the
   rapid passage through both Houses of the Sporting Events

   beginning o f the football season.
       Fourthly, steps have also been taken to enhance police
   effectiveness next season. In England and Wales the
   Association of Chief Police Officers has introduced a new
    system for exchanging information about the conduct of
    fans, which should assist in anticipating and preventing
    trouble. Three of the Home Office photographic vehicles
    will be a v ailab le to be deployed at football matches,
    together with two experimental high-definition tripod-
    mourned cameras. This is in addition to the £500,000
     worth of closed circuit television equipment purchased
    through funds provided by the Football Trust.

    INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS
    INTERIM REPORT JULY 1985 ( CMND 9585 )



    GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS



    GROUND MANAGEMENT

    RECOMMENDATIONS

    1.    Evacuation procedures should be a matter of police training
    and form part of the briefing by police officers before a football
    match. (Paragraph 3-9)-


    2.    The local authority team responsible for issuing safety
    certificates in respect of designated grounds should, as heretofore,
    include police officers.   (Paragraph 3-15)


    Certificating authorities and chief officers of police will be
    invited to act upon these recommendations (see also Recommendation 10).




    RECOMMENDATIONS

    6.     Those managing sports grounds not governed by safety certificates
    should give serious consideration, with the assistance of fire authorities,
    to the presence in a ground of suitable fire fighting equipment.
    (Paragraph 3-5*0


    7.     Stewards at all sports grounds should be trained in fire fighting.
    (Paragraph 3.55)

    8.     In designated grounds it should be a term of the safety certificate
    that an adequate first-aid room should be provided. (Paragraph 3.99)



                                         1
10.    Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
precautions and fire-fighting (see Recommendation 7 above) but should
also be trained in how best to help the police in evacuation.
(Paragraph 3.10*0


14.    Suitable and adequate exits should be provided in all sports
grounds. (Paragraph 3-138)
15.    No smoking should take place in combustible stands, that this
should be a condition of entry to the ground that signs tc that effect
should be prominently displayed ana this should be a condition of
entry to the ground.   (Paragraph 3-1^1)

The relevant sports authorities will be invited to draw the attention
of sports grounds managers to these re^onroendations, and certificating
authorities will be asked to consider reflecting the recommendations
in new or amended safety certificates as appropriate in the case of
designated grounds. The fire and police services will be asked to stand
ready to advise on equipment and assist with training as appropriate.




RECOMMENDATION


9.     There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety
Executive and the fire authorities and local authorities as to how best
to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and reports.
(Paragraph 3-95)

The HSE has appointed a member of it3 Executive to review liaison
arrangements between its inspectors and the fire authorities. He will
consult Government Departments and others in this review, the results of
which will be made public.




RECOMMENDATION

16.    Fire Authorities should identify and visit all sports stadia in their
areas and should prohibit or restrict the use of any stands which, in their
view, constitute a risk to spectators because of the inadequacy of the fire
precautions. (Paragraph 3.1^2)
                                   2
 Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales were invited by the Home Secretary
 on 16 May to inspect all sports grounds and were reminded of the pcwers
 available to them to take emergency action if, in their view, fire hazards
 constituting a risk to spectators are revealed. The Secretary of State
 for Scotland similarly asked Firemasters to inspect sports grounds in Scotland.
 Reports received show that fire brl^dss have not hesitated to recommend
 emergency action where necessary, including in a number of cases a prohibition
 on the use of stands or a restriction on the number of spectators allowed
 into them.




 RECOMMENDATION


17.    In order to ensure a complete record of sports grounds a
local registration system should be set up. (Paragraph 3-150)


Consultation will take place with the local authority associations to
establish how such records may best be compiled and maintained. The
recent visits of the fire brigades <see Recommendation 16) should have
in practice marshalled much of the relevant data already.




STRUCTURES

RECOMMENDATION


13-    Building of new permanent stands of combustible materials
should be prohibited as a general rule. (Paragraph 3-132)

This recommendation will be given speedy and urgent consideration
by the Departments who are responsible for building regulations.




                                3
 GREEN GUIDE

 RECOMMENDATIONS


*J.    The Green Guide should be amended to include in Paragraph 11 a
provision that, wherever practicable, roads within a quarter of a
mile of a sports ground should be kept entirely free of parked vehicles.
(Paragraph 3.35)


I-1--  Paragraph         of the Green G uid~- snould De amended to read:
"All exit gates should be manned at all times while the ground is used
by the public and be Cc.oa’c le of being opened immediately frc~n insic-'.
by anyone in an emergency.” (Paragraph 3.111)


-2 -   The Green Guide sh ou 1d be amended to contain a specific provision,
in relation to stewards,


       (1)      that they should be trained and instructed to
       deal with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation
       (see also Recommendations 7 and 10);

       (ii)    that they should be given written instructions
       about the action to be taken in cases of emergency;

       (iii)   that they should receive practical instruction
       and training appropriate to their responsibility;

       (iv)    that no one should be employed as a steward
       unless they have been so instructed and trained; and

       (v)      that they should be adequate in number, physically
      and mentally capable of performing their duties, effectively
      deployed, effectively supervised and readily identifiable.
      (Paragraph 3-117)


19.    The next edition of tne Green Guide should make it clear
that it applies to all sports grounds. (Paragraph 3.15*0
These points will be noted fcr inclusion in the next edition of the Green
Guide which will be needed after the Inquiry's final report is received.
Action will not however depend upon the availability of a fresh edition and
certificating authorities and chief officers of police (Recommendation *0
will be invited to take such steps as are open to them now.




CROWD MANAGEMENT


RECOMMENDATIONS

5.     Consideration should be given to making it a criminal offence
in England and Wales to have a smoke bomb or similar device at sports
grounds.   (Paragraph 3-^2)

22.    There should be a specific offence of throwing a missile at
sports grounds. (Paragraph 6.57)

The case for inviting Parliament to create new criminal offences on
these lines will be studied urgently in connection with the Government's
intention of introducing legislation in the next session of Parliament
following its r-view of the law relating to public order.




RECOMMENDATIONS

20.   Urgent consideration should be given by football clubs in
England and Wales to introducing membership system so as to exclude
visiting fans. (Paragraph 6.^8)

23.   Football clubs should review their arrangements for entry and
the organisation of their turnstiles.    (Paragraph 6.62)

Both these recommendations are for football authorities and clubs, but the
Government hopes that they will be given serious consideration. The
Government has been encouraging the Football Association and the Football
League to introduce a scheme of membership cards and the options are currently


                                   5
 being considered in a Footbsjl League working group: that group's
 attention will therefore be drawn to the Inquiry's Peoccroendjtion 20.
 The governing bodies' attention will *1 r: be draw:- to Recommendation 23

MISCELLANEOUS


RECOMMENDATIONS


3.    Early attention should be given ty th-; Hone Office Directorate
of Telecommunications to consider the practicality of producing a more
suitable personal radio for the police. (Farscranh *.?')

18.    Consideration should be given as hov best to deal with temporary
stands and marquees   (Paragraph 3-151)

24.   Consideration should be given to the design of a standard,
efficient perimeter fence, with proper e;:its. (Paragraph 6.63)

Each of these will be studied as the Inquiry advises. Recommendations
18 and 2^ may best be taken forward in the context of the Inquiry's next
stage and when it turns to examine the Green Guide as a whole.
PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS


(To be reviewed in the Final Report)

1.     I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should
be given the unfettered right of search before entry to football grounds by
statute.'   (Paragraph

2.    I am m i n d e d to reconmend that Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971
should be amended with a view to giving the Fire Authority power in cases other
than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional    (Paragraph 3.61)

3.     Linked with the above, I am   winded to recommend that consideration
should be given to introducing legislation giving powers for the Fire Authority
to apply to the High Court for an injunction (or to the Court of Session for
a n interdict in Scotland) under Section 30 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
(Paragraph 3-61)

U.     I am m i n d e d to recommend that Section 10 of the Safety at Sports Grounds
Act 1975 should be amended in like manner to Section 10 of the Fire Precautions
Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations 2 and 3) and an application to the
High Court for an injunction (cr to the Court of Session for an interdict in
Scotland) should be an alternative remedy. (Paragraph 3-76)

5.     I am m i n d e d to recommend that the Secretary of State shou11 exercise his
powers to designate all sports grounds, whatever their size to include indopr
as well as outdoor activities. (Paragraph 3-1^5)

6.    I am minded to recommend immediate designation of any ground
capable of holding over 5,000 spectators, to cover all sports grounds,
not merely football grounds.   (Paragraph 3.1^6)

7.     I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to
providing the police with additional powers of arrest under the
Public Order Act, 1936. (Paragraph 6.66)

8.     I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to
creating a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse
at a sports ground. (Paragraph 6.67)

These are noted and the Government will stand by to assist the
Inquiry in its further consideration of the matters.

        JOINT REPORT OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE,                       FIRE SERVICE COMMITTEE
        THE CHIEF F IRE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF                      8ch SEPTEMBER, 1983
        CONSTABLE

                                SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

 1.     Background

 1.1    The Committee will recall that the County Council's powers and duties under
        this Act are delegated to this Committee.  On 8th January, 1976, the
        Committee decided that any necessary detailed investigation should be
        undertaken by Officer Working Parties for each of the four Borough Council
        areas.  These Officer Working Parties consist of representatives of the
        Fire Service, the Police, the Building Inspectors of the Borough Council,
        co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of Administration.

1.2    Whilst it is Parliament's intention that all sports grounds which have
       accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators should be subject to the
       provisions of the Act eventually, the only grounds designated by the Secretary
       of State to date as requiring General Safety Certificates from the appropriate
       County Council have been certain "International" grounds and those of clubs
       in the First and Second Divisions of the Football League.

2.     Position in South      Yorkshire

2.1    The Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. was
  >    designated by the Secretary of State as requiring to apply to the County
        Council for a General Safety Certificate by 1st January, 1979.  Following
        detailed investigations by the Officer Working Party for the Sheffield
       District, the Certificate was granted on 21st December, 1979, after approval
       by the Committee.

2.2    The Officer Working Parties for the four Districts have also given informal
       advice on a continuing basis, on request, to the remainder of the football
       league Clubs in South Yorkshire.

2.3    Following their promotion to the Second Division of the Football League, the
       Barnsley Football  Club Ltd. and the Rotherham United Football Club Ltd. were
       designated by the Secretary of State as requiring to apply to the County
       Council for a General Safety Certificate by 1st January, 1982 (as reported to
       the Committee on 3rd September, 1981).

2.4    The two Clubs did so, but have taken rather longer than they anticipated to
       carry out the works required to meet the provisions of the Act in view of
       certain development and re-development proposals which the Clubs had in mind.
       Naturally, the Clubs were reluctant to incur expenditure on their Grounds
       if these proposals were to be put into effect.  It should be pointed out that
       the Act does not specify a time limit for consideration of an application
       for a General Safety Certificate once the application has been formally made.

3.     General Safety Certificates

3.1    On 30th November, 1978, the Committee approved a draft General Safety
       Certificate as the basis for the standard certificate to be used throughout
       the County.

3.2    The General Safety             Certificate granted to the Sheffield Wednesday Football
       Club Ltd. on 21st             December, 1979, was based on the standard certificate with
       additions to meet             the particular conditions at the Hillsborough Stadium.   The
       Committee decided             on 14th January, 1930 not to make any charge for the
       Certificate after             referring the matter to Policy Advisory Sub-Committees 'A'
       and 1B '.

3.3    Experience gained since the granting of the Sheffield Wednesday General
       Safety Certificate showed the desirability of incorporating two minor
       amendments to the standard certificate and, on 3rd September, 1981, the
       Committee agreed to the Standard Certificate being amended so as to
       incorporate the two suggested minor amendments.

3.4    All of the required works at the Barnsley and Rotherham Grounds have been
       carried out or will be completed shortly and drafts of the Certificates in
       respect of the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club Ltd. and the
       Millmoor Ground of the Rotherham United Football Club Ltd. are attached for
       the Committee's consideration.  These are, of course, based on the standard
       South Yorkshire General Safety Certificate previously approved by the
       Committee.

3.5    The Committee is also requested to consider the question of whether a fee
       should be charged for the Certificates in view of the earlier decision of
       14th January, 1980, that no charge should be made to the Sheffield Wednesday
       Football Club Ltd. for the General Safety Certificate in respect of the
       Hillsborough Stadium.

4.     Recommendation

          (i)       That the General Safety Certificates now submitted in respect of the
                    Oakwell Ground, Barnsley, and the Millmoor Ground, Rotherham, be
                    approved, and that the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Committee
                    be authorised to agree any amendments necessary should any of the
                    requirements of the Certificates not be able to be complied with by the
                    actual date of issue, such amendments not reducing the overall level of
                    safety to be required at either ground.
          (ii)      That the Committee make a decision as to whether a charge should be
                    made to the Barnsley Football Club Ltd. and the Rotherham United
                    Football Club Ltd. for their General Safety Certificates.

3.2   The General Safety                           Certificate granted to the Sheffield Wednesday Football
       Club Ltd. on 21st                           December, 1979, was based on the standard certificate
       additions to meet                           the particular conditions at the Hillsborough Stadium.   T e
       Committee decided                           on 14th January, 1980 not to make any charge for the    ^ ^
       Certificate after                           referring the matter to Policy Advisory Sub-Committees A
       and 1B 1.

3.3   Experience gained since the granting of the Sheffield Wednesday General
       Safety Certificate showed the desirability of incorporating two minor
       amendments to the standard certificate and, on 3rd September, 1981, the
       Committee agreed to the Standard Certificate being amended so as to
       incorporate the two suggested minor amendments.

3.4   All of the required works at the Barnsley and Rotherham Grounds have been
       carried out or will be completed shortly and drafts of the Certificates in
       respect of the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club Ltd. and the
       Millmoor Ground of the Rotherham United Football Club Ltd. are attached for
       the Committee's consideration.  These are, of course, based on the standard
       South Yorkshire General Safety Certificate previously approved by the
       Committee.

3.5   The Committee is also requested to consider the question of whether a fee
       should be charged for the Certificates in view of the earlier decision of
       14th January, 1980, that no charge should be made to the Sheffield Wednesday
       Football Club Ltd. for the General Safety Certificate in respect of the
       Hillsborough Stadium.

4.    Recommendation

        (i)            That the General Safety Certificates now submitted in respect of the
                       Oakwell Ground, Barnsley, and the Millmoor Ground, Rotherham, be
                       approved, and that the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Committee
                       be authorised to agree any amendments necessary should any of the
                       requirements of the Certificates not be able to be complied with by
                       actual date of issue, such amendments not reducing the overall level
                       safety to be required at either ground.
        (ii)           That the Committee make a decision as to whether a charge should be
                       made to the Barnsley Football Club Ltd. and the Rotherham United
                       Football Club Ltd. for their General Safety Certificates.

                     S A F E T Y O F SPORTS G R O U N D S ACT, 1975

        Background

1.      A& the Committee will, recall, the County Council's powers and duties under the               ;
        Aek&re-pai^a^tMfc               s                    Oft 8th January,19'76, the Co m m i ttee i
        decided that their functions should be exercised through Officer Working Parties
        for the four Borough Council areas, consisting of representatives of the Police,
        the Fire Service and the Building Inspectors of the Borough Councils, with
        co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of Administration.

2.      Whilst it is Parliament's intention that all sports grounds should come under
        the Act eventually, the only grounds designated by the Secretary of State up to
         recently had been First Division grounds and certain international grounds.
         Following representations by the County Council, the Hillsborough Stadium of the
        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club has now been designated by the Secretary of
        State on the basis of its quasi-international use.

        General Safety Certificate

3.1     The Officer Working Party has been considering in detail the terms and conditions
        which they feel should be attached to a General Safety Certificate.

3.2     The following recommendation is submitted for the Committee's consideration:

                That the draft General Safety Certificate now attached be
                approved as the basis for the standard certificate to be
                used throughout the County.




        Fee

4*1.    Thm.leads, oiv ta the question .of the fee to be charged to applicants for General
        Safety- CTe^ilifeatesv^ The K ‘
                                      egmlafiOTB»stfpE^Me*€hat % loeal authority may determine                   1
        the fees to be charged in respect of applications for the issue or amendments of
         safety certificates, but that such fees shall not exceed an amount commensurate
        with the work actually and reasonably done. H ome Office Circular No. 130/76
         referring to this, expresses the view that local authorities should, in the normal
        course,not find it necessary to charge fees representing more than 17 man/days'
        work per certificate.

4..2.   The fees 'cbarged', by the ioealVatrtto^leaiwfeQiiaire issaed Certificates to date ■                     i
       range from no charge at all by the Nottinghamshire County Council to an
       average of £4, 000 by the Greater London Council.

4. 3   There would appear to be five options open to the Committee, as follows:

       (i)     to charge no fee at all                           ?
       (ii)    to charge a purely nominal fee
       (iii)    to charge a fee which is a purely arbitrary figure (i.e. not related to
                any specific number of man/days' work)
       (iv)     to charge a fee related to the H o m e Office estimate of 17 man/days'work
       (v)      to charge a fee based on the actual number of man/days' work.

       In the event of the Committee deciding on option (v), the charge for 17 man/days'
       work (without including any element of clerical support or supervisory staff) has
       been currently costed at £850.     This figure would need to be up-dated, of course,
       to take salary increases, etc., into account as necessary. In the event of the
       Committee deciding on option (v), the fee could not, of course, be determined
       until all of the work has been completed.

4.4    Whilst the City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council has yet to make a
       decision as to the basis of charge for work undertaken by its Building Surveyors,
       it is likely that any decision taken will be influenced by whether the County Council
       makes, say, a purely nominal charge or a full economic charge.

4.5    The Committee's instructions as to the fee to be charged are requested.

       Powers of Entry and Inspection'

5.1    The Act provides that the County Council, the appropriate District Council and
       the Chief Constable are empowered to authorise entry of their officers to sports
       stadia for the purpose of making inspections.

5.2    The following recommendation is submitted for the Committee's consideration:

                That the Chief Executive for the time being be authorised to
                issue formal authorisations to the requisite officers under the
                Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, to enable them to exercise
                the powers of entry and inspection specified in the Act.

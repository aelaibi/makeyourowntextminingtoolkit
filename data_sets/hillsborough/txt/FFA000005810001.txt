     clubs and their support ora are concerned.  The proposed scheme
     should, therefor®/ b® introduced only if it it certain, or at
     least likely, that these diaadvantages are outweighed by its
     benefits.  Xa our view, they are not. It la proposed to

     .Danger of congestion

     7. 3.   The PA and The Football League have appointed the

      of the eatabliahment of a national membership scheme. Their
      initial report is appended.    (Annex K) The Minister for
      Sport has stated that the Government will not sanction the
 Upintrodttotlon of a scheme until such time aa it is clear that
      the necessary technology exists to ensure its successful
      implementation.   In our view, a successful implementation must
      entail an assurance that the public can be admitted to grounds
      without undue additional delays. It ia the view of the
      Government that there should be a central computerised registry
      of members and that membership cards should be computer read at
      the point of entry to the ground. Our concern, which must be
      deepened following Hillsborough, is that the time taken to read
    jeaoh card and to deal with invalid or defective cards will add
    I intolerable waiting times to those already experienced.
   I Appended to this submission, (Annex L), is a study conducted
      by Arthur^Young^ at the Littl©woods Cup replay between Arsenal
      and Liverpool on 9th November, 1988, when between 3 , 0 0 0 and
      5, 000 people were locked out of a full Highbury Stadium and the
      kick-off was delayed for 30 minutes.    The conclusion that
                    have drawn from the queuing model forming part of
      their study is that the absolute maximum additional admission
I Jfeime that can be       coped with forthe    processing of each
* ^Membership card,if the fans are to be admitted on time, is two
      seconds.                are currently evaluating the proposals
      that they have received from a short-list of companies asked to
     bid for the provision of the technology required for the
     implementation of the national membership scheme.     While it ia
     too early to judge whether the companies will be able to meet
     this two second requirement, it is certain that no system has
     been tried and tested to these standards in the real
     environment of a football match.     A further concern is the very
     real possibility of malfunctions in the computer system itself.

          t»oaa of the woccasional* supporter

           7.4.           The game'a objection to the proposed 100% compulsory
           scheme is that it make* no provision for those who do not wish,
           for one reason or other, to join a club scheme. An independent
           survey conducted by Target Group Index in 1905, showed that
           5, 700,000 that S. 7 million people attended at leaat one
           football match during the course of a season. This survey
           appears a« part of the 7A submission to the Prime Minister,
           appended ae AnnexJ to thie document. A Mori poll, quoted in
           the, Peat Warwick Mcldntock report referred to below (paragraph
i,         7. 6. ) indicated that 25% of football spectators attend four or
           fewer matches per seas on.     (Annex M) It is our contention

           joining a compulsory scheme that will require them to complete
           a form, Identify themselves and provide photographs together
          with a membership fee. £zhe Government looks to football to
          produce a workable scheme, but it will insist on the procedures
          outlined in the laat sentence^

          Hooliganism in grounds not the main problem

       7.   We have already shown that hooliganism within grounds is   r J:
      on the decrease.   The Government's scheme could only act to
      prevent known hooligans from gaining entry to stadia.   It could
      not prevent trouble away from grounds.   It could not, for
      example, prevent 250 English and Scottish youths from engaging
      in rowdyism in the streets of Glasgow on the occasion of the
      recent England v Scotland match. It oould not prevent trouble
      on motorway service stations.   It could not prevent dashes
      between supporters on ferries going to the continent.   To
      exclude the tiny minority of trouble-makers from grounds, where
% J^fchey are already well contained, 99. 97% of the total support
  w w h o according to the arrest figures quoted in paragraph
      above, are blameless, will be forced to join a scheme they d d
     not want to join and put to inconvenience and possibly, as
     suggested, into danger.

              (iv) The whole ground is restricted to members of tha
    home club: three cluba have introduced suoh a system: Luton
    Town# Colchester United and Torquay United.



           Luton Town PC has     undoubtedly achieved a significant
    decrease in crowd problems at its ground.   Since the
    introduction home members only in 1986, the number of arrests                •CvQ.!rcvi
    reported within tha stadium has fallen from 55 to 1. The       ‘
    scheme is, however, deeply unpopular with other clubs and
     articularly with their supporters.   The geographical situation
     f the Luton Town ground makes it relatively easy for the
    police to deny access to the vicinity to away supporters.   This
    oould not be achieved at most of the Football League grounds.
    The club la also able to identify reasonably well its catchment
    area and exclude from membership people applying from outside
    the district.   This oould not be made to work in parts of the
    country where clubs are close together - such as in the big
    cities - nor does it take into account the phenomenon of cluba
    such as Manchester United and Liverpool, that draw their
    support from all over the country.

      7. 8. It was widely publicised by the originators of the
      Luton Town plan that they expected to attract back to the game
      many lapsed supporters who no longer attended because of the
      fear of hooliganism.  Since the members only system was
      introduced, gates at the club's matches have fallen by 14%
      (average 11,062 in 1985-86 to average 9, S04 in 1988-89). This
      is during a period in which the club has enjoyed unparalleled
      success, winning the Littlewoods Cup, making three other
      Wembley appearances and reaching the FA Cup semi-final.

\     7. 9. Colchester United followed Luton Town's example at the
      start of the 1987-88 season, but found that their gates also
      dropped dramatically, falling from an average 2,700 in season
      1986-87 to an average 1,800 in season 1987-88. There were,
      however, no arrests on the club's ground in season 1987-88.
      The club has subsequently reduced its membership and allowed in
      away supporters. ‘
      7. 10. Torquay United have had a 100% membership scheme thrust
      upon them because of the small capacity of the ground.   The
      area set aside for visiting supporters can only take 300 and,
      with well-supported clubs such as Wolverhampton Wanderers and
      Cardiff City sharing the Fourth Division with them, they were
      unable to cope with an away contingent.   In season 1989-90,
      there are no clubs in the Fourth Division with very large
      travelling support.   The club will seriously consider the
      readmission of visiting fans.

      General trend
      7, 11. The general trend ia clear. Club membership is rising.
      By the end of season 1987-88 , the number of persons in
i   ^toembership with Football League clubs was 604, 600. There is a
       rowing t^ex^k towards restricting parts of grounds to
      m e m b e r s 8^ o f the 92 League clubs have-gartfSX home
      membership schemes.       As seen above, only Luton Town and Torquay
      United exclude away supporters.       Oni^u&we clubs restrict
      visiting supporters to members onlyT
     7. 12, Membership, to be attractive to the public, must entail

      forced to join or need to ibt a member to got into the grounds) ,
      illustrate what can be achieved through a close identification
      of olub with community.   The Football Trust has instituted a
      Community Relations Award Competition for clubs, with cash
      prises for the more enterprising schemes. In its first year,
      Millwall and Preston North Bad shared the main prise.   These

            9.       G5TTIN0 THE PUBLIC INTO GROUNDS EARLIER


            9. 1. It has become a tendency since Hillsborough for the
            police to insist upon the delay of kiek-offa when there has
            been a build-up of supporters outside grounds close to the
            scheduled start of a match. This is understandable, but is

            Klearly unacceptable in the long-term,  if it becomes the rule
             ather than the exception for matches to be delayed, the effect
             will simply be to enoourage people to come later rather than
            earlier.  The fears expressed in paragraph 7. 3. about further
            delays caused by the need to verify membership cards make it
            even more imperative for a means to be found of persuading the
            public to come to grounds earlier.

            9. 2. The FA and The Football League are looking closely at the
            question' of encouraging supporters into grounds earlier through
            the provision of improved pre-match entertainment.   It has to
            be stated, however, that experience in this area indicates that
            fans are rarely impressed by the type of entertainment that has

         football as one of the moat progressive cluba ia its attempts
         to create a family atmosphere at its matohe*, i® a regular
         provider of pre-match entertainment. A letter from
         the club' a Chief Executive, is appended.     (Annex P) The club
         would normally expect to provide entertainment before ©very
         match.   This year, however, it wasi decided, following
         Hillsborough, to suspend the programme for the rest of the
         season as a mark of respect. Prior to that, a variety of
         eatertaliMMnta had h m n . provided before tfeirtiMa matohaa. A
         brief quote from M^-Pluaday*■ letter is sufficient.      “I have
         never been under the impreeeion that pre-match entertainment
         has encouraged supporter* to come any earlier or that it
         attracts additional support. Nevertheless, whilst the
         entertainment ia in progress it i» fair to say that it adds to
       _ the spectators' pre-occupation prior to the game commencing."

           Of course, the problems posed by the British winter cannot be
           ignored in this context.  At certain times of the year, pitches
           are simply not capable of talcing extra wear prior to games.  It
           ia usually acceptable, however, even in adverse weather
           conditions, to stage some form of football related event - for
           example, a penalty competition - in a corner of the pitch where
           there is more grass.

           9. 5. It is the view of The PA and The Football League that the
           provision of adequate refreshment facilities is the single most
           important factor for the public in deciding at what time they
           arrive at a ground.  The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol,
           etc) Act, 1985, introduced with the very best of intentions,
           has, unfortunately, had the opposite effect from that intended.
           A football ground has never been the place for someone with
           serious intentions of getting himself drunk. There is simply
           not enough time to queue at the bar, obtain and consume
           sufficient alcohol.




                                                          -   30-
      However, because of the undoubted fact that football
      hooliganism was drink related, the conclusion was drawn that,
      if you stopped people from drinking at football matches, you
      would eradicate drunkenness among football supporters.   This
      view was widely held and was supported by The FA sad-Th*
     -PqotbaM League^
            —      „           •

      In fact, events have proved that th* view was ill-conceived*
      The standard practice now, among those who take moderate
      amounts, as well aa those who consume too much, is either to
      buy alcohol in supermarket or off-licences and drink it in the
      street, or to stay in the pub until the last minute. The net
      effect is potentially lethal.    Large numbers of people, soma
      the worse for drink, arrive late and in a hurry to get into
      games.  Tha police prefer to get supporters into grounds early,
      where they can be properly policed.    They will only go
     Ivoluntarily into grounds at a reasonable time if they can have
      something palatable to eat - and drink. The prohibition on the
      consumption of alcohol on trains and in coaches going to
      football matches has resulted in more and more people
      travelling to matches in private vehicles.    The hired mini-bus
      has become particularly popular.    The number of special trains
      bringing Liverpool supporters to the last three semi-finals at
      Hillsborough in which the club has featured has been, in
      chronological order, 13, 3 and 1. A greater load is thus
      thrown onto the road system and the police have greater
      difficulty in obtaining intelligence about the movement of
     supporters.   The FA a n d The Football League r e c o m m e n d ,
     t h e r e f o r e , that the S p o r t i n g Eve n t s    (Control ot Alcohol,             etc)

     this last recoamendation, because it is apparent that, while, it
     is illegal to conaumei alcohol on coaches going to games os
     coming from games, there ia nothing at present to stop drivers
     from taking their passengers to public houses on the way, other
     than the said clause, which makes it an offence for someone to
     ba drunk in a vehicle, but places no onus on the driver to
     ensure that this ia observed. The Act is appended.    (Annex Q)

     Shared grounds
       9.       6. Of course, all clubs aim to provide the best possible
       general facilities for their supporters, within the club*s
       financial capabilities.   This means comfortable accommodation,
.,;j»k^^easy access, adequate car-parking, clean and efficient, toilets
 !> {^pfor both sexes and much more, in addition to the ability to buy
       reasonably priced, wholesome food and drink. Many clubs,
       however, find themselves in geographical locations where it is
       practically impossible for meaningful improvements to be made.
       Others share catchment areas in which two costly to maintain
       stadia on prime development sites make no commercial sense
       whatsoever.

     Many of these clubs would undoubtedly benefit from a move to an
     area providing better communications, better parking and,
     perhaps, shared use of facilities. £many clubs spring
     immediately to mind as candidates: The Bristol clubs, one of
     whom has no current home, Fulham and Brentford, Blackburn and
     Preston, Bolton and Bury, Rochdale and Oldham, Leeds and
     Bradford, Chester and Vfrexham, Stoke City and Port Vale,
     Huddersfield Town and Halifax, Watford and Luton Town, Enfield
     and Barnet. There is resistance.    Supporters do not like
     leaving their traditional home ground, as the experience of
   ^Khariton Athletic - playing on Crystal Palace's ground, but
   ^Rixious to return to their former ground - has shown.    There ia
     also the resistance of many local authorities to the granting
     of the necessary planning permission for new grounds. We
     recommend that local authorities rethink this negative
     attitude.

    In contrast, we have the experience of countries such as Ztaly
    where big clubs such as AC Milan and Internationale Milano
    share a'stadium with no perceiveable problems, in our own
    country, Scunthorpe United have provided the only recent
    example of a Football League club moving to a purpose built
    stadium.  Walsall are currently building a new stadium.  Such
new ground* can be custom built to provide all o£ the
incentive* fox the oustomar to coma early that we have
mentioned above. Central and local government should be
encouraged to assist ia tha construction of these new ground#.

10. 1, The FA and Tha Football League hava been actively
promoting a rapid growth in tha provision of family seotions
within football grounds. The FA employs an officer whose
s p a d fie function this is. Tha Football league has recently
held a seminar on Family initiatives that was well attended by
tha professional clubs. A report of the seminar is appended.
(Annex R) It shows that 34 of tha 92 Football Leagua clubs
operate family areas.     Tha FA has a family enclosure at all of
its International matches at Wembley and at tha FA Charity
Shield match. Children are admitted, accompanied by adults, at
reduced prices and spacial aat«artainment and incentives are
provided.

10. 2,    The FA and T h a Football League will build on this
founds cion by ensuring better communication with supporter a in
goners 1 . 1 They are a l r e a d y consulting organisations with
re l evant E x p er ie nc e in the area of customer r e l a t i o n s , with a
view to establishing an effective system of supporter liaison.
They already hold regular meetings with the existing
supporters' organisations.



11.   EDUCATION

11. 1. Tha FA spends a large amount aach year on its educational
programme. In the financial year 1988, the amount was.
SI, 181, 440, made up of the cost of running courses and The
National Football School, and of supporting the FA Youth Trust
and the FA National Sports Centre Trust, Since 1982, when fUr
Bobby Robson was appointed as National Coach, The FA has
stepped 'up the marketing of its coaching and other educational
activities, with the result that the numbers attending courses
have risen from 18, 524 in 1982 to 210, 809 in 1988.

     11.2. Much of this increase is accounted for by tha
     introduction of teaching and leisure programme* for young
     people.   M l of these activities contain a strong emphasis on
     behaviour, discipline and personal responsibility.   A code of
     conduct produced for young paopls attending PA course is
     appended.    (Annex S) The PA has initiated an inner-city
     coaching programme for youths who are either criminal offenders
     or "at risk*. A pilot scheme in Birmingham has already been
     tested and the project will be extended to other areas with
     inner-city problems.

Dear Sirs
                                             HILLSBOROUGH

     We enclose herewith a further bundle of Statements from
supporters which have accumulated at our offices over the last 2
weeks. We have perused the Statements wherever possible and do
not consider that those perused raise any fresh evidence, although
having contacted several of the makers of the Statements, we
understand that they wish them to be submitted to the Inquiry in
any event.

        We also enclose two letters passed to our clients by
Liverpool Football Club, the first being a letter dated 5th
January from Manchester United Football Club and the second being
a letter from Carlisle United dated 11th January. Given the
contents of the police evidence as to the previous behaviour of
Liverpool supporters, we feel it only fair that these letters
should be placed before the Inquiry and given whatever relevance
his Lordship thinks fit. We understand that there may be further
letters forthcoming and we shall, of course, endeavour to place
before the Inquiry as quickly as possible.


                                         Yours faithfully,

STATEMENT OF


Usually I travel to football matches by coach but on Saturday
April 15th I travelled to Wadsley Bridge, Sheffield by special
train which left Lime Street at 11.10 am.  On arrival in Sheffield
we were led to the ground by mounted police.

Judging by the crowds already in the area I thought the stadium
would already be filling up and that it may be difficult to find
a good viewing position.     However although it se.p.m.ed that we had
arrived late I saw that many coaches were only just arriving after
us.   Supporters were grouped into two columns, on the left side
of the road were the coach and car passengers and on my side,
the right, were the train passengers. On the right side I saw
only two pubs open, there were also people trying to buy tickets.
Just before reaching the ground I saw police officers instructing
 fans to dispose of alcohol in the gutters, this is the usual
procedure at matches.    Although some had been drinking, the majority
just went straight into the ground.     At the time I reached the
turnstiles there was no crowds or queues so I just walked in.        My
ticket was taken as I entered 'B' turnstile.       The time was
possibly before 2.30 pm.     Inside there were no stewards to direct
us.   I walked straight down the tunnel to the central area behind
the goal.   The section was about 2/3 full at this time and I took
up position in the m iddle behind the right side goal post.       It was
now about 20 minutes to kick-off.     I remember a beach ball being
thrown around by the crowd, the atmosphere was normal.        The wing
 sections were about half full while the central section filled up
when the players came out to warm up.     A r ound five minutes to kick
off the crush became unbearable.     At this point people were
shouting to those at the back to move back and also to police
officers and a steward to open the gate and by doing so relieve
the pressure.   I saw a police officer look away, ignoring the pleas
from the crowd.   Three lads climbed the fence and at least one
was pushed back into the crowd.     I saw the lads explaining to the
officer w hat was happening.    The officer did nothing.     The crush
was so bad it was diff ic u lt to breathe and impossible to move
from the neck down.   Mor e and more people climbed over the front
and sides of the terrace and at the back others were lifted to
safety.   Police formed a cordon across the pitch to prevent a
pitch invasion.   Many would not look at the crowd but instead
they looked towards the forest end.     They must have heard the shouts
for help yet still did nothing.     I even saw police looking on as
a supporter gave heart massage to a dying man.       Liverpool supporters
were lifting people to safety over the barriers and also kicking
in the fences to get at the fans easier.       I saw an ambulance woman
who seemed to be telling the lads not to kick in the fencing but
they explained to her and then policemen joined in tearing at the
fences.   By this time the small gate (hatch) had been opened also.
A man with glasses d ir ectly in front of me was crushed against the
barrier and was bent double in pain.     One or two were passed
overhead to the pitch.   The fence had been pulled open, there was no
cutting gear used on it at all.      Police dived in tolift the injured
Sut and the doors at the back were opened.     Some of the dead were
taken out the back, although at the time I thought that       many of the
injured had only fained.   There   was now space and 1was able to mo\e
to the dividing fence on the left of the terrace.          er^aVT^crot^out
and belongings scattered all over the terrace.       ,eY ® n    J L
on to the pitch and saw money scattered all around the goal and
people wit h coats over their heads.    I saw no hooliganism but at
stage I saw a photographer attacked and a steward who needed a police
escort of three office?* away from the area.     Fans charged towards
the forest end because of the taunts but soon came to their senses
and stonoed.   Everybody was very emotional and it was understandable
that man y grown men were in tears.    I saw no fans stealing or
attacking officers.   I.left the ground the same way I had entered
and arrived back at Lime Street at 8.00 p.m.

     Statement of


     I travelled to the match by Amberline Coach which left
County Road, Liverpool at 11.00 a.m.  We travelled to Sheffield
via the M62 and Ml and experienced large traffic jams.  When
we turned-off the Ml to go to Sheffield we were stopped by police
who searched the coach for alcohol and to ensure that everyone
had a ticket for the match.  The officer told us that anyone
smelling of alcohol would not be allowed into the stadium.

      When I have been to Sheffield before the coach after
leaving the Ml, turns left at the large roundabout down the
Halifax Road for about 2 miles until you reach the football
ground.   However, we did about an Qh mile detour and came
towards the Leppings Lane turnstile area from the River Don
side.   During the detour I saw lots of pubs open and fans drinking
outside them.   When the coach finally parked-up it was about
1.45 p.m. and we were about a 5 minute walk from the ground.

     My friend wanted to. go *st-rra-i-ght into the ground but I
said it was too early.  We saw fans with drink purchased
from the Gateway Supermarket but when we got there police
were stopping people going in.

     Near to the ground was a small pub that was closed but
you could hear people inside - some fans knocked on the doer
but were told it was full-up.  The police said all pubs were
closed by the ground but they weren't in 1988 all the pubs
were closed.  I saw some fans who looked drunk but the vast
majority were sober or in high spirits.

     At about 2.35 p.m./2.4 0 p.m. we went to get in. We had
terrace tickets but we ended-up queuing at the West Stand
turnstiles.  A steward told us we were in the wrong place.
We saw a youngster with a number of people about 8 climb onto
the dividing wall between the West Stand and Terrace turnstiles ^
and into the ground.  No police or stewards attempted to stop him.

      We left the West Stand queue and went to the terrace queuing
area - it was packed and we could hear screaming and shouting.
The crush was so bad we mo v e d to the side wall by the River Don.
I cli mb e d onto the outer perimeter gate to escape the crush but
was told to get down by police.     A gap a p peared in the crowd
and I jumped down and made my way out into Leppings Lane and stood
by the road over the River Don.     I said to my friend that we
should wait until kick-off before attempting to get in.       I saw
a police officer standing next to a c ameraman on the wall near the
junction with the turnstile area.     It looked as though he was
filming what was going on at the turnstiles but as soon as the
gate open e d both cameraman and policemen stepped down onto the
ground.

     The crushing outside the turnstile seemed to get worse as
it came nearer to kick-off time.  A policewoman by me said
"God, I've never seen anything like it".  I said they shou     o
something about it before someone is killed - she just ignore    me.
     My friend said to me they were opening the gates.           I
noticed that the cameraman appeared to stop filming the crowd.
We watched for a minute or so as fans went through the gate
and the crowd t h m n e d - o f f .  People were running around to get
through the gate.      We then ran down and ran through the gate
and went through to the West Stand area.           There were about
2,500 people behind us.           Two Police on horses were shouting
at people stop rushing as they w o u l d all get in.       We made our
way to the side terrace - not many others did.

     When we got to the side terrace there was a corner to
Liverpool and Beardsley hit the cross-bar.   People must have
heard the roar outside because shortly after I noticed people
trying to get onto the pitch by climbing over the fence.   The
fence dividing the central terrace section from the North-West
terracing looked as if it was going to collapse such was the
crush.  I said to my friend it was another Heysel.

     The police appeared to beckon the first supporters to climb
onto the fence to go back into the pens.    When on the pitch I
was looking around to sfe'e'Tf ft^re was anyone I knew injured
I noticed  that some police did help though in trying to
resuscitate supporters but others just stood and watched.    It
took 20 minutes for the ambulances to arrive and I could only see
one oxygen tank.   Hundreds of police appeared from the North Stand/
Kop corner and stood across the pitch - there were hardly any
police at our end.

     The differences between this years semi-final and the
one in 1988 seemed to me that the police were better organised
in 1988 - there were more of them outside the ground and they
made sure people had tickets and controlled the Liverpool
supporters really well, without any trouble.

     This year they were a disgrace and had no control of the
crowd simply because there weren't enough police at the Leppings
Lane end to stop drunken supporters and fans without tickets
from getting in, which could have prevented the crushing and
the gates having to be opened.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Statement of
age
of




I was already in Sheffield as I had been staying with my girl -
friend.

I walked to the ground at about 1.50pm/ 2 .0 0 p m . There weren't
many people around and those who were did not cause any trouble.       I
saw an off-licence that was open and crowded.       I looked for a pub
that was open but the two I passed were both closed.

I arrived into Leppings Lane via the River Don side of the ground.
It seemed quite crowded.  I bought a paper from the shop by the
ground.  I made my way to the North Stand turnstiles, there was
a bit of a crush getting through the outer gates.  There was a
form a queue outside the turnstiles but this had not been enforced
by the police.  There was a crush by the turnstiles.  I do not
recall seeing police outside the turnstiles or on the outer gates.
There did not seem to be a major police presence.

It took about 5 minutes to get in and I got to my seat about 2.10pm.
It was located on the Kop side of the half-way line.  I had a
good view of the Leppings Lane terraces and as soon as I was in
the ground I could see the central pens were almost full.  The
side pens were almost empty.

When the match kicked-off I noticed a line of police against the •
perimeter fencing behind the goal.  I saw people being pulled into
the stand above the terrace and climbing over fences.  I gained the
impression that the police were seeking to contain the fans rather
than get them out.  The St. Johns Ambulance Brigade and the fans
seemed to be reacting to the problem - the police seemed more
concerned about possible trouble.

At about 3.30pm I saw the first body being carried away on an
advert hoarding carried by supporters.  A police jacket covered the
face. I counted another nine.

Another group of police arrived and they formed a line in front
of the North^Stand.  Fans in the North Stand, became very irate -
an ambulance was already behind the goal when they did this so they
must have known how serious.the situation was.   "Why don't you
help" shouted fans.  Distressed andinjured supporters on the pitch
were tapping them on their backs and pointing to the West Stand
terraces and asking them to go and help.

The goal net at the West Stand end was taken by fans and police to
allow better access.  The Forest fans began jeering.  They may have
thought people were committing acts of vandalism whilst others were
dying.
                               -   2   -




About 50/100 Liverpool fans then ran down towards the kop end but
they were stopped by the police.

The police in front of the North Stand then moved across the pitch
to re-inforce that line.  A small space was left for people to get
through.  I thought it was a hindrance to the rescue operation.

About 4.15pm it was announced that the game was abandoned but
would fans stay calm.  When we left the ground we saw 2 ambulances
outside.

                       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

STATEMENT OF




I went to the match on an Amberline coach which left Liverpool

at approximately 10.30 a.m.     We experienced very few traffic

delays but we were stopped by the police just after we left the

M1 motorway.    They checked that no alcohol was on board.


We arrived at the car park at approximately 1.30 p.m.      Together

with two friends, I went to The Gate Public House for a drink.

We were charged £1 to gain entrance.     At 2.35 p.m. we left the

pub and went to the football stadium which took approximately

5 minutes.     Inside the pub and on our way to the Stadium I saw

no signs of drunkeness, only good humoured and high spirited

supporters0


When we arrived outside the Leppings Lane End we saw a mass of

people seeking admission.     My friends had stand tickets and I

had a terrace ticket.     I could only see one officer on horse-back

and 2 officers on foot.     There was no queuing system.


At approximately 2.50 p.m. a concerting gate was opened and I

was carried through with the surge of the crowd and then through

the tunnel were I was crushed, and finally into the fateful pens.

I managed to turn to the right as soon as I was on to the

terracing and moved over to the dividing fence between the pens.

I could see supporters shouting at a police officer standing by

the pitch access gate and demanding he open it.     A policewoman

then came over and spoke to him and the gate was opened.     I

managed to climb over the fence, with the help of another

supporter, to the safety of the adjoining pen.
I a lso   attended the 1 9 8 8   semi-final and for that match there

were more police on duty outside the stadium and no pubs vere

open.     I arrived at the stadium at about Z.hO p.m. and there

was a better queuing system in operation.          Inside the ground 1

stood directly behind the goal against the perimeter fence.

There was a crush due to some overcrowding.

                     STATEMENT B Y _______________

                    MADE - FRIDAY JUNE 9th, 1989

My   flame   is


On April    15th,  1989   I decided    to go    to the Liverpool v
Nottingham    Forest   F.A  Cup   Senri   Final   at  H i 11 s h o r m igh,
Sheffield.    I was accompanied by my friend                              ^
22.   Neither of us had tickets but we felt confident we would
be able to purchase some from other fans or ticket "touts"
outside the ground.     We went by train and left Liverpool Lime
Street Station about 10.30 a.m.

We arrived in Sheffield at about 12.10 p.m.  As soon as we left
the train we were escorted by police constables to buses parked
immediately at the end of the station platform.   There were two
women police constables    on our bus asan escort.       The bus
arrived at Leppings Lane at about 12.30 p.m.     We were dropped
off immediately opposite gates leading to the football ground.
There was no police presence.    Beyond the gates we could see
turnstile entrances to the ground.   The  turnstiles were closed
and no queues had formed.      There were some fans in Leppings
Lane.

We walked up to some shops about 200 metres from              the ground.
As we went we continuously asked fans if they had             any "spare"
tickets.  None were available.

When we reached the shops area we entered a baked potato shop
to buy some food.      We  had beer, in the same shop a year
previously before a semi-final between the same two teams and
remembered the friendliness of what we took to be the man and
wife owners.  ^Partly joking   we asked if they had any tickets.
They replied    No. Are you    one of che two thousand   without
tickets mentioned on the radio this morning? Be careful."     We
went outside and ate the food.

At about 1.00 p.m we walked back towards the ground.   Again we
asked for tickets, again to no avail.   The numbers of fans had
increased.  There were the usual amount asking for tickets.  At
this time we saw the only ticket tout we saw all day.     As we
approached he told those around him he had no tickets left and
walked^off.  We followed in the hope he was merely changing his
 pitch" but we lost him in a side street.

We returned to the     ground at about 1.45 p.m.       Outside the
gates  we  noticed     two   mounted  policemen  and  about   three
constables on foot.     People were now queuing at the turnstiles.

                             Continued            We walked   ....
                              -   2   -



CONTINUATION


W e - w a l k e d up to the shops area again in search of tickets.
This       proved unsuccessful once more so we returned to the
ground.

At about 2.10 p.m. we walked past police at the gates                   and
arrived in the area outside the turnstile entrances.                     We
noticed a folding metal gate to right of the turnstiles.

At this stage there was one foot constable immediately next to
the turnstiles.    To right of the folding gate was a barrier
manned by one constable and one woman constable.     The area in
front of the gate was comparatively easy to move around in.
The turnstile queues were densely packed and an uncomfortable
      was a PParent with some fans plainly distressed.  At about
2.30 p.m the nearest constable stood on a turnstile queuing
barrier and asked the queues to ease off and move back, but
this appeared impossible to achieve due to the sheer mass of
people.   We noticed a video cameraman and soundman easily
moving back and forth recording the events from the area in
which we stood.

When we first arrived outside the folding gate there had been
perhaps  five men telling two Sheffield stewards    they were
Liverpool stewards and showing what appeared to be official
passes.   At no time was it uncomfortable or "packed" outside
the folding gate, although numbers did increase as time wore
on.

The folding gate had a glass viewing panel in it. Through this
it was possible to see about ten constables and two stewards
monitoring turnstile operations.    Several times the folding
gate was opened and the occasional fan ejected.      Each time
those outside the gate were pushed back firmly to ensure there
was no illegal entry.

By   this  time   conditions   in   the  turnstile   queues  had
deteriorated badly.   Fans were standing on top of the turnstile
housing   and boundary walls and were helping to pull others
from the crush.   Very many fans were showing tickets to police
inside and were allowed to get down inside and enter the
ground.

At about 2.50p.m the folding gate was opened from inside whilst
I was about three meters from it.   Those present moved through
the gate.  About fifteen people went through ahead of me.


                                      Cont/d   .../...   I got caught
                              -3-
CONTINUATION

I got caught on the edge of the folding gate and
pulled me through.    The police constables made no attempt to
stop’ anybody and those entering through the gate quickly mixed
with those coming in through the turnstiles.    Everybody moved
through a tunnel which was straight ahead.  The tunnel was full
but not uncomfortably so.

Crowd motion brought us into a pen immediately to right of
centre of the playing area and goal.  With difficulty we made
our way to the front right side of the pen.  A terrible crush
developed very quickly.  To escape it we climbed over a fence
into a comparatively empty pen to the right.     Other people
tried to climb over other fences but police constables pushed
some back.

The teams came onto the pitch as conditions worsened in the
centre pen.  We watched helplessly.   Eventually people spilled
onto the pitch and the players left the area.

We watched rescue operations and were among the last to leave
the terraced area.    We caught a train home and arrived in
Liverpool at about 9.00 p.m.

QUESTIONS

1.   Which radio station   broadcast   the   news   item    concerning;
     ticketless fans?

2.   Which journalist wrote the item and how was      the figure of
     2000 ticketless fans arrived at?

3.   One Policeman used this figure in evidence to the enquiry.
     How did he calculate the total?

4.   Why were T.V. news video cameras in Leppings          Lane before
     the match?  Who issued instructions for them          to be there
     and why?

S T A T E M E N T :-BY


            __________________________________ I •*- live with my mother and
I 1i ve a t I
fa the r . I am 20 years of age and have been a Liverpool football s u d d orter
since I was a small chi 1 d .

T first attended a match when I was about 10 yrs old.  I have been a
season ticket holder since 1984, (The COP).  I have been attending every
match since 1986.

On the day of the match I boarded a football coach at Priorv Road,
organised by Barnes Travel of County Road, Live r o o d , at about 11.00a.m.
I was with two friends, I h a d o r a a n i s e d t h e t r i D a w e e k b e f o r e h a n d .
I had a ticket for the Leppings Lane terrace (£6 ) which T had bounht two
weeks previous from Anfield.

Arrancements seemed to be normal althouah there were a lot more fans than
  usual - many many more.  As I boarded the coach mv baa was checker, bv a
steward.  I was carrying soft drinks and sandwiches.

The co a ch left at 11.30a.m. — ab out the normal t i m e . Th 0 full co a ch left
by its usual route; Priory Road, East Lancs Road, m . 57, M , 62, (at this
stage the coach left the motorway at road works and re-joined the m.62
later and then on to the M . 1 motorway, went South and followed Dolice sians
Once off the motorway t h e coach was insoected bv D o l i c e and we were b r i e f e d
about arrangements for Darking etc-) .

The coach then aporoached Sheffield and arrived at the around and narked
about one mile away from Hillsborough, on a main road near a railway bridge
We left the coach at about 2.10p.m. (I would have normally expected to of
arrived at 1 .0 0 p.m.)

It was a straight walk to the ground, I was with two friends and we went
directly  to the ground-,   arrangements seemed normal-, Tarrived at 2.30p.m.
I seperated from my friends who went to the North Stand.     I a p p r o a c h e d the
Leppings Lane End.    I immediately noticed that, unlike the previous v.ears
Semi  Final, no filtering of fans was taking place, previously barriers
had filtered fans who could approach the turnstiles with ease.           This
year there s e emed to be few police in evidence, I saw two near the
turnstiles, one on horseback and one outside the open turnstiles.

When T arrived there was a crush and J was P u s h e d / c a r r i e d / crushed through
the turnstile.  I showed my ticket and h a d the stub r e t u r n e d to mo, ( T
still have it).  I had never been in such a crush outside of a font-ball
ground before.

It was getting late and some of the crowd wore anxious                   aboxit the- c r u sh ,
they v/ere shouting to "ease off" and "hold back".
                                                                       p aae 2 .




       entered the ground between 2.40p.m. and 2.45p.m.  when throuah the
      jrnstiles I was searched quite thoroughly by a line of 6 - 10 ooli.ce
    x bouoht a programme and then went to the toilets.   There was no crush,
    i t ].ooked normal.

    I had intended standing in the Leppings Lane Pen, behind the aoal about
    3/4 way back.  I approached the tunnel for the Leppings Lane Terrace,
    (I knew the ground having been there three times previously and had stood
    on that terrace as well as h a d a place in the stands twice#}.

    I did not notice any stewards and I was not advised where to position
    myself in the ground.  I can remember there being there previously.

    I entered the tunnel for about ten minutes.      ,The re was little forward
    movement and I was trying to jink my wav through the crowd, people were
    still coming in behind me.   People w e re saying "This is Stupid" etc.
    We had no idea what was b locking us.        I was worried about missing the
    start of the game.  I was g etting anxious about-the crush which was getting
    similar to the one outside the around.

    I qave' up trying to move forward and forced my way out, I had decided to
    make my own wav towards the South Stand Side.        As I left the tunnel I
    noticed police and stewards by the turnstiles arguing and debating something
    hotly.      I did not notice the gates beinq open, people were still coming
    through the turnstiles.       I went  round and entered the terrace on the
    right, facing the pitch.       I entered the terrace which was half full.   I
    went down to      my left and moved as close as possible to a position behind
    the goal.      I  noticed the plavers comina out onto the pitch as I took up mv
    pos i ti o n .

    The space around, me started to fill up.    I concentrated on the game and
    noticed little else.   I didn't he a r singing from the central terrace, it
    was quite quiet.
                                                                    Oiccs.
    The match started, after about four minutes Beardsley hit the •ttal-i' at the
    opposite end and we surged down and did not get up to mv previous position.

    Not long after Forrest had a corner kick at Leppings Lane end at the North
    Stand side, T saw lots of fans running out the pitch waving their arms
    about in the   penalty area. The plavers went off the pitch.   T n o tic e d
    police in the stands above us shouting down at us to move to the riaht.
    We started to move over and stopped when the crush became too much, we were
    moving over to let people over the fence from the middle enclosure.
    I was not able to move mv arms and could not breath properlv.     I then saw
    people on the pitch aetting mouth to mouth r es u sitation. The crowd beaan
    to become anxious and people were shouting and screaming that thev wanted
    to get out.  It was extremely frightenina.

    We were in that position for about seven minutes and. I noticed the
    advertising boardings were being taken down and fans were being lifted into
    the stand behind the goal.   Help beaan to come from either side of the
    pitch from supporters.   Police came and stood across the half wav line.
    One ambulance arrived and tried to get to the noal, it c a m e around the

1 hope never to experience    anvthinq as friqhteninq as this ever aaain.

I would like to sav that the pen fencinq played a part in the disaster and
forced fans to remain crushed in an area from which t h e y could not escape
I was lucky to be able to qet out of the tunnel just in time.     Also, there
should have been a filterinq system to prevent the crush which took place
outside the turnstiles.   T. feel that the police rarelv treat fans as human
beinas.  We are h erded from coaches into qrounds.   w e should be treated
like normal people.

Ticket allocation should reflect the demand and the size of the averaqe
attendance at qrounds.  We never have enouqh tickets.

     Statement of


      My girlfriend and I left Southport by coach for Manchester
on the Friday evening for the start of a special weekend break
that included a Granada T.V. Studios tour on the Saturday and
a visit to the Leeds Variety Theatre on the Saturday evening.
In order to see the match I left the coach party to catch the
12.05 p.m. train from Manchester Piccadilly and arrived in
Sheffield at 1.15 p.m.   I then got a d u s to the g r o u n d a n d
a rrived at 1.30 p.m.  I bought a non-alcoholic drink in a
shop by the ground and went towards the turnstiles at about
1.45p.m.

        There were 3 or 4 moun t ed police and a small number on
foot.     They issued directions "seats this way - terrace that
way" and I went to the terrace turnstiles were there was no
queue.     I then took up my position in the right hand pen (A)
3 steps back from the p erimeter fence b e h i n d the goal. There
was no crush until 2.45 p.m. when I was pushed down a step.
At 2.55 p.m. the crush was very intense and at 3.03 p.m. 2
people next to me fell to the left - then another crush
developed and I ended up over them and crushed up against
the fence.     I was by 2 young girls and an older bloke in his
3 0 's.   He kept asking if I was o.k.    We screamed at the police
and officials to let us out.       The police formed a line in
front of us.

     I heard one say into his radio        "What shall we do Chief".
We screamed at them to let us out.         Perspiration was dripping
from me and I thought I was going to       die.  A young lad
climbed onto the fence - the police        forced him back into
the crowd.

     More people began to try and climb out - I helped a
youngster out by pushing him up.   The girl next to me shouted
"mind my head"; mind my head!"   Someone stood on my shoulders
and I fell to the ground.   People were actually over me
and I thought my back would break.

      At about 3.23/3.25 someone helped me up - I couldn't
move my feet because of the bodies around them.           Someone
then grabbed my arm and p u l l e d m e b a c k a few steps u p t h e
terrace.   I saw bodies of blue-faced youngsters laid out
b ehind me and the two people who fell by me looked dead.

     I then went to the back of the terrace and down the
tunnel.  When I came out of the tunnel I stopped to get my
breath back and I saw fans trying to revive people.  I was
crying as were others.  A police officer came over to see
if I was o.k.

      I left the ground at 4.20 p.m. to catch the 5.05 p.m.
train to Leeds.   On the train someone said 35 people had
died.   I waited for the coach in Leeds at the variety club
but my girlfriend wasn't on it.   I then phoned our hotel
                               - 2 -

hotel in Manchester, the Brittania, and she was still there
worrying about me.  I had a d o u b l e brandy at the variety club
and stayed for the show.

     On the way back we had a minutes silence on the coach for
those who died.    When we got to the hotel lobby I saw on the
T.V. that 95 had died.    I cried.  I then had some drinks and
something "to eat.

     For 2 weeks after I had a bad cold.  I then suffered a
sore throat for 2 days, followed by a bad cough for a week
and I have suffered constant breathing difficulties.   On the
Monday after the disaster I went to the new hospital in
Southport as I had pains across my chest and ribs.   The doctor
examined me and said I would be contacted but no one had been
in touch.  He said that 14 other fans had been in over the weekend.
For the three days after leaving the hospital I went to the
jacuzzi in the Royal Clifton Hotel which seemed to cure my
chest pains.

     Finally although I saw supporters drinking I did not see
any drunkeness.

I went to the semi-final with my friend, his two teenage sons and their friend
who had no ticket.  We left Liverpool at 10.00 a.m because of road works as we
approached Sheffield, we diverted from the suggested route and came in through
the centre.  This took us past the side by which the Forest fans approached
the ground (we followed the diversion signs).  All of the pubs were open.
We parked the car on the Liverpool side only to find all of the pubs were shut
This was at ]2.30 p.m.

We took a bus out of town, had a few drinks, and arrived back   at the ground at
2.15 p.m. By this time thousands of people were converging on   the ground from
the hill immediatly behind Leppings Lane.

As we arrived outside entrance 'A' we were confronted by a huge gathering of
fans trying to get in.   There were no queues.   The first thing we noticed was the
absence of police.   There appeared to be only a few officers standing outside
this mass of people.   There were two mounted officers, one of them a woman,
trying to sort it out.    I managed to get to the turnstile at 2.35 p.m.   It was
then I realised that the mounted officer was from Liverpool as he was screaming
into his walkie talkie to get more men out immediatly.     I have been in some
crushes at football matches but this was bad.

I got through the turnstiles it felt like a cork being popped from a bottle.  We
took up our position at the east end of the North stand.  From this position you
could see that the Leppings Lane were packed in like sardines. It looked really
b b d . Th is v/as 31 2.40 p.m.

At 2.45 p.m a man of about 50 years of age ran on the pitch waving his scarf at
the Forest fans (he looked like a wino). He was rugby tackled by a policeman.
The whole crowd cheered (we don't like drunks). This was the only man I saw
drunk all day.

2. 50 p.m. the Le_ppings Lane is looking ominous.
2. 55 p.m. the teams warm up. Leppings Lane is looking like a disaster waiting
to happen.
3. 00 p.m. the teams kick off. Within minutes Liverpool hit the bar, but
immediatly Forest get a corner.   You could see people trying to climb over the
fences and also up to the west stand.   Police were pushing them back.  A
policeman runs forward to tell the referee.   He takes the players of the pitch -
time 3.06.  Police are still pushing people back and continue to do so for at
least 2 minutes, until they all realise and some start to help, but most stood
around and watched.   Some fans start to rip down a fence. Some police helped -
most just watched.   Some fans start to rip up advertising boardings.  Some
police tried to stop them, others helped (these were the make-shift stretchers).
People are being given the kiss of life all over the Liverpool end of the pitch,
mostly by fans.  The police look on.

The first body is taken out in front of me, covered by a red anorak.  The-Forest
fans start chanting "Heysel play on, play on".  Some Liverpool fans run towards
them, waving their fists in anger, but they stop and go back to treating the
injured and the dying. An ambulance arrives.

The police reaction to this was to put a line of men across the pitch and march
to the half-way line (this hampered everything).  The Liverpool fans helped by
few police ran a shuttle of stretchers from one end of the pitch to the other,
The police look on and get in the way.   It appears, tnat L.he otu> o.
amongst the civilians.

Five minutes later a division of police is marched in.  We thought help at
last but no the order went out to form one rank in front of the North stand.
They’were booed for this, and as if this wasn't enough, they then brought in
dogs and put them in front of the Forest end.

The poeple are still dying, the police are still looking on.  An announcement
comes over the tanoy telling people to get off the pitch and return to their
places (the dead can't hear).

An announcement is made by the Liverpool Manager for people to staycalm and
to co-operate with the police, (sorry Kenny but that was a bad joke.,.

At 4.00 p.m we returned to the car. We were relieved to see the lad who had
no ticket.  He said that he got in when the police opened the gates.

I asked was he sure of that and he said yes, that they had been opened twice.
Once to let police either in or out, and then after kick off. We then sadly
went home.

My opinion is that the first mistake was the allocation of tickets (police
suggestion).  You could have played five a side in the Forest end, which is
ironicly called the spion ko p . The easier access idea doesn't wash, as a lot
of us came in with the Forest fans anyway.

The second mistake was the police operation bothir.side  andoutside  the ground
which suggests that little or no monitoring of the situation had taken place, or
if it had it was totally flawed.  All you had to do was look around the corner
at the thousands of fans coming down the hill.   Once they arrived it was too late
for the police by the turnstiles to do anything about it. They should have been
fore-warned.  Inside the ground why were there no announcements for people to
move away from the centre.

Why wasn't the tanoy system taken over bythe policeimmediatly the crushhappened.'
Why were the police only trained for a riotsituation.     Theyjustdidn't know   what
to do. (The only time that they eventually moved was when someone who had just
finished given the kiss of life to a fan started to push that ghoul from the
Daily Mirror away from the fence.   Their reaction was immediate, but thank god
they were ordered back).

COMMENTS

The hooligan element at football grounds is vastly overstated and sentionalised
and peoples idea of the average soccer fan being a hooligan is not "born out by
the amount of proffesional people who have come forward after this disaster.

Football matches have become a complete police operation.

a)  Fans both men and women are searched frequently.
b)  Marched to and from grounds.
c) Locked in after the final whistle.
d) Their coaches are frequently searched.
e) They are generally treated like second class citizens, e.g I was travelling
with my wife on a normal inter city train at 4.20 p.m on a Friday.  My bags were
searched and an announcement was made that this was a soccer urain an anyone

    caught with alcohol would be liable to a   fine of £400.   The match, Liverpool
    v Everton milk cup, was on a Sunday.

    The whole situation needs re-evaluating.   The police need to be made more
    aware that they are their to protect people safely.   The action taken by police
    at Hillsborough, which they have come to expect is necessary to prevent a riot,
    came within a hairsbreath of causing one.

    V.'e hope that you take a fair and just appraisal of the inquiry, the real issues
    being; was the police operation correct and safe from the allocation of tickets
    to the policing both in and around the ground9

    Was the ground itself built for safety in the sixties (Dr Andrew Stevens
    sacrificed a great tean to build it) or with hingsight was it a death trap waiting
    to happen with only five turnstiles feeding two stands and a terrace and all
    funneled into the same place?

    Our hearts go out to the people of Sheffield.  Our hearts go out to the police
    of Sheffield, but the officers in charge of this operation should have the
    decency to tell the truth and take responsibility for any short-falls.  Please
    no lies, no cover-up.

    Yours sincerely,




    P.S. I am sorry about the length of this letter, I had to get it all on paper.

Statement by


I went to the match by Amberline coach.  We left Speke at about
10.30 a.m.  We travelled on the M62, Ml, A61 and there was
only one major hold-up on the M62 in the Middleton area for
about 45 minutes.  We arrived at the coach park at about 1.00 p.m.
No one on the bus had been drinking.  Our coach was not stopped
and searched for alcohol by the police.

We went to find an off-licence or pub and about half a mile
away we found an off-licence in a parade of shops.   People
were around the area drinking and using the beer garden of
a closed pub.  I saw no excessive drinking or drunkeness.
After drinking two cans of beer I went to the ground.   It was
about 1.30 p.m./ I.40 p.m.; we wanted to get in early because of
the problems last year of big crowds outside and crushing
inside the ground.   We got to the turnstiles at 2.00 p.m.

In 1988 as soon as you got into Leppings Lane the police moved
you into the ground - this, year, there was none of that. There
was a lower police presence.

My 3 friends and I all had terrace tickets.  There was no queue
outside the turnstiles and inside the ground I was searched by
the only police officer I saw.  I did not see any stewards.
Having been to this ground before I was not going behind the
goal.  We tried to find the way to the North West Upper Terrace
and that took 10 - 15 minutes.  At 2.15 p.m. we took up our
position at the rear of the North West Upper Terrace just below
the Bunker and Pratley Advert hoarding.  The very first
conversation we had was that the centre sections were ov e r ­
crowded - people were already climbing over the side fences.
About 2.40 p.m. you could see it was packed solid in those pens.
After that we watched it all unfold.

There was a long delay before police seemed to understand what
was happening.  When fans began to climb over the fence the
police pushed them back so they fell back on those who were being
crushed.  It was a long time before the gates at the front were
opened.  There was complete lack of stretchers and medical
facilities.

      I cannot recall if there_was better stewarding in 1988.
At that game the two centre section were over-full.   We climbed
out into the side section towards the North Stand.   A man next
to us was carried out on a stretcher after being crushed against
a barrier.   We had arrived at the ground between 2.15 and 2.30 p.m.
and there was no crush to get in.   There were far more police on
duty.

I went to the match with 3 friends.  We travelled with the coach
firm Barnes Travel.  I had a ticket for the West Stand.  Two
of my friends had terrace tickets and another had a North Stand
t icket.

We left Liverpool at 11.20 a.m. and arrived in Sheffield at. ^.Gu p.
We encountered very few traffic delays.  Another 4 friends went by
car and one of them, David Mather died.

We went to the ground at 2.15 p.m. and had no problems getting in.
We were searched for alcohol.    I was in the West Stand and I
looked down into the pen b ehin d the goal and there must have been
around 20 people I knew in there.     At 2.20 p.m. it looked full-up
The side pens were not even half full at this time.     I thought
it strange that our part of the ground was only half f u l l . I
thought that there were far more people in the ground at the
same time the previous year.    My. seat was 9 rows back from the
front behind the goal.

After the match kicked-off I saw people trying to climb over the
fences.   I thought at first it was just a normal crush problem.
Police Officers were making ha n d gestures that appeared to tell
the £unr'^rters to go back into the pens.   They stepped some pcopxe
from climbing over.   More and more people were climbing or being
helped over the fence.   Some lay on the ground and did not move.
I knew then something was badly wrong.    The game stopped and the
players went off the pitch.   I saw a friend of mine, Tony Lawrence
climbing over.   He got hold of a policeman and was pointing to
the middle seciton.   He was crying.

I went down to the front of the West Stand and looked over onto
the terracing.   People were trying to climb up to escape the
crush so I joined the other supporters pulling people up.    I
pulled ten people up and broke my foot; I did not know that until
later.   One of those I pulled up was a friend - he did not know
were the others were.   I just wanted to go and see if my friends
were OK.   I went to get out but the police wo uld not allow people
to leave.   I left the West Stand at about 3.40 p.m. and went
down to the terracing to look for my friends.    I approached a
policeman by the pitch access gate nearest the police control room
I was in tears and I asked if I could come onto the pitch to see^
if any of my mates were dead or injured.   He just said   fuck off .
I argued with him but he was adamant that he wouldn't let me on.

I walked along to the central section of the terrace and jgot
on the pitch were the fence had been pushed out and walked around
for about 20 minutes but I couldn't see any of my mates.

 I finally left the grounds at 4.25 p.m. and got back to the coach
at about 4.45 p.m.    My mates w e re on the coach and were safe.  One
of the lads who went by car,                  was there minus his shoe
 I then began to find out how many people died. My mate
I              Ihad lots of cuts on his stomach from were he had
climbed over.    Another friend,_____________ had bruises on his chest
 and back from the crush.   When we got back to Liverpool we found
 out Dave was dead.

     I was in a party of ten people who travelled in 2 cars.    We
left Liverpool at 9.00 a.m. and travelled to Sheffield via the
M62 and then through Huddesfield to the Ml.   We experienced no
traffic delays and arrived in Sheffield at 11.00 a.m.   By the
stadium we noticed a heavy police presence.   Barriers were
placed across side streets adjoining Leppings Lane and each
barrier was manned by 3/4 police officers.   We parked by the
TAVR Centre in Leppings Lane, about 3/4 minutes walk from the
ground.  We then went to The Anvil Public House (same as in
1988) for a drink.   When we left the pub 4 of us went by taxi
to the gr ound and the rest by bus.  Traffic was very heavy
and we left the bus to walk the remaining few hundred yards
to the ground.   We got there at 2.30 p.m.  I had a stand
ticket for the North Stand.

     I saw very few police outside the grou nd but did see 4
or 5 police on horses on the opposite side of the road.   I
also noticed a BBC cameraman filming outside.   I then joined
the 'queue' for the North Stand which was a large crush.    No
proper queuing system was in force.  There was a massive crush
with people screaming for others to move back.   An old man
collapsed in front of me and I held him up.   There was a
policeman and policewoman outside each turnstile and they were
beina crushed as well.  Fans screamed at them to radio for
help'but they said they had no radios.  As the crush intensified
the police went through the turnstiles.  I was pinned against
the wall by the turnstiles and was struggling to avoid
falling over a metal household rubbish bin.   Eventually I got
through the turnstiles and saw fans screaming and shouting
at a large group of police officers to go and help outside.
The police seemed more concerned with catching a youngster
who was on top of a caravan which was located to the right
just after the turnstiles.  There must have been 15 or more
police demanding he get down — we told them to do something
useful like stopping the crush outside.

      I got to my seat at about 2.50/2.55 p.m.  I was on the
third row from the front almost by the corner flag by the
West Stand.   Almost immediately we knew something was wrong,
b ehind the goal was packed but the sides were empty and
people were trying to climb over the fences.   I didn't even
notice the kick-off as people were spilling onto the pitch.
A policeman ran onto the pitch to stop the game and then police
began to arrive from everywhere.   They locked their arms
and formed a barrier across the pitch and in front of us.
We screamed at them to go and help the people in the West
Stand.

     We saw people lying on the pitch, others being pulled
into the West Stand seating area, others being stretched-off
on placards.  At around 3.3 0 p.m. we heard rumours that 10 or
15 people had been killed.   I saw a girl screaming over a body
and a photographer snapping away.

     I left the stadium at approximately 3.40 p.m.

     In 1988 I arrived at the ground at 2.20/2.25 p.m.  Police
were checking you had tickets before you were allowed into
the turnstile area.  There was a small crush but I experienced
no problems.  There was a large police presence outside the
ground in 1988 whereas in 1989 it was inside.

Statement of L. TUDOR
Age          21_______
of




I left home at around 10-45 am and caught a bus to Liverpool City
Centre.  I then caught a train from Liverpool Lime Street to
Sheffield which left around 11.30 am.

The train arrived in the Station in Sheffield City Centre at around
1.30 am.  There was no alcohol on the train and there didn       appear
to be anyone who had been drinking before t h e y ’d boarded the train.

When I arrived at Sheffield I joined all the other Football
Supporters who were met by a police escort.  No-one was allowed to
leave the group and make their own way to the game and we were
directed onto buses to take us directly to Hillsborough.

I boarded the bus and paid the £1.00 return fare   Once the bus
was filled it moved off and another pulled in behind and took
more Supporters.  The journey took approx 25-30 minutes and we
arrived in Leppings Lane at 2.10 pm.

I didn't go straight in to the Stadium but instead went to a
Chip Shop further down Leppings Lane.  After this I made my way
to the ground, having been moved on by mounted police officers w
were moving fans down Leppings Lane towards the ground.  I believe
that this may have contributed to the sudden build up of peop e
around the turnstiles and the entrance to the courtyards at the
Leppings Lane End.

I joined the M e l e e outside the turnstiles at 2.20 pm.  I took a
note of the time because I hadn't intended to enter the ground
until 2.40 pm.     However, once we had been 'herded' up to the
turnstile area by the m o u nt ed police I dedided I might as we    go
in.  At this stage the crowd outside the turnstiles reached as
far as the large outer gates which lead onto Leppings Lane.

There were no queues organised and it was pretty crushed waiting
to get in.
 It took me about 10 minutes to reach the turnstiles, during which,
 time I was carried forward by the crowd until I found myself in
 front of a turnstile.

 After coming through the turnstile I was searched by a police officer
 and then I headed down the tunnel and on to the Leppings Lane
 Terrace       I went in to the right hand pen (although at the time I
 d i d n ’t realise that there were two pens which could be reached via
 that tunnel) and decided to stay near the back of the terrace.
    (i)   to get a clearer view of the game,   being higher up ;

   (ii)   so that I would be able to get back out if I wanted
          to go to a different part of the terracing nearer kick-
          off time.

This was about 2.30 pm.  At this stage the enclosure was quite
crowded, but there was some space at the front.  This lead to the
crowd constantly toppling forward, sometimes quite 'violently',
and then swaying back again as everyone found their feet.

Over a period of fifteen minutes, during which everyone was
being thrown about by the movement of the crowd, I gradually
moved nearer to the front and decided to stay there; at least
until the game vas well under way. All the time the crowd was
swaying forward and falling onto the people at the front.   This
is not unusual on samll terraces like this.

At about 2.50 pm the area started to ger very full.  I found
myself moving even further forward, just in front of the gate in
the perimeter fence.  When the teams came onto the pitch it got
very uncomfortable at the front.

I was standing with my feet on the step in front of the gate.  In
front of me were a man and a young boy; I leaned back into the
people behind me to try and take some of the pressure off the two
in front of me.

I didn't see the game kick off.    Eventually the crush became too
much for me  to hold off the two people in front, so I moved
sideways, away from the step.    Soon, I found myself up against
the perimeter fence.  At this stage I think everyone still
thought that the crush would ease off and we'd be able to watch
the game.- Even so, we were all shouting for the police to open
the gate and let the boy o u t .

I turned around to look behind me saw people shouting for two
girls to be helped out.  I'd seen the two girls earlier on as
we waited for the game to start.  I later learned from the press
reports and pictures that these were Sarah and Victoria Hicks
who were killed by the crush.

This was the last time I turned around.  I'm not sure what time
this was as I didn't see the game start or see any of the play.___

After that the pressure built up gradually.My feet were pressed
against the bottom of the wall in an attempt to keep the pressure
off my chest and hips.  This I managed to keep up most of the
time, and I had a little difficulty in breathing.

I was now standing about 1 - 2   feet from the gate in the perimeter
fence.
Eventually the crush reached a point where I w a s completely unable
to move.   My left arm was pinned high out the side, against t
back of sombody's head.   I think I heard the person say that their
head was squashed but it was hard to tell in the noise      .
                                                            Anyw,ay,
I tried to-move my left arm to free them but it wouldn t budge
all.
My right was by my side, with my hand in front of my chest,        holding
the fence.
For a period the pressure on my chest b e c a m e greater and it became
more difficult to breath ( than normal that is) but I could stil
get my breath with a bit of effort and concentration.       All ^ u n d
I could hear people gasping for breath and^groans of pain,
also hear people faining trying say 'help!'

Eventually the pressure subsided on my chest and breathing became
normal.  However, the pressure then i n c r e a s e d across the top
my legs and my right knee  was being pressed hard into the wa        .

There was a boy just tomy left wearing a Liverpool Football Shirt
I think it was the same one I mentioned earlier.      He was hanging
on the to fence just above us and his legs were still in the crowd.
Everyone around was urging him to climb the fence a n d trying
move in order to help him up out no-one could do anything
Somebody on the other side of the fence was trying to reach over
the top to pull him up but they couldn't reach him       The b o y s e e , a
to be frozen with fear and he w a s n ’t climbing the fence.   I didn t
see whether he eventually got out or not.

Once the crush had subsided I was left hanging on to the fence by
my left arm.  My right arm had gone completely numb.      My legs were
7till trapped b e t w e L the front wall and the pile of bodies at the
front of the terrace.

Someone on the pitch side told me to pull myself up and climb over
the fence.  When I tried to get up I couldn't move my legs.

By this time people were pulling the bodies from the pile and
police officers were stepping through the gate and carrying people
out onto the pitch.   An officer stepped through the gate looking
for someone to help so I let go of the fence, fell back onto the
pile and reached out.   From there my legs where dragged free and
was carried onto the pitch, near the edge of the penalty area.
This was at 3.21 pm.                               — -

 After about five minutes somebody toldme to move a w a y from the
 area because people were trying to c a r r y stretchers through   I
 tried to stand up to move but my legs had gone numb and
 was strength in them at all.


 Eventually, somebody called over a group of p e o p l e w i t h an advertising
 board and carried me off the pitch.  I w a s taken through the gap _
 between the kop and the North Stand and left near the club gymnasium,
 behind the North Stand.
After some time I was lifted into what I think was a police minibus




COMMENTS

There are number of points which I think contributed to the events
which led to the disaster.  These are:

    (i)     The lack of co-ordination between police officers and the
            lack of a strategy for dealing with the crowd outside the
            Statium contributed a great deal to the chaos outside.  For
            instance, there were no attempts made to organise fans into
            queues outside the turnstiles.

  (ii)      The actions of the mounted officers in Leppings Lane in
            herding fans along to the ground, which took place from
            about 2.20 pm onwards served, I believe,to cause the much
            talked of "sudden build up of fans" at around 2.30 pm.

 (i i i )   The decision that all Liverpool fans must go through the
            Leppings Lane turnstiles was always going to cause problems.
            How ~24 000 are expected to go through such a small area in
            a short space of time, without crushing, I don't know!

  (iv)      The allocation of tickets to Liverpool, again, was always
            going to see problems.  With an average attendance at
            AnfieId of nearly 40 000, the small end of Hillsborough
            was quite obviously inadequate.

    (v)     The position of the Hillsborough Stadium, with its restricted
            access for visitors at the Leppings Lane         End is quite
            simply not s u i t e d -to -dealing with large crowds.

  (vi)      Once fans were through the turnstiles (or the opened gate)
            no attempt  was made to divert people into the empty side
            pens.  The layout of the entrances means that it is^ impossible
            to see the entrances to the side enclosures.  The tunnel
            to the centre pens stares you in the face when you enter
            the ground subsequently, everyone heads down there.
   (vii)   Perimeter fences and small pens, made the area in
           the central pens behind the goal a cage and a death
           trap.  These must go.


LAST YEARS SEMI-FINAL (1988)
LIVERPOOL V NOTTINGHAM FOREST
HILLSBOROUGH.


I attended last years FA Cup Semi Final at the same ground and
I feel that my experience then may help to shed some light on
the reason for the disaster this year.

Upon entering the gound myself and two frinds went down the
tunnel into the right hand centre pen.  After about five minutes
the pushing and crushing got so bad that we forced our way
back out.  We then sought out a steward and were directed round
the right hand side pens (on the South Stand Side)

This area was crushed as well, but not as bad as the area behind
the goal.  There were numerous people pulled up from the West
Stand terrace and in the West Stand.

The central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace are notorious among
fans for crushing.    Numerous people advised me to go in the
side pens.  The day before the game (Friday 14 April) a friend
told me of his experience in there at an Everton v Sheffield
Wednesday FA Cup Jtie)* I didn't heed their advice.

      Statement of



      Having arrived at Hillsborough myself and my brother both
 obtained tickets from Liverpool supporters with little difficulty.
 There seemed a lot less ticketless fans than in 1988. We had
 arrived at approximately 1.45 p.m. despite leaving at 11o00 a.m.
 (from Whiston). Traffic on the M 62 and M1 had been delayed by
 several sets of roadworks. We saw no signs of trouble (rowdiness
 or drunkenness) in the area around the ground, in fact a very
 friendly atmosphere was in evidence between Liverpool and Forest
 fans and police.

     We arrived at the Leppings Lane turnstiles at approximately
2.20 p.m. Again I was surprised at the low number of ticketless
fans compared to 1988. Also, X noticed a lower police presence
than in 1988 and no attempts to check tickets on the approach to
the turnstiles, something which was strictly enforced at the
first game.

     We queued for a short time approximately 5 minutes and
entered the ground, (at this stage the queues were very orderly).

       On entering the ground we went straight t h r o u g h the tunnel
 below the stand into the middle section of the Leppings Lane
 terrace.   No attempts were made by Police or Stewards to direct
 fans to the outer enclosures.    On entering the central terrace
 we realised straight away that it was too full (2.3 0 p.m.). We
 decided to move towards the right hand flank of the Leppings Lane
 terrace. Progress was slow and difficult. Eventually we reached
 a fence which ran at right angles to the steps. We climbed over
 and were amazed to find the outer section was sparsely populated
 and commented on how poorly organised the crowd was to allow such
 uneven distribution of fans to occur (2.40 p.m.). We remained
 at this point until 3.05 p.m. A steady stream of supporters
 continued to climb out of the middle section although this
became more difficult as the crush increased. They were mainly
young men/boys. At 3*10 p.m. the first of the dying/injured
were on the pitch. The reaction of the Police was confused -
 some were trying to encourage fans in our section to evacuate
onto the pitch. Why? A good number seemed unconcerned - I saw
one group chatting and laughing, seemingly oblivious to the
surrounding mayhem. Many obviously under orders stood waiting
to encounter the expected hooliganism. The rest fought bravely
to give assistance.    It was 3.20 p.m. and the outer section
remained sparsely populated. We left to contact our family
Some supporters, obviously distressed and hysterical vented their
anger on F.A. Officials and Police.    This was the only 'violence*
we witnessed and consisted only of verbal abuse and those we saw
were calmed by other supporters.
                                                              •
 n
almost full.
              at     p, m ‘ the Liverpool part of the ground was
              In 1989 at 2.30 p.m. (except for the central
terrace pens) the Liverpool part of the Stadium was almost
empty.
                                -   2   -



      In 1989 as w e l l as a low police presence outside the ground
I .noticed one of the mounted police officers was from Liverpool
I've seen h i m on his horse m a n y times over the years at Airfield,,
It may be a good thing to have Liverpool police at such matches
but it is questionable p articularly if they are not used to
policing the ground.

My name is                                                         L iv e rp o o l.




I am a Liverpool Football Club Supporter who attended the Hillsborough
Stadium     on the occasion of both last year’s F.A. Cup Semi Final against
Nottingham Forest and this year’s Semi Final.         With regard to last year’s
Semi Final we started off from Liverpool at approximately 11,30 a.m. on the
morning of the game.    We had an uninterrupted journey and by 1.00 oclock
had reached a suitable parking space within a half hours walking
distance of the Hillsborough ground.     This year we set off at the same
time 11,30 a.m.     It took us 3 hours to reach a parking space which was
within a twenty minute walk from the ground.     This was due to a twenty
minute delay whilst our car was allowed to cool down but primarily the
journey took longer this year because of the extreme congestion of the
roads and the extent of the roadworks en route.


When we arrived at our roadside parking space I knew from our visit last
year that we were a 20/25 minute walk away from the ground.        We made off
at a brisk walk towards the ground.     At about 100 yards from the outer blue
steel gates (which give access to the turnstile forecourt at the ground)
there were two policemen who were patrolling the whole width of the road.
They were both standing on the pavement on my left hand side of the road.
As we approached they asked us if we had any drink and if so could we leave
it there and not take it into the ground.     We had none and neither my
four friends nor myself had, in fact, consumed any alcohol at all at any
time that day.     No attempt was made to check tickets at this point.         I
approached the outer gates which were shut and the time was 2.50 p.m.              All
I could see was a crowd of people who were trying to gain access to the
gate at the Leppings Lane turnstile,.


It was a large crowd and those at the front were getting pushed against the
gate and wall by those at the back.     Those at the front were pusing back
to relieve the presure on them.     As I was pushed towards the crowd I got
swept in and I was being pushed about.     I lost contact with my iriendfe.
                                       -2-

People around about me were now shouting to the two policemen who were on
horseback to warn their police colleagues by radio inside of the ground
of the crowd problems which had developed outside#


The crowd problem was in my view caused by a lack of police control both
on Troute to the ground and at the Leppings Lane endo    In my view, there
was insufficient numbers of them to control the crowd#


The policeman on horseback closest to me was more interested in trying to
keep control of the crowd than getting the gates opened*

I was caught in the crush outside for 8 or 9 minutes •     In that time a
policeman appeared on the pillar in the centre of the gates.     He was looking
down trying to assess the crowd then just before 3»00 p.m. the police opened
one blue outer gate which was on my side*


I made my way over towards the turnstile.     By this time it was quite packed#
As I approached the turnstile there was a barrier and the crowd had filled
the whole entrance to the turnstiles.     I was at the back of the crowd next to
the barrier#     As I was queuing there, a policeman approached me and said
"Here you are mate there is a gate around here you can go into"#     By that I
thought he meant there were more turnstiles we could go through#     I walked
round.    As I approached I could see there was a big blue wooden gate which was
open#     I had my ticket in my hand to pass in as I went through the gate# To
my surprise there was no one there to check the tickets#    As I walked in all
I could see to my right was a tunnel.    I took it for granted that this led
to the terrace, as there was no police, stewards or signs to direct people
at all.    As I approached the tunnel, the tunnel was in total darkness apart
from a strip of daylight which could be seen at the far end of the tunnel#
As I entered the tunnel, with it being bright sunlight outside it took a
little while for my eves to adjust to the gloom.    I had said to my friends
before we got split up to make our way to the left hand side of Leppings
Lane end and where we had had a good view last year.    I thought that I could
get there, to that side, by going through the tunnel and turning left.       When
I went through I did not get a chance to turn left. I walked down the tunnel
slowly watching my feet.    It was pitch black and I didn't know whether or
not there would be hidden steps. With saying to my friends about the left hand
side I was holding the wall on the left hand side of the tunnel#    I got to
the end of the tunnel and came up against a wall of people who were watching
                                - 3-

 the game.   By this time the game had started,


 I tried to make my way through the crowd so that I could get further
 into the terrace but it was so packed that I could not manage to
jnake any progress to go further down the terrace,,    I was just about
 to turn round and make my way back out of the tunnel when there was
a big surge from the back where people had come in behind me.     With
me being at the back the surge took me right down to the front of
 the terrace#    Thepressure was so intense that I could not turn round
 or move my arms-at some stages I was lifted off the ground.     This
pressure did not stop for at least 15 to 20 minutes.     When I first
g o t sw ept down to the terrace people were shouting to the police to
stop the game, that people were getting injured and hurt.      It wasn't
until five minutes later that the police realised what was happening.
People were by then climbing over the fence.      People were climbing on
top of other people to get out - they were fighting for their lives*


The police opened the gate at the front of our pen to let people out
onto the pitch but the gate was so small only one person at a time
could be pulled out*    By this stage, with people being pulled out,
people were trying to get closer and closer to the front gate.     This
put even more pressure on thosealready at the front, near the gate
who were themselves trying to get out*


At this stage I realised I was being pushed nearer and nearer to the
fence and the front barrier and I was conscious of the need to keep
clear of them*    After tv/enty minutes the pressure eased off a bit and
I had a chance to turn around*    There was only 3 or k people deep
behind me trying to get towards the gate so I started to shout 'all push
back'o   Some around me dido Then I managed to break free of the crush.
The first thing I did was to look around for my friends,     I saw 2 in
the same pen as me who were to the right of where I waso     I shouted to
them and they replied they were okay0


By this time I realised that this had not just been an ordinary crowd
surge but that people had been injured*    I had seen the people on the
pitch who were injured so I went back out of the tunnel to see if I
could see my other friends.    I went back through the tunnel but I could
not see ray other two friends on the forecourt outside0
                               _ if _


Blocking the blue wooden entrance which I had originally walked
through was a line of policemen and women.   People were now being
brought out of the tunnel who had been injured.   The police just
seemed to stand and watch the fans bringing the people out and
myself and the others had to shout to them to give first aid.
When they did come in at least 10 or 12 of them congregated around
one person.   We shouted to them again that t^ere were others around
who needed attention.


I had still not found my other two friends so I went back through

the tunnel and one of my friends who I had seen earlier before,
said he had seen one of our friends walking about on the pitch and
he seemed okay.   This was about ^mb-0 p.m., so my friend and I went
onto the pitch to find him and our other missing friend.


At about 3.55 p.m. I was walking by the goal mouth and the friend I
had gone onto the pitch with shouted to say that our missing friend
was safe and on the terrace.   All five of us left the ground at about
^-.00 p.m. I still had my complete ground ticket in my possesion which
I have now passed to the West Midland Police.

 STATEMENT




        My name is

                        I am a supporter of Liverpool Football Club

who attended the F.A. Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest

on Saturday,     15th April this year.


        I left Liverpool at exactly 11.00 a.m.   that Saturday

morning.      I travelled by car with my brother and a friend.

Because of traffic delays we did not arrive in Sheffield until

about 2.20.     We parked approximately % of a mile from., the

ground.      By the time we arrived at the ground it was"about

2.45.


        We went to the Leppings Lane end of the ground and found

the situation to be chaotic.      I only saw one police officer on

foot.     There were other officers on horseback and two officers

in a jeep.


        Nobody was on hand to direct supporters to the appropriate

turnstiles.     I estimate that there were at least 500 supporters

outside the ground at this time and more were arriving all the

time.     Supporters were trying to get to whichever turnstile was

nearest.     Nobody was trying to form supporters into queues at

the turnstiles and there was no direction as to which turnstiles

supporters were to use.


        I had a ground ticket while m y brother and my friend had

tickets for the stands,    and they therefore left to find the

entrance to the stands.
                                                  - 2 -



               One of the police officers in the jeep was asking supporters

 to move back away from the turnstiles.                      He said over the jeep

 address system that attempts were being made to get the start of

the match delayed.                  The officers in the jeep were trying to get

the mounted police to form a line preventing supporters from

reaching the turnstiles^                    _


               I stood by the jeep, which was about 2 5 yards from the turn­

stiles, for approximately 10 minutes.                       I would not have been able

to reach the turnstiles without pushing through the crowd.


               At this stage I felt a bit doubtful about my prospects of

getting into the ground because there were so many people still

outside.              I decided to wander away from the turnstiles and passed

to the right of the jeep.                    I walked between two mounted police

officers who did not try to stop me;                      some other supporters did

the same.                 When I had passed the mounted officers I saw two gates

wide open and supporters were walking through.                       I went through

the gates and expected to see turnstiles but instead I found

myself inside the ground.                    I did not see any stewards or police

officers.                 Nobody asked for my ticket, which I still have at home.


           Once inside the ground I looked for an entrance to the

terraces and I saw a tunnel which appeared to be the obvious

entrance.                 I started to walk down the tunnel which was very poorly

lit,       in fact almost in darkness.             A supporter with a small boy

was coming in the opposite direction and he said to me,                     " i t ’s

chokker in there".                  I decided to take a look for myself and

carried on walking.                  Before I reached the end of the tunnel there

was a great rush of supporters from behind me and I was carried

along with the crowd on to the terraces.                      I tried to turn to get

out but it was impossible to go back.

      I managed to edge over towards the wall so that I could

 stay near the back of the terraces.             Even so,    I was carried

 down about 10 steps by the surge of the crowd behind me.                 I was

 then pushed back up by people in front and ended up with my

back pressed up against a barrier.              Because of the pressure on

my back I ducked down under the barrier and forced my way up

on the other side.       I worked my way back up the steps with

difficulty until I was just below the stands.                A girl beside

me, who was with her boyfriend, was on the verge of passing out.

I helped to pass her up to people in the stands.                Between us,

I and a couple of other blokes, passed up several more

supporters into the stands.        I was then pass ed up myself by

other supporters.       From there I helped to pull up more people.


     When I looked down from the stands              Isaw a mass of

supporters crushed up against the w a l l .Some             people were

climbing over the fence.      When I had done         all I could I   left

the stand and went out of the ground.


     I have been a football supporter for nearly 30 years and

have travelled to matches all over the country.


     In my opinion the policing outside the ground was pathetic.

I do not think that there was sufficient numbers of police to

organise the supporters into proper queues.             There was a

complete lack of direction among the police.                Inside the ground

there was nobody to tell supporters where to go and there was a

lack of appropriate signs .              ............................... ... ..

       examined          in greater       detail        by the expert w i t n e s s e s at the Pu bl ic

       of    that day will          no doubt be the subject                  of debate,        analysis,

       s p e c u l a t i o n and c o n j e c t u r e    for man y m o n t h s    to come.

2.1.       The   t erm "Relevant         Event"    is u t i l i s e d to h i g h l i g h t     those

           to a lso examine o ther           "Relevant       Events" under             item 4.0 that           took

       p la ce before           15th April,       1989.      It is r e c o g n i s e d      that e ac h and

    We had no option but to join what a p p e a r e d to be the back of the

    The situ at io n q ui c k l y b e c a m e u n c o m f o r t a b l e and m a n y of the fans

    complained        in no u n c e r t a i n terms       to two,     by now,      h e l p l es s

    P o l i c e m e n who had p o s i t i o n e d   them se l ve s c lose to the wall near

The        pressure of the c o n f i n e d c ro wd b e ca m e            increasingly

unbearable.             I co ul dn 't move,          m y arms w er e     lock ed into m y chest.

I quickly          lost track of time.                One e l d e r l y m a n   in the c ro wd was

p e r s p i r i n g profusely.          He was       trying    to b l o w air on to his cheeks

be contin uo us ly changing.                  The m a n was o b v i o u s l y distressed.               The

thought        crossed my m in d         that he w o u l d not be able to w i t h s t a n d

the heat and pressure.                   The s it u a t i o n w as p o t e n t i a l l y   lethal.

          their backs and other sharp o bje ct s w h i c h had been i n a d v e r t e n t l y

          placed        to the d is ad va nt a ge of others.



3.9.      The w ho le e x p er ie nc e w as hot and tiring.                       We had been         in the

          queue        for about     20 m inutes and had h a r d l y m o v e d forward.                     It

          appeared        to me    that the p re ss ur e of the crowd was a c t u a l l y

          lo ck in g     individuals w i th i n the mass                 and thus p r e v e n t i n g   those

         near       the front f ro m act ua ll y g e tt i n g             into    the   turnstiles.



3.10.    M a n y of the crowd sensed that                     the s i t u a t i o n was p o t e n t i a l l y

         lethal.          The c r o w d ’s p a t i e nc e b e g an to b reak as -kick-off                 time

         appr oache d.         W h en     the f r u s t r a ti o n and d i sc o m f o r t b ec am e

         u n b e a r a b l e m a n y of    the crowd s t ar t ed s h o u t i n g for the g ates                  to be

         opened.



3.11.    I n o t i c e d some young lads               c li m bi n g up d r a i n p i p e s   etc.   to a vo id

         the    crush and get             into the Stadium.               I c o n c l u d e d that   their

         p a t i e n c e had snapped.           The     thought n ever          c ro s se d m y m i n d w h et h e r

         or not        these fans had tickets.                  W it h   the b e ne fi t of h i n d s i g h t     I

        still       can't consider           that a n y b o d y w i t h o u t    a ticket w o u l d q ue ue           in

        s uch u n c o m f o r t a b l e   circumstances.



        Due    to the      locking effect of the pre s su r e                    of   the crowd       I was

        f ac in g      the blue    conc er ti n a gate and saw the same being o pe ne d

 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

 Statement of

Myself and 3 friends travelled by car to Sheffield.  We left Formby at
10.45 a.m. and arrived in Sheffield at 12.30pm.  I am not sure which road
we used to cross the penines, but it was not the M62 or Snake Pass. We
experienced no hold-ups.

We parked at a friends house near the Ranmore Public House, Ranmore. We
went tp a small pub on the outskirts of Sheffield.   There were about 10
Liverpool supporters and a few locals in there.   We took a taxi to the
ground at about 2.00pm/2.10pm and were dropped off about Jmile from the
ground.  We arrived outside the Leppings Lane End at about 2.45pm.   There
was a bit of a crush getting though the outer perimeter gates. I saw
2 or 3 police on horses but didn't see any on foot.   There was no
semblance of order and there was no proper queuing system. We pulled a little
lad, about 10 years old away from a crush barrier.   I saw people climbing
over the turnstile wall.

Last year at 2.45pm I was searched by police, lined-up in a properly
organised queue and I saw large numbers of police on foot.

In the turnstile queue the crush was bad - one lad's face was actually
pressed against mine and a friendg.arnwgag also pressed against my face.
People were shouting that they were in pain or demanding to know what
was going on.

I asked a police officer on horse-back if the kick off was going to be
delayed.  He did not say anything, perhaps he didn't hear me.  Fans
were singing at the rear of us but I saw no indication of drunkeness.
I saw only on arguement between 2 lads.  I got through the end^iurnstile
(No.16) almost without my feet touching the ground.  There was.deliberate
or selfish pushing and shoving.  As I got past the turnstile tne police
opened the side gate.  We managed to go through the gate into the area
behind the West Stand turnstile.  Virtually no one came through behind
us. At first we went up the staircase to the West Stand seating area
but realised our mistake and went through to the North West Upper Terrace.

Last year I was in the pen adjacent to the South Stand.  The pen was
packed out so at half time I went round to the North West Upper Terrace.
I know therefore how to get to that terrace.

This year we got to the terrace at about 2.58pm.  It was quite full,
below us the pen looked empty; the pen adjacent to it seemed half-full
but the two pens behind the goal were packed.  I saw people on the
perimeter fencing. I thought they were trying to get a better view.

At 3.05/3.06pm it was still empty below us but people were clambering
over the fences behind the goal.  I saw one fan run and speak to Bruce
Grobbelar and another supporter spoke to Steve McMahon and pointed to
the area behind the goal.   The referee stopped the game.  After the
police arrived behind the goal hardly anyone seemed to climb over.
At about 3.25pm some fans and police started to rip the fence down.   Police
officers moved across the pitch - I couldn't understand what their role
was.




                                                            -/2-
When I was outside the ground there was a good atmosphere.  There was
fighting or drunkeness and I didn't notice anyone without a ticket.
I cannot recall police officers shouting any instructions.  The
organisation was very poor and the police horses added to the problems

                      HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Statement of
Bootle.


I travelled to Sheffield by Barnes Coach Company.   We left
Liverpool 20 minutes late at 11.05 a.m. following a police
search for alcohol on the coach.  I didn't pay much attention
to the route we took but there were several delays.   I think
we arrived in Sheffield at about 1.50 p.m.

We went to get a drink but the pubs were either closed or full
so we bought some cans.   I am not really a^drinker and it's
very rare I have a pint.   We walked a^ay'"-J--g^g^the turnstiles.
It was 2.2 0 p.m. when we got outside and therd were no queues
at all, just a mass of people stretching back from the
turnstiles almost up to the outer gates.

After being in the 'queue' for about 5 minutes I began to get
worried because of the crush. In over 2 0 years of watching
football matches this was the first time I have been frightene
I called a police officer on a horse to close the outer
perimeter gates and relieve the pressure on us.    The police
officer was telling people to move back but we said it just
wasn't working and the gates should be closed.    After a
 short time he was shouting 'gate' to mounted officersby the
gates but I don't think they heard him.    He then went off on
 'Rosy' (his horse's name).

His departure left a space which I mo ve d into.  A large surge
then propelled me through to turnstile 'A'.    I did not take
my ticket out and the turnstile operator didn't say anything
as I went through.  I met up with my 2 friends and we went to
the newest police officer and told him that unless something
was done about the crush outside then someone would be killed.
He looked through the turnstile and said it was bad but there
was nothing he could do.

We were inside at 2.35 p.m. - I know that was the time because
I lost my watch in the crush and asked my friend what the
time was.  There was no signposting around.  We went to the
toilets and as we came out I saw another 3 or 4 lads having
a go at     police officer about the chaos outside.   I
intervened"on behalf of the policeman and told them there was
nothing he could do.  The policeman then walked away.   We
bought programmes and went towards the tunnel.   There was a
stairway to the West Stand and a steward and policeman were
standing at the bottom of the stiars.  My friend asked them
how you get to the terraces and they pointed to the tunnel.
There were no stewards by the tunnel.  At the game in 1988 I
had a ticket for the North Stand.

We went down the tunnel and went into the left-hand pen and it
was quite packed.  We tried to move to the side but there was
a fence in the way so we went back up the tunnel, turned right
through a gap in the wall and went onto the North West terrace
We stood at the rear of the front section.  I can't be certain
of the time but we could see the big crush behind the goal.
The terracing by us was almost empty.
                              -2-


A lad came in and said they had opened the gate - I thought he
meant the fans.  We noticed there was a lot of crushing now
behind the goal and from the time the players came out it was
obvious something was wrong as fans were climbing over fences
into the side pens.

I didn't realise how serious it was though until I saw a dead
body.  My general impressions about the disaster were that
the fans did more to help than the police, that whilst police
were standing across the pitch the fans were running around
using hoardings as stretchers.  There were police officers
helping but for each one there must have been 10 fans.  We
knew that there was a problem from 2.30 p.m. onwards and I
can't understand why the police didn't see there was a problem.

The police operation seemed strange as there was a heavy police
presence on the road to the ground which got less and less as
you approached the stadium.  Outside the stadium I could only
see 2 mounted police controlling the supporters.   I don't
remember much about the 1988 police operation.   In terms of
stewards I didn't notice any in 1988 or 1989 but that is not
unusual because they are just part of the scenery.   In 1988
I went by car, left Liverpool a lot earlier and drank in a pub
with Forest fans.  There was no trouble and we walked into the
ground together.  This year the police seemed more intent on
keeping people apart.

At the Taylor Inquiry the police keep saying 2.45 p.m. was the
time when the problems outside the ground were apparent.  At
2.25 p.m. there was chaos outside and the police from the
surrounding streets should have been used to help the situation.

Statement of



I booked with BarnesiCoach Travel to go to Sheffield although
the vehicle I got on had 'Proctors Coaches' on it.  We were
due to leave at 10.45 p.m. from Priory Road, Liverpool but the
police searched each'coach for alcohol and it was not until
11.15 a . m . (a p p r o x . ) that we set off.

We travelled on the M62/M1/A61 route and there was very heavy
traffic around Manchester.  We arrived in Sheffield at 1.50 p.m.
(approx.). We were held up again when the Sheffield Police searched
the first coach in our 4 or 5 strong coach 'convoy'.

We eventually parked by a brewery at around 2.00 p.m.  We then
tried to find toilets and something to drink as the police had
not allowed us to stop at the Services on the motorway - they
waived us straight through.

We went to Gateways and bought 2 or 3 cans each.   There were a lot
of fans there and police but the police didn't stop us.   We
bought chips from a shop in Leppings Lane   and got to the ground
at around 2.20 p.m.  It was crowded outside the turnstiles and
the 'queue' stretched beyond the outer gates.   There didn't seem
many police about.  I could see two on horses in the terrace
turnstile ara and two on Leppings Lane.   We walked through the
outer gates and after a couple o f minutes a big crush developed.
One of the police on horse-back shouted for fans to move back
but it was impossible.  I was in front of the police horse with
my brother-in-law and a friend when the horse began to panick.
Two young girls were directly in the horses line of movement but
we managed to pull them away as the horse moved off.   The horse's-
stirrups hit me causing bruising.   The horse went forward either
under control of without control but as it did it brought it's
head down and his nose hit one of the girls on the head.

When we got to the turnstiles we had to struggle to avoid being
trapped on the brick corners because the crush was still
considerable.   As soon as we got through the turnstiles we
complained to the officer about the pressure outside and told
him to radio for help.   He just shrugged his shoulders.  We then
went to find some stewards but there were none around.   After
going to the toilets we went down the tunnel because we thought
that was the only route to the terraces.   There were no signs
showing directions.   It was about 2.40/2.45 p.m.  We moved to
the left side pen as we came out of the tunnel.   It was really
packed so we decided to move back off the terrace and back up
the tunnel.   By this time there were quite a few fans coming
down the tunnel.   We then went through a gate to our right and
managed to find the North West Upper Terrace.   We took up a
position at the front of the upper terrace and had a good view of
everything that happened.

We could see at this time (2.50/2.55 p.m.) people trying to climb
out.  We could hear people screaming yet by us you could have sat
down.  The police were beckoning the fans to get back into the
pens and not to climb the fences.
When people were getting carried out we thought at first they had
fainted.  We had a radio and it started to announce death figures
of 2, then 5, 7 and up to 17.

My final comments would be why were there no stewards to direct
things, why were no queues formed outside the ground and why was
there such lousy organisation?  On our way out of Sheffield at
about 7.00 p.m. a brick hit a window on the coach but it didn't
break.

STATEMENT of


         I went to Sheffield by coach booked through Barnes Travel.         We
left at 11.00 a.m.    from near Everton's ground.      There weipe no serious
traffic delays and we arrived at the coach park by the Ba|s Brewery at
1.30 p.m.      There was no drinking on the coach.


         I walked about with some friends and we got to the Ground at
2.21 p.m.      There were fairly large crowds outside and I noticed no
one was being directed and there was no queueing system.         The police
had lost control.      There were a few police officers around and
supports were     asking them which way to go.


         The situation looked confused but not dangerous.      I joined the
'queue' but after a couple of minutes there was a crush and it became
difficult to stand up.      Fans were now climbing onto the walls and
shouting for the police to do something.         The two officers on horses
just shouted to them to get down.      I ended up by a horse and was thrown
against it.      The horse was stamping around and seemed frightened.
The police officer also looked frightened and he moved off on the
horse.      I thought he did well tokeep the horse under control.


         People were shouting for the outer gates to be closed because the
crushing was so bad.      I got through the turnstile and saw a young
policeman and grabbed him by the lapels (which is not normal behaviour
for mel) and said "you'd better fucking do something - shut the outer
gates, delay the kick-off or else someone will be killed."         It was
2.35 p.m.      He said "I've got to stay here."      My friend said something
to him as well and then 3 lads had hold of him and they had to be calmed.


         I then went to the toilet, and bought a programme when I came out.
2 Friends with me wanted to get on the terraces so we went down the
tunnel.      It was just after 2.40 p.m.   The terrace was quite packed.
We went to the left side where the crush which was unpleasant but not
too bad.      We moved over towards the side fence about half-way up the
terrace.      The crush was no<Uterrible yet we could see the empty terraces
in the adjoining pen.
       We managed to get '{jack out through the tunnel and I said I was sure
there was a way to the top'terrace which is where I went in 1988.          We
eventually got there at 2.50 p.m.


       Just before kick-off we could see people being pulled up into the
west stand.      I didn't think this was unusual because sometimes you see
fans bunking into the stands.         I did not see any stewards on the
terraces or by the tunnel but they were on the areas leading to the
stands.


       After Beardsley hit the bar I noticed people climbing onto the
pitch perimeter fence.         The centre pens did look odd as there was just
no movement, no swaying.        Once the game stopped a wave of pecple came
over the fences.      What was strange was that the police at the packed
pen nearest     to us were helping fans over but they seemed to be stopping
fans in the     other pen.     There seemed to be arguments going on with the
police and I noticed some kids run across the pitch to the Forest
end.    The police then came out and formed a line across the pitch.


       I saw    3 or 4 lads holding the mesh on the fencing and rocking it
in order to     rip it away.     2 police then helped and the mesh was removed
and fans were pulled out.         I saw loads of police standing doing
nothing and at the other pen the^ were still pushing fans back in.


       There were no announcements coming over the tannoy.


       When the bodies started to be carried across the pitch an ambulance
arrived.       Instead of going across the pitch it went along the perimeter
track and injured fans had to be moved out of the wayl


       People with bowls of      water then arrived.    I saw fans being
given the kiss of life and I saw a body where the face had gone black.
I turned my radio into Radio Hallam and they were calling for all
medical personnel to report to their appointed station which I thought
might be the authorities implementing an emergency plan.


       The tannoy finally announced something and asked for us to stay
were we were as the roads outside had to remain clear in order that
the emergency vehicles could get through.         I was in a state of shock
and left the stand when the game was abandoned.         When we got outside
the street was filled with fire engines.
     The people of Sheffield were great and they let us use the 'phone.


     My comments on the organisation and what has happened since are
that last year our tickets were checked before we got to the turnstiles,
I saw incredible acts of bravery by police officers, other officers
helping and others doing nothing.      The only act of violence I saw was
when we went home on the coach and someone threw a brick.      It hit the
window next to me but thankfully it didn't break.


      Such was the crush inside the ground I saw a guy walk from almost
the front of the terrace, stepping on people's shoulders, to the back
and then get lifted into the stands.

    Statement of



    I travelled by car with 3 friends and we left Liverpool at
    10.00 a.m.  We travelled to Sheffield using the Snake Pass
    and the only traffic delay was at Stockport.  Ke arrived in
    Sheffield at approximately midday and went to the Fox Public
    House for a couple of drinks.

    After we left the pub we parked the car about 2 miles from the
    ground - we actually thought the ground was nearer.   We got to the
    ground at about 2.45 p.m. and there were thousands outside.   The
    crowd didn't stretch back onto the road itself.   We walked through
    the outer gates to try and get into the ground.   There was a
    police officer on a white horse (I think it was white) and the
    horse was moving around in order to get people from the gates.
    I lost 2 of my friends in the crush.  I was crushed against the
*   barrier dividing the turnstile area from the adjoining road.
    I managed to get out of the crush and decided that I wasn't
    going to try and get in the ground until the crowd cleared.

    The concertina gate facing the road then opened and I walked in.
    About 50 or 60 of us got in before it was closed again.  A copy
    of my ticket is enclosed.  I think there were 2 police officers
    and a steward controlling the gate.  It was about 2.55 p.m. and
    I met one of my friends who got through the trunstile.

    I went to go down the tunnel to the terraces but my friend shouted
    for me not to as he had been there last year and people had been
    badly crushed.  Last year I had a seat in the North Stand.  I
    managed to get back out of the tunnel using the handrail because
    there was by now a big rush of fans going down the tunnel.

    We went through the gate dividing the West Stand and terrace
    yards and saw a steward at the bottom of the stairway leading to
    the stand.        We asked if we could go into the West Stand because
    of the crush on the terraces but he wouldn't let us in, so we
    c a r r i e d on and got to the North West Upper T e rrace.

    A young lad tried to climb into the North Stand from the terraces
    and 2 police officers pulled him off the fence onto the wooden
    seats and he was kno c k e d out by the fall.

    Later on we climbed into the North Stand and there was a lot of
    arguing amongst the supporters in there.  I think that it was
    caused by confusion about what was happening.   We stayed until
    4.00 p.m. and then tried to phone home.

    I think there were thousands without tickets because         as soon as

      I travelled by mini-bus to the match and left Liverpool at
11.00 a.m.   We travelled on the M62 and Ml.  We stopped at the
services for h hour.   There were several traffic hold-ups and
about 3 miles from the ground we were stopped by police and
oinked if we had tickets.  Everyone had stand seats and I had a
terrace ticket.   We eventually arrived at the coach park/car
park at 2.15 p.m.

     On the way to the ground we stopped at the Chip Shop.         I
did not see any drunks or bad behaviour.         We got to the ground
at 2.30 p.m.    There was a large crowd outside the perimeter
gates.  At about 2.50 p.m. people started panicking thinking
they would miss the k i c k - o f f . There was a surge and a big
crush and I ended up by the dividing fence between the terrace
and West Stand queuing areas.         I climbed up onto the fence.
There were two police on the roof of the West Stand turnstiles
and they help e d me onto the roof.       The police on the ground
side of the West Stand turnstiles then helped me down.
There was no ticket check — I have sent my unused ticket
to Liverpool F.C.

      I thought about trying to get into the West Stand seating
but I didn't.       Instead I walked through the side gate and into
the area b e h i n d the terrace turnstiles.  I then went down the
tunnel to the back of the terrace.       At 2.57 p.m. there was a
huge surge from the back and I ended up right in the middle
stuck on the corner of a crush barrier.       I was very scared
as I suffer from a s t h m a . An old man next to me was right on the
barrier.   He said "help me son" and turned blue and passed
out.   I said "I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do".       He did
live because I saw him later in the newspapers. There was
another surge and I ended up down at the front.       I could feel
people on the floor pulling at my legs.       I got onto the fence
and worked my way along to the pitch exit gate, a policemen
pulled me out and then as I lay on the floor he checked my
ribs.   I was in tears and shaking.      Two lads came to see if
I was O.K., they put me in the semi-circle on the edge of
the penalty area.       I lay there for about 10 minutes.   I got
up and saw people lying dead, I broke down again.        I went
over by the South Stand and sat on the cinder t r a c k .

     About 3.40 p.m. a man in what looked like a Sheffield
Wednesday club officials outfit told me to move-off.  I just
said "people have died" and he said "the games got to go on".
Three Liverpool fans aged 18/19 then told him to leave me
alone, which he did.

     A few minutes later some stewards and young people came
out with water and cloths and gave me a cup.   The Forest
fans chanted "You'll never play in Europe" and I saw some
very distressed Liverpool fans try and charge at them but
the police line across the pitch stopped any trouble.

match was abandoned.  I then went back to the pitch access gate
and left the stadium.     '

I travelled to the match by private car, leaving Warrington
at mid-day.  There was a small hold up at the M67 inter-change
with the.A57 but that was the only traffic hold up we experienced

At 1.15 p.m. we stopped for a drink at a pub overlooking a
reservoir approximately 8 miles from Sheffield.     We then
travelled to Sheffield and parked at about 2.10/2.15 p.m.
We approached the ground from the Notts Forest end and got to
the ground at 2.25 pm.    On the w a y to the ground we noticed
a lot of police officers standing at the end of each side
road in groups of 3 or 4.   Last year I approached the ground
from a d ifferent direction so I cannot compare this part of
the police operation.

When we approached the ground there was no check for tickets
by the police - last year there was.   We were 10 or 15 minutes
earlier last year when we had no problem getting into ^the
ground.  This year there was chaos.   I saw police officers
searching fans as they wen t in through the turnstiles and this
obviously caused delays.

I saw no drunkeness just high spirits.     I joined the 'queue'
for the North Stand and was pushed over towards the wall.       I
said to a nervous looking police officer that the outer gates
should be -closed until the crush wears off.    Lots of people
outside the ground where asking police officers w h y there was
such a lack of control.     Its quite reasonable for people who
paid £14 for a stand ticket to arrive at a c r o w d 30 minutes
or so before kick off to be annoyed if there is a poor pplicing.
Unfortunately m a n y police officers reacted badly to genuine
concerned people, who w ere m a king what they thought were useful
suggestions.

I saw several wo m e n edging their way along the side wall to
escape the crush.     We m o v e d away twice. There was no proper
queuing system enforced.

The concertina gate was opened and we just went in - t h e r e was
no ticket check until we got inside the North Stand itself.
My seat was located in line w i t h the edge of the penalty area
about half way up the stand.    I got there just in time for
the kick-off.

When Notts Forest attacked just after Beardsley hit the crossbar
I noticed people being pulled-up from the terrace into the
seating area.   Then I saw more and more fans starting to climb
the perimeter fence.   The m a t c h was then stopped after an
officer climbed onto the pitch.       A man next to me said "someone
must be seriously hurt for them to stop the game".       I thought
a crash barrier had collapsed.       A youngster then walked along
the track around the pitch and past us - his arm looked badly
mis-shapen and he seemed very pale with shock.       A St. John s
Ambulance V olunteer then came over and helped h i m away.

onto the pitch and formed a line in front of the North Stand
and across the pitch.        Lads were running through the police line
with the improvised-stretchers.

The police d i dn't seem to b£ doing anything to help the injured.
Fans in our stand were shouting at them to go and help the
injured.  They just stood in a straight line.

I saw one Liverpool fan run towards the Forest end but he turned
around before he got there - he didn't look as if he was all
there.  The Forest fans b e g a n to realise it was a very serious
situation and they stopped taunting the Liverpool fans.

We counted about 20 bodies; someone said it's going to be worse
than Heysel.  A t 3.30 p.m. we walked out of the ground and saw
lots of ambulances parked outside.   A man with a radio said 5
fans were dead but we knew it was a lot more.

STATEMENT of


         We left at 12 noon and travelled by car.      We were delayed at
Stockport and just before we got to the Snake Pass but there were no
other delays.      We arrived in Sheffield at around 2.30/2.35 p.m. and parked
just off Browning Road.      We got to the ground at approximately 2.50/
2.52 p .m .


         There was a mass of people outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles and
people were on the road itself.      There was no orderly queue but we didn't
realise that    at first because      we thought we had    joints a queue.Iam
sure I heard    a police officer      say "don'tworry,     we're going toput the
kick-off back".      I can remember saying to two people either side of me
"did he say they were going to put the kick-off back".         There was no
sign of drunkeness or bad behaviour and I couldn't tell if people had
tickets or not.      Fans did try and form queues and the police did try
and get people to form queues.


         There was a bit of a crush and we were over by the metal fence
dividing the terrace queueing area from the West Stand queueing area.
The crush eased off and we started to walk following other people.            We
passed the barrier by turnstile G were a policewoman said "take your
time".      We just walked through the side gate.      The first thing we saw
was the tunnel and my ticket had B entrance on it so I thought B pen
was were I had to go.      I s$id to my mate we should get our tickets out
but he said there was no need b ecause they were not being checked.
We went down    the tunnel and a      girl caught her arm on the fencedividing
the 2 pens -    people held back      other fansso she     could be released.
There was a small crush but nothing to be scared about.


         We went into the left hand pen and ended up behind the goal
about two thirds of the way up the terrace.         At this point I wished I
had a stand seat because it was getting quite packed and very hot.            I
then noticed a man aged about 25 years pleading to be helped off the
crush barrier he was caught on.      I could still turn around so I tried
to push him off but I couldn't move him.      I accidentally knocked a
small chap next to me on the head.      I shouted to a police officer in
the Stand that he was getting crushed and needed help.         I don't know
if he heard me because he just looked beyond me and looked as if he
was talking into his radio.

climb o v er th e fe n c e and I'm s u r e th e y were g e t t i n g pushed back by th e
p o lice.     Y oungsters were b e in g p a s s e d ov er p e o p le s heads t o th e f r o n t .


         A pitch access gate was opened and fans were trying to get
through whilst others were passed overhead.                         I think I said to the
guy next to me that if we stay calm we will be alright.                                The crush
forced us further towards the front and I tried to stay off the barrier.
I saw a guy trapped under the barrief* who couldn't get up.                                I remember
shouting to people to invade the pitch in order to stop the match.
Some la d s went on t h e p i t c h .         I tu r n e d round and t h e r e were spaces
behind me.         I ducked under a b a r r i e r and went back towards th e
tu n n el.     I s h o u ted t o p eo ple "move back t h e r e ' s s p a c e " .        I saw a man
c r y i n g as he s to o d by th e e n t r a n c e and I asked him i f he was a l r i g h t .
He told me his mate was dead.                   I then turned and saw a large man in a
white T-shirt being carried by 4                     fans and a police officer.              It just
didn't register at the time that he might be dead.


         As I came down the tunnel, which wasn't full, a policeman came
in and urged fans to get out of the tunnel and back towards the
turnstiles.         When I got out of the tunnel I saw the big man laid out
but with no one attending to him.                     I thought about going over to help
but I thought that might stop better qualified first aiders from looking
after him.         If they saw me with him theymight have thought he was
alright* and was being looked after.


         I left the Ground at approximately 3.07 p.m.                            I saw a policeman
by a barrier on the first street off Leppings Lane.                               I said to him that
"people are dying down there."                   He didn't seem able to comprehend what
had happened.           I managed to 'phone my mother from                      the butcher's shop
and my mother wondered why I was                     telling her I was alive.             When I came
out of the butchers I saw loads of police bikes and people coming from
the Ground.          I walked back to the entrance and I could see fans stopping
others who were very distressed from going back into the Ground and
saying there was nothing they could to to save their friends.

Statement of
Wirral.


I travelled by car to Sheffield using the M56 and the Snake
Pass.  We left Wirral at 11.00 a.m. and the only traffic
problems we had were at Stockport were there was a 10
minute hold-up.  We arrived in Sheffield at 1.00/1.30 p.m.
We stopped at a pub about 10 or 15 minutes from the ground.
There were 4 of us and v.ve drank about 2 or 3 pints and
left at 2.20 p.m. (approx.). We drove down and parked
about 5 minutes walk from the ground. We did almost exactly
the same things as in 1988.

We approached the Leppings Lane turnstiles from the River
Don side.  In 1988 police stopped you before you got to the
bridge and asked if you had tickets.  This year they just
watched.  Two of us had terrace tickets and two had stand
tickets.  I went with my friend to the terrace queue and there
was already a large crowd of people stretching back across
the road.  I remember saying what a lack of organisation -
no queues and very few police and how different it was last
year.

I saw two police by the turnstiles, 2 or 3 on horse back and
a ra nked officer. There must have been 2,000 people trying
to get in and it looked like the police had given up.

I saw two lads climb over the wire mesh fence by the side of
the River Don and they walked along the River Bank and climbed
over the railings and back onto the road. We did the same and
as we climbed over the concertina gate was already open.
We w a lked through and there was no ticket check and there
was no running or pushing.    I noticed a couple of police by
the turnstiles but I can't remember seeing a steward.

We went straight to the tunnel and were made-up we had made
it before kick-off.       There was no rush in the tunnel.  We
w a l k e d onto the right hand terrace and made our way in front
of 4 or 5 people when there was a massive crush and surge.

We ended up against the barrier behind the goal (it was the
one that later collapsed) but managed to get under it and
help a couple of others to do so as well. Usually if you
can get past a barrier there is relief but the crush was just
as bad.

There was then a crack and the barrier collapsed and it got
me on the back of my legs.  I s a ^ p e o p l e tumbling to the floor.
I held a lad by his shirt collar but the surge took him away.
The crush got worse and people fainted.         You could feel people
on the floor grabbing at your legs.        I had hold of a lad
round his neck; he was down by my waist it must have been
like that for 10 minutes.  I noticed they had opened a gate
onto the pitch.  A couple of people got through.


                                                                 /-2-
                            - 2 -




The police then closed the gate.   The match was still going on.
Some lads got onto the railings and tried to pull people up
but the incredible hulk couldn't have done it.   The police
came over and told the m to stop it.  A couple of minutes
later the gate opened again.   The game had now stopped.  It
was opened for 4 or 5 minutes and then shut again.
A Sergeant gestured to ^a police officer not to open
it again.  It stayed shut for a period of time before
being opened again.

Fans getting into the West Stand and going back down the
tunnel must have eased the crush.    When it was cleared
behi nd us other fans pu lled us over the bodies piled up
against our legs.

We then helped to carry bodies out to the back of the terrace
where the police tried to revive them.  Some police stood
looking bewildered - they didn't seem to know what to do.

I went back to the front to try and find my friend but couldn't
see him anywhere.   I c arried on moving more bodies and helping
fans onto the pitch or to the back of the terrace.    I am
sure I carried the body of one of the Hicks girls.    I sat
down for about 10 minutes as I felt so light-headed I thought
I was going to faint.    A policeman came over and asked if I
was OK.   I was sitting up against the segregation fence to the
side pen.

A St. Johns ambulance person came over and asked if I would
stay with a lad who had broken his leg.. I stayed and spoke
to the lad for about 5 minutes until they took him off onto
the pitch on a stretcher.  The terrace was clear by now except
for bodies.

I went onto the pitch to         find my mate [and searched
for a good half hour. There were thousands    on the pitch and
I couldn't see him anywhere so I went back down the tunnel.
The Fire Brigade had arrived but I don't think there was
much they could to other than provide oxygen.

I made my way back to the car and            and the other lads were
there.  He had been p u l l e d into the stands.

We sat by the car for 10 minutes in a state of shock.   A lady
across the road came o ut with a tray of tea and offered us
the use of her phone.         phoned his wife who contacted
our wives and after thanking the lady we went home.

There were six        of us;      I and one friend had terrace tickets and the others were

in the stands.            Me and the other lad with the terrace ticket bought three, -cans

each of beer and sat by the bridge on Leppings Lane.                     There didn’t seem many

fans around and after we finished the cans we went in the ground.                           It was

about 2.15.p.m.         There was no queue.          I was searched after I went through

the turnstile.          There didn't seem many police about but I couldn't compare it                         -

with what happened last year             as I didn't go.       Once I had been searched I                     ^

didn't see any police or stewards.


We saw the tunnel and went down it and stood at the rear of the right hand pen-.

There was some jostling so we moved over to the left hand pen and stood on the

back step where we thought we might see some other mates.                         The gate into the

police gangway was definitely open at that time..


It was now about 2. 50 .p.m. and there was a good atmosphere.                       There was no drunkeness

or violence.         The teams came out and then there was a tremendous crush which

forced us about         two/thirds of the way down the terrace by the side fence.


A lad said the police had just opened the gates and |ucked-off and he showed                                  jj

me his ticket.          I got spun around and was facing towards the west stand seating.                      *

My arm was jammed between people and I couldn't move it.                          A lad managed to

move-off it so I could get my arm free.


 I had managed to turn round and face the front and use my arms to protect my

 chest but the pressure was intense.                  A man in front said don't panic but

 people were starting to panic0               If you fell down you wouldn't be able to get

 up, no one could create any space for you to get into.


 Fans were now climbing onto the fences at the front and side.                         It eased the

 pressure and gaps appeared.             The players had left the pitch but I still didn't


 know anyone had died.
I thought they would try and put everyone back on the terraces and re-start

the game so I went back up the terrace to look .for my mate and then get out

of the pen-.-      I found him at the back and he had gone through a similar

experience.       We then got lifted up into the West Stand.


We could see everyting that was happening - people being given the kiss of

life, chest pumping and a body with a coat o^qrthe head.       Fans were trying to

rip down the fencing.       I saw a policeman grab one, by the neck to pull him

away.     He was obviously high-up because he had braid on his hat and wore

brown gloves.


Within a couple of minutes the lad who was pulled away was back again this

time with police officers to pull the fence down.       It was like they realised

what was actually happening.       Fans were ripping down hoardings for use as

stretchers - it was like the fans doing all the work.       Some police helped

people over the fences but loads of them did nothing.


Other things I remember were prior to the kick-off a lad at the back with his

girl friend     was shouting up to police in the West Stand that she was being

crushed and they should let her up - they just ignored him.         I d i d ’nt see many

without tickets; there were very few asking for spares although one lad told

me he j                 ^           ^   I did not see any drunks.

Statement of

Aged   39

of



There was a group of seven of us who travelled to Sheffield for
the game in two cars.            These were: myself, my three sons (two
of wh o m were d r i v i n g ) , my two nephews and a friend.  One nephew
and the friend had stand tickets - the rest of us had tickets
for the West Terrace, "Leppings Lane Standing".

We left Liverpool at 9.30 a.m.  We went by the M62 motorway and
then via some minor roads to Sheffield.  I don't know the exact
route we took as I wasn't driving.

We stopped off just before we reached Sheffield and went for a pub
lunch.  We stayed there for about 3/4 - 1 hour.   We then carried
on to Sheffield.

When we arrived at Sheffield last year we were directed to parking
but this year there wasn't anybody to direct us.  We arrived this
time between 1.35 pm and 1.40 pm.

We parked just off the Peninestone Road, about 5-10 mins from
the ground.    After we parked up we headed away from Hillsborough.
We found a pub about 10 mins walk from the car.    There was a Police
Van parked outside the pub.    We stayed here until around 2.15 pm
and then w a lked back to the ground.

We got to Hillsborough stadium at 2.30 pm.   I've never seen so many
police on the approach roads to a football ground.   They were stopping
everyone and taking cans' of drink from people.

W hen we got there myself, my two nephews and two of my sons headed
for the terrace turnstiles.   The other two headed for the stand
turnstiles.

The area outside of the turnstiles was packed with people, right
out beyond the double gates which lead to the turnstile area.
I saw two police officers on horseback and one policeman on top of
the wall above the turnstiles telling people on another wall to
climb over.

Wit h having my 14 year old son w i t h me I was wary of getting caught
up in the crush outside the turnstiles, so I held back for a while.
Even then, I still had to move back three times to avoid the crush.
                               2 -



I told my other son and my two nephews to go ahead of us and
arranged to mee t them inside - over on the right hand side of
the Leppings Lane terrace.   They then went on ahead of us.

Whe n we joined the crowd outside the turnstiles there was a lot
of pushing and mo ving around, but. all of a sudden the'crush
seemed to ease off - although it was still very crowded.    This
was just before 3.00 pm.   My son and I eventually went in
through the turnstiles.   The game had just kicked off.

I later found out that the other three in our party who had
standing tickets had been swept in through.the open gate.
One of my nephews ended up heading down the tunnel and on to
terracing w hilst m y other nephew and my son, who had bee n to
Hillsborough before, went to the right hand side terracing.

Once we got in we headed right.  I didn't see any police     or
stewards until we were on the terrace.

We w ent right around the corner of the stand and up the steps
leading to the right hand section of the Leppings Lane standi g
area.   I saw two stewards at the top of these steps w h o were
watching the game.

We w e n t to the same place as last year, near the front.  We were
near the qate in the perimeter fence just in front of the police
control box.     We stood just in front of the first crush barrier
back from the perimeter fence.     There was plenty of room here.
This was where we met my other son and one of my nephews.

 The first indication we got that there was a Problem was “hen
 we saw people on the pitch. over a period of 3-5 m i n s . We siowiy
 began to realise that there was more to it than crowd
 as such.
 Mv first thought were to go and help, especially as one of my
 My nrs-c tiiuuynu        ^           to na s t years semi-final
 nephews was missing.  He hadn t gone to idbt yc
 so he didn't know the ground.
 However    there was a policeman on the pitch gate keeping us from

 IF iilrtroo^fntKiif
 the centre pens on the side nearest u s . He was sitting
 pitch and refused to go back onto the terrace.

 At this time people were being pulled form the centre pens and
 into the wes t stand.

 We stayed in the same spot until 3.50 pm.        We
 come down from the South Stand.      Later we saw Kenny 1Dalgli     _
 come down after w h i c h his statement was r e lj»ye^ Jn^Sncement
 for fans to help and keep calm.      This was the only announcement
  that I heard.
A policeman ont he pitch said that he'd seen at least ten people
dead.  We found out by then that the gate had been opened and
not broken down.  We still hadn't found my other nephew.

We left the ground and made our way back to the cars.   We saw
my neph ew near a telephone box and I asked him to call home and
tell everyone that we were alright.   This was about 4.20 pm.

When we reached the cars we left Sheffield near enough right away.

My neph e w who was split up from us sustained injuries to his ribs
(bruising) and he took two days holiday from work to rest and
recover.

I think that the problems were caused by a total lack of policing.
I've seen the two mounted officers I m entioned earlier at previous
games in Liverpool.  I did not see the horse lifted off the floor
by the crowd, as was claimed, even though I was quite near them
all the t i m e .

There were plenty of police on the approach roads but not enough
organising queues, etc in the area immediately in front of the
turnstiles - especially compared to last years operation.

Once inside the turnstiles there were no signs or stewards to
direct people to different areas.   I would say that most didn't
know that the end was separated into pens by fencing.   I was there
the previous year and I had no idea of this.

 STATEMENT of

           We both   travelled to Sheffield by private car on April 15th, 1989
 with our daughter and nephew both aged 17.                                   We each possessed tickets for
 the West Stand overlooking the West Terraces.


          At exactly 8.30 a.m. we left Runcorn together heading directly for
 Sheffield via the M.56, A.57 and A.616.                          We joined the latter on the
 outskirts of Sheffield which we followed to Middlewood Road parking just
 around the corner from the Ground itself.                            We did not stop on our journey
 arriving and parking at 10.30 a.m.                Though we experienced no delays I
 had to slow my speed so as not to arrive too early.                                        There were no police
 road-blocks en route and traffic was light.


          On parking we noticed a scattering of fans, a couple of whom were
drinking.      There was surprisingly a light police presence in the area
around Middlewood Road.       Based upon last year's semi-final experience
 1            decided to enter our party into the Ground at around 12.30 p.mm.
Between our arrivaland 12.30 we viewed the shops in the locality together
Neither at this time, on our journey, during or following those tragic
events of that afternoon did any of our party take intoxicating liquor.


          At approximately 12.30 we accessed the Leppings Lane crossing the
River Don     from the Middlewood Road.                 Upon crossing the bridge we met
no more than a few-hundred fans - many sitting around, others entering the
Ground.      At this time the mood of police and supporters alike was
pleasant and easy going.       We did witness a few fans asking for 'spares'
(spare tickets) requesting the location of 'touts'.                                         Normally this
activity is very open and a common feature but at this time it was below
the level one would expect based on my                                                experiences at such events.


          From last year's experience - where West Terrace and West Stand ticket
holders mixed in the inner      courtyard to the rear of the turnstiles - I
(Leslie) assumed we could enter any bank of turnstiles as there were no
signs or notices to indicate otherwise.                      Attempting to access the right
bank of turnstiles (those adjacent to the River Don) we were turned back
and directed to the next bank of turnstiles to our left.                                        I thought this
was stupid given fans with tickets for separate and distinct areas of the
Ground were able to mix beyond the turnstiles.                                                                      '
                                    - 2 -

        Before entering the unmarked West Stand turnstiles we were all
searched.     There being a normal police presence including some three
mounted officers and there appeared to be an office to each pair of
turnstiles at this point.      Here we were searched and we then entered
the turnstiles marked 'B 1.     Immediately beyond the turnstile we     were
searched again.     After being searched for a second time we looked and
felt lost.     We did not know where to go.     There was a small amount of
fans about at this time.      We walked straight towards the tunnel unable
to identify our point of entry.      Approaching the tunnel I (
realised this was not our way in.       I recognised that the stairs to the
right of the tunnel were those I accessed at last year's semi-final.


        Still confused we approached a steward on the staircase requesting
help and assistance.     He was the only steward we witnessed in this area
except for one solitary steward we saw inside number two tunnel.         After
visiting the toilets we followed the appointed staircase where our
tickets were further marked (the corner of     each ticket beingremoved).
We were directed by stewards to our seating where we witnessed a number
of stewards at each gangeway.


        We noticed that the Spion Kop end was half full as was the first
stand - this would now be about 12.45 p.m.       There was only a small section
of Liverpool supporters across the three pens below us.       Until 1.45 p.m.
approximately we noticed nothing out of the ordinary.       At this time the
centre pens (numbers 2 and 3) were filling up quite rapidly.      The    outer
pens were noticeably mostly empty.


        Throughout this time, and up until approximately kick-off time,
there was no stewarding or policing to these terraces, including all pens.


        At 2.30 p.m. pens    2 and 3 were full to capacity from our viewpoint.
Still the outer pens were approximately only one-third full.       It was at
this time that fans began to evacuate both pens traversing both sets of
railings.     It was clearly something more than the normal movement of fans
unhappy with their view.      The rapidity of the exodus increased reaching
a peak just before kick-off.      I (            only noticed Grobbelar
entering his goal and my attention from that moment on was to the centre
pens.    I told I      |that it was disgusting or words to that effect.
People could not move.      There was no fluidity to this crowd - it was a
solid mass.    Before kick-off those fans escaping on to the pitch were
                                       -   3    -


consistently being punched and thrown back into the pens.               Fans were by
now appealing to the police for help, pointing back to the extent of the
problem on the terraces.      We were by now very annoyed because of the
apparent short sightedness of police and stewards alike.               We noticed
the security cameras fixed to the right of the West Stand were trained

throughout on the central pens.


         The police approached a fan and spoke to him about his boisterous
behaviour directly in front of us on the concrete parapet of the West
Stand.     it was this incident that led us to follow each camera's
movements throughout.


         As far as we are concerned our frustrations at the time were further
increased by the belief that these cameras were witnessing problems we
had long adentified in the centre pens.             If they were not what were they
doing there?     From where we sat it seemed like an eternity.


         There was room in both outer pens before and following the tragedy
even before it was publicly announced that the game was abandoned.                  Indeed
when the police and stewards began to co-operate in transferring people
from the centre pens the outer pens were still not anywhere near full.


         Evan before 3.00 p.m. we could not understand why fans were not
entering outer pens.     I (|                  | not having    attended an away game
before was shocked and frustrated at what I witnessed before kick-off in

the centre pens.


         After kick-off I \           ~| watched brief snatches of the game whilst
I (I           I) did not take my eyes off the situation below me.             I(|_______
witnessed the egress gate to number three pen being opened twice in total
- just before kick-off and immediately following kick-off.                On each
occasion police pushed fans back using the gate opening as a means of pressing
fans back from the fence.       The    pressure was so strong no fans could have
evacuated the area even with the gate open!                   This made us even more
frustrated.     We saw one fan who escaped the crush trying to explain to
police, via his hand signals, the scale of the problem on the pens.                  They
grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and frog-marched him to the outer-

pen below the police look-out post.
                                    -   4   -


       From 2.45 p.m. the pens were solid full - a sheer human wall.
We felt from about this time onwards the situation, especially to the
people at the front of the terracing in both centre pens, was life-
threatening.      At this time people were unable to evacuate - as they had
been doing - the centre pens over the segregating railings because of the

sheer volume of people.


       Just after kick-off people from the rear of the pens were walking
over others who were standing solidly to escape the crush to reach the
outer pens.      I (            witnessed one woman trapped on these railings
 by her trousers.      Chaos now reigned everywhere.     Police, attempting to
drag bodies out over the perimeter fence were frustrated in their efforts.
Whilst some attempted to offer assistance other police officers stood and
watched.       Initially it was fans helping themselves to get out and to assist
the injured.       Slowly the police and stewards responded haphazardly.


        Fans carried their own injured on make-shift stretchers with the
 assistance of Red-Cross and St. John’s Ambulance personnel.        We watched
 helplessly as fans were lifted into the West Stand as events unfolded.
 The police stopped fans in their attempts to rip the perimeter fencing to           .
 pen number three from both the pitch and terrace sides.         The police in
 our view were using unreasonable       force in preventing what seemed to be the

 obvious - the need to remove the imprisoning fence.


        Other than the fans who were organised as to their activities the
 only officially led organisation came from the South Yorkshire Fire
 Brigade.      Upon their arrival a sense of organisation prevailed.       By this
 time it seemed like an age since kick-off - bodies were everywhere.
 People were still standing back watching just as if they were talking about
 the weather.      Throughout we felt the police lacked organisation and
 leadership.      In our view their sole concern, with the exception of some
 outstanding officers, was the containment of supporters behind the fencing
 even when fans spilled onto the pitch at the height of the crisis.
 Telling fans to move back when there was no room to mvoe did not help the
 solution.      There was no attempt to organise an evacuation of the centre

 pens from the rear as far as we could see.


           Until the Liverpool Manager addressed the crowd we had no official
  information, we didn't know if the match was to be continued or       abandoned
 and when the P.A. system was in        operation it was very difficult to
 comprehend the information.       The lack of information led to the Forest
  fans misinterpreting the real nature of the problem to the West Terrace.
                                         5


Because of this there was a real potential for conflict.        As it was the
police cordoned off the pitch across the centre-line.


           Before we left our seats we witnessedP.ressf3hotographers taking
shots of the dead and injured.       This upset many fans, including Forest
fans in the South Stand.       At approximately 4.10 p.m. we left the Ground.
Upon reaching      the inner-courtyard, from the staircase, there was a mass
of bemused, emotionally upset and frustrated fans were tunnelled into a
small exit.       This was an uncomfortable and frightening experience
especially as our daughter and nephew were present.        There was no
attempt by police or stewards to aid our movements or control and direct
the flow of human traffic.       This situation was heightened by the fact
ambulancement, fire vehicles, police vehicles and other private cars
blocked the exists of what is at the best of times a very narrow and confined
area to Leppings Lane.


       We left straight for home - no one talked, the mood was one of
disbelief and shock.       We assumed there were at least thirty people dead
and manymore injured.       Only when we tuned to Radio City as we crossed
the Pennines did we grasp the extent of the tragedy we had witnessed.
We stopped somewhere on the Pennines to telephone home.

A    P    P   E   N   P   A   G   E




To Statement of




                  Below z             I         offer a brief comparative account of the

April 1988 Semi-Final fixture at Hillsborough.


    1.            Last year I held a West Stand Ticket, leaving home between 10.30
    - 11.00 I drove along the same route with two others (my daughter and
    nephew both aged 16).                 We encountered numerous road works, police road

    blocks and very heavy traffic.


    2.            We parked on Middlewood Road some one mile from the stadium reaching
    this point at 2.30 p.m.                 We walked briskly to the Ground where we were
    confronted by a disorganised mass of fans many of whom were becoming
    boisterous and frustrated at not being able to access the ground.                      Numerous

    comments were made about the lack of turnstiles.


    3.            The police were aggressive and the mounted officers appeared to be
    unable to organise the flow of people, I and my party were pushed
    involuntarily through the turnstiles.                   My ticket stub   was    removed but
    it was not checked again.                 None of our   party was searched.       I saw little
    drinking though I could smell alchohol on some people.                    I heard nobody
    asking for spare tickets and I did not witness the presence of touts.                         I
    was throughout very frightened because of the pressure of the crush and the
     presence of mounted officers who added to the confusion.                      Mounted police

     were positioned at the turnstiles.


     4.           Once inside the inner-courtyard I was lost.            There was no signs
     nor indicators as to where I should enter the West Stand.                      There was
     however a greater stewarding presence in this area compared with April
     1989.            Only by listening to other fans who pointed to the relevant stair­

     cases did we find our way onto the West Stand.


     5.           The centre pens were full to capacity at kick-off and we took our
     seats.               The outer pens were relatively full though not full to capacity.

     This remained so throughout the course of the game.
6.     On leaving the stands we experienced a crush extending to and
including the staircase from the West Stand.     Until   we   passed the:.v;;
bridge over the River Don the drowd was solid.     No attempt was made
to control or direct the flow of people leaving the ground.        '-This"was
a worrying and disconcerting experience.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

STATEMENT OF:




ROLE OF POLICE

On the approach road to the stadium there were more Police
Personnel deployed than there were outside the ground.           There were
6 Policemen every 50 yards.           They were regarding the fans with a
certain amount of emnity.           As soon as our coach arrived 3 Police
Officers boarded the coach and asked fans to leave any cans of
beer behind, but I must stress - before the coaches left Liverpool
the Merseyside Police had boarded all the coaches and had
confiscated all the cans of beer and no cans of beer were on our
coach and the coach did'nt stop until we got to Sheffield.           They
also asked for banners and flags to be left behind.           They clearly
didn't trust the fans.           We were being treated like villans or
criminals.  The majority of fans are responsible people as regards
to the helping of the fans and victims in the crush.           I saw Police
with their tunics dishevelled and looking shattered.           These
Officers, though I must say, only some, had pulled their tripe out
in helping the victims and fans, but I also saw Police standing
around doing nothing.          I saw Police lining the north stand.    I
also saw a great huge line of Police form on the centre circle of
the pitch.  I still think more could and should have been done by
these Officers, though I'm not blaming them.           I am blaming those
in Police authority who could have deployed them more in the
rescue of the s u p p o r t e r s . There were enough of them in the
stadium at that time, which was about 3.35.           Had it not been for
ordinary supporters pulling the fans out or pushing them out ....

STEWARDING OF STADIUM

Outside the^ ground, before we went in, I notice 4 Policemen and
2 mounted Policemen from Liverpool.     We were searched by Officers
outside the turnstiles.    It was about 1.45 as we went through
the turnstile.    We were met by Police Officers on the other side
who searched us a second time.    Why we had to be searched a second
time after coming through the turnstiles, it was a waste of time.
We went through the tunnel and on to the Leppings Lane terrace.
It was half full and we    mingled into the crowd, but there were no
stewards around to guide people or to supervise the area.          When
the crush began there were again very few stewards around.           They
were on the touch line shouting for the people to move back.            But
sadly we just couldn't move back because of the wall of the goal
stand.    It had got to the stage where I was feeling hot and
     fighting to keep my footing.   I c o u l d feel something w c o n g .
I felt uneasy and frightened.
- 3 -


I saw of violence was when a photographer tried to take photo­
graphs of the victims belongings or injured belongings i.e.
scarves, trainers, hats that were left strewn on the terracing.
They chased him away.     I saw anger and frustration directed at
Police because the supporters were frustrated and angre, myself
included, at the way the authorities had penned us all in like
animals.   Frustration and upset at not being able to do anything.
I helped one fan, I carried him to the gate where a Policeman
took over and said "thanks for your help", I couldn't even give
that fan any first aid because I hadn't done much firs aid at
all.  He was cold when I felt him.     He was just motionless. I
felt his pulse, there was none.     I felt his neck - he was a
bit warm.   I saw 2 other people lying there.    One fan was
pumping hard on one of them trying to resuscitate him, then we
carried him away with the help of another fan and a Policeman.
I saw another fan lying with a cloth over his face.     I saw
people lying in a big heap of bodies on top of each other.     The
fans passed other fans up into the stands.     It was children and
women first, which was the order of the day.     As the bodies lay
there in that terrible heap there was a dreadful stench and I
though people w o u ld be dead, but not 95.  I am absolutely
appalled.

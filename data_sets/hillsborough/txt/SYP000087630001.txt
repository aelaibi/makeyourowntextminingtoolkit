              the       past       six       months.

              I qualified                in J u n e       1986    000686             at       Sheffield          Medical         School.        My

              information                was       that    there       was       a       paediatric             arrest      on    the    way    to    the

              hospital.                 At    the    time    I was          not          aware       of    any    other      details.           I d i d n ’t

              know       where          the    patient       was       coming             from       or    the    ci r c u m s t a n c e s   leading           to

              his/her          condition.

              I went       immediately                to    the    A       and       E    and       almost       at   the    same       time    the

               with     him,           The    boy       was       brought           into      the       resuscitation                   room          on       a

               stretcher              by    the    ambulanceman.                       I went       straight             over          to    this          patient,

               he     was    not       breathing.                 He       had    no    pulse,          I could          not       hear          a    heart          beat

               and     he    was       blue       in    colour             all    over     his      body.

               Together              with    other          people          present,          doctors             etc,       whom       I will             try

               and     name          later,       I began          cardiac             massage




               During        the       course          of    administering                 the      above          treatment                I became                aware

               that     there          were       other       patients              with      serious             injuries             arriving                at    the

               hospital.

               Once     the          first    patient             was       stable       I became             involved             witha              young          man

               who     had       arrived          at    the       hospital.                                                                                          He

               was     initially             assessed             in       the    resuscitation                   room           and    due          to    his

               condition              being       one       that       d i d n ’t      require          intensive                resuscitation                      he    was

               moved        to       another       room,           I did          not    go    with          this       persons              I would

               describe              this    patient          as       a    young       man    aged          approximately                   twenty                (20)

               years.            I    cannot       describe                this     person       any         further             and    do       not       know          if

               he     did    or       not-        I d o n ’t       think          he    did    die       find JL        would          be    surprised                   if

               he     did.

               ^ he                  person       that       I had          any     dealings            with       was       a    young          man       aged

               hair.         He       was    brought          into          the     resuscitation                  room          but    I am          unable             to

               say     by    whom.           He    was       unconscious,                he    w a s n ’t         breathing,                he       had       no

    to    another          r oo m .        He       was    definitely             dead    when       he    left    the

    resuscitation                room.              I do       not    know    who       transferred           this      patient          to

    another          room.

    I am    unable          to     give         a    better          description          of    this       patient       and    to       date      I

    do    not    know       his       identity.

    There       was    a    fourth          person             who    I had       dealings          with    and    to    the    best          of

    my    recollection                he    was       already          in    the    resuscitation                room    by    time       I had

    finished          with       the       above          patient.           He    was    a    young       man    probably       in       his

    mid    twenties           (20's ) with                 dark       hair.        He    also       was    unconscious         and        blue

    in    colour.

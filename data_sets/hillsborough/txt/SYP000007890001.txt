A PR IL,       1 9 &9 .
                                                                          s'




I am a S e n i o r          Registrar            in Di/afgnostic R a d i o l o g y             in S h e f f i e l d.        On     the

15th April,               1989,     I atteni^€d            the    Sheffield          Wednesday             Football       Ground

at      Hillsborough.               I was        at    the    edge       of    the    Hop,     in the        Nottingham

F o re s t end.



When       the m a t c h wa s        stopped           and. s p e c t a t o r s      from    the      Leppings          Lane      end

came       o n to    the    pitch,         all    I sa w       initially           were     people         who    were

limping.             At    t h is   time     I d id        not    see     anybody         l y i ng    on    the    ground.

However,            after     what    must        have       been     probably         10 m i n u t e s ,        I realised

t h at     the      situation        was     obviously            more        serious       and made         my way       down

onto       the      pitch.




At      a p p r o x i m a t e 1y 3 . 1 5    p .m ■ I w e n t        to    the      Leppings          Lane    end    of    the

                  spectators             and    police.           Only       a small        number       of    these       bodies          were       being

                  a d m i nist e r e d     to at       thi s t irne .           Having       a 1ready         contacted a             seni o r

                  police        officer         on    the      pitch        I set a b o u t    examining             as m a n y       of    the

                  I examined             probably        up     to 2 0       pe o pl e.      In m y      opinion        the      majority             of

                  these     were         already       dead.          Together         with    the       nurse       and    several             other

 ”                 was    dead and           gave       the    policeman               my       name.




                   W h e n we     were       satisfied           that        we       had       e x a m i n e d all        the    people         on     the

                   floor     I waited             for    further          instructions                  from        the     p ol i c e .      No      further

                   The    points        which          I feel       are      important              ar e      as    follows:




                   1.     There        were       no    c alls      via      the       public. a^Wrfess s y s t e m for m e d i c a l a n d

             from    the       other       en d     of     the    ground         t h at    the    situation          was    so    grav e .




             2.     As    far       as   I w as      aware,           there      were      no    a i ds   for   resits c i t a t i o n , s u c h

             as    oxygen,          airways,          or    suction         device         to    cl^tj^v^omit         from       the    mouth.




             3.     Assessment             of     patients            on   the    field,         some     of w h o m m a y       have     b e en

             able    to       be    resuscitated               wa s    hampered           by a    l a rg e   number        of    p e o p l e,   many

             of    them       very agitated.




             I hope       t hi s      is of       some      va lu e .       If    further         information          is       required        I

 For the attention of Mr W.B. Ashfield




 Dear Mr Ashfield,

 Re.    Hillsborugh Inquiry

 Further to our telephone conversation this morning, we enclose herewith
 a draft bill representing the costs of the six member practices of the
 Hillsborough Steering Committee covering the period 25th April to
 14th July 1989.

 One or two relatively small disbursements have still to be added to the bill
 and we will let you know the figures as soon as possible.

 The bill is still only in "draft" form but we do not anticipate any major
 amendments save that if the matter proceeds to a taxation there will be a
 substantial "taxation" item and possibly some small additional items.

 We shall be pleased to hear from you when you have had an opportunity to peruse
 the bill and o u r C o s t s Draftsman, Bill Cansfield will be pleased to let you
 have any information which you might require.

 Yours faithfully,




        K. M. Tamlin         W. A. "fvvemlow                     Elizabeth M. Steel                    Patricia A. Cottrell

                    a p p arent that there was a major problem
                    the teams were removed from the field
                    and the game was s u b s e q u e n t l y abandoned

                    There then followed a period when the
                    dead and injured were being removed froi
                    the ground and it was some time before
                    the matter of i d e n t i f i c a t i o n was
                    completed.  The result was that 95 peop!
                    had died with m a n y m o r e injured including
                    several suffering from brain damage and
                    other serious injuries.

                    which occurred and their consequences.

                    A l t h o u g h the events took place in
                    Sh e f f i e l d and were of national proporticjlns
                    the effects were most serously felt on
                    M erseyside, where most of the victims
                    resided, and the effect upon the local
                    p o pulation was devastating.       The passage
                    of time has failed to e l iminate the moot

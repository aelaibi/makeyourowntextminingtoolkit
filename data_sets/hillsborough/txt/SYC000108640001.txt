           EIGHTEENTH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

           WEDNESDAY 12th DECEMBER 1990

     THE CORONER: Good morning, Mr. Isaacs,   it is nice
to see you.

      Before we start with our first witness, can I
just say two very quick things.   We have reviewed the
use of the Mandela Room, that is the big reception
room at the back, and certainly on our assessment we
are not using it to any practical purpose and I
therefore intend to release it back to the Local
Authority so that they can do with it whatever they
like.   I take it nobody is raising any objections.

     MR. RUSSELL:  Sir, will you be providing any
alternative working area because, for myself, I find
it extremely convenient to be able to use the cubicles
sometimes to work?

     THE CORONER: I think the answer is no.  We have
made a few enquiries as to whether there are any
smaller areas available and up to now we have been
told no, but perhaps we could just make further
enquiries.  We may find that there is a room where you
could withdraw to, not necessarily on this floor, for
you to sit down, but I think we cannot justify keeping
a huge reception room like that available.

     MR. RUSSELL:  I understand that, but if it would
be possible to find such a room, it would be
conve n i e n t .

     THE CORONER: We will make enquiries and if we can
help you we will.

     The second point I want to make is this.  You
will recollect that there are a number of people who
have made PACEA statements, and what I intend to do,
again subject to anybody raising some absolutely
fundamental objection, is next Wednesday we will not
hear the PACEA statements because they are extensive
and long, but I am hoping next Wednesday to get one of
the officers up who was present when they were all
taken.  He did not do all the interviewing but he
happens to be an officer who was there throughout and
we will get him formally to produce the tapes, and so
on.  Then when we get to them I do not intend to
recall that officer because it seems to me an
incredible waste of manpower to have him sit here for
hours and hours, or days even, while we listen to
recordings.
                                                         2




          This is just a matter of pure practical
     convenience and next Wednesday seems to be a nice
     convenient day where we can do a few procedural things
     like that, simple things which are not really in
     issue.  If any of you were to think, "Hang on, I don't
     like it", you could mention it to me at some point
     later, but I hope that it will not cause you any
     particular difficulties.  It is not intended.

          Right, so we will start with the witness and I
     think it is Mr. Kerry.

                    PETER KERRY - Sworn

                      By THE C O R O N E R :

Q.   Can you please give your full names, number and where
     you are from? - A. I am Peter Kerry, P C . 790 of the
     Nottinghamshire Constabulary, Mounted Section.

Q.   You came over on 15th April on Mutual Support? - A.
     That is correct, sir, yes.

Q.   For practical purposes you were posted at the
     Penistone Road end? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q.   Looking after Nottingham Forest fans in the main? - A.
     Yes sir.

Q.   Were you actually at Penistone Road end or were   you
     behind the South Stand, can you just remind me?   - A. I
     was on Penistone Road and also at the main gate   at the
     South Stand looking after the players' entrance   and
     the coaches.

Q.   At the players' entrance, yes.  Is it right that at
     about 2.50 or so in the afternoon you were around the
     Penistone Road turnstile? - A. Yes.

Q.   That is where you happened to be at that point in
     time? - A. That is correct, sir, yes.

Q.   Did you, and I think perhaps another officer, receive
     a message to go to Leppings Lane? - A.  That is
     correct, sir, yes.

Q.   Did that come over the radio or word of mouth? - A. It
     came over the radio, sir.

Q.   Perhaps you do not know, but would it have been via
     control? - A. I don't know, sir, because I was working
     with a South Yorkshire officer, and he told me to go
     because I did not hear it on my own radio.
                           P. KERRY


I understand.  How many officers actually set off from
Penistone Road to get down to Leppings Lane? - A. I
don't know the exact number, sir, but I would suggest
about 8.

More than one or two? - A. The Nottingham officers
were doubled up with a South Yorkshire officer to
familiarise us with the area, and I think it was about
6 or 8.

That is good enough.  You came round, did you, via the
South Stand side, is that right? - A. After the call,
sir, yes.

So you were moving around within the ground? - A. That
is correct, sir, yes.

You therefore approached Leppings Lane end with the
River Don on your left-hand side, would that be right?
- A. Yes sir.

As you approached the area did you come up to a large
concertina gate, or close to a concertina gate on your
right-hand side? - A.  We rode past that gate, yes
sir.

If you would just turn round now, could you be shown
Gate C for a moment and just make sure we have got the
right one.  Is that the one? - A. That is correct,
sir, yes.

What met your eye as you were coming up? - A. When I
approached the area I saw that there was a vast crowd
of people outside the turnstiles.  It was a crush,
people were packed tight and I noticed that there was
an iron barrier down the river side of the turnstiles
and people were packed between that and the perimeter
wall.  People were being crushed up on the front of
the turnstiles, people at the back were pushing
forward.  The first thought of myself was trying to
alleviate the pressure at the front, but I couldn't go
to the front because this iron barrier was stopping
me, so I went further back and I endeavoured to push
my horse into the crowd, trying to push the people at
the back back towards the gates so that the pressure
would go off the front, but the crowd was that tightly
packed, I found I wasn't having any effect at all.

You were trying to enter the crowd from the side, is
that right? - A.  Yes, farther round the back.

But still within the perimeter gate section? - A. That
is correct, sir.
                                                         4



                                P. KERRY


Q.   Could you see whether the crowd which you were trying
     to push back, where you were trying to enter, did that
     stretch beyond the perimeter gate at that point, could
     you see that? - A. I was not really taking much notice
     of that at the time.  I was trying to get the crowd
     back against the turnstiles.  When I found that I
     could not do any good with my horse, I turned and
     looked towards the gates and I could see the people
     pushing through the gates there and I could see that
     the foot officers were having difficulty closing the
     middle gates.

Q.   The gates - do you mean the perimeter gates? - A.       Yes
     sir.

Q.   Carry on. - A. So I rode my horse down there and I
     endeavoured to assist the foot officers to close the
     centre gates so that it would take the pressure off
     the crowd inside.

Q.   Did that succeed, in fact, as far as you remember? -
     A. Yes, it did.  Eventually we managed to close the
     centre gates.

Q.   What effect, if any, did that have on the crowds on
     the inside of the perimeter gates, the ones who were
     moving forwards towards and through the turnstiles? -
     A. I think it alleviated the pressure a bit because
     people were not pushing so much and, as I say, I
     endeavoured to stay there to stop the gates coming
     open again.

Q.   You have mentioned the word "pushing":  did you
     observe this yourself?  Were people actually pushing,
     or were they in a position, the people whom you
     observed, that they were being pushed and had no
     option in the matter? - A. The people at the back were
     pushing forward and the people in the middle were
     being pushed, so they had not got any option but to
     push themselves.

Q.   So what you are saying is that the people who were
     caught by that metal bar presumably were trapped and
     could not do anything else? - A.  They could not get
     anywhere, sir, because the bar stopped them.

Q.   But the people further back, you feel, had some option
     in the matter? - A. Especially the people outside the
     gates.  I did try and shout to them to push back, but
     my instructions were just ignored in some places.
     They were that intent on getting into the ground.

Q.   Did you hear any announcements over loudspeakers at
     all? - A. No sir.
                             P. KERRY


Did you see a Land Rover by chance? - A. No sir.

Having then shut, or assisted with the shutting of the
middle gate, as you have described it, did anything
else happen that you noticed? - A. While I was there,
I noticed all of a sudden that the gate nearest to the
River Don suddenly burst open and all the crowd that
was outside the gate at the time, they rushed towards
this gate and they rushed past me.   I happened to look
over ray shoulder and I saw them going down to the side
gate which was open and after about 2 minutes the
people outside had just gone, it was just an empty
space.

The side gate, I think,   is the big concertina gate you
mean? - A. Yes sir.

You did not actually see it open? - A. No sir.     When I
looked round it was open.

You noticed there was a rush coming through the gate
by the River Don? - A. Yes sir.

Then you   turned round to see where on earth they were
going? -   A. Yes, that is correct.
Because,   of course, there weren't any turnstiles
there? -   A. No sir.

How much experience have you had of being a mounted
officer policing football matches? - A. 23 years, sir.

Is this an experience which you have had before? - A.
I have had a similar experience at the Nottingham
Forest ground, sir, where people do come late and they
try and push in and try and get in.  They push
forward, although the turnstiles won't take it, and no
matter how much you endeavour to stop them they will
keep pushing.

Was this a recent event, or a long time ago when you
had this experience at Nottingham? - A. I have
experienced this over a number of years, sir.
Although the area at Nottingham Forest is larger than
Leppings Lane, you do get pressure from people.  If
they come late like that they want to get in and just
will not listen to any reason at all, and sometimes we
have to force them back to alleviate the pressure at
the front.



                          /Q. I suppose if
                                                   P. KERRY




I suppose if a column of people which is pressing
forward is not too deep, you can if you have enough
mounted Officers actually move them back by advancing
against them, would that be right? - A. That is
correct, sir.  The actual move that we do is to start
at the back of the queue, because it is pointless
putting a horse in at the front, because you cause more
damage with the weight of the horse.  You start at the
back, ease the crowd back and then keep going forward
until the pressure is taken eventually off the front of
the crowd.

So you are trying to split them off? - A. That is
correct, sir.

What I want to be clear about, perhaps you can just
help roe, if I have a very long crowd, and there are
people continually coming in at the back, and I can see
that there is pressure at the front? - A. Yes, sir.

Are you saying that you    go right to the back and start
peeling off, or do you    try and start peeling by
splitting the crowd at some point? - A. We start at the
back, sir, because it is pointless starting at the
front.  You will get no pressure - people are still
pushing at the back and    if you try and force the horse
in at the front   you cause more injuries, so you start
at the back and take the pressure off.

Let me ask you then, why did you in fact then - forgive
me, I aia not criticise you but I am just want to
understand - when you came up you said you actually
went into the crowd from the side. - A. I tried to,
sir.

Clearly not right at the back, from what you told me,
because you said that the crowd was further out. - A.
Yes, sir.  I stayed inside the perimeter gates.  I
could not get to the front because of the iron bar, so
I went to the end of the iron bar and tried there, but
the pressure of the crowd was that intense it was not
making any impression at all.

You have told me that that is what you did,   but when I
asked you about   technique you said that the normal
practice is to go right to the back and start peeling
people off.  It sounds to me as if you did not do that
in this instance.   You went, as I understand it,
somewhere in the middle.   When I say middle I don't
mean that you had measured it, but somewhere within the
crowd and tried to split it? - A. Yes, sir.

That is right,   isn't it? - A. That is correct.

                                               P. KERRY




Why did you do that rather than say, my goodness me, I
have got to go right down to the end and start peeling
people off?- A. Because there were other horses outside
the perimeter gates.  I thought I would try my best to
do something inside the perimeter.

             Cross-Examined by MR. HALE

We keep getting a succession of firsts.  You are the
first Nottingham Forest Officer? - A. That is correct,
sir.

And I am sure many people here will be pleased, in a
roundabout way, to hear what you say, that the sort of
people we are talking about are not confined to any
particular city, are they? - A. That is correct, sir.

Have you policed at other football matches? - A. Yes,
sir, I have policed at Leicester, Derby and
Chesterfield.

Do you find that you occasionally get bad behaviour of
varying degrees from people in all cities? - A. That is
correct, sir, yes.

            Cross-Examined by MR. PAYBE

Did you attend the 1988 match? - A. I did, sir, yes.

Did you police that at the Penistone end as well? - A.
Yes, sir, I did.

On that occasion were you called round to the Leppings
Lane turnstiles? - A. No, sir.

Of course, the layout of the turnstiles at the
Penistone Road end is different from the layout at the
Leppings Lane end, isn't it? - A. That is correct, sir,
yes.

So far as you are aware, and the evidence which the
Jury has heard is to this effect, there was no problem
in 1988? - A. No, sir.

In 1989 this match you have been telling the Jury
about, can you compare the scene please that you saw at
2.50 at Penistone Road, compared with what you saw at
Leppings Lane? - A. The scene was very tranquil,
although there were quite a number of Nottingham Forest
supporters coming in, when they did come to the
turnstiles we just ushered them in quietly and they
went in, as good as gold, and we just carried on.
There was no pressure at all although there were quite
a number of people coming.

                                                  P. KERRY




Q. Can you compare the response of the crowd to
   instructions which you gave to them? Was there any
   difference between the behaviour of the two crowds? -
   A. You mean *89 and *88, sir?

Q. No. - A. On the *89 one?

Q. Yes, at *89? - A. No, sir.  The Nottingham Forest ones,
   they went in quite well but when I went round to the
   Leppings Lane end, I am not saying all the supporters
   but quite a lot of them, instead of listening to
   instructions they wanted to get into the match and they
   would not listen to any reason at all.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KING

0. Of course, Officer, when you arrived at the Leppings
   Lane end it was very shortly before kick-off? - A. That
   is correct, sir, yes.

Q. And the number of people you saw outside, you would say
   to yourself as an experienced Officer, it would be
   quite impossible for all those people to get in before
   kick-off, given the short period of time? - A. That is
   correct, yes.

Q. You would also confirm, wouldn't you, that the layout
   at the Penistone Road end is very different from the
   layout of the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end? - A.
   That is correct, sir, yes.

Q. And the major difference is of course that the Leppings
   Lane end, you have got this very narrow, confined
   entrance into the turnstiles you were looking at? - A.
   That is correct, yes.

Q. And that confined area does not exist at the Penistone
   Road end, does it? - A. No, sir.

Q. You have got flat walls, turnstiles in straight lines
   and a lot of space for people to move in? - A. That is
   correct, sir, yes.

Q. You also very fairly said to the Coroner that in order
   to relieve pressure in an area say between the
   perimeter gates and the turnstile area, what you have
   got to do is go to the source of the pressure which is
   at the back, there is no use starting at the front, you
   have confirmed that? - A. That is correct, sir, yes.

Q. It is well established now that if you say to someone
   at the front, "Push back", they are in an impossible
   position because they are being pressurised themselves?
   - A. That is correct, sir, yes.

You yourself endeavoured when you got to the end of the
barrier you have described, that metal barrier, you
described to the learned Coroner how you endeavoured
yourself to deal with the situation, but you could not
because of the pressure of the people who were there? -
A. That is correct, yes.

And I assume by that you mean the pressure of the
people still coming in through the perimeter gates? -
A. That is correct, yes.

So while you were where you were people were still
being able to come through to join the throng which was
already in the turnstile area?- A. That is correct,
yes.

And that was the problem you were trying to cope with?
- A. That is correct, sir, yes.s

I have no further questions.    Thank you.

                Further by T H E CORONER

I want to go over this business of breaking up the
crowd because it is an opportunity - in fact, you are
the last mounted Officer. - A. Yes, sir.

So I have got to do it with you - perhaps I should have
done it wit h somebody else    - the thing that puzzles me
is that if you have a column of people or a crowd or a
crush, or whatever word you wis h to use, and you have
other people joining at the back, it isn't to ray way of
thinking possible to ever get to the back because the
only way you can get to the back is to wait until
everybody has arrived, by w hich time it is too late.
Can you try and explain to     me what you mean when you
say you want to get to the     back, given that scenario
which is what actually happens when people are
approaching any football ground, be it here or anywhere
else? - A. If the crowd is coming and you have got an
orderly crowd you can do that.     If there is a vast
number, no matter how much time you try and keep the
horses at the back, as you say, there is always others
joining on at the front.    It is not always successful


Not at the front, you mean at the back? - A. At the
back.  It is not always successful but this is what you
try.  If you can imagine, you have only got a certain
number of horses and there are a lot of people coming,
and sometimes you do get overwhelmed by numbers, and
that manoeuvre sometimes does break down.  On a normal
occasion when you don't get so many supporters, that
manoeuvre does work.

                       ALBERT RHODES Sworn

                         Bv THE CORONER:

Q. You are Albert Rhodes, is that right? - A. Yes, that
   is correct.

Q. Is it                          A.

Q. In           , Sheffield? - A. Yes.

Q. Your job is as a foundry worker which is your main
   occupation? - A. Yes.

Q. But you also have for about nine seasons acted as a
   part-time turnstile operator? - A. Yes, this is my
   tenth season.

Q.    At Sheffield     Wednesday, is that    right? - A. Yes.

Q.    The job of a     turnstile operator   is what in a
     nutshell? - A. Just taking tickets or taking money.

Q. And letting people into the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. Is it in fact a difficult task? - A. It varies on the
   match, most matches are pretty all right.

Q.    What I meant     when I asked if it   was a difficult task,
     in the sense that it is a very technical operation or
     not? - A. No, it is not technical.

Q. I think when you first started you joined a more
   experienced man and watched? - A. Yes, that is
   correct.

Q. Once you knew what to do you just started doing it? -
   A. That is right.

Q. Anyway, by the time this match came along you had
   done nine seasons? - A. Yes.

Q.   About how many matches would you go to per season in
     round terms? - A. Probably 30. It depends on Cup
     matches.

Q.   A lot   of them anyway? - A. Yes.

Q.    Whatever else one can say, by the time the 15th April
     came around you had had plenty of practise? - A. Yes.
                                                              12




                                                       A. RHODES




    Q. I presume when you turned up you might be allocated
       to any turnstile? - A. Yes, anywhere in the ground.
B
    Q. On this particular day you were allocated to
       Turnstile C, is that right? - A. That is right, yes.

    Q. In the section A to G which was leading to the
       Leppings Lane terracing, is that right? - A. Yes.

    Q. The ticket numbers which you were supposed to
       receive, or the letters, how were they distinguished
       so far as you were concerned? - A. They were B and
       they had got Leppings Lane on.

    Q. Did they have a colour as well, do you remember? - A.
       Yellow.

    Q. You are sure about that because I think you may have
       got the colour wrong. Can you remember? - A. I am
       colour blind.
D   Q. Pardon? - A.   I am colour blind.

    Q. Yes, I remember that from another occasion now. We
       had problems with colour. Forget the colour.   It had
       a letter B on it? - A. Yes, and Leppings Lane.

    Q. It was intended for the terracing, is that right? -
       A. Yes.

    Q. What time did you start work? - A. I arrived about
       11 .20.
    Q. Pardon? - A. I got to the ground about 11.20.

    Q. What time did you take up your position? - A. About
       five to twelve.

    Q. This is a little sort of enclosed space where you sit
       or stand, I am not sure what? - A. Stand.

    Q. As a supporter approaches a turnstile you either take
       his ticket or the money as the case may be and then
       you depress a pedal which allows the turnstile to
       rotate? - A. Yes.

    Q. A quarter turn in fact? - A. Yes.

                                                            13




                                                    A. RHODES



Q. He goes through and the next one hopefully comes? -
   A. Yes.

Q. In the initial stages, say between twelve and one,
   did you have a lot of people there? - A. No, it was
   very quiet.

Q. Perhaps I should have asked you this earlier but did
   you do the 1988 Semi Final as well? - A. Yes, I was
   on that one.

Q. Were you by any chance on the same turnstile? - A. I
   was on the same set of turnstiles.

Q. You may not have been on C? - A. No, G I think it
   was.

Q. G was it? - A. Yes, I think so.

Q. Do you remember by chance - and I am talking about
   between twelve and one when you first opened - was
   there an appreciable difference in the amount of
   people who were coming through in 1988 as compared
   with 1989? - A. No, not really.  It was about the
   same.

Q. It was about the same, do you   say? - A. Yes.   It is
   always quiet at first.

Q. Then between one and two, did it begin to liven up? -
   A. Yes, it builds up.

Q. Can you say about how many you had let through your
   turnstile at say two o'clock? - A. At two o'clock
   about 200 to 300. I was counting them then.

Q. You were actually counting them? - A. Yes, I was
   counting them.

Q. Were you counting the tickets? - A. Tickets.

Q. So you are pretty sure about that? - A. Yes.

Q. At that time I take it everything was going perfectly
   smoothly? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you have a lot of problems at that time? - A. I
   had one or two try to get in, yes.

Q. Without tickets? - A. Without tickets, yes.
What did you do when that happened? - A. I called the
Police Officer from the inside of the compound.

Are you saying that you let them in and then got a
Police Officer to pick them up and throw them out
again? - A. It depends how they were trying to get
in. If they were pushing in two together, if they
get in, you have got to open your turnstile gate
inwards and push it back in towards the compound
again and then shout the Officers.

Supposing somebody presented themselves at the
turnstile without a ticket and said, "I want to get
in" between twelve and one when there is nobody else
there, if you do not depress the pedal they cannot
get through, that is right, is it not? - A. Yes.

Unless they climb? - A. Unless they jump.

Assuming they are not doing that, what would you
normally do? Would you throw them out and say, "Get
out.  I am not letting you in"? - A. Yes, or shout
the Officer on the outside.

Are you saying in some cases   you could not do this
because if there happened to   be two together? - A. If
they just sneaked in I would   have to get them on the
inside and shout the Officer   on the inside.

Were there many at this stage? - A. Not at that
stage, no.

Let us take the next half hour, between 2 and 2.30,
what happened in that period? - A. Well then, it
starts to build up.

Pardon? - A. It started to build up. The crowd got a
lot more and just built up to a crescendo.

I am sorry, I could not hear? - A. It built up more
and more in that half hour until it built up to a
crescendo.

We know from other people that from 2.30 onwards it
got a little bit more hectic and so I will deal with
that later but during this other half hour, of 2 to
2.30, did you have an increase of the number of
people trying to get through? - A. Yes, that
increased.
                                                          15




                                                 A. RHODES




Q. Were these people who had no tickets or had wrong
   tickets or what about them? - A. Just no tickets, no
   tickets at all.

Q. Were these people who at that stage were presenting
   themselves on their own or were they coming through
   with others? - A. Usually on their own.

Q. Did you in fact allow them in and shout to the Police
   Officer on the inside or did you ask them to go
   out? - A. Like I say, if they did manage to get
   through somehow I shouted to the Police Officers.

Q. If they managed to get through you said? - A. Yes.

Q. How many in round terms would you say presented
   themselves without tickets to you during that half
   hour? - A. Again it wasn't a great deal, about ten
   probably.

Q. When you made a statement you thought it might be 20
   to 25? - A. No, that was after.

Q. I do not care whether it is ten or not? - A. No, that
   was later on. If you look in the statement that was
   later on.

Q. I beg your pardon. So only about ten? - A. Yes, and
   it might not have been that.

Q. We are not talking about large numbers whichever way
   we look at it? - A. No.

Q. Were you still  able to count your tickets at that
   time? - A. No, at that stage I couldn't.

Q. It was too busy? - A. It was getting a bit busy.

Q. Then did the position change? - A. Yes.

Q. In what way? - A. Again it started to get a lot worse
   and people getting crushed in. They couldn't
   actually get into the turnstile. They were getting
   pushed into it. They weren't getting in themselves.
   They were getting crushed into it.

Q. Were these people with or without tickets in the
   main? - A. Most of them had got tickets actually.
                                              A. RHODES



Most of them had tickets? - A. Oh yes.

Was this the stage when you thought there might be
about 20 or so who had not got tickets? - A. Yes, as
it built up.

Did you have any impression of the fans? What were
the fans saying to you as they were coming through
the turnstiles? - A. As it got worse obviously they
were getting crushed and they were taking it out on
us and they were being abusive. Some tried to pull
the grille down on the front of the turnstile and
they were in general blaming u s . They were being
pushed into the turnstiles.

They were cross with you? - A. Yes, more than cross.

Because they were uncomfortable? - A. Yes.

That might not be the right word but that is what you
are trying to convey, is it not? - A. Yes.




                           / Q . What I am interested.
                                                           17


                                           A. RHODES



Q. What I am interested in is, as far as you could see or tell
   were these people who were coming through, firstly,
   distressed? - A. Some were distressed, yes. There were a
   certain number of females, they were in the worst state
   probably.

Q. How did they exhibit their distress? - A. Some were holding
   their arms and some were actually crying.

Q. Did any of them saying anything to you about the conditions
   outside? - A. I was asking them, "What's happening", and I was
   telling them to get a Police Officer when they got inside and
   get it sorted out, because I did not know exactly what was
   happening.  All I know is it was theworst I had ever seen,
   the worst thing I had ever seen.

Q. In what way was it the worst you had ever seen? - A. It was
   the largest numbers, you know.  I could tell with the
   pressure.

Q. Have you had pressure on the turnstiles before in other
   matches? - A. Not like that, no.

Q.    So this was quite unusual as faras you were concerned? - A.
     And for a long time as well. Usually you get a late burst,
     even in the Semi-Final, but this was going on like half-an-
     hour, probably more,- I don't know.

Q.    Was there anything else about the fans that you noticed    that
     was worth mentioning? - A . Well, ye s , some were drunk. A
     certain amount were drunk; certain stages of drunkenness,
     yes.

Q. When you say "drunk", do you mean rolling drunk or do you just
   mean you could smell alcohol? - A . There were various stages.
   Some were absolutely paralytic.  Some could not turn the
   turnstile, actually, to get the next person in. They had to
   help them through.

Q. Was this a handful of people or more, in that state? - A. I
   would say it was more. As I say, there were various stages of
   drunkenness.

Q. And eventually the crowd just disappeared? - A. Yes.

Q. You did not know why that happened, did you? - A. Not then,
   no.

Q. You found out later, but at the time you did not know? - A.
   No.

Q. From where you were could you see up Leppings Lane, up towards
   Leppings Lane? - A. When there are no fans in front of the
   turnstile I can see a certain amount, yes.

Q. But from 2.30 onwards? - A. No, I couldn't see anything.
                                                             18


                                            A. RHODES



Q. So you can't help us about what was happening further up? - A.
   No, all I could see was the next person or persons around that
   who had been pushed in.

Q.    Perhaps I could ask one other question. Youmentioned Police
     Officers on the inside. Two other things. How close to your
     turnstile were these Officers? - A. At the beginning?

Q. Yes. - A. They were a few yards away because they searched the
   fans as they came in on the outside and the inside.

Q. So there were Officers outside searching and Officers on the
   inside? - A. Yes, as in every match, most away supporters.

Q.   That isthe normal practice, is it? - A. Yes.

Q.   Later on what happened? - A. I could not get - I darenot open
     that gate.  It came to a stage where I dare not open that
     inner gate to get into the inner compound.

Q.   Which gate? - A. For me to get into the Officers inside to
     talk to them.

Q. Why did not you dare do that? - A. Well, the fans that were
   coming over were getting very abusive and threatening
   violence, actually, some of them.

                     Cross-Examined bv MR. HALE:

Q. Is it possible for people who are in a hurry to climb over in
   any way? - A. It is possible, yes, but it is hard to do.

Q. It is hard   to do.   Did any do that on this day? - A.   No, not
   jump over.    No.

Q. So the only way they could get in would be to squeeze through
   two at a time? - A. That is the normal practice.

                    CroBS-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

Q. When someone turns up at the turnstile without a ticket so
   that you have to call for help from a Policeman, what effect
   does this have on the flow of people through the turnstiles? -
   A. If there is a queue behind him obviously it holds it up.
   It holds the whole procedure up.

Q.   You have been asked to give various estimates of the number of
     people who came toyour particular turnstile without a ticket.
     - A . Yes.

Q. What is the overall figure? - A. What, for the whole time?

Q. Yes, estimate? - A. Roughly 30 to 40.

Q.   And each     time whatdid    you have to do? - A. It depends.     If
     they got through I had to get the Officer on the inside, or
                                                           19


                                          A. RHODES


  just refused them. Some just turned away if you refused.    If
  you said, "You can't get in; that’s is” , they just go, but
  others don't, so you call an Officer.

Q. Is there a counting mechanism inside your turnstile? - A. Yes.

Q. To keep a record of how many people have gone through? - A.
   Yes, there are three.  There is a counter on the gate which is
   a magic eye, and the video as well.  They count off the video
   as well.

Q. Is that connected by a wire to a control panel inside the
   ground? - A. I presume so, yes.  I don't know.

Q. Was the wire in your turnstile damaged? - A. I do n ’t think so,
   no. Not that I know of.

                   Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS:

Q. Mr. Rhodes, people turning up late is not something which is
   wholly unexpected? - A. Not at a Semi-Final, no.

Q. But in the past when that has happened you have been able to
   cope? - A. Yes. It has been hard to cope but I have coped,
   yes.
Q. Just because of the extra numbers all coming in in a rush
   towards the end? - A. Yes.

Q. But   never anything like this? - A. Never, no,.

Q. And of course, the ability to cope depends very largely upon
   what is happening immediately outside your turnstile? - A.
   That is right, yes.

                    Cross-Examined bv MR. KING:

Q. In fact, as I understand from that, the fact that people come
   late is not unknown to you. What was unknown to you was the
   numbers on this occasion? - A. Yes.

Q. That more people had the idea of coming late than on previous
   occasions? - A. That is correct.

Q. But the fact that people come late does not come to you as a
   surprise, does it? - A. No, they come late at all matches, in
   various numbers.

Q. Thank you. As I understand it from your numbers of the people
   who you dealt with without tickets, there were relatively
   small numbers by the sound of it, ten plus a maximum of 25, 35
   people? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you have anybody present to you a ticket which was for the
   Nottingham Forest end? - A. Very few, I think, about five.

Q. Did you have any instructions as to what to do with anybody
K
                                                                  20


                                                 A. RHODES


          who came with a Nottingham Forest end ticket? - A. We were
          instructed by a Police Officer, yes.

        Q. What were the instructions? - A. To take so many and then I
           think they had got a segregate section on the Spion Kop, and
           to send some round there as well.
    B
        Q. But you had instructions to allow into the Leppings Lane end
           people who in fact had the wrong ticket for the Leppings Lane
           end? - A. Some of them, yes.

        Q. Who gave you those instructions?   You said a Police Officer?
           - A. A Police Officer, yes.

        Q. Was that at your briefing at the beginning of the day? - A.
           No, that was after we were on the gate.

                             Further bv THE CORONER:

        Q. Just arising out of that, about what time was that instruction
           given to you to let in some of the people? - A. I think it was
           about 2 o ’clock. Just after 2 o'clock, I think.

        Q. Right, thank you very much.

    D           THE CORONER:   I think we will do, we will have coffee.
           One of our witnesses does not seem to be in the room, but he
           may be here. So we will rise for coffee and have quarter-of-
           an-hour and see where we go from there.

Q.   Which bit of the terracing did you go to in 1988? - A.
     Pen 3.

Q.   Did you know that the terracing was split up by radial
     fences in 1988, or did you find that out then? - A.
     No, I found out after it.

Q.   You found it out in 1988? - A. I didn't know then, no.

Q.   When you got onto the terraces in 1988, not 1989, did
     you notice the radial fences? - A. Down the middle?

                                     D. A. LACKEY


Q.   Yes. - A.   I didn't, no.

Q.   You saw nothing? - A. No.

Q.   I know you have said you do not know what time you
     arrived, but can you remember - we are talking about
     1988 at the moment - how long you were on the terraces
     before the match started? - A. Twenty minutes, half-
     an-hour.

Q.   You had no problems getting in in that year,    is that
     right? - A.  Yes.

Q.   1989 was slightly different, I think, because you came
     by train, that is the first thing? - A. Yes.

Q.   And the second thing is you came without a ticket,
     that is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q.   You came with a friend? - A. Yes.

Q.   Can you remember what time the train got into
     Sheffield? - A. About half-past 1, I think.

Q.   Is it right that having got off the train you were
     directed towards some --- A. We were escorted down,
     yes.

Q.   To the coach,   to the buses? - A. No, we walked down.

Q.   You walked from where?  Which station did you arrive
     at? - A.  Wadsley Bridge.

Q.   Were you on the special train, do you mean? - A. Yes.

Q.   Are you quite sure about that, because we know what
     time that train arrived? - A. No, I am not quite sure
     about the time.  I think it was about half-past 1.

Q.   But definitely Wadsley Bridge? - A.    Yes.

Q.   You were escorted by some mounted officers and a few
     foot officers? - A. Yes.

Q.   There was a whole column of you, wasn't there? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   If I then were to tell you that that train actually
     arrived at about 2 o'clock, you would accept that,
     would you? - A. Yes.

Q.   So you were escorted down to the ground but, of
     course, you had no ticket at that stage? - A. Yes.
                                                                 23




                                       D. A. LACKEY


Q.   So did you, in fact, attempt to go straight into the
     ground or did you peel off? - A. No, we were looking
     for tickets.

Q.    Did you go   towards a little bridge? - A.   Yes.

Q.   Did you sort of settle there, if that is the right
     word? - A. I was sitting on the bridge, yes.

Q.   Hoping that you would see somebody who might be able
     to sell you a ticket, that is right, isn't it? - A.
     No, well we had already been looking for tickets.

Q.    You had already been looking? - A. Yes.

Q.   I assume you had tried on the train as well?         - A.
     Yes.

Q.    But I take   it no success? - A. Yes.

Q.   The people on the train itself were all very         well
     behaved, weren't they? - A. Yes.

Q.   And they were very well behaved     on the way down as
      well, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.   In fact, you did   not see anything which concerned you
     as far as behaviour is concerned? - A. No.

Q.    Of your colleagues and fans? - A. No.

Q.   On the bridge while you were there did you see   anybody
     either the worse   the wear for drink, or consuming
     alcohol, or even   not maybe the worse for wear, just
     generally a little bit merry? - A. No.

Q.   Nothing? - A. No.

Q.   Having got to the bridge, what happened then? - A. I
      was just sitting there and then my mate went back down
      the road.

Q.   To look? - A. Yes, for tickets.

Q.   Were you surprised that you had got to that position
     without a ticket? - A. Yes, because the year before we
      were stopped.

Q.   Where were you stopped the year    before? - A. I think
      it was by the garage.

Q.   But on that occasion you came by coach,       is that right?
     -   A. Yes.

Q.   I have already asked you and you cannot remember what
     time it was.  It is quite an important thing, but if
     you do not remember, you do not remember.   Just as a
     matter of interest, can you remember how the stopping
     was done by the garage in 1988?   You said you were
     stopped? - A. Yes, I was stopped.

Q.   Yes, but how was it done?  Were there horses across
     the road, were there barriers? - A. It was just like
     random.

Q.   Whilst you were on the bridge were you approached by
     any officers, either mounted or on foot, who said
     anything to you about either going in or clearing off?
     - A. Not while I was on the bridge, no.

Q.   Were you approached at any point? - A. Yes.

Q.   Where were you when you were approached? - A. On the
     path just by the shop, by the perimeter gates.

Q.   By the sweet shop you mean? - A. Yes, by the perimeter
     gates like.

Q.   How often had you been to Hillsborough, just as a
     matter of interest, apart from this match and the
     semi-final? - A. Just the once before.

Q.   Did you understand what he was actually asking you to
     do? - A. Yes.

Q.   What did he want you to do? - A. Either go in or get
     away.

Q.   What did you, in fact, do? - A. I walked over and sat
     on the bridge.

Q.   I see.   Your friend then came back? - A. Yes.

Q.   And still had not got any tickets? - A. No.

Q.   Did you have a watch on on that day? - A. No.

Q.   So you do not really know what time it was? - A. No.

Q.   Help me then.  So there you were, having come all the
     way from Liverpool, on the bridge without a ticket and
     without any apparent prospects of one, so you were not
     presumably too happy at that stage? - A. Yes.

Q.    What happened then as far as you were concerned? - A.
     He came back and said that the gates had opened.

Q.   Did you glance across towards the turnstiles at any
     stage whilst you were on this bridge? - A. Yes, I was
     looking over.

Q.   What did it seem to you like at that time? - A. Just
     masses of people there.

Q.   There were lots of people there, were there? - A. Yes.

Q.   You said your friend came over and said the gate was
     open.  Can you remember whether you saw a Land Rover?
     - A. Yes.

Q.   You did see a Land Rover? - A. Yes.

Q.   Can you remember whether you saw that  Land Rover
     before your friend told you that the gate was open or
     afterwards? - A. I think it was before.

Q.   Do you recollect whether any messages were being
     passed from the Land Rover? - A. Yes.

Q.   You do remember that? - A. Yes.

Q.   How close to the Land Rover would you have been,
     about? - A. I was on the other side of the road.

Q.   So in yards, or if you cannot do it in yards, look
     across this room - twice the length, half the length?
     - A. Yes, about twice the length.

Q.   Twice the length of this room? - A. Yes.

Q.   Can you tell me what messages you heard come over the
     loudspeaker?  I take it it was a loudspeaker, was it?
     - A. Yes.  To the Police to make a line across the
     gates.

Q.   You heard that? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you hear any other messages? - A. No.

Q.   Nothing at all? - A. No.

Q.   Nothing about   "Don't push", or anything like that? -
     A.  No.

Q.   Just asking the Police to make a line? - A. Yes,   to
     make a line across the gates, yes.

Q.   Did you notice whether such a line was made at any
     point? - A. No, there wasn't.
                                                           26



                                      D. A. LACKEY


Q.   There wasn't or you did not notice it? - A. No, there
     wasn't a line.  They were just taking no notice of it.

Q.   Did you see any horses trying to make a line a r o u n d
     there? - A. No.  I have seen horses.

Q.   You saw the horses? - A. I saw the horses, yes.

Q.   But you did not see them make a line? - A. I did not
     notice, no.

Q.   Then your mate came over and said,    "The gate's open"?
     - A. Yes.

Q.   Was that the gate at the side going down by the River
     Don there? - A. I don't know which gate it was.

Q.   If you looked at the model, do you think you would be
     able to find the gate? - A. I don't know.  It was just
     a gate that was open and I don't know which one it
     was.

Q.   When you say a gate, do you mean a perimeter gate? -
     A. A concertina gate.

Q.   A concertina gate? - A. Yes.

Q.   Okay.  So when you saw that and your friend said that,
     what did you and your friend decide to do? - A. We
     just walked in.

Q.   So you left the bridge? - A. Yes.

Q.   And you entered? - A. Yes, walked through.

Q.   How did you get to the concertina gate? - A. Walked
     over.

Q.   Was it clear? - A. No,   there were people there like.

Q.   Can you remember whether the perimeter gates - do you
     know what I mean by the perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were the perimeter gates open or shut when you went
     through? - A. They were open.

Q.   Did you have to pass any horses at all at that stage?
     - A. There were horses there, yes.

Q.   Which way were they standing?  Were they broadways on,
     or facing inward or outward? - A. I can't remember.

Q.   Anyway, you managed to get to the concertina gate? -
     A. Yes.

                                   D. A. LACKEY


Q.   Without particular difficulty? - A. Just walked
     straight through.

Q.   And got into the ground? - A. Yes.

Q.   So that things had changed as far as that was
     concerned at that point.  Then what did you do after
     that?  Were you with your mate? - A. We got split up
     in the tunnel.

Q.   I see.  So, having got through the concertina gate,
     what happened next as far as you were concerned? - A.
     We walked down to the tunnel.

Q.   What made you walk towards the tunnel? - A. Because
     you could see the pitch.

Q.   Did you look for any signs, or did you just say,
     "There's the pitch, we'll go that way"? - A. We just
     saw the pitch.

Q.   I see.  Were you alone, or were there quite a lot of
     people going down? - A. Yes, there was a few people.

Q.   A lot of people going down? - A. Yes.

Q.   You have just told me you could see the pitch.  Can
     you remember whether, when you first got to the tunnel
     and went and looked through, you could see the players
     on the pitch at all? - A. They were on the pitch when
     I got into the ground, like, onto the terraces.

Q.   So you then entered the tunnel - right? - A. Yes.

Q.   So you had not seen them on the outside;  you first
     noticed them once you got to the other end of the
     tunnel, so to speak? - A. Yes.

Q.   Having entered the tunnel, what was it like in there?
     - A. It was just people walking down.

Q.   Were you worried or concerned about them? - A. No.

Q.   Obviously I assume that there were a fair number of
     people walking down? - A. Yes.

Q.   But was it such large numbers that it worried you in
     any way? - A. No.

Q.   You were able to make progress by yourself? - A. Yes.

Q.   When you got to the far end of the tunnel, having
     traversed it - do you know what the tunnel is like, do
                                                        28



                                   D. A. LACKEY


     you remember there is a slope down? - A. I can't
     remember.

Q.   You cannot remember, okay.  Could you exit from the
     tunnel onto the terraces unimpeded, or were you
     blocked by people? - A. No, I walked on and walked to
     the right.

Q.   You walked on and onto the right? - A. Yes.

Q.   I think your friend actually got   separated at that
     point and you later on found out  he was on the left,
     but we are not worried about your friend, we are just
     interested in you.   You walked onto the right? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   What was (a) happening on the pitch at that point as
     you came out of the tunnel? - A. The players were just
     kicking in.

Q.   Kicking about? - A. Yes.

Q.   Second question: what was the terrace that you entered
     like at that point when you entered it? - A. It was
     full but you could move.

Q.   It was full but you could move you said? - A. Yes.

Q.   You have been to many matches before,   I assume? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   Was it startlingly different from other big occasions
     that you had been to? - A. No, not then it wasn't, no.

Q.   I think you then moved forward a little way, is that
     right? - A. Straight forward, yes.

Q.   You were actually more or less in line behind the
     goal, would that be right? - A. To the right of the
     goal.

Q.   Can you remember how many steps you moved forward? -
     A. No.

Q.   You cannot.  I will get you later on to try and
     pinpoint it for us on a plan.  Did you stop at that
     point?  Were you able to stop and say, "I think I'll
     watch the match from here"? - A. Yes.

Q.   At that point had the game already started, or were
     they still kicking around? - A. I think they were
     still kicking around.

Q.   Still kicking around? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did the match start   while you were still in that first
      position where you had gone? - A. When I first went
      in?

Q.   Yes.   - A. No.

Q.   I just want to make   sure we have got the right pen.
      You had gone down a little way, you were standing
      slightly to the right of the goal, they were kicking
      around I think you said? - A. Near the back it was,
      yes.




                               /Q. Near the back

Q. Near the back, yes, and and you were actually standing
   at that point? - A. Yes.

Q. And it was crowded but not to such an extent that you
   were personally concerned, at that stage? - A. Ho.

Q. What happened then? - A. Then I just got pushed
   forward.

Q. Was it a gentle push, a sudden push or a steady push? -
   A. A sudden push.

Q. A sudden push? - A. Yes.

0. Unexpected as far as you were    concerned? - A. Yes.

Q. You got carried forward quite    a distance I believe,   is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q. To approximately how far would you say? - A. I could
   not say.

Q. Did you hit any barriers? -     A. No.

Q. Here you able to touch the front fence? - A. No.

Q. Can you estimate how far back from the front fence you
   were when you came to rest after that push? - A. About
   six feet.

Q. Had you ever been in a situation like that before,
   where you had been pushed forward? - A. Yes.

0. So that in itself did not surprise you but something
   then happened? - A. It never went back.

Q. It never back, because that is what normally happens,
   you go forward and then ... - A. Yes.

Q.    But on this occasion you just stopped and you could   not
     get back, is that what you are saying? - A. Yes.

Q. Was the m atch in play at that time? - A. I can't
   remember.

Q. Did you see anything of the match at all?  I am not
   asking you to describe what you saw, what I am trying
   to find out is whether you have any recollection of any
   play on the field at all? - A. No.

Q.    None? - A. After that I wanted to get out then,   and I
     was just taking no notice of the match.
                                             D. A. LACKEY




While you were being propelled forward with this crowd,
can you remember whether you saw anything happening on
the pitch at all, because at that stage presumably you
just thought, "This is a surge forward, I will come
back again"? - A. Yes.

Did you see anything on the pitch at all? - A. While I
was there, yes.

What did you see, tell me? - A. The match was just in
play.

I am trying to pinpoint when that was.  Was that as you
were going forward? - A. No, that was when I was
forward.

When you were   already forward? - A. Yes.

You then became uncomfortable,   shall we say?   - A.   Yes.

Were you able   to shout? - A. Yes.

You were able to shout, and were you able  to shout
throughout the time until you were able to get out of
the enclosure? - A. No.

Was that because the pressure became even tighter? - A.
Yes.

How many - this is a very difficult question and if you
can*t answer it, please say so - do you want a drink?
Are you all right? - A. No, I am okay.

Can you say, having been brought forward nothing had
come back, you were squashed but shouting? - A. Yes.

How long was it before you got to the stage where you
could not shout any more? - A. I don't know.

You don't know.  Did you feel any more - I will use the
word surge - did you feel any more surges? - A. Yes,
one or two.

One or two? - A. Yes.

And that is what increased the pressures,    is that
right? - A. Yes.

Could you from the position that you were, were you
able to see a gate in the perimeter fence? - A. Yes.

You could see it? - A. Yes.
                                                             32

And I tnink you also could see a man quite close to
you, an older raan, is that right? - A. Yes.

And he was referring to a little boy, is that right? -
A. Yes.

You could not get at them,    is that right, because you
were pinned? - A. Yes.

What were the people around you and in that part of the
Stand doing at this time, or saying? - A. To open the
gates.

They were shouting to open the gates? - A. Yes, and
help.

And help? - A. Yes.

iJere the people further back,   could you hear what was
happening further back in the    enclosure? - A. It was
just all over the place, just    people were shouting, all
over the place, behind me, at    the side of me.

Could you hear from further back in the terraces
chanting and encouragement to play? - A. No, I can't
remember.

Just have a look at this line here, the fifth line from
the bottom which is highlighted?  Can  you just read
that? Does that ring a bell with you   now that you have
read that? - A. Yes.

Is that correct, what it says there? - A. Yes.

So can you just tell me what, in fact, it says there,
what the sense of it is? - A. It was just singing and
shouting.

So the people further back were still singing. - Yes,
at the back - it might have been coming from the top.

I see.  You could hear that - the people in front of
you were shouting, "Open the gate", people further back
somewhere, you don't know quite where, they were
singing and chanting, that is right? - A. Yes.

You were in fear for your life at that stage, weren't
you? - A. Yes.

And what happened then as far as you were     concerned? -
A. Just the same, just couldn't move.

You couldn't move? - A. No.

    Q. The people were shouting and saying, "Open the gate,
       open the gate", and "Help" and things like that? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. What did you notice happen? - A. Nothing.
B
    Q. Did you see the gate open at any point? - A. Yes.

    Q. When you saw the gate open what was happening on the
       pitch?  I will ask you what happened to the gate .... -
       A. I was taking no notice then.

    Q. So you can't say? - A. No.

    0. So when the gate was opened what did you then notice? -
       A. There was someone got out.

    Q. Someone got out? - A. Yes.

    Q. And what happened then? - A. I think a couple got out
       and there was a lad, I think it was a lad, was pushed
       back in.

    Q. Are you saying a lad was pushed back into the same
D      enclosure? - A. Yes, and the gate was shut then.

    Q. Yes.  Was the pressure - it is difficult and you may
       not be able to answer this question but try if you can
       - you have described to me how tight you were, were you
       able to shout at that point? - A. Yes.

    Q. You were    still able to shout? -A. I think so, yes.

    Q. As far as  you can tell were the people ahead of you in
       the same sort of situation as you, in other words
       between you and the gate?  Were they in the same sort
       of crushed position as you were? - A. I think so, yes.
       They must have been, yes.

    Q. Could you tell whether the people immediately by the
       gate were in the same sort of position? - A. Well the
       gate was over to the right.

    Q. Could you    see what the people were like at that
       position?    - A. I could just see people's heads.

    Q. So you could not actually tell.  The reason why I ask
       is because obviously is you open a gate, somebody comes
       out and you push them back in, there has got to be
       space for that, hasn't there? - A. Yes.

    Q. Could you see any space? - A. Ho, I could not see the
       floor.
                                            D. A. LACKEY




So all you could do was see the tops of the people? -
A. Yes.

When that happened did you see the gate open or shut
again at all? - A. The next time I think they was
letting everybody out then.

So the next time you noticed it was open they were
getting people out? - A. Yes.

Is it right then that from your recollection, you
recollect two openings, is that right? - A. Yes.

One where a couple of people got   out, and you think one
of them was pushed back in? - A.   Yes.

And then it was opened again and that time it stayed
open? - A. That was when everyone started climbing
over, yes.

Do you remember whether the opening and shutting of the
gate - can you remember people climbing over the
fencing? - A. Yes.

In relation to the opening and shutting of the gates
when was that? - A. It was after the gate had opened
first.

I see, so the first time the gate was opened people had
not yet begun to climb over, is that right? - A. I
don't think so, no.

And I think you also then saw Police Officers climb on
to the little ledge? - A.k Yes.

What were they doing as far as you could tell? - A.
They were shouting to push back.

Push back? - A. Yes.

You at that point I take it were not able to move back
because there were people behind you, is that right? -
A. Yes.

You lost sight of the gentleman with the little boy,
didn't you? - A. No, he was still there.

You did not, of course, know him at the time but you
recognised him subsequently as somebody who was
photographed in the newspaper, didn't you? - A. Yes.

Was it Mr. Howard? - A. Yes.

You never saw the little boy? - A. No.
                                            D. A. LACKEY




Because he was too low down for you to see? - A. Yes.

How close to Hr. Howard were you? - A. Standing next to
hint.

Next to him? - A. Yes.

Was the lad - of course, if you did not see him you
don't know, but did you assume that he was in front of
him? - A. Yes.

He was not between you and the man? - A. No.

When the gate was opened the second time and people
were getting out, were people coming from behind you to
get out? - A. Yes, there was one crawled over the top.

It is very difficult for you to answer this and if you
cannot say so, do you know from how far back some of
these people were coming? - A. No.

You don't know? - A. No.

Again, if   you can't answer just say you don't know.
When they   were coming over to get out, did those people
appear to   you as distressed .... - A. Yes, they just
wanted to   get out.

Yes, but what I am trying to ask you is this, did you
think, “My goodness me, I am in a worse state than they
are", or did you not think any thoughts like that? - A.
No.

Pardon? - A. No.

You just did not think about it? - A. No.

Eventually what happened?  How did you get out,   tell
me? - A. Back through the tunnel.

How come that you were able to do that?  What happened?
- A. It was just - I don't know - they must have taken
some out of the back or something.

They must have taken some out of the back, because did
some space develop behind you? - A. Yes, and I stumbled
out there.

And you got out the same way as you came in? - A. Yes.

               Cross-Examined by HR. HALE

In 1988 you said that the Policeman who asked you if
you had a ticket, it was just a random check? - A. Yes.
                                                             36


                                              D. A. LACKEY




Q. So there may well have been people in front of you or
   just behind you, or at the side of you, who went
   through while he was talking to you and were not
   checked? - A. Yes.

Q. Similarly if there had been a random check in 1989, is
   it possible that you were one of those who just walked
   by and were not checked? - A. It is, yes.

Q. There was no barrier across the road in 1988? - A. I
   can't remember.

Q. You can't remember? - A. No.

Q. You can't remember any great difference in the way that
   people were checked going down Leppings Lane in 1988
   from 1989? - A. I was not stopped in 1989.

Q. Sorry? - A. I was not stopped in 1989.




                Q. I appreciate that .
                                              D. A. LACKEY


Q. I appreciate you were not stopped. Did you see any
   difference that struck you as to the way in which the
   Police were mobilised between the two years in
   Leppings Lane? - A. No.

                Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

Q. On the question of your attending at the match
   without a ticket, did you know before you set off
   that the match was a sell out? - A. No.

Q. Had you tried to get a ticket before you left? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Where had you tried? - A. Round Anfield.

Q. What? - A. Round Anfield.

Q. Had you been to the ticket office? - A. Yes.

Q. Why had you not been able to get one there? - A. No,
   they had sold out but you always get someone who has
   got tickets.

Q. You knew the ticket office had sold out? - A. Yes.

Q. You were looking for someone else who might have
   some? - A. Yes.

Q. Someone in the street? - A. Yes, a tout.

Q. No luck? - A. No.

Q. What day was that that you were trying to get
   tickets? - A. I think it was the Friday or the
   Thursday before.

     THE CORONER:    Mr. Payne, I do not think we want to
pursue this. He has told us he did not have a ticket quite
honestly and openly.   I do not want to pursue that line.
It is not going to advance the Inquest.   It is an
interesting point and an important point but I do not want
the witness to feel threatened about that.

     MR. PAYNE: Quite.   I am not criticising him at all.
I am just trying to get information as the Jury in fact
have expressed interest in this point earlier on.

     THE CORONER:      Yes, that is true.

     THE WITNESS:    The year before I didn't buy a ticket
at Anfield.

Q.       MR. PAYNE: Where did you get it the year before?
     - A. On the coach.

Q. So this time when you travelled on the train you were
   with a friend? - A. Yes.

Q. The two of you together. Apart from you two, do you
   know whether there was anybody else who was
   travelling without tickets? - A. Yes, there was a lad
   that my mate knew. He didn't have a ticket.

Q. When you walked to the ground and were trying to buy
   a ticket and asking people, was anybody else doing
   that? - A. Yes.

Q. Many people? - A. Yes.

Q. Were they having any luck? - A. Some of them did,
   yes.

Q. When you were sitting on the bridge were there others
   sitting there with you? - A. They were standing
   against the wall, yes.

Q. Others were standing against the wall? - A. Yes.

Q. Were they people without tickets? - A. I don't know.

Q. But they did not go into the ground? - A. I don't
   know.

Q. What did they do when you got the message that the
   gate was opened? What did those other people do? -
   A. I don't know.

Q. Did you know that there was a limited number of
   tickets available for the Leppings Lane end for the
   capacity of the end? - A. No, I don't understand you.

Q. Did you know that only a limited number of tickets
   were on sale? - A. That is obvious, isn't it?

Q. What? - A. That is obvious.

Q. So when you went in without a ticket you were at
   least one more than the limited number? - A. Yes.

Q. Your friend made two? - A. Yes.
                                                            39




                                              D. A. LACKEY



Q. Anyone else added to that as well? - A. Yes.

Q. When you got down to the end of the tunnel and went
   into the pen you have described what you saw. Did
   you think it was safe at that time for you to go into
   the pen? - A. Yes.

Q. Quite safe? - A. Yes.

Q. No worries at all? - A. No.

Q. The teams were then kicking about on the ground? - A.
   Yes.

Q. I wonder if you would look at what is called the
   acetate to mark the place where you went to in the
   ground? You will be shown the picture.

Q.        THE CORONER:   If you walk round, Mr. Lackey.
     Can you just point out where the tunnel is, which is
     Enclosure 3, and where the gate is so that he can
     find his way around this? - A. Yes.

Q.        MR. PAYNE:  What it might be helpful to do is to
     mark the first place that he went to.

Q.        THE CORONER:   That is the first position,   is it
     not, the one you have marked with a cross, Mr.
     Lackey? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you put a figure 1 next to it because that is
   quite important? - A. Yes.

Q.       MR. PAYNE: After you had been pushed, Mr.
     Lackey, whereabouts did you finish up?

Q.        THE CORONER:   Mark it with a circle and not
     with a cross and put a figure 2 next to that so that
     we will know exactly what it is? - A. Yes.

Q.        MR. PAYNE:Come back to the witness box and
     could the acetate be left on the screen please?

          MR. JONES:   C.320.

Q.        MR. PAYNE:  To push you from point 1 down to point
     2, as you felt it, from which direction did the push
     come against you? - A. From the back.

Q. Can you do any better than that? I am not
   criticising you? - A. No, I don't understand you.

Q. It was a hard push, was it? - A. Yes.

Q. Just turn round and look where you have put point 1.
   There is not much space there between you and the
   back of the terrace, is there? - A. No, I am not
   saying I was exactly there.

Q.   Somewhere there? - A. Yes.

Q.    Did   the push shove you all theway     downtheterrace
     to point 2? - A. Yes.

Q.   In one go? -    A. I think so, yes.

Q.    Do you remember before that push came whether the
     match had started? - A. When I first went in there,
     no.

Q. We understand that. Your answer is you do not know
   if the match had started? - A. I wasn't in there long
   before I got pushed forward and so I don't think it
   had.

                    Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS:

Q. When you were sitting on the bridge you must have
   thought that you were not going to get in? - A. Yes.

Q. You must have been disappointed? - A. Yes.

Q. You do not see the gate opened but somebody tells you
   the gate is opened? - A. Yes.

Q.    How   far are you away from thegate    atthattime?- A.
     Which gate.

Q. The gate which you go through? - A. I was on the
   other side of the road.

Q. The distance you have been telling us about? - A.
   Yes.

Q. So you could see when your pal told you the gate was
   opened? - A. I couldn't see the gate.

Q. You could not see the gate? - A. No.

Q. You then walked towards the gate? - A. Yes.
                                           D. A. LACKEY



How many people were there outside the gate when you
looked towards it when you could see it for the first
time? - A. There was a few.

Ten, twenty, a hundred? - A. I couldn't say.

Do your best please.    Was the crowd still milling
round the gate or was   it then virtually free for you
to walk through? - A.   Yes, it was free to walk
through but there was   still people there, yes.

A few people were there all doing the same as you? -
A. Yes.

Going through the gate? - A. Yes.

Were there people, so far as you are aware, behind
you? - A. Yes.

Any idea of the numbers? - A. No.

Do you know whether you went through the gate whether
other people were stood behind you? - A. Yes.

Did you look round at all? - A. No.

Had you any idea what time   it was? - A. Twenty to
three something like that it must have been, round
about then.

Twenty to three? - A. Round about, yes.

I thought you told us when   you actually got to the
tunnel there were players already on the pitch? - A.
Not when I got to the tunnel, I couldn't see the
players on the pitch.  I could just see the pitch.

It cannot have been twenty to three, can it? - A.
Round about twenty to three.

It must have been much closer than that? - A. Much
what?

Closer to three o'clock than that? - A. It must have
been, yes.

Did you hear the roar of the crowd as the players
came out? - A. I can't remember.

Q. How long did it take you from going through that gate
   to getting into the tunnel, the entrance to the
   tunnel? - A. Not long.

Q. Did you walk or did you run? - A. Walk.

Q. Are you sure about that? - A. Positive.

Q. You would have been keen to get to a good place,
   would you not? - A. Yes. No, just get in.

Q. Close to kick-off time, get to a good place, you
   would run, would you not? - A. No.

Q. Was anybody else running? - A. I can't remember.

Q. Did you not see anybody? - A. I can't remember.     I
   wasn't looking for anyone running, was I?

Q. You do not have to look for somebody, with respect,
   do you? It is happening all around you? - A. Well,
   you are not taking much notice, are you?

Q. It is a thing that happens at football matches, does
   it not? People close to kick-off time run to get a
   good place before the kick-off starts? - A. Yes.

Q. Is that not what you did? - A. I don't know.

Q. Were there not other people doing the same thing?

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Isaacs, I am sorry, he has answered
this several times. These witnesses, generally speaking,
are coming voluntarily. Of course, we want to get at the
truth and you can ask him whether other people ran but I do
not think you can ask him whether he ran.  I am not happy
with that at all.

     MR. ISAACS:   You mean ask again whether he ran?

     THE CORONER:   No, no, I am just saying that I am not
happy with you pursuing this line of questioning with this
witness.

     MR. KING: Just to help my learned friend, and I am
not being unkind when I say he has not been here very
recently, we do in fact have a video which very clearly
shows the manner in which people were crossing the
concourse and perhaps that is good evidence rather than
having to get it through the witness in this way.

                                             D. A. LACKEY


     THE CORONER:   I think this witness has given very
clear evidence. Mr. Isaacs, I do not want to hinder you
unnecessarily but timings are exceedingly difficult. You
may notice I did not pursue the detail of the timings apart
from the train because we have got the timings when the
players came out on the pitch. We can    work out from other
evidence at what time this gentleman got on to       thepitch,
assuming he is correct that when he first exited the tunnel
they were still kicking about. So we have got a bracket
and we know as near as minutes when that was.

     MR. ISAACS:   I am concerned, sir, when you say to me
that I should not even ask him the question as to whether
he was running or not. Of course, a witness comes and
gives an account and that account does not have to be
accurate o r ....

     THE CORONER:   I do not mind you asking the question.
What I do not like is you pursuing him   when he    hastold you
quite clearly that he was not running.

     MR. ISAACS:   Very well, sir.

Q. You cannot remember whether other people were running
   or not? - A. No.

Q. When you got to the end of the tunnel was there a
   space for you to move into? - A. Yes, to the right.

Q. As you went down the tunnel, have you a recollection
   of people coming up behind you? - A. There was people
   behind me.

Q. You cannot help us as to the numbers in the tunnel? -
   A. No.

               Cross-Examined bv MR. MANNING:

Q. What I want to ask you about is your vision of the
   terrace when you got there. You have said you
   managed to find a space that night? - A. Yes.

Q. You have said that although it was crowded it was no
   more crowded than other big matches you have been to?
   - A. Yes.

Q. You have described yourself right at the beginning as
   being a long standing football supporter? - A. Yes.

Q. Your perception of coming through the entrance way
   that you can see out of the tunnel and on to the
                                                              44




                                                  D. A. LACKEY


     terrace at a point, I suppose, about three-quarters
     of the way up. I am just looking at the acetate and
     you can look if you want to? - A. No, I have seen it.

Q. Your perception at that time was that it was a
   terrace similar to ones you had stood on before? - A.
   Yes.

Q. It is right, is it not, that on terraces there is
   swaying in the crowd? - A. Yes.

Q. It has been suggested, and I do not know what you
   would say about it, that that is part of the thrill
   of standing behind the goal? - A. Yes.

Q. The sway of the crowd? - A. Yes.

Q. You may not have been but at least I ask you, were
   you there at a time when somebody had a beach ball
   and it was being ping ponged around from front and
   back and up and down the terrace.  Is that something
   that in any way rings a bell? - A. No, I don't
   remember that.

Q . Then a time came when you were then pushed down the
    terraces and you thought that that was nothing more
    than the ordinary sway, if one puts it that way? - A.
    Yes.

Q. A surge down? - A. Yes.

Q. And ordinarily a surge back up again? - A. Yes.

Q. In your case there was no surge at all?

       THE CORONER:       No surge back at all I think.

Q.         MR. MANNING:    There was not a surge back? - A.
     No.

Q. You were not able to step back at all? - A. No.

Q. I am puzzled as to this.  It may be you can't offer me an
   answer to It, but you said you did not either have to go
   through, under or come into any contact with a barrier? - A.
   Yes.

Q.   But if you look at the acetate there, it does seem that even
     if you went round the one side of the first barrier you must
     have come into contact with the second if you were standing in
     front of   them? - A. I don't know.    If you look at the
     photographs you will see where I w a s .

Q. But you are saying that you can't remember coming into any
   contact with the barrier? - A. No.

Q. When youwere down at the lower level after the surge,    that is
   when the   pressure started gathering? - A. Yes.

Q. And it gathered pretty quickly? -A. Yes.

Q. Because we are talking about a moment or a few moments only? -
   A. Yes.

Q. When you then saw the gate opened and the events that followed
   i t . Your evidence is that it was at the time the gate opened
   for the second time that you were also aware of people
   climbing over the fence? - A. Yes.

Q. I am not going to try to pin you to times, because as the
   learned Coroner has said, we actually know what time the
   concertina gate opened, and therefore what time you went
   through, and if you walked then what time roughly you would
   have reached the terrace, taking into account how long it
   takes to walk, but is it right in the overall looking at
   it, that from reaching the terrace and then from being
   pushed down the terrace to the front position there was a
   matter of minutes only at that stage until you got out
   the back way? - A. Yes.

                     Cross-Examined bv MR. KING:

Q. Mr. Lackey, when you went through the big concertina gate,
   gate C and went over to where the tunnel wa s, were there any
   Police or stewards or any.... - A. Yes.

Q. Just wait for me.    They were there, were they? - A. By the
   tunnel, y e s .

Q. And were these Police and stewards directing you in any way? -
   A. No.

Q. But you say they were actually close to the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. Could you help us how close they were? I wonder if a plan of
   the ground could be shown? - A. By the side of the tunnel.

              THE CORONER:   Can you put the ground plan up?    (C 274
         shown on screen)

    Q.        MR. KING:   Mr. Lackey, it may be a bit difficult for you
         because it is a large plan. - A. They were at the sides of the
         tunnel.
B   Q. I wonder if Sergeant Griffiths could use his famous stick by
       now. (Pointed to on plan) - A. Yes.

    Q. How many Police did you see there? - A. I think there were
       two. One or two, and I think there were a couple of stewards.

    Q. They were just standing there watching you and did nothing,
       for example, to stop you going down the tunnel? -A. No, they
       never stopped me.

    Q. You did not, for example, see a cordon of Police in front of
       the tunnel trying to prevent entry? - A. No.

    Q. You were asked by the learned Coroner whether you were looking
       for any signs, and you said you were not looking? - A. Yes.

    Q. You had been there the year before, had you not? - A. Yes.

D   Q. Had you ever noticed any sign showing you the way into the
       side pens, for example, when you were there? - A. No, I
       thought it was just the one way, the tunnel, the only way in.

    Q. I am interested in this. You say when you got on to the
       terrace it was crowded, it was full, but you were not
       concerned for your own safety at that stage. That is what you
       told the learned Coroner. - A. Yes.

    Q. This is obvious; you would not call yourself an expert on
       crowd safety, would you? - A. No.

    Q. You have been to football grounds over many years, I suspect?
       - A . Yes.

    Q. Are you aware that the capacity of grounds keeps getting
       reduced, so that one moment a ground may have 60,000 allowed
       in and then the next year only 50,000? - A. No.

    Q. You are not aware of that. All right. As a football
       supporter I am interested as to what you have been tolerating
       over the years so that you say it was crowded but you were not
       concerned.  In a crowd which has a sway, which we have heard
       of, which goes forward and back again, that is the sort of
       crowd which you say you are not worried about? - A. No.

    Q. But in that sort of crowd you must be tightly packed in order
       to have a sway at all, are not you? - A. No, not like that.
       Not like then it was not, no.

    Q. But in order to go forward you have got to be in contact with
       the person in front of you, have you not? - A. Yes.

                                          D.A.   LACKEY



Q. You don't have a sway if there is a nice little space around
   you, a little island of space? You are not suggesting that is
   what it is like, are you? - A. No, you just get pushed.

Q. But you are quite tightly packed even when you say it is a
   normal crowd, are not you? - A. Not tightly packed, but it is
   packed, but you are safe.

Q. I understand that you say you are safe, but between you and
   the man in front, there is your chest and the back of the man
   in front - all right? - A. Yes.

Q. In a normal crowd how much space do you say there is in a
   normal packed terrace between you and the man in front? - A.
   You are touching him.

Q. Touching him? -A. Yes.

Q. So even on what you regard as a normal safe terrace you are
   touching the man in front? - A. Yes, but you are not crushed
   up against them.

Q. You are not crushed up against them at that stage, but clearly
   if you are that close, if a lot more people come in behind
   you are going to be crushed up against them, are not you? - A.
   Yes.

Q. So although you are not concerned for your personal safety
   when you enter in that way, if you had known that a lot more
   people were coming in you would be concerned, would not you?
   - A . Yes.

Q. Can I go ahead in your account to where you say you saw people
   or heard people shouting for the gates to be opened? - A. Yes.

Q. Were they showing signs of distress, the people around you? -
   A. Yes.

Q. How was this distress being shown? - A. Because they were
   shouting, "Open the gates", shouting for help.

Q. And you yourself at that stage were feeling crushed? - A. Yes.

Q. The learned Coroner said to you you did not know what it was
   like at the very front when the gate was opened and you saw
   someone going out and then being pushed back in, and that is
   right, is not it? - A. Yes.

Q. So you can’t say how much space, if any, there was for that
   person to be pushed back into it, can you? - A. No.

Q. Did you yourself see any   Policemen actually in the pen you
   were in.... - A. No.

Q. Just wait for a moment -   between about 3 and 5-past-3? - A.
   No.

Q. You did not see anybody? - A. No.

                  Cross-Examined bv MR. CATCHPOLE:

Q. Mr. Lackey, you probably know from your experience from going
   to football matches that there is often a difference in the
   cost of a seating ticket as opposed to a terrace ticket? - A.
   Yes.

Q. And seating tickets are more expensive than terrace tickets,
   are not they? - A. Yes.

Q. And you probably see at any ground you go to - I am sure
   Anfield is no exception, and neither is Hillsborough - that
   very often Policemen and stewards stand at the entrance to the
   seating area and the check the tickets of the people going up
   to make sure they actually have got tickets for those seats? -
   A. Outside.

Q. At the entrance? - A. Yes.

Q. When you come into behind the turnstiles at Hillsborough and
   you   have got the tunnel in front of you, and just over to the
   right, I don't know whether you noticed this, there is a
   stairway leading up. Do you remember that? - A. Yes.

Q. And  that is the way up to the seating area, is not it? Did
   you  know that? - A. No, I didn't know that.  I thought it was
   a fire escape or something.

Q. You saw the stairs.  They are fairly close to the tunnel?      Is
   that the vicinity that you saw these Police Officers and
   stewards, in that sort of area? - A. Yes.

                   Cross-Examined bv MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Mr. Lackey, were you surprised to have been allowed into the
   football ground so easily, firstly through the main perimeter
   gate and then through a concertina gate, with no-one bothering
   to stop you as you had no ticket? - A. Yes.

Q.   And you say there were lots of people following behind you,
     and presumably no-one was bothering to stop them either? - A.
     No.

Q. So it was quite obvious to you that there was no check on /the
   numbers entering the ground that day? - A. No check, no.

                   Cross-Examined bv MR. RUSSELL:

Q.    Mr. Lackey, we know it is right you were not among the very
     first to go through Gate C, the concertina gate, were you? -
     A. I don't know.

Q. Because as I understand your evidence you were told by your
   friend that the concertina gate was open? - A. Open, yes.
                                                            49


                                           D.A. LACKEY



Q. And he told you when you were both on the bridge? - A. Yes.

Q. And at the time were you sitting on the bridge or sitting on
   the ground? - A. No, sitting on the bridge.

Q. When you had that information you got off the bridge, walked
   across the road? - A. Yes.

Q.   And inthrough the perimeter gates and down   to the concertina
     gate and through? - A. Yes.

Q.   As you were making your way from the bridge to the concertina
     gate was there anyone else in the area between the perimeter
     gates and the direct line to the concertina gate? - A. Yes.

Q.   Was that densely packed with people or was it quite freely
     moving? - A. It was free moving, yes.

Q. And how did you make your way then through that area? Did you
   join the back of the crowd making its way to the concertina
   gates or were you able to make your way through the people....
   - A. Make our way through, yes.

Q.    I will repeat the question, although I think you correctly
     anticipated what I was going to say. Were you able to make
     your way through the people who themselves making their way
     down to the concertina gate? - A. Yes.

Q. So whether you were walking or running or whatever you were
   doing, you were certainly moving faster towards the concertina
   gate than the majority of people in the same area? - A. Yes.

Q. You told us what it was like and what you felt when you first
   got on to the terracing, and you described receiving a sudden
   push that propelled you forwards? - A. Yes.

Q.    I wonder if the acetate could be put back, please, showing the
     terracing.   (Plan shown on screen) You marked on that two
     positions, the first one when   you arrived and were able to
     make your way on the terrace.     Is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. And the second one where you ended up having been pushed? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You put a mark and a figure "2" just in front of a barrier.
   Is that because you were able to identify your position by
   reference to the barrier in front of which you marked? - A.
   No, I am estimating.   I am not saying I was exactly there. I
   was round about there.

Q. Round about there. Do you think you might have reached that
   second barrier? You describe being pushed forward, andwe can
   see from that that your route  was taking you past two lines of
   barrier? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you think because you don't have any recollection of
                                                                        50

              negotiating a barrier that in fact you did not reach certainly
              the second barrier? - A. No, I was further than that.

     Q.       You think you had negotiated    two barriers? - A. Yes.

     Q.        In any event, you were still   some distance from the fence,
jj            were not you? - A. Yes.

     Q. And were you aware that at the front of the enclosure the
        front of the enclosure is some feet lower than the perimeter
        path on the other side of the fence? - A . Yes.

     Q. And there are steps out of the enclosure up on to the
        perimeter path behind the goal, are not there? If you don't
        know that I can invited you to look at C 268 in that file in
        front of you, and you will see what I mean.  I think there is
        a file in front of you, Mr. Lackey.  You may find it easier
        than turning round. - A. Yes. What number is it?

                                 D. A. LACKEY


Q.   268.   Do you have 268? - A. Yes.

Q.   That is looking down from the top of the West Stand
     down onto enclosures 3 and 4, and to the right of the
     centre of the photograph is enclosure 3, do you see
     that? - A. Yes.

Q.   I hope you can see that there are steps going up to
     the gate out of enclosure 3? - A. Yes.

Q.   It is right, is it not, that although you were a
      relatively short distance away from the fence, there
     was a mass of people between you and the front? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   At the time of the start of this game, and at the  time
      that you were on the terrace, would it be fair to say
      that there was a considerable amount of noise within
      the stadium? - A. Yes.

Q.   You have identified the noise that was in your
     immediate vicinity, but that was not the only noise,
     was it?  There was an inferno of noise, I would invite
     you to agree? - A. Yes.

Q.   Coming from all four stands? - A. Yes.

Q.   Would it be also fair to say that it was difficult to
     hear, or be heard, more than a few feet away from
     where you were? - A. Yes.

Q.   There came a stage when things got so uncomfortable
      that you wanted to get out? - A. Yes.

Q.   And there came a stage when the gate at the front of
     the pen was open and people were, as best they could,
     getting out - correct? - A. yes.

Q.   The gate offered a relatively narrow access from the
     enclosure onto the perimeter track, did it not? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   Also those getting out had to negotiate the steps up
      from the bottom of the front of the enclosure onto the
      perimeter track? - A. That is right, yes.

Q.   That is right? - A. Yes.

Q.   You have described people coming over the top from
     behind you attempting to get out? - A. Yes.

Q.   Quite clearly, those people coming over the top had
     the health and strength to do so? - A. Yes, they must
     have.

Q.   Do you remember there being any officers at the front
      in the gateway? - A. In the gateway?

Q.   In the gateway to enclosure 3? - A. Going onto the
      pitch?

Q.   Yes. - A. Yes.

Q.   They were, to an extent, helping people out of gate 3,
     weren't they? - A. After they had realised, yes.

Q.   When people were being permitted to come out? - A.
      Yes.

Q.   Would you agree that it was necessary to give priority
     to getting out the people who were very seriously
     injured right at the front of the pen, possibly in the
     trough at the bottom of the steps? - A. Yes.

Q.   And to give them priority rather than the people who
      were coming over the top who clearly had their health
      and strength? - A. Yes.

Q.   In giving that priority, it would have been necessary,
     would it not, to have restrained and pushed back some
     people from getting out to get out the people who were
     very seriously injured and needed to be got out as
     quickly as possible? - A. Yes, well everyone had to
     get out, didn't they?

Q.   Yes, but the most important people to be got out were
      those people who were clearly very seriously injured?
      - A. Yes.

              Further Cross-Examined by MR. HALE:

Q.   I would like to just ask a supplementary question to
      the one Mrs. McBrien asked about not being checked for
      your ticket.   You said that you were surprised that
      you were not c h e c k e d .for your ticket. Now that would
      have been the case if you had gone to an ordinary
      gate. You would not expect, without a ticket, just to
      walk up, somebody open a gate and just show you in? -
      A. No.

Q.   That is what you mean,   is it not? - A. Yes.

Q.   I know that a great deal happened on this day   that you
      did not observe, your answers have made that quite
      clear and no one criticises you for that, but had you
      noticed, just before you went across the road, that
      people were being carried out over the heads of the
      crowd? - A. No.

         Q.   You had not seen that? - A. No.

         Q.   You had not seen that police officers were desperately
              trying to hold the gates against a great mass of
              people who were pressing against the gates - did you
     B        see that? - A. No.

         Q.   You did not see that the gates were opened and a great
              mass of people went through, pushing the Police horses
              and the Police aside? - A. No.

         Q.   You did not see any of that? - A. No.             I had seen the
              masses of people outside.

     C   Q.   But if you had seen that and you had been made aware
              that the decision was taken by someone to save life to
              open the gates and just let everybody in, then you
              would not be surprised if you just walked in without
              your ticket being checked, would you? - A. Yes, but I
              didn't know that then, did I?

         Q.   No, but nevertheless we have heard other witnesses and
              everybody else knows that that did happen.

     D             THE CORONER: You have established that you did
              not see those things.  We can draw our own conclusion
              as to what we make of it.

                     MR. HALE:      I am much obliged,   thank you.

                   MR. PAYNE:  Sir, may I enquire whether there are
              to be other witnesses from within the pens?

     E               THE CORONER:     I was going to say dozens.

                     MR.   PAYNE:   Right.   Then I have no questions,
              sir.

                   THE CORONER: Because we have been so slow, if I
              can put it like that, we have not got to them.  I am
              not saying how many we are going to have, but I am
              determined to have a good number.
     F               MR.   PAYNE:   Thank you.

                   THE CORONER:      It is only right,    I think,    that we
              should do that.

                               Further by THE CORONER:

         Q.   There are a couple of questions which the Jury have
              asked me to ask you, which I will now do, and then I

                    under a barrier at all? - A. No, I never went under a
                    barrier.

                    You do not remember that? - A. No, I never went under
                    a barrier.
           B
               Q.   You did not go under a barrier? - A. No.

               Q.   Did you see any barrier break at all, did you notice
                    that? - A. Not then, no.

                    I think as a supplemental in your statement you say at
                    one point you saw people fall over? - A. Yes.

               Q.   But that was fairly late on, was it not? - A. Yes.

               Q.   And it was just shortly after that that you managed to
                    get out towards the back, is that right? - A. After
                    they had fallen over, yes.

                         THE CORONER: The other question which you have
                    asked about Mr. Howard's plan is a very good one
                    actually.  Mr. Catchpole was there, and Mrs. McBrien,
                    and you will remember that we had a plan prepared for
                    every single deceased where we could, and where we
                    could we marked the position where they were seen, and
                    the Jury have suggested that we have a look at that
                    plan, which I think is a good idea.  The interesting
                    thing is it is very close actually, the markings.

                         The other thing is I am very reluctant, as you
                    know, to use photographs because they are exceedingly
                    emotive and, in fact, that is the reason why we use
                    the plans.
                    But let me ask you, Mr. Lackey, just have a look at
                    this one and see whether this is the photograph where
                    you can see yourself on it.

                         MR. JONES:     It is Reference PR1/13A.

                         THE CORONER:   If it is, I might just use this
                    particular one.

                         THE WITNESS:    Yes.

                         THE CORONER: Is that the one where you can see
                    yourself? - A. Yes.

                         THE CORONER: In principle, if we are going to use
                    identifiers for the deceased, I would prefer to use my
                    plans because that was a deliberate choice on my part
                    at the time for the sake of everybody, but can we get
                    an overhead of that photograph, please, if you will
                    bear with us for a minute or two, and in the meantime

do we have a C reference for that plan?              Has it got a
C reference on it?

          MR. GRIFFITHS:     Sir,   the only reference is MRF.2.

          THE CORONER:     We can work it out.      It is Case
N o .1.

          MR. JONES:     C.162,   sir.

     THE CORONER: If we can just remember that, when
we put it up we will number it.
Mr. Lackey, we will clarify the position because it is
difficult to visualise, but the Jury very sensibly
remembered that there was something which might help.
A. Yes.

     MR. PAYNE:  I was wondering if we might do some
housekeeping while there is a short delay and can we
get the numbering up-to-date.  My last number is 319,
which is a photograph at 15.05, and then I think we
have at least the acetate from Mr. Lackey.

          THE CORONER: We have had something else.

     MR. JONES:  The plan of the terraces marked by
Mr. Lackey was C.320.  No new ones have been allocated
yet.

     THE CORONER: Be careful, because when we put one
of the plans up we will be using it at an earlier
numbering because it is already in, so to speak.

     The other thing I was going to say is we could,
of course, start on the next witness.  Would it be
inconvenient if, when we finish with this witness, we
rose for lunch and started a little bit earlier in the
afternoon?  Would that inconvenience you, Mr. Hale?   I
know that you have got problem a sometimes.

          MR. HALE:    I think I could manage that,      sir.

     THE CORONER: It is easier, in a sense, to start
with a witness and go on rather than break.  We will
only be another minute or two on this, but we might as
well sort it out.

     If I could just explain, ladies and gentlemen,
you know what these are but for you, if I could just
repeat what we did.  The officers, who had examined
the photographs to the best of their ability, then
identified the location of the deceased.  Now in this
particular case we know that Mr. Lackey was very close
to the deceased, and we marked them with various
                                                  56



                           D. A. LACKEY


coloured dots.  Now that dot represents Mr. Howard,
and the C reference is what?

     MR. JONES:  That plan is MRF.2 and we gave it a C
reference of 162, sir.

     THE CORONER: If you put Mr. Lackey's plan up,
turn round, Mr. Lackey, and just look at that.   You
can see where he has marked himself.   It is not
identical but it is in the right area.   Can you put
the photograph up?  What number is that.




                     /MR. JONES:   We will
                                                                   57


                                                   D. A. LACKEY




     HR. JOiiES:       We will give that C321,    sir.

     THE CORONER:        What is the PR number?

     MR. J O N E S :   PR1/E/13A

     THE CORONER:   You can see this photograph if you
turn round.  - A. Yes.

Can you see there is an arrow which points to some o n e ,
and it has got the word "Lackey" on it? - A. Yes.

Is that pointing at you? Is that you?         Can you
identify yourself? - A. Yes.

Is that the position that you reached when you got into
that surge? - A. Yes.

Where you stopped? - A. Yes.

And you can see in that case, the gate is open.  Can
you remember whether that would be the first or the
second opening, as far as you can recollect?  Perhaps
you can't remember? - A. Ho.

You can't    remember.    - A. I would say it was the    second.

Yes, that    is what I would guess.

     THE CORONER:       What    time isit on the bottom?

     MR. JONES:        15.03.

     THE CORONER:    It is timed at 15.03, which I think
is actually 15.02, isn't it?   It is one minute wrong,
or are these correct?

     MR. JONES:        The time clock was out one minute.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, that is right, but the timing
on the photograph is 15.03?

     MR. JONES:        Yes.

     THE CORONER: Subject to adjustment.

     HR. RUSSELL:    It was in       that sequence in that
film, the first photograph was        on the clock - PR1/1A is
a photograph of a clock in the        ground which shows
exactly 3 o'clock and the time        in the bottom right hand
corner is 15.01.

     THE CORONER:   That is right, yes.  I don't think
there is any argument about the timing of it, I was
                                              D. A. LACKEY




just trying to remember which way it went.  Does
anybody want to ask anything else?  I have merely put
this up for clarification:

And that is you where the arrow is? - A. Yes.

     MR. PAYNE:   Sir, I wonder if I might say on
behalf of all Counsel and representatives here that we
are most grateful to Mr. Lackey for attending to give
his evidence, and I certainly don't think that any of
us would want him to feel that he was in any being
criticised by any of the questions that were being put
to him.

        THE CORONER:   That is very kind of you,   to say
that:

I want to say, Mr. Lackey, I know that it has not been
a very easy thing for you to come but I am very
grateful to you that you have done so because it was
quite important, and I think with great respect when
you think about it you will realise that, in fact, you
have told us quite a bit, and also I was very anxious
that you should come because you were so close to Mr.
Howard.  I know that is painful for you, but it is very
important for the families.  Thank you very much
indeed.

     THE CORONER:   We will rise for lunch and start at
quarter-to-2 if that is convenient.

                     HORMAK LUDLAM Called (Sworn)

                             By THE COKOHER

    Q. Good afternoon     You are Norraan Ludlara? - A. That's
B        right.

    Q. Is it still                            ? - A. That's right,
         yes.

    Q.               in Sheffield? - A. Yes.

    Q. In 1989 I think you had been working as a turnstile
         operator at Sheffield Wednesday for about 7 or 8 years?
         - A. That's right, yes.

         Was this a regular task, that you had to go every other
         Saturday during the season? - A. Yes, every other
         Saturday.

    Q. Can you remember 1988,     the semi-final of 1988? - A. I
       can, yes.

D   Q. Can you remember whether you were working the same
         turnstile that year? - A. I was in that area.

    Q. We will talk about 1989 first of all, okay? - A. Yes.

    Q. I think I am right in saying that you were located in
         turnstile A is that right? - A. That is right, yes.

    Q. That is in the section for the people with B tickets,
       is that right? - A. That's right, yes.

    Q. Those were the ones who were supposed to be going onto
         the terracing? - A. That's right.

    Q. Would you agree w ith me that the operation of the
         turnstile, once you had been shown it, is not a matter
         of great difficulty? - A. Not really.

    Q. The coain thing is to make sure that you either get a
         ticket or the money? - A. That is right, yes.

    Q. Then you press your foot on the pedal so that the
         people can go through,   that is right,   isn't it? - A.
         Yes.

    Q. What time did you start working in your turnstile on
         15th April, 1989? - A. It would be roundabout 11
         o'clock.

         About 11 o'clock, so you started fairly early? - A.
         Yes.

                                                                      60

                                                      N. LUDLAM




Q. At that time I don't suppose there were that many
   people coming through were there? - A. No, there
   wasn't.

Q.    Until what time would you say that the flow was what        I
     would call real slow? - A. Any time up to about 2
     o'clock.

Q.   Up to 2 o'clock it was slow? - A. Yes.

Q.   I don't know what your practice is, but were you in the
     habit of counting your tickets? - A. Yes, you do.

Q.   You do? - A. You count them and put a pencil mark       on
     them.

Q.   I see, and can you by any chance remember how many you
     had counted up to about 2 o'clock? - A. I should say
     about 300 or 400.

Q. 300   or 400? - A. Yes.

Q. Had you had any problems up to 2 o'clock with people
   coming two or through the turnstiles? - A. Not really
   but I was offered money.  I kept on to them to take
   their hook, like.

Q. You   would not take it? - A.    No, no chance.

0. Did you also get people come to you who had tickets for
   the Kop end but who were Liverpool supporters? - A.
   Yes, I had one or two of them.

Q. ilhat did you do with those? - A. Just turned them away,
   all bar one - I had to let one through.

Q.   What time was that? - A. I can't really tell.      It would
     be roundabout 2 o'clock time.

Q. I see, and what was so special about him? - A.
   Policeman told me to let him through that was all.

Q. I see. - A. Just one special,      I don't know why like.

Q.   So that is the only one you let through? - A.    Yes.

0.   Did you have people come up without tickets -
     presumably the ones w ith the money did not have
     tickets, is that right? - A. No.

Q. Are you saying that as far      as you were concerned up to
   2 o'clock you did not have      any ticketless people going
   through? - A. No.  We just      had them few offered money
   like, I should say roughly      about five or six.
                                                              61

                                                  N. LUDLAM




Q. And you kicked those out? - A. Kicked those out, yes.
   We shouted to Policeman like and that were it.

Q. Did you send thera back out frontways? - A. Back
   outside.

Q. I take it at that time the numbers of people in the
   area, they could get out .... - A. They could get out
   easy, yes.

Q. From 2 o'clock onward what happened then, tell me in
   your own words what happened? - A. We were just getting
   more people pushing through, up to time of match like,
   gradually getting worse every minute.

0. It was getting worse? - A. Yes.

Q. Was there any point in this, between 2 and 3, as you
   say, when the matched started, when it became
   particularly bad? - A. I should say from about half-
   past-2 onwards it was really terrible.

Q. What was it that was so terrible? - A. Well there was
   20 trying to get into one little gate, fighting to get
   in more or less.

Q. You have done this for years now haven't you, 8 or 9 I
   think you said? - A. Yes.

Q. Had you come across that sort of situation before? - A.
   No, never as late as that.

Q. Never as late as that? - A. No.

Q. Are you saying then that it does happen that you get
   people wanting to get through but it is usually
   earlier? - A. Yes.

Q. At what time, in your experience, is it that you get
   people thronging? - A. Roundabout that time, half-past-
   2 time, they are usually, nearly everybody is in.  This
   particular time there were quite a lot outside.

Q. Can you think back to 1988 for a moment? - A. Yes.

Q. I am taking you back a year.  If you compare the flow
   of people through your turnstile, say in 1988 and '89
   between 21 and 2, was it about the same would you say?
   - A. I should say roughly, yes.  Perhaps a few more
   than that.

Q. A few more in '88? - A. Yes, coming a bit more steadier
   like.
                                                                 62

                                                     H. LUDLAM




    Q. What happened between 2 and 3 in 1988 as far as you can
       remember? - A. There was still quite a lot of people
       there like, but not as many as what there were this
       time.

B   Q. I see.  Did you in this last part of the proceedings
       have any problems apart from the fact that fans were
       pushing and trying to get in? - A. There had been
       plenty of mouthing off at us like.

    Q. Sorry? - A. We were getting quite a few spectators
       shouting at us, and giving a lot of abuse.

    Q. Did they look distressed to you as they were coming
       through? - A. They did in a way, just fighting amongst
       themselves more or less.

    0. Can you tell me, are you actually able to look out onto
       the Leppings Lane area from wriere you are in the
       turnstile? - A. Not out into the street really.

    Q. Can you see outside your turnstile? - A. You could just
       seen entrance, that was all.
D   Q. Could you see whether the people who were pushing to
       get in, were they themselves being pushed?  Mas it
       happening because there were so many people behind them
       forcing them forward, or could you not see? - A. I
       couldn t see very well, but the gate I was on was right
       in the corner, and they were pushing up against the
       wall all the time.

    Q. You could see that? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you have Police Officers outside your gate
       searching initially? - A. Yes, there were two outside
       and two inside.

    Q. And they were searching in and out, so to speak? - A.
       They could do when it first started, up to 2 o'clock,
       but after that there were that many people coming in,
       they just couldn't cope.

    Q. Did you notice the Officers on the outside
       disappearing, if that is the right word?   Did you lose
       sight of them? - A. Well, we kept losing sight of them,
       yes, because they probably got called to somewhere
       else.

    Q. Did the Officers on the inside stay, as far as you
       know? - A. Well, I think they got pulled away and all
       like, eventually.

                                                       N. LUDLAM




Q. You from your position could not see any gates open,
   could you? - A. No.

Q.   Could you see Gate B? - A. No.

Q.   You can't see it? - A. No.

Q.   And I take it you did not see them   open? - A.   No.

0.   But you noticed that the crowds appeared   todisappear?
     - A. Eventually, about 5 - to-3 time or something like
     that.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Q. Mr. Ludlam, you have a very restricted view as to what
   is going on outside your turnstile, don't you? - A.
   That's right, yes.

0. So you can't really offer a judgment as to what was
   happening.  You only saw the people as they were coming
   through, that is fair, isn't it? - A. Yes, and there
   were quite a lot of people on top of the turnstile
   itself.

Q. Yes, what I am interested in is this, you are able to
   tell us the numbers who had come through by 2 o'clock,
   you gave your estimate? - A. Roughly, yes.

Q. It was also being counted electronically, wasn't it? -
   A. It was, yes.

Q. So that somewhere else in the ground, if anybody was
   looking at the computer or whatever it was which was
   taking the numbers, would be able to say exactly how
   many had got through by 2 o'clock? - A. They should be
   able to do, yes, roughly.




                   Q. And they would be able to say ....
                                                      N. LUDLAM


Q. They would be able to say how many had got through by
   two o'clock along the whole line of those turnstiles,
   A to G? - A. They should do.

Q. Were you aware that some 10,000 people had to go
   through the seven turnstiles A to G on that
   afternoon? - A. Not really.

Q.    You did not know? - A. We didn't know the exact
     amount. We knew there would be a lot there but I
     wouldn't say 10,000.

Q. Does 10,000 surprise you? Does it surprise you to
   learn that 10,000 went through? - A. No, not really.

Q. What you can tell us is that of that 10,000 on your
   one turnstile, one out of seven, no more than 400
   were there by two o'clock? - A. That is right, yes.

       THE CORONER:   Did he say 400 or 200 to 300?

Q.        MR. KING:   I beg your pardon.   What was it? - A.
     300 to 400.

Q.    Of course, we may well be able to get those numbers
     from another source? - A. You probably could, yes.

Q. The point which is obvious? - A. More people come
   after two o'clock than what did before.

Q. Far more people came after two o'clock than before.
   At any time, you could not do it, anybody looking at
   the figures of the people going through the
   turnstiles with that computer would be able to make
   an estimate of how many more people there were to
   come, would they not? - A. Yes, they would be able
   to, near enough.

Q. Were you given any information yourself as to how
   many more people to expect? - A. Not really.

     MR. KING: I have been sent a note.      May I have a
moment to read it?

      THE CORONER:    Yes, certainly.

     MR. KING:   A point which is concerning those behind
me, I will ask the question.

      THE CORONER:    Please do.
                                                  N. LUDLAM


Q.        MR. KING: Were you yourself under orders to do
     what the Police were saying or were you meant to use
     your own discretion? Who were you acting under? - A.
     Under the Police.

Q. Under the Police? - A. Yes, we knew what to do like,
   from experience.

Q. If they said to let somebody in you then let them in?
   - a . Yes.

Q. If they said, "Don't let them in" you did not? - A.
   No. We knew that anyway.

Q. There is some concern about the use of the expression
   "fighting". They were not actually fighting with
   each other, were they? - A. Just pushing and shoving
   trying to get in faster than anybody else.

Q. They were trying to get into the turnstiles? - A.
   Yes.

Q. What was going on behind them you had not a clue? -
   A. We couldn't see really.

Q. So you do not know? - A. One big mad rush at the gate
   entrance and that were it.

Q. You do not know whether or not they were being
   pressurised to get in at all. You just do not
   know? - A. I should imagine so, yes, the way they
   were pushing and crushing.

Q. You imagine they were being pressurised? - A. Yes.

                    Further bv THE CORONER:

Q. Can I just ask you one other question which has
   occurred to me? If you compare 1988 to 1989, was the
   flow in 1988 steadier than in 1989 or was it about
   the same except that in 1989 it was later? - A. It
   was steadier actually.  In 1988 there were more
   people in before two o'clock than what there were
   after.

     THE CORONER:   Does anybody wish to ask anything else?
Thank you for being here.

     MR. PAYNE:   Sir, before you call the next witness I
wonder if I might raise a matter of law with you about
which the Jury do not need to be troubled.
                                                      66




     THE CORONER:     You would like the Jury out?

     MR. PAYNE:     Yes, please.

                  (in the absence of the Jury)

     MR. PAYNE:   I am doing this in the absence of the
Jury because I do not want to get into the situation that
we were in two or three days ago when Mr. King and I were
vigorously arguing in front of the Jury.

     THE CORONER:     Yes.

      MR. PAYNE: I am anxious really to receive your ruling
about the extent to which Counsel or Advocates before you
may be permitted to make what I can call disguised speeches
in the form of questions. One knows there is a certain
extent to which cross-examination is within bounds and then
it is difficult to draw the line but one knows when it has
been gone over where the cross-examination then becomes a
vehicle to make a point rather than to ask the witness a
question.   I am not saying that it is easy to draw that
line.

     There are a lot of questions being asked along the
lines of, "Would it surprise you to know that such and such
was the situation elsewhere in the ground?" and, "Were you
aware that elsewhere in the ground..." the latest example
being, "Were you aware that elsewhere in the ground there
was a counting mechanism which could total up the number of
people coming into the ground?". The witness says, "I
don't know, it is nothing to do with me", or whatever
answer he gives. The real reason for asking the question
is to make the point about the evidence as a matter of fact
that this was something which leads to something else. So
it is not a question but is in fact a disguised speech.
There were several examples yesterday in connection with
the anticipation of Police Officers outside the ground on
their horses and what they could expect at two o'clock
which was then countered by questions along the lines of,
"You weren't in a position to know what was happening and
what numbers were to be expected but someone else inside
the ground with the full information would be", and so on.
That is a disguised way of making a submission of fact or
introducing a completely different fact which that witness
is not in a position to know himself.

     Sir, what I am asking for is your guidance as to the
extent to which this sort of cross-examination is
permitted.  I may say that I am very conscious that this
can be done and it can be done not just by one party.  If
this is permissible, and it is permissible to dress up a
question by introducing extraneous facts in order to make a
useful point, and there are plenty of useful points lying
around available to be made when most witnesses give
evidence, if that is permissible, I would be grateful to
know that it is and we will organise the cross-examination
accordingly.  If it is not permissible then I would be
grateful if it is not allowed.

     MR. KING: Sir, I suspect that is a disguised attack
on myself and in that case can I respond to it? Sir, I
agree that one should not make a speech to a witness but
when issues are raised and take, for example, a situation
yesterday where my learned friend asked witnesses - and he
started the line of questioning - "Would it have surprised
you at two o'clock to learn that there were a lot more
people to come?" and he must be asking that question for a
purpose, in my submission, it is only right and proper that
further along the line one asks the question to realise
that that person is not a person to be in a position to
know but there may well be another person in a position to
know. That is not making a speech. That is simply
obtaining evidence as to the nature of his role and whether
or not he was aware of other persons having a different
role. One knows that the import of his evidence to my
learned friend is not perhaps of the significance that it
apparently would have been if one did not ask that
question.

     Taking the point, sir, which seems to be objected to
immediately about numbers, this witness was telling us from
his own estimate the numbers going through. The Jury might
have thought that was going to be the be end and end all of
the numbers going through, his estimate, and it was
important in my submission to ascertain through that
witness that in fact not only his estimate but they would
be counted automatically going through. He was also asked
about the numbers arriving, his impression of numbers
arriving, how many had come and so forth, the flow, and in
my submission it is not making a speech in order to
investigate that evidence to discover whether or not there
were ways and means of knowing with greater exactitude how
many people had already arrived and how many were to come.

     Sir, I do not in any way resile from the nature of the
questions I put.  If I might give an example of a speech
through questions - and it is not meant to be an attack but
is only an example that comes to mind - this morning we had
a witness being asked the following sort of question, "You
say you did not see anything. Did you not see the
following?" and then there is a rehearsal of evidence which
may or may not have been accurate of what had been said by
other witnesses and the witness said, "I didn't see it".   I
did not object at the time because one takes the rough with
the smooth though in fact, sir, you did stop at the
appropriate time but I am bound to say I accept the
principle that one should not make a speech through
questions, I accept that, but I do not accept that the
examples my learned friend has indicated, namely the
questions I asked, were designed to that end. They were
not.  It was a genuine question I asked, whether or not he
knew there was a computer counting the numbers because that
may help us to know whether or not he himself was counting
accurately, whether or not he was concentrating on it, or
what have you. It did not have the sinister purpose which
my learned friend put on it.

     MR. PAYNE: May I just be permitted shortly to make
this comment? Another example which has come to mind was
that several of the Police horsemen were asked questions
about planning for the event which was clearly something
outside their own ambit. My submission is that the rule
ought to be that witnesses should be asked about matters
which they themselves ought to give first hand evidence and
the cross-examination should be confined to what the
witness saw and what the witness knows of his own
knowledge.  If that rule is adhered to then one will avoid
this sort of problem.

     M R . KING: I am bound to say my breath is somewhat
taken away by that example about planning because it was my
learned friend who insisted on asking nearly every witness
who came from the Police what they thought of the
Operational Order, whether they thought this was as good as
last year, whether it needed to be changed and what have
you. So it was that question which opened the door to
planning and it was only in reply to those planning
questions that the response came from this side of the
floor.

     MR. HALE:   I rise so rarely that it is a shame that
when I do it should be thought to be wrong.  I would draw a
very big distinction between evidence which has already
been given, and that is what I was asking about, which if
it was wrong anybody could pick me up on it. There is a
big difference from prognosticating about what is going to
come in the future.

      MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, can I say a few words from the
other flank? I, and all of us, have listened to both Mr.
Payne and Mr. King begin two questions which have become
quite familiar. Mr. Payne often says, "If someone had
tapped you on the shoulder at about two o'clock and
said....'' and Mr. King has been tapping people on the
shoulder right, left and centre in all parts of the ground,
usually telling them that about a thousand people are about
to come into the enclosure, those are questions which are
of no great assistance to you, sir, or the Jury and I hope
I can take something of a neutral stance by identifying
both types of questioning from both the people who have
                                                        69




sought to make and defend points during the absence of the
Jury at the moment.

     What is being sought and what concerns me to an extent
is the extent to which evidence of opinion is being slid
into the evidence and primarily, of course, the Jury's duty
is to establish the how that 95 people met their deaths.
As a matter of admissibility and as a matter of brevity,
and as a matter of getting through the Inquests as
efficiently as possible I would invite you to restrict
questions that are transparent attempts to bring opinions
to the fore before the Court. What might have been
plannable might have been an interesting question but it is
clearly a question seeking the opinion of a particular
witness.  I apologise to my learned friend, Mr. King, for
taking that example but it is one which has been raised a
few moments ago. I would encourage you, sir, from this end
of the Bar to limit so far as you are able evidence from
witnesses as to what they saw and what they could see and
they should not be asked what might have been capable of
being seen by other people in other places at other times
because that is really treacherous evidence and in other
courts would not be admissible.  I appreciate different
rules of admissibility apply before you but perhaps in the
interests of brevity and bringing the evidence before the
Jury as to what the facts are rather than what a lot of
people's opinions.  It is the best way forward.

     THE CORONER:   I agree with Mr. Payne and Mr. King
that to use a question as a form of making a speech clearly
is wrong and my problem is to stop it when it occurs.   It
may well be I might miss some or other. That is the first
point.  I agree that if I perceive that that is what is
happening then I will endeavour to say, "No, stop".

    We have been over this question of opinion already and
my basic principle is that people's opinions are of no
value unless it is something which they have seen or heard
or because they happen to be experts. The difficulty is
that in some cases, for example let us take a turnstile
operator, he may not be an expert in computing but if he
has had nine years of turnstile operation then he has some
knowledge of how they work and I think it is not improper
for whoever it may be to say, "Can you tell me what you
think about that?"




                             /I think it is perfectly
                                                        70


                                        THE CORONER



I think it is perfectly proper to ask whether there are any
counting mechanisms, particularly when I asked about whether
he had counted the tickets.

     I did not perceive your questions as being speeches with
regard to the computing aspects and whether they could be seen
somewhere else.  I was beginning, I suppose, to twitch a
little bit because I felt we were getting to a point where we
were asking a turnstile operator to tell us something about
the managerial side of the club, but in the events which
happened and the reason why I did not stop you was because I
listened to his answers, and his answers on the whole were,
"As far as I know but I d o n ’t really know” , or words to that
effect.  I am not quoting him verbatim, of course. So I felt
on balance I could let it go.

     I think in principle, and everybody is agreed on this, no
disguised speeches, (2) opinions to experts, and take Mr.
Creaser who we had a few days ago, he was a very experienced
Police Office, a relatively senior one, and I did not think
there was anything particular wrong in asking him as to his
views with regard to planning and because his views might well
have some validity.  To ask a PC is a little bit more
doubtful. Certainly, my intention when I come to do my
summing-up, is to make my views on the values of opinions
clear to the Jury, and that is in my mind, and may be that
influences me a little bit in the way I put the questioning.

        So, Mr. Payne, I am partly with you and partly against
you. As I say, your main point is agreed, and I agree it as
well. The secondary point whether speeches are being made, if
I were to think that were to happen then I would intervene.
That is not to say I may well miss something and I am not
saying it is Mr. King who does it. All of you can do it.
You are all capable of doing it. Forgive me, Mrs. McBrien
sometimes does it, does not she, and sometimes I know she has
done it and sometimes I do intervene and sometimes I distrain
myself and don't, because I have to allow because I feel I
d o n ’t want to hamper you too much. So try and be fair.

      I have no objection to getting tougher, because we must
make progress, and in fact I am certain when we start again in
January we will be going a lot faster, partly because a lot of
the evidence - not all of it, of course - a lot of it will
already have been canvassed, and I will then take the view, I
think, that if we call a witness who is really just repeating
what we already know then unless that witness has something to
say which is significantly different from what we have heard,
we will cut through that and we will listen to the bits that
matter.   I think that will certainly also make it easier for
all of you. At this stage we have gone - I would not say
leisurely;   I d o n ’t think it is leisurely;  I find it quite
hard work - but we have gone into a great deal of detail and
we have repeated evidence from one witness to the next, but I
thought it was necessary because the Jury need to ;get the
feel of what the evidence is about.      That is not to say when
✓
                                                                       71


                                                      J.R. SMITH


             we call witnesses who are saying things which are different,
             because on the whole when I prepared my provisional list I did
             look at their statements.  It was not just that I said, ’’Let
             us have 10 Bs and 5 Cs of surnames". Most of them I thought
             were saying something which might be helpful. Whether I am
             right or not we will see.
    B             I think that is as far as I cango, but on the other hand
             I have no objection as we go along if you feel I am slipping,
             so to speak, from my standards, if I am reminded at convenient
             points. Shall we have the Jury back? Are you happy with
             that? To a great extent, of course, you can help me and
             yourselves by thinking hard about your lines of questioning.

        Q. You are Jason Robert Smith.     Is that right? - A. I am, yes.

        Q. And what is your address? - A.

    D   Q.   That is in Sheffield? - A. That is Sheffield, yes.

        Q.    In 1989 you were a student. I see you have a badge on.    - A.
             That is just over Christmas.

        Q. You are still a student? - A. I am University now.

        Q.    Well done. In 1989 you were a turnstile operator, on     a part-
             time basis, of course? - A. Yes.

        Q. And I think you had been a programme seller for a few years,
           and then you had been promoted or transferred to turnstile
           operator? - A. Yes.

        Q. That was about September, 1988.     Is that right? - A. That is
           right, ye s.

        Q. And mum and dad also work at the club? - A. That is right.

        Q. So it is a family concern. - A. Yes.

        Q. We have heard from one or two of the other operators that in
           fact to operate a turnstile is not one of the most difficult
           tasks. Would you agree with that? - A. I would agree with
           that, yes .

        Q . Obviously you have to be shown what   you are supposed to d o ,
            and I take it you have explained to   you about taking the
            money, how much you should take and   if it is an all-ticket
            match how to deal with it? That is    right? - A. Yes, that is
            right.

                                                   J.R. SMITH


         Q. But once that has been done and you are watched for a little
            while, it should not be too difficult to operate the
            turnstile.  Is that right? - A. That is right.

         Q. And in 1989 were you in fact working on turnstile B? - A. I
            was on that particular occasion, yes.
     B   Q. And that was again in the section of turnstiles A-G which led
            into the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. Yes.

         Q. And you having done your preliminary tasks of collecting
            paraphernalia that you need and so on, you had gone to your
            turnstile? - A. Yes, that is right.

         Q. And did you get there about quarter-past-11 or so? - A.
            Perhaps just abit before that.

         Q. And you went in, and what time did you open, can you remember?
            - A. It might have been about half-past-11.

         Q. Between half-past-11 and half-past-12 virtually nobody came
            in. Is that right? - A. That is right.

         Q. As far as you were concerned? - A. Yes, through my turnstile.

     D   Q. And it did not really surprise you, did it, because it was
            quite early on. At that time were there Police Officers
            outside your turnstile and inside? - A. Yes, you could not
            open up until they were.

         Q. I see.   So you had to wait for them to come? - A. Yes.

         Q. And did things then begin   to pick up a little bit? - A.      Not at
            half-past-12, no.

         Q. What time did it start picking up? - A. Sort of 1 o ’clock,
            half-past-1, really, before anybody in a lot of numbers came
            in.

         Q. Of course, you were not there the previous year, were you? -
            A. I was not, no.

         Q. You were a programme seller? - A. I was, yes.

         Q. We won ’t ask you anything about that, then. Did you have
            people come to you with tickets for the wrong part of the
            ground? - A. Yes.

         Q. And were these Liverpool supporters? Did you recognise them?
            - A . By their accents, probably, y e s .

         Q. You thought they were Liverpool supporters? - A. Yes.

         Q. But they just happened to have tickets for the Nottingham
            Forest end? - A. That is right.

         Q. How many of those came to you in total,   altogether,   from the
                                                            73


                                           J.R. SMITH.


     time you opened to the time you closed? - A. From half-past-2
     it was impossible to tell how many.

Q. Tell me up to half-past-2? - A. The first one was about half-
   past-12, and then they came, probably 10 or 12, until about
   half-past-2.

Q. And what did you do with those up to half-past-2? - A. From
   half-past-12, the gentleman who came in at half-past-12, a
   Policeman overheard the conversation, and he directed the
   gentleman to a high ranking Policeman outside somewhere, and
   he would deal with him from there.  So from then on until it
   would be just after 2 I could then say, "Look for the high
   ranking Policeman outside and he will direct you what to do” .

Q. So in other words, you did not let them through? - A. No.

Q. What you did was you sent them back out and said, "Find the
   Police Officer and he will tell you what to do"? - A. Yes.

Q . You may not be able to remember or answer this. Can you
    recollect whether any of those people came back to you? - A. I
    did not see them, no.

Q. So you d o n ’t actually know what happened to them? - A. No.

Q. And as far as you were concerned you had not let them in? - A.
   That is right, yes.

Q.    And did people alsooffer you cash to get in? - A. Not that
     time.   It was about half-past-2 when everybody started coming
     together and everything was sort of happening then.

Q. What you are saying is that until about half-past-2 things
   were fairly quiet and completely normal? - A. Yes.

Q.   And nothing that startled you in any way? - A. No.

Q.    Describe to me what happened about half-past-2, as far as you
     were concerned? - A. Until half-past-2 I was able to number
     each ticket as I received it to save time later on.

Q. How did you get to by then? - A. It was about 700.

Q. 700 until half-past-2? - A. Yes. From half-past-2 it became
   unsafe to continue doing it because it added an extra second
   or two on to the time going through, so I pushed them to one
   side and put the new ones in a different pile. They were
   coming in like a continuous stream, and you could not stop
   anybody into the turnstile because they were all pushing so
   hard, so you just had to put your foot on the pedal and let it
   turn and take whoever was inside it with it inside.


                                /Q. You have given.
                              J.   R.   SMITH


You have given quite a graphic and interesting
account.  Did you have the impression that they were
being propelled from behind and that they really
hadn't much option? - A. Yes, that is right.   In one
instance there were three came in together almost, and
the end two were holding the middle one up because he
had been crushed outside.

I see.   How poorly did that man look?  I take it it
was a man? - A. Yes, it was a man.   He could not walk
himself.   He was very sweaty and I couldn't see a lot
of him because they were going through fast.

At this time in between 2.30 and 3 o'clock, were
people also offering you money? - A. Yes.

Because it sounded as if they were? - A. Yes,    they
were.

I know it is difficult to be precise, but are you able
to say what sort of numbers there were, you know,
proportionally? - A. I can say that out of the people
I admitted after half-past 2, from my own estimates
then I estimated that for every two that went in with
a ticket, one did not, so that would have been split
between people with no tickets, the wrong tickets, or
with m o n e y . '

So you are saying if you let 100 in with tickets you
would let another 50 go through either without or with
the wrong ticket? - A. Yes, approximately.

That was in that last half-hour? - A. That was in the
last half-hour, yes.

Did you count up, by chance, how many tickets? - A.     In
the last half-hour?

In the last half-half.   - A. About 300.

So, in fact, that last half-hour you had had through,
on your estimates, about 450 people, would that be
right? - A. Yes, approximately.

If my arithmetic is right.     You are not a mathematical
student? - A. I am, yes.

Did I get it right? - A.     That is right.

That is about 45% or so of the numbers that you had
had through in the previous two hours? - A. Yes.

Approximately.  You can do the sums for me!  Apart
from that, anything else about that afternoon,

                                  J.    R.   SMITH


     particularly the last half-hour, which worried or
     concerned you? - A. Well, a lot of the fans were
     coming in sweating, and there were lots of sounds from
     outside, from in Leppings Lane itself, making
     derogatory comments about the state of the ground
     really, that they couldn't get in quick enough, and
     there were people saying, "Come on, open up, we're
     dying outside", but at that sort of time you just took
     it as, "Come on, let's get in quick, we want to see
     the game".  But as it progressed and people were
     getting more sweaty you felt there might have been
     some problem outside the ground.

Q.   Because you cannot see very well, can you, because you
     were looking ahead of you? - A. Not only that, you
     have got the people blocking the doorway to look into
     Leppings Lane.

Q.   So your initial thought was that ---  A. They were
     just eager to get in to see the game.

Q.   But then when it went on and you saw that they were
     sweaty and a bit red in the face, and so on, you
     thought, 'Maybe there's something happening out
     there'? - A. Yes.  They were coming in aggressive as
     well.

Q.   Were they aggressive to you? - A. Generally.  Just
     generally about the whole thing that was happening
     outside really.  They were aimed sometimes directly at
     me, but more often than not one of the people's
     friends would say, "Look, it's not his fault, let's
     just get in".

Q.   So somebody might shout at you, or swear at you, and
      then his mate might say, "Shut up, it's not his
      fault", or something like that? - A. Something like
      that, yes.

Q.   Did you hear people on the roof? - A. I think so, yes.
     In all the crush and that it could be anything, but I
     thought I heard people crossing the roof.

Q.   Then am I right in thinking that everything cleared
     apparently, you know, things quietened down? - A. Yes.

Q.   You were pleased, I suppose, at that point? - A. I was
     surprised how quickly it all cleared.

Q.   You did not know why? - A.   No.

Q.   You had not seen any gates   open? - A. No.
                                                               76




                                  J.   R.   SMITH


Q.   Had you heard any announcements before 3 o'clock? - A.
     No.

Q.   I think you did hear an announcement, but it was well
     after 3, was it not? - A. It was well after 3, yes. It
     was after I saw the Liverpool fans beginning to come
     back into the enclosure.

Q.   Do you know about what time that was, can you
     remember? - A. Perhaps it might have been about
     quarter-past 3, something like that.

Q.   So your experience was that in that last half-hour
     there were through your turnstile quite a lot of
     people    A.  There were a lot of people, yes.

Q.   Who came through, as far as you could tell, with the
     wrong or without tickets? - A. Yes.

Q.   With the wrong ticket or without tickets altogether? -
     A. Yes.

                  Cross-Examined by MR.     PAYNE:

Q.   It is more accurate than quite a lot:           you estimate
     150 in the last half-hour? - A. Yes.

Q.   Is mathematics your degree subject? - A. It is not,
     no.

Q.   What do you mean by saying you are a mathematician?            -
      A. I did maths at A level.

            THE CORONER: That makes me feel more comfortable
     now.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS:

Q.   Mr. Smith, just one or two questions about this.           You
     say that from 2.30 it became unsaid to count the
     number of tickets? - A. Yes.

Q.   Unsafe to the number of people who were coming in? -
      A. I presume, yes, by taking the extra time to number
      them I was causing more trouble outside, more people,
     more pressure.

Q.   The people who offered you money, it may sound like a
     daft question and perhaps it is, but why did you not
     tell them that they had to go somewhere else and they
     could not come in? - A. They could not go anywhere
     else.  They had to go through the turnstile.
                                                               77



                                  J.   R.   SMITH


Q.   Why was that? - A. Because there was no way they could
     go backwards out through the queue that was at the
     turnstile.  There was a queue from the Leppings Lane
     into the turnstile and the pressure was such that the
     only way they could go was through into the ground,
     and you just had to trust the Police on the inside
     then to have seen the offer of money and then eject
     the supporter concerned.

Q.   They, of course, must have known that when they got
     into the queue? - A. Yes.

Q.   Apart from those who offered you money, were there
     people who just presented themselves, did not offer
     you money but did not have a ticket? - A. Yes.   In
     that case it was often the case that his friend,
     perhaps, or her friend, would have a ticket, and it is
     like a 90 degree segment of the turnstile and they
     would both try and get into this 90 degree segment and
     as it turned they would both go through together.   So
     it was one click of the turnstile, but there would be
     two people in it.

Q.   You were left with no option because of what was
     happening? - A. Yes.

Q.   But to let them through? - A. Yes,       that is right.

                Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING

Q.   Ordinarily, if that had been tried on you, you would
      have held them in the ratchet, if you like, not put
      your foot on the pedal, called the police officer and
      said, "One of these two is trying it on"? - A. That is
      right, yes.

Q.   But because of the press   coming back you had
     absolutely no option but   to let them through? -     A.
     Yes, that is right.

Q.   And you just kept your foot on the pedal, letting as
     many people --- A. You can't keep your foot on because
     it jams.  You have to keep lifting it up every time
     somebody has gone through and press again.

Q.   I am not quite sure when the 300 is counted from and
      it may be you are not entirely sure either.     Is that
      300 counted from 2.30 up to the   time that you stopped
      counting? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q.   Is that a precise figure then?  You went back
     afterwards and re-counted? - A.  Well, I had counted
     the first 700 or so beforehand, and they were all
                                                                  78




                                       J.   R.   SMITH


     numbered.  So the difference must have been after
     half-past 2.

Q.   Because after everybody had got in, as far as you were
     concerned, you then calculated or added the number
     that you had left? - A. Yes.

Q.   What you are saying is in that last half-an-hour about
     half those people had no ticket? - A. No, about half
     as many again.

Q.   I am sorry, one half of the number, I see. - A. So
     those 300 were counted tickets and there was about
     half as many again who went in without a ticket.

Q.   150? - A. Yes,    approximately.

          MR. MANNING:  I am glad I got it right because I
     did A level maths as well.

                      Further by THE C O R O N E R :

Q.   Before Mr. King rises, I have just looked at your
     statement and the figure you gave in your statement is
     very close, but it was 270 tickets that you counted.
     Is that more accurate than 300?   It does not make very
     much difference.- A. I would say that was right.   That
     was nearer the time.

          THE CORONER: Mr. Manning, did you hear that?  It
     is 270.  If you divide that and add that up, it is a
     little bit less than 450, but not that much less.

          MR. MANNING:       35 about.

          THE CORONER:      About 50 less.         It is about 400.

          MR. CATCHP0LE:  Before Mr. King rises, it may be
     helpful, the actual number of tickets that were taken
     were 992 in the turnstile, so I think that probably
     puts it in perspective.

          THE CORONER: He is pretty accurate in other
     words. It is his A level.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. K I N G :

Q.   It would appear you are pretty accurate on the
     counting of the tickets, Mr. Smith.  It has been
     checked.  You would agree with me that as far as
     estimating how many people came through who were not
     part of those who had given you one of those tickets,
     that is just an estimate of your eyes in that chaotic
     last half-hour? - A. Yes.
                                                         79



                                 J.   R.   SMITH


Q.   It was a chaotic last half-hour, was it not? - A. Yes.

Q.   Your turnstile, however, clicked every time someone
      went through? - A. Unless they went through together.

Q.   I accept that, but if they did not go through together
     it clicked every time one single person went through?
     - A. It did, yes.

Q.   Those number of clicks, we know from the last witness,
     are recorded somewhere? - A. They are, yes.

Q.   I am not suggesting for one moment that you cannot
      give us the estimate, but another way of checking your
      estimate of the number of people who went through who
      did not give you a ticket is to look to see how many
      clicks there were on that turnstile? - A. That is
      correct, yes.

Q.   I accept that that may not itself be entirely accurate
     because one click may represent two people? - A. That
     is right.

Q.   So it is all a matter of slight guesswork in that
     respect? - A. Yes.

Q.   Tell me, the policemen who were originally looking
     after you at your turnstile before half-past 2, where
     were they positioned? - A. There would be a number
     outside into the Leppings Lane itself. They would be
     searching the supporters coming in and there would be
     some on the inside searching them again as they were
     going into the ground.

Q.   Would those police officers who were receiving people
     as they went through the turnstiles into the concourse
     area be standing outside the exit to the turnstile,
     the entrance into the concourse? - A. Not directly
     outside, obviously to give the supporters some room to
     go through, but they would be certainly close by, yes.

Q.   As you understood it - and you must have seen the
      officers who were there because you may have spoken to
      them? - A. I did not speak to any.

Q.   But you saw them? - A. I spoke to one or two in
     specific circumstances about the gentleman who had the
     wrong ticket.

Q.   I am interested to know how close they were to the
      exit point of your turnstile? - A.  Perhaps 6 or 8
      feet away from the end.
                                 J.   R.   SMITH


So they were able to see into your turnstile area? -
A. They were, yes.
If, for example, two had gone through that would be
visible to the Police on that side? - A. It would have
been visible sort of before all of them came through
in a crush together.  They may not have noticed at
that point.

Were you able yourself to communicate with the Police?
- A. I never had cause to.  I could have shouted to a
policeman certainly.

Did you, in fact, ever shout to a policeman and say,
"Look, people are coming through in twos"? - A. No,
because when they were I couldn't leave the turnstile
unattended, or people would crush on the outside.

Can you estimate - it is very difficult - of the 150
which you say came through without a proper ticket,
how many of those were people who came through in a
group of two as opposed to coming through and your
letting them through on a click? - A. I could not be
accurate.  Not a great percentage of the 150 would
have done that, but there were certainly a fair number
of them.

Because we seem to know the number of clicks that were
recorded it may help us to get a rough estimate
because you are clearly somebody who has a good eye
for estimates.   You say not a great number of the 150?
- A . No, perhaps 10 or 15.

10 or 15 of the 150? - A. Yes, would have gone through
with somebody with a ticket.

Right.  So if we take those 15 off, we have got your
estimate of 135 going through who would have gone
through on a click? - A. Yes.

That is why I come back to something you cannot help
us with, but we can check your estimate, perhaps,
against the recorded clicks? - A. Yes, you can.

       THE CORONER: Anybody else?

     MR. HALE:  Just     on Mr. King's last question, I
think we had reduced     it to 135, not 150.

       THE CORONER:   I thought Mr. King said that.

       MR. HALE:   I am sorry,    I thought he said out of
150.

       THE CORONER: Yes.
                             J.   R.   SMITH


     MR. KING:   I am getting confused. I understand
the point being made. We started with 300 going
through with tickets, and then it was for every two
there was one allegedly without, so we arrived at 150.
I was working on that 150 and took off ray 15. I think
Mr. Hale was being kind to me in saying I started with
too large a number without a ticket because it is 2:1
of 270.   I do not have my pocket calculator and I am
certainly not going to ask this witness to do it on
his feet.

     THE CORONER:   I do not think we need to.   We have
got a rough idea.

     MR. KING:  I think what we do establish is that
the numbers going through in twos are very small
numbers? - A. Yes.

So the point I am making to you about checking the
clicks as against the number of tickets you have got
is still a good one? - A. Yes.

     THE CORONER: Thank you, Mr. Hale, and thank you
too, Mr. Smith, and all the very best to you at
university.

     THE WITNESS:   Thank you.

      NEIL KEITH JOSEPH LAYCOCK Called (Sworn)

                   By THE CORONER

You are Neil Keith Joseph Laycock? - A. That is
correct, yes.

              Sheffield? - A. That is correct.

You are a student too, is that right? - A. That is
right, yes.

What is your subject? - A.

So you can add.  In 1S89 you had been working as a
turnstile operator for about three seasons, is that
right? - A. That is correct, yes.

Do you normally work at the Leppings Lane end? - A.
Yes, I have always been on the Leppings Lane end.

Were you on 15th April 1989 on turnstile number 5? - A.
That is correct, yes.

That is one of the turnstiles that serves or is
supposed to serve the North Stand, is that right? - A.
That is right, yes.

And although it is a stand it is a seated area? - A.
That is right.

On that day you knew it was an all ticket match, and
you were not expecting to do anything other than
collect tickets? - A. That is right, yes.

And you too would agree that relatively speaking, once
you know how to do it, it isn't that difficult? - A.
That is right, yes.

Can you remember, were you working in 1988, for the
1988 semi-final? - A. Yes, the year before the same
fixture, that is right.

Were you, I am not saying on the same turnstile, but
were you in the same area? - A. I would have been on
Leppings Lane, yes, on the North Stand.

Let's stick to'89 first of all, okay?  Just you tell me
(a) what time you began, and what your experiences
were? - A. Uell, I got to the ground about, say, 11 to
half-past, obviously registered in, got all the
equipment, was allotted my gate and then got to the
gate, I would say about 12 o'clock, something like
that.  At that stage we had been told to make ourselves
                                                                   83


                                          N.   K.   J.   LAYCOCK




  known to trie Policemen on the outside, which we did and
  then we opened up the gates.   I had just a few through
  early on at that stage.   As I say, we kept on going,
  there was a sort of steady flow, nothing really very
  much - a bit of trouble, the usual sort of people
  trying to get through without a ticket, or trying to
  buy a ticket, and we were just letting them know they
  could not purchase one, or redirecting them if their
  ticket was for the wrong part of the ground.

        Then it was just a steady progression until about
  2.35 where there was an enormous surge at that stage.
  It just seemed to - usually there is a gap, a bit of a
  breathing space, if you like, between each supporter
  coming in, but it was just like a continual flow, to
  the stage where obviously they were in trouble outside
  and they needed to get in.   In the last 25 minutes it
  was impossible at that stage to even get tickets off
  them.   It was a struggle at that stage because the
  minute you put your foot on the turnstile they were
  rushed through.   Rather than pushing the stile
  themselves, the sheer pressure behind them pushed them
  through it.

Q. So what you are saying is you had a column of people? -
   A. That is right.

Q. Up against the turnstile? - A. That is right, pushing
   right up against it.

Q. And as soon as you depressed your pedal,    it moved? - A.
   That is right.

Q. And the next one was there? - A. Immediately they were
   actually thrown forward.  Rather than walk forward they
   were actually thrown forward.

0. Did they look hot and flushed and distressed to you? -
   A. During the last 25 minutes there was a number came
   through looking decidedly the worse for wear, sweaty
   and generally out of breath and really particularly
   aggressive at that stage really, I think due to the
   circumstances more than anything else.   Obviously they
   wanted to get in, they had been outside for a while and
   people were pushing and obviously getting crushed.

Q. As a matter of interest did you have people at that
   stage who either had wrong tickets or no tickets at
   all? - A. Yes, in the last 25 minutes there were a
   number of people that had not got tickets and/or had
   not got the right ticket, but obviously there was no
   alternative but to let them through.
                                                                    84


                                           N.   K.   J.   LAYCOCK




Q. Just an estimate, this is not an engineering drawing,
   how many would you say fell into that category? - A. It
   would be difficult to say.  I didn't count toy tickets
   like the gentleman before did but in the last 25
   minutes it was impossible to even take the ticket off
   the person as they ran in.  It was a question of
   grabbing the ticket, and in the last 25 minutes it was
   purely a continual flow of people, there was not a
   break at any stage, it was just an enormous queue.

Q. Would you agree with him that it would have been
   impossible for you to send somebody back out? - A. It
   was out of the question.

Q. Anything else that you want to mention about those last
   25 minutes? - A. Mothing particularly about the last 25
   minutes, no, nothing really.

Q. You had done it for two or three years before and you
   had been there in 1988? - A. That is right.   I had
   never experienced anything like that.   I have been to
   big matches before and taken a lot of tickets, but when
   there were people screaming outside, saying "You have
   got to let us in", there was no option but just to let
   them follow through because it was quite obvious that
   there was a problem at that stage.

Q. You could hear that? - A. Oh yes, they were screaming
   outside.

Q. Are you then saying that in your mind's eye, comparing
   '88 with '89, there was a marked difference? - A. Yes,
   definitely.

Q. What was the difference? - A. I felt the difference was
   on the '89 people as they came to the stile, initially
   before the last half hour, were being searched outside,
   directly outside my gate, whereas in the year
   previously we have discussed it, and if I remember
   rightly they were above, they were not actually not
   outside my gate, they weren't allowed in the actual
   compound of the Leppings Lane, so they were actually on
   the road if you like and being searched there, and
   purely the numbers weren't the same.    Obviously they
   tried to search   everybody, the two Policemen outside,
   but in the last   25 minutes I don't know where they went
   to.  The crush was that great that I don't know where
   they went to.

Q. Was the flow any different in '88 as compared with '89?
   - A. Yes, you are always used to having a few people
   hustling outside your turnstile to get in first, but
   not a pure mass   of people. It was quite obvious
   because all I needed to do was put my foot on the
                                                                 85

                                        H.   K.   J.   LAYCOCK




turnstile and as I say it was thrown open, rather than
them having to push it, so that it was the pressure
outside that was pushing against it.

Can I take you back to this business of the searching.
Are you saying that as far as you remember the
searching in  88 was done outside the perimeter gates?
- A. It was done just as you come through the gates on
the Leppings Lane, so they had the area frora there to
walk to the turnstile to get to us.   Obviously that is
where they were searching, and it seemed to me that at
that stage they could stop thera from coming into that
compound at that stage, where I was, and on '89 the
men, obviously they were searching them as they came
in, but when a lot of people come towards them they
could not do anything.

So your recollection was in '89 the Officers were
closer to the turnstile entrances? - A. That is right,
yes.

Than they had been in *88? - A. Yes,   I think that.

But they were still within the area bounded by the
perimeter gates and the turnstiles? - A. That is right.

            Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS

Mr. Laycock, I would be grateful if you could try to
estimate the numbers coming in without tickets.  I
appreciate what you are saying, you are saying, "It was
such a flow some people didn't even give me the tickets
that they had"? - A. That is right, yes.

As an experienced turnstile operator, as you were at
that time, you would be able to form some opinion,
estimate, of those who just did not have tickets? - A.
I would say the people who did not have any tickets,
there was probably - there was the small number that
had no tickets whatsoever, I would say that was
probably only in the region of 30, probably.

About 30? - A. About 30.

Nobody is going to hold you to 5 or 10 either way. - A.
No, but obviously there was quite a number of people
that came in with the Leppings Lane tickets, but
obviously I was the North Stand so I let them through,
because obviously I had no choice, but it wasn't for
the right part of the ground.  They had obviously
walked there and it was the North Stand on the left and
Leppings Lane on the right and they had gone the wrong
way.  Obviously had they got to my turnstile I would
let them through on that ticket.
                                                                         86

                                                N.   K.   J.   LAYCOCK




Q. Or they wanted to go to that particular area? - A. Yes,
   obviously if they felt they wanted a seat they were
   going to try to get through there, yes, I suppose.  In
   the last 25 minutes it was in the hundreds, I would
   say.  I wouldn't like to guess because it really was a
   mass.

Q. I am not concerned with the actual numbers coming
   through, but the numbers coming through without a
   ticket.  Were you offered money? - A. Oh yes.

0. And whilst I asi sure you did not take it, you could not
   stop the people going through? - A. Initially when they
   first came, obviously we said, "You can't pay, you go
   somewhere else".   When they came through at the time,
   there was no choice, I was letting everybody through
   anyway.

Q. Could you help then with the number of people who
   offered you money to come through? - A. Again I would
   say probably about 10 or 15.  There was quite a few.

Q. So some of those who you estimate, about 30, did not
   even offer you money, they just took the opportunity to
   get through? - A. I had people jump over the stile as
   well, just physically jumped over it, climbed up and
   over.

Q. Thank you very much.

                   Cross-Examined by HR. KING

Q. Anybody going to the North Stand with a wrong North
   Stand ticket, would be seeking to sit in a seat for
   which someone else had a ticket? - A. Yes.

Q. You would not know what the position was on the North
   Stand.  Perhaps we  will hear later as to people
   checking people as   they got to the North Stand. Can
   you help us on that? - A. Ho.

Q. We can ask someone else about that.  The picture I do
   get though is that you regarded the numbers actually
   going through your turnstile without any ticket at all
   was relatively small? - A. Yes, I would say that.

Q.        THE CORONER: Thank you very        much, and all      the
     best to you too in    your studies.   - A. Thank you.

          THE CORONER:   Ladies and gentlemen, I think we
     are going to look at the video now.  We have done much
     better today, timewise.  I will tell you what we have
     got planned for tomorrow because some of the legal

tell you whom w e have in mind for tomorrow? It is Mr.
Milton and Mr. Coupland - they are two more turnstile
operators - and then we are back on Police Officers -

     Ladies and gentlemen, would you just leave us for
two minutes?  I think that is all I need. I just want
to say something to the legal representatives and then
we will look at the video.

            (In the absence of the J u r y )

     THE CORONER:   I wanted to say something about the
witness whom we had this morning, Hr. Lackey, because I
don't want any misunderstandings about him.   He
actually attended because I subpoenaed hi m but that is
a little bit unfair because he was invited, as indeed
all my witnesses are, to come, 10 or 12 days ago, and
in fact he was here because I saw him, he was sitting
in Court, and some of you will remember I actually
addressed him, but we did not get to him.

     Having sat through a whole day waiting to give
evidence he then went back to Liverpool and could not
face it, to come back the next morning when I wanted
him to be here, and in fact he was, I think, so tense
that in the end --- I felt I had to, I wanted him here
for various reasons, so in the end I did decide to
wield the big stick and subpoena him but in a sense it
was not his fault because he did come voluntarily the
first time, and it was just too much, because of course
it is very difficult for some of the witnesses as well,
but I wanted to just explain that to you because I did
not want you to think he was a man who had to be
drummed in.  That was not how it began, that is all.




        MR. KING:   Sir, a matter which was         ....
                                                       88




     MR. KING: Sir, a matter which was concerning some of
the families about Mr. Lackey after he had given his
evidence, and it is a matter which I had no knowledge of
and thought it was not proper for me to investigate with
him because I know we are getting a large number of
witnesses from the terraces, the families did understand
and I did not, that he himself was injured.  I do not know
whether that is the case.  I do not know whether his
statement indicated that.

     THE CORONER:   I do not think his injuries were very
severe.  I am not saying he was not hurt but I do not think
his injuries were severe. He was certainly very upset
after we finished. Perhaps I should have mentioned that to
him but I am afraid that it slipped my mind.

     MR. KING: Sir, if he was hurt and if one could find
out perhaps whether he was hurt or not we might be able to
introduce that by agreement into the evidence because
otherwise it is a matter which perhaps I did not deal with.
I did not have his statement, sir, and I did not wish to go
into matters that....

     THE CORONER:   It may be that there is a reference to
it but the injury I did not think was that severe except
the psychological injury. He said, "Throughout it all I
got slightly injured.  I had bruising to my ribs, chest,
plus under my arms and the backs of my legs were bruised
too. I went to hospital at Walton the next morning."

     MR. KING: As you know, sir, a large number of those
who were on the terraces were not particularly physically
injured but were genuinely psychologically injured in a
real sense and still are today, in a way recognised by law
as injury. As I say, sir, I did not investigate it with
him because I had no statement and it would have been a
pure fishing exercise on my part.  If there are witnesses
who come forward from the terraces who have been injured, I
would be grateful - not necessarily if you wish to ask
about it - if I could have some information to that extent.
It does give a different picture to them as a witness
because they may still be suffering from those effects when
in the witness box.

     THE CORONER:   I see what you mean.  In addition to
that he says he was stressed and so far as I know he still
is.

     MR. KING: Certainly I am one of them but there are a
number of Counsel involved with those who are seeking
damages for personal injury, and part of that personal
injury, sometimes the sole part of the personal injury, is
the psychological injury of a psychiatric illness from
which they are suffering.

     THE CORONER:   I accept what you say but I did not
have the impression that this particular witness was in
such a statement that his evidence could not be heard or
accepted.  That is not to say he may or may not have a
claim in law because that is obviously outside my area.

     MR. KING: It is very difficult for someone like
myself to ask of a witness, "Are you suffering from a
psychiatric illness?" but if in fact, sir, you have
information which leads one to believe that to be the case
then really that would affect the whole content of his
evidence, not only the way he gives it but the way one
should view it.

     MR. MANNING: We can continue this much further and I
think there are balances here which are very difficult for
you as the person who has to make that kind of decision.   I
know from the instructions that I have received that
several Police Officers who gave evidence last week have
suffered great psychological problems as a result of what
happened on that day. We have not to let the Jury into an
emotional situation where because someone has suffered,
whether directly physically or in a psychological way, that
it is appearing to taint the evidence or take a different
view of it.

     So far as Mr. Lackey is concerned obviously one has
sympathy.  I certainly associate myself with the words of
my learned friend, Mr. Payne, but at the end of the day he
was one of the people who did not have a ticket and ought
not to have gone into the ground. One did not want to
labour that point because you are here to discuss how.   It
is obviously taken by the Jury that he was a person without
a ticket and he had no legal right to have gone in.
Whatever followed, one is very sorry about it but one has
to try and keep it out of the emotional ring or else it
really becomes a how enquiry which is being varied or
changed from the factual basis that you want to achieve.

     THE CORONER:   I take your point, Mr. King, and to a
slightly lesser extent your point, Mr. Manning.  I do not
think I would want to get into a situation where we vet
each witness as to their psychological status. There have
been several whom I have noticed, and I can instance a few
to you now, where in my view people have not remembered
events which I would have expected them to do. They have
either not remembered them because they do not want to,
because they have genuinely forgotten or because there is
some psychological reason why that particular bit cannot be
recalled by them. Within reason clearly when I direct them
I am going to try and remind them of the fact that people,
apart from the stress of coming anyway, are reliving
events.

     That goes for Police Officers as well. A Police
Officer is a human being just as every other witness is but
I would not want to get into the situation where we
investigate the psychological or psychiatric status of each
person. There was one witness who did suffer slightly more
severe injuries.  I cannot remember who it was.  I think it
was Mr. Murray who fractured two ribs so far as I remember.
I did mention that partly because it was a more severe
injury and mainly because he was the father of one of the
deceased.  I take your point, Mr. King, and I will
certainly bear it in mind.

      MR. KING:  While the Jury are out, I wonder if I may
raise an allied matter which concerns me? I do not wish to
invite witnesses to relive so much detail of events as to
cause not only them distress but clearly everyone listening
here.

     THE CORONER:   I know.

      MR. KING: One of the matters I feel about treading
too gently, and I was deliberately treading gently with
that witness because I knew there were lots more to come,
is that we would get a false picture. One tends, with a
desire not to cause harm in the way I have described,
almost to gloss over what are often crucial events in this
saga.    For example, it was almost casually put to him - and
I do not mean this with disrespect, sir - that he was in
fear for his life. I do not mean that disrespectfully
because that was a proper way of doing it because otherwise
you do get the detail.    I would invite you, sir, at some
stage to consider leading the witness as appropriately
rather than leave it to the advocates in order that as much
of the full flavour of what was happening emerges for the
Jury's needs so that that picture emerges without leaving
it to, for example, someone in my position who does not
know what is going to emerge and causing greater harm than
I would want to have.

      I am being instructed, of course, as you know, sir,
and a picture is emerging which perhaps is not so far in
sufficient detail as to what was happening to those in the
crushing which those behind might wish in one sense to
know.   I am conscious of the other duty not to cause the
harm I describe and that I do find a difficult balance,
sir.

     THE CORONER:   Are you talking about the crushing on
the terraces at the moment?

    MR. KING:   Yes, sir.

     THE CORONER:   You have got to remember, if you like,
my schemer in so far as I have one left. In a sense we are
still technically outside. We have not got in yet. We
have gone in on occasions because you have got to follow it
through but as I think I said in reply to Mr. Payne earlier
this morning as to whether any more were coming from the
terraces, there will be dozens I think.  I do not know
exactly how many because I do intend to review my position
on this and if I feel that we have heard enough then I may
curtail it in places. We have not got, if you like, on to
the terraces yet and so there is I am afraid going to be a
lot more painful evidence yet to come.

     It is a difficult balance because, on the one hand, we
want to get the truth out which is what happened. On the
other hand, we all know that 95 people died and that is
sufficient horror. We do not need to have the Jury in
tears over every witness because they know it, I know it,
and you know it. I am, of course, very conscious that
there are families here. I am not blind and I noticed that
when Mr. Lackey was speaking, he did not say much, there
was at least one member of the families exceedingly
distressed and I could see it. You cannot because you are
looking at me. So it is a delicate balance.   I am
determined to try and get enough evidence for this Jury,
who seem to be anxious to listen, to have something to bite
on but, on the other hand, we do not want to go beyond what
is absolutely necessary from the distress point of view,
for them and everybody else.

     MR. KING: Sir, I am grateful for that indication.    In
many ways I am raising it not only, sir, that you can hear
it but those behind me can hear it because I know it is a
matter of concern to them. They will be grateful to hear
what I knew already I think in advance that you have a
scheme, sir, and that really the witnesses so far have been
called for a different purpose. Of course, it is when they
continue on to the terraces that we hear that evidence.

     THE CORONER:   If we have Police Officers who were
only outside like the mounted Officers, of course, they are
not going to say a word about what happened inside.  In
that sense if you only listen to that tiny bit you will
see. One has to wait until one has heard it all before one
can actually make a judgment as to what we have heard.

     MR. KING:   I think you understand the point I have
been trying to make.

     THE CORONER:   I do understand the point you are
trying to make and you clients will feel reassured when
they know I do have plans to have quite a lot of supporters
coming along.  It may well be that the supporters will not
take as long as the Police Officers.  I think that is very
                                                          92




likely, not because we are going to cut them short, but
because they are talking about a relatively speaking
smaller segment. We will see.
     MR. CATCHPOLE:   I rise on a slightly different matter.

      THE CORONER:  Actually, let me get the Jury back and
send them home because we are not going to look at the
video. We have taken longer than we thought. Could we
just have the Jury back and I can let them go home and then
we will go home a little earlier as well.  I had said that
if we had finished with the witnesses before quarter past
three we would have the video but I had not anticipated
this.
     MR. CATCHPOLE:    The matter I am raising will not take
thirty seconds.
     THE CORONER:     That is all right but let me get rid of
the Jury first.
               (The Jury returned into Court)

     THE CORONER:   Ladies and gentlemen, I have news for
you. My two minutes have taken longer than we thought.    If
we started the video you would be here until half past four
and so we are not going to start it. I have just brought
you in to say good night and see you in the morning at ten
o'clock. We will do the video another time.

                (in the absence of the Jury)

     MR. CATCHPOLE: Sir, I rise as a matter of courtesy to
you. I am sure what I am about to say will be obvious not
only to you but to everyone here.  In representing the Club
not only do I represent the Officers but also the turnstile
operators, the stewards and everyone employed by the Club.
Unfortunately there is one notable exception with whom the
Club have an obvious conflict and it seems may well be
called as a witness tomorrow.  I would just say that in the
event that any warnings that have to be given to one of the
turnstile operators then I certainly will not be jumping up
and down and treating him as my witness.  It is really a
gentle reminder in that direction, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much indeed. As you
know, some of the witnesses there may be problems which are
not really relevant to the Inquest but which technically
may put them in jeopardy. My intention is to either warn
them or to tell them that if it is unnecessary they do not
need to tell me about X if X is not something actually I
need to know anything about because I think it is wrong to
use my Court to make people make admissions which have
nothing to do with the how people came by their deaths.  Is
                                                       93




there anything else anybody wishes to say? We will all
rise a little bit early. We will meet tomorrow at ten
o 'clock.
       (The Inquests were adjourned until 10 o'clock
                   the following morning)

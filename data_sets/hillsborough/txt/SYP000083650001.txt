             Some       of the      fans were          drunk.      I went       thro ug h the     tunnel        and

             still many            fans    in the       stand and        I saw numerous          bodies     layed

             on the       floor.          I tried to        calm      people     down who were        coming

             up to me and            shouting.           1 then went           to the    front    of the

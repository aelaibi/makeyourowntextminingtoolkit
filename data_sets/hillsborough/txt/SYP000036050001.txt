Dear Sir

I have enclosed a copy of the letter I have sent to the Sheffield Star,
regarding the Hillsborough football disaster.

I thought you should be aware of what we saw and how we feel.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Editor

We read the attached letter in the Sun Newspaper on Saturday 22nd April,
and to the people in our vicinity it says it all.

Fans were still passing the end of our road along Penistone Road at 2.45pm,
so obviously they would be rushing as they got closer to the ground for the
kick off.

Like the lady said in her letter the blame cannot be put down to one man
alone, with all the people arriving late and causing crushing outside the
ground, Police were forced to make the decision they made for fear of deaths
and injuries outside.

Even after the disaster a couple of gangs of fans came running up Broughton
Road, they were-shouting—and-fighting, one lad was knocked to the ground
and continuosly kicked by the people running past him, as if they had'nt
seen enough. Then they all carried on running into Hillsborough Park where
apparently other fans were already fighting and the Police were on horse
back trying to get them under control.

Our hearts go out to all the families and friends of the victims who died
so tragically at Hillsborough, as they were the innocent ones who got
themselves to the match early to be able to see a good game. Many of us
in the area helped as much as we could by giving sympathy and cups of tea
and the use of our telephones, but we are sickened by the hooligans still
running free to create more havoc at other football matches, when so many
good and innocent people have died.

Yours sincerely,

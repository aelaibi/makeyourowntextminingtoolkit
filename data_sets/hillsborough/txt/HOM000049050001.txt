 1                                           Wednesday, 8th October, 1997
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Would you like to say anything more
 3        to me than what you said in your letter or can I ask you
 4        some questions about what you say in your letter?
 5   MRS. STRINGER:    Yes, you can ask me some questions.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I take it that what you say in your
 7        letter is really the gist of what you want to say to me?
 8        Perhaps we can expand on one or two points.
 9   MRS. STRINGER:    With not having much time they are the main
10        points.     There is a lot I would like to say.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I have a previous letter from you
12        as well, I suspect you have said much the same things in
13        both, have you not?
14   MRS. STRINGER:     It was a personal letter I wrote to you myself,
15        there was no points in it.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Have you got a copy of this letter,
17        this latest letter?
18   MRS. STRINGER:     Yes.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Could we just make one or two
20        points.     In the first paragraph you say, "In thesmeeting
21        with the families you", that is me, "made it perfectly
22        clear that only the strongest evidence would cause you to
23        interfere with the findings of the Divisional Court."        I
24        am not sure that I said the strongest evidence.       What I am
25        looking for is fresh evidence which would affect the
26        conclusions of the Divisional Court.        It is not quite the
27        same thing but I just wanted to clarify that.
28   MRS. STRINGER:     But the thing is, sir, nothing really is new,
29        all the evidence was there it was just it's never been
30        used, it's been withheld.        So you're asking for new
31        evidence, we don't know what new evidence is.        This is all
32        new to us because it's all been withheld.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I tried to explain that it was
34        evidence which has not been presented to either Lord
35        Taylor's Inquiry or to the inquest.
36   MRS. STRINGER:     Even what was presented to Lord Taylor I'd


                                       2
 1        object to that as well because it was not presented to the
2         inquest.     I have got no things with Lord Justice Taylor's
 3        Inquiry but I have got a lot of things about the inquest.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Do you mean complaints about it?
 5   MRS. STRINGER:    Objections about the inquest.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Mr. Frazer was representing some of
 7        the relatives at the inquest, only 22.
 8   MRS. STRINGER:     I didn't know he was representing me but
 9        apparently he was.     I was represented by Kevin Julie and I
10        only found out a long time later that I was actually
11        represented by the Steering Group, I was never informed
12        that my solicitor was part of the Steering Group.        In fact
13        I sacked Kevin Julie after 7 months.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You were a member of the family
15        group?
16   MS   ADLINGTON:     The Hillsborough Family Support Group.
17   MRS. STRINGER:     Yes, I was, yes.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        There were a number of solicitors
19        involved in that including your solicitor.
20   MRS. STRINGER:     I didn't know at the time.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        What was the name of your
22        solicitor?
23   MRS. STRINGER:     Kevin Julie.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        What was the name of his firm?
25   MRS. STRINGER:     Kevin Julie and Co.     When I went to him after
26        several months and asked him to take a complaint out
27        against Peter Wright he said he couldn't because their
28        firm represented Peter Wright.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Is it right, that your solicitor
30        was in fact part of the Steering Group and the Steering
31        Group appointed Mr. Frazer to look after the interests of
32        the family?
33   MRS. STRINGER:     Yes.
34   MS   ADLINGTON:     He was appointed a spokesperson for the
35         Steering Group.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        But he was also the solicitor who


                                           3
 1        represented the families at the mini-inquest, was he not?
 2   MRS. STRINGER:    Yes.
 3   MS   ADLINGTON:    On behalf of the Steering committee of
 4        solicitors, yes.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can I just deal with this business
 6        about the police officers coming to you on the eve of the
 7        mini-inquest.
 8   MRS. STRINGER:    Yes, 2nd May, yes.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     They wanted, for some reason or
10        other, the ticket stub?
11   MRS. STRINGER:    Yes.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Because the other part of the
13        ticket would have been taken as he went through the
14        turnstile, is that right?
15   MRS. STRINGER:    Yes.   Well, they kept telling me there was no
16        tickets but when I got Paul's clothing back I asked for
17        Paul's belongings as well, I knew he'd have his tickets
18        with him, bus tickets, train tickets, because he would not
19        release these at any time and I kept insisting to Mike
20        Layton and              Ifor Paul's tickets and they said,
21        "There is no ticket", and then when they brought the video
22        evidence to show my two daughters this day I asked Mike
23        Layton myself about the tickets and he said, "Just wait
24        until I go in the car and look through Paul's body file."
25        He went out to the car and came back and he said, "There
26        is a ticket", and then I was produced Paul's stub ticket,
27        I've actually got the ticket.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You have got the stub ticket, have
29        you?
30   MRS. STRINGER:    No, I haven't got the stub ticket, I did have
31        with his bus ticket and train ticket, I've got all them
32        and then on 2nd May |             [and, I can't remember the
33        other police officer who was with him, he came and asked
34        me for Paul's stub ticket and I said, "What for?", and he
35        said, "Because we've given you the wrong ticket", I said,
36         "You haven't given me the wrong ticket, that was with


                                       4
 1        Paul's belongings, his train tickets, bus tickets", and
2         there was —    in fact, sir, I'll be honest, I got a bit
 3        frightened because I've never had any involvement with the
 4        police and I started getting frightened.
 5                           said to the other police officer, "We've
 6        got to get this ticket, we can't go back to the office
 7        without this ticket", but I didn't know what was
 8        happening, I'll be quite honest with you.      I said, "I
 9        can't give you this ticket, I've waited that long for this
10        ticket", I just wanted it because it was Paul's ticket.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You did not want to hand it over
12        because it was a memorial of him?
13   MRS. STRINGER:     Of paul with his bus ticket and they said, "We
14        need the ticket", so I said, "Well, can you give me a
15        receipt for it so that if you lose it"--
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:.    Did they give you a receipt?
17   MRS. STRINGER:     Yes, I've got the receipt.   So they said,
18        "Here's the full ticket", I said, “Well, what are you
19        giving me that for?", so they said, "We made a mistake, we
20        gave you the wrong ticket,, it should have been a full
21        ticket we gave you."     I just couldn't understand it.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I see.
23   MRS. STRINGER:     Until I realised what they were doing.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You think this was because they
25        thought or were seeking to make out that he had gone
26        through Gate C .
27   MRS. STRINGER:     Because there is a photograph of Paul outside
28        timed at 14.54 hours, it is Paul on the photograph, taken
29        by a police photographer, I have got the photograph.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Have you had the body file in this
31        case?
32   MRS. STRINGER:     I have been requesting things for years, I've
33        got the letters, I don't know what I've had.      I've never
34        had a full body file.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Do you know, Miss Adlington?
36   MS   ADLINGTON:     It is another one of those instances, sir,


                                       5
 1        families who have requested information over the years and
2         have built up a file are now being told, with the material
 3       that has been supplied recently, that constitutes a
 4        complete file.     We only have South Yorkshire polices' word
 5        on that matter.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Again this is something which I
 7        hope you will sort out for them because, as I say, I can
 8        check the body files and if there are documents on them
 9        which have not been in your files    then we will see if we
10        can get copies of them.     I cannot do anything about it
11        until I know the various things that people have had.       So
12        you will put that in train, will you, for all the people
13        that you are representing?
14   MS. ADLINGTON:   Yes.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am not clear quite what the
16        problem here is.     It does not matter, does it, whether he
17        went through Gate C or not?
18   MRS. STRINGER:   It does to me because at the inquest that is
19        all the Coroner kept saying, that the people that went
20        through Gate —     it was assumed and people were accused if
21        they went through Gate C they were to late-comers, drunk.
22        My son wasn't a late-comer, my son was outside the ground
23        at half past one trying to change his ticket, he had been
24        round some of the public houses because he wanted to go
25        into the stands, because of the year before he was
26        frightened and he wanted to go up into the stands.        But my
27        son was not a late-comer.
28              My son couldn't have been outside at 2.54 because
29        I've got another photograph to say he's inside the pen.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I thought you told me a moment ago
31        that video taken outside at 14.54 undoubtedly showed Paul
32        there.
33   MRS. STRINGER:   It does but there was also a another photograph
34        showing Paul inside before that time.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     He is not likely go out again, is
36        he?


                                        6
 1   MS   ADLINGTON:    Sir, what I think it may be, I think on day
2         one of the mini-inquest Inspector Layton makes it clear
 3        that some of the photographers who were present outside
4         the ground you couldn't rely on those times because they
 5        were individually set.
 6   MISS STRINGER:    What they wanted to put forward was that Paul
 7        was outside and confuse the jury as to there was Paul
 8        outside, he can't be inside as well.     That was what they
 9        wanted to do, say that Paul was outside, he was one of the
10        late arriving fans.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not think anyone is really
12        criticising the people who went through Gate C.
13   MISS STRINGER:    There has been a lot of criticism over the
14        years.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am certainly not criticising.
16   MRS. STRINGER:    Besides that, sir, it was made that all the
17        fans came late and caused what happened outside and those
18        that were outside late caused the crush inside.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I mean I did try to explain the
20        position so far ast I am concerned on Monday in.my opening
21        remarks.     The position is that at Lord Taylor's Inquiry
22        there was a very controversial issue between the police on
23        the one hand and the supporters on the other as to why the
24        police lost control of the crowd outside Leppings Lane,
25        outside the turnstiles.     That was resolved by Lord Taylor
26        in favour of the supporters, by and large.     He said that
27        the principal cause of the loss of control was poor
28        policing.
29                I would like you to understand, because it seems that
30        not everybody does understand, what my position is on
31        this.     I have had no new evidence in relation to anything
32        which happened outside the ground at any time, other than
33        possibly about people being taken to hospital afterwards.
34        So I can see no reason to review Lord Taylor's conclusion
35        about that.     Nobody has suggested that I should.   I have
36        not got any evidence which suggests that I should review


                                       7
 1         that conclusion.
2               So, so far as I am concerned I accept Lord Taylor's
 3         conclusion about that, I am not going to try and re-open
 4         that.
 5              If of course there had to be a whole new inquest then
 6         all those issues would no doubt be re-opened but so far as
 7         I am concerned they are closed.    This is why it is rather
 8         ironic so far as I am concerned that people suggesting
 9         that I have made up my mind against the Liverpool
10         supporters on this issue, in fact actually the opposite is
11         the case.     I have made up my mind insofar as I have that
12         that decision of Lord Taylor's should not be interfered
13         with.
14                 So I do not think, if I may say so, you need trouble
15         too much about any criticism of him coming late.      It does
16         not matter.
17   MRS. STRINGER:      It's suspicious when I have got a photograph
18         from outside timed by a police photographer and yet Paul
19         is inside the ground on the another photograph.      Then they
20         came for the stub ticket and gave me a full ticket.      It
21         makes me very suspicious apart from a lot of other things.
22
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It must be faulty timing on one or
24         other of the cameras.
25   MS.   ADLINGTON:     Sir, the one inside the ground 14.47 is
26         actually from the BBC video.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I thought that this one outside the
28         ground was from the BBC?
29   MRS. STRINGER:      No, a police photographer took that one.
30   MS.   ADLINGTON:     There's no BBC footage so far as I am aware
31         but there were actually some police photographers.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      There were certainly BBC
33         photographers outside the ground.
34   MRS. STRINGER:      No, I've got a letter off Mr. Greenway, the
35         photograph taken outside--
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Have you got a copy of this


                                        8
1          photograph?
2    MRS. STRINGER:      Yes.   That1s my son there.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       This is MWL10/J/33A, is it?     You
4          are sure that is him, are you?
 5   MRS. STRINGER:      Oh yes, it's been identified by several people,
 6         his friends and my daughters.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I do not know what the     provenance
 8         of this photograph is, do you?
 9   MR.   BONE:   The timing is said to be 14.54.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Where does thiscome from?
11   MR.   BONE:   It has come from the police,        of course there is no
12         timing on the photograph itself, is there?
13   MRS. STRINGER:      At the bottom.
14   MR.   BONE:   I am sorry, I did not see that.15th April 14.44.
15         I did. not see that at first.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Was there any suggestion that these
17         timings were wrong?
18   MRS. STRINGER: No.
19   MS. ADLINGTON:  Sir, of the photographs taken outside on day 1
20         of the mini-inquest there was a remark passed by Inspector
21         Leighton to the effect that he couldn't be sure of the
22         timings of photographs taken outside of the ground because
23         a lot of photographs were taken by individual
24         photographers.       Unlike the footage from inside the ground,
25         which is timed, because it was BBC footage in the main.
26   MR.   BONE:   I think we can say the BBC footage is very accurate
27         as to time.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        This undoubtedly after Gate C has
29         been opened, it is not?        This photograph?
30   MS.   ADLINGTON:     The time is.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        So is the photograph, there are
32         people about to go through Gate C.
33   MRS. STRINGER:      You can see the police there leading them to go
34         in, telling them to go in.          On the video you see the
35         police actually telling them to go through the gate.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Can you show me any other


                                           9
 1          photographs which you say shows him inside at an earlier
 2          stage?
 3   MRS. STRINGER:      Yes.     (Photographs shown)
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I do not think these timings are
 5          out as much as that.       This purports to be seven minutes
 6          earlier.
 7   MRS.    STRINGER:    I've got another one of him at    14.56 as well,
 8          after thatone.       I don't think two of them would be wrong.

10   MR.     BONE: This is taken from the BBC Match of the Day       video?
11   MRS.    STRINGER:    Yes.    It is, isn't it, Ann?
12   MS. ADLINGTON:      Yes.
13   MR.    BONE:     It looks like a T.V. videostill,does it not, with
14          the lines going across.
15   MRS. STRINGER:       This photograph was taken from a police still
16          video, is it.        This is at 14.56 and there1s my son again
17          in pen    3. This    is a police one.
18   MR.    BONE:     Is that the police one?
19   MRS. STRINGER: Yes,         because the letter   went toone of the
20          families with this photograph .that was given to another
21          family and saying it's off the police, the letter John's
22          got.     It is a still photograph.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Where did you get this from?
24   MRS. STRINGER:       Another member of the families was given this
25          by the South Yorkshire Police and I was just looking
26          thorough it and I seen Paul within the last couple of
27          weeks.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Would you mind if I put some arrows
29          on it?
30   MRS. .STRINGER:      No, it is a copy, I have got the original.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Can I keep this?
32   MRS. STRINGER:       Yes.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I am going to circle that, that is
34          the one, is it?
35   MRS. STRINGER:       Yes.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Can I keep these or not?


                                            10
 1   MRS. STRINGER:     Yes, they're copies.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     One thing is quite certain he
 3         cannot be in both places at the same time.
 4   MRS. STRINGER:     Can you understand now why--
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I can understand your concern.      I
 6         think one of the problems about identifying people in
 7         photographs, which I have come across in the Criminal
 8         Courts, is that you do not always get a very good
 9         likeness, particularly if it is a blown up photograph
10         depending on the angle which the photograph is taken and
11         so on.    It seems to me reasonably clear that those timings
12         cannot be as far as out as they look, so there must be a
13         mistake about one or other of them.        Which one do you feel
14         most confident about identification?
15   MRS. STRINGER:     That it's Paul?
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Yes.
17   MRS. STRINGER:     The three of them, the three of them are Paul.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     They cannot be.
19   MRS. STRINGER:     They can be Paul, it's the times that can't be,
20         but it's definitely my son.         It's the time I-d say is at
21         fault not the identification.
22   MR.   BONE:    According to times he is inside the pen at 14.49,
23         inside in the street at .14.54 and inside the pen again at
24         14.56.    One of the timings must be wrong.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I suppose it is conceivable.
26   MISS STRINGER:     I'd have more faith in these photographs simply
27         because Ian Glover is in the photographs, isn't he, and he
28         was with his brother Joe at the time in pen 3 when Paul
29         was there.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am sorry, I did not catch that.
31   MISS STRINGER:     I'd have more faith in these photographs of him
32         inside simply because Ian Glover and Joe Glover were in
33         the terraces at that time.
34   MR.   BONE:    Were they friends of Paul's?
35   MRS. STRINGER:     No.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am afraid this may have to remain


                                          11
1          a mystery.    I am not sure that I am going to be able to
2          solve it for you.
 3   MISS D. STRINGER:     This is the type of thing that we've have
4          had to deal with over the eight years.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It is very unfortunate but I can
 6         try and check these times and see.         We will have to try
 7         and find the provenance of these photographs.
 8   MR.   BONE:    This one especially.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     This is one of the ones which was
10         in that compilation bundle.         We have got these.   They have
11         always been accepted as part of the--
12   MS.   ADLINGTON:    Mrs. Stringer does have a letter from South
13         Yorkshire Police saying that was taken by a police
14         photographer outside the ground.
15   MRS. STRINGER:     I can fetch the letter.        I forgot about that.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     33.        That it is.   It actually shows
17         slightly more, it actually shows people going in through
18         the gate.    This is the same photograph and on your copy it
19         has got cut off a bit.     Do you see?       You can see the gate
20         there and you can actually see people going through it.
21         This is clearly after 14.52.          We know that gate opened at
22         14.52.    It is not possible to reconcile these photographs,
23         I am afraid.    We know, even if that is a minute or two
24         out, it must be after 14.52.
25   MRS. STRINGER:     How come?
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not know.
27   MRS. STRINGER:     If I had any doubt I would argue that my son
28         wasn't outside at that time but he is outside at the time
29         stated on there but he is also inside.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think it is a question of you
31         obviously -- is it your daughter?
32   MRS. STRINGER:      Yes, both daughters.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You think that the photographs
34         inside are more reliable, do you?
35   MISS STRINGER:      I know that's Paul outside but what I'm saying
36         is the fact that Ian and Joe are on there.           At that given


                                          12
 1         time Joe can actually tell us what time it was in the
 2         terrace.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I am afraid this will have to
 4         remain a mystery because it is quite obvious that he
 5         cannot be in both places at once.         It is quite obvious
 6         that this photograph of the outside is after 14.52, there
 7         is no question about that.
 8   MR.   BONE:   If I might, Sir Murray, the gate was open very
 9         briefly 2.48.      The police threw somebody out?
10   MRS. STRINGER:       Yes, it was.
11   MR.   BONE:   150 people got in before a mounted officer enabled
12         that to be closed again.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          This has always been accepted as
14         being the correct timing.
15   MR.   BONE:   Yes.
16   MRS. STRINGER:       I think that's been part of the trouble,
17         everything has been accepted.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          We have got the next one in the
19         series, 15.55.      That follows on from that one there.        You
20         can see people are absolutely streaming through?
21   MRS. STRINGER:       There1s my son there.      He's got his back to
22         the camera now.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Here we are, we have got the next
24         one, the next one in the series.         That follows on from
25         that one there and you can see people absolutely streaming
26         through.
27   MRS. STRINGER:       There is my son again.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Where?
29   MRS. STRINGER:       He's looking out, he's got back his back to the
30         camera now.      See, he is wondering, looking.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Can you see him again on that one.
32         This again is 14.55.      There is no doubt about this, the
33         gate is open, people are streaming through, this is not
34         the earlier occasion.
35   MRS. STRINGER:       You see this police officer asking him to go
36         in.


                                            13
1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You have got these photographs,
2          have you not?
3    MS    ADLINGTON:    No.
4    MRS. STRINGER:     No, we've got none of them, we haven't been
 5         able to get any photographs.      See what the West Midlands
 6         police done, now, when Paul was identified on that 2.54
 7         they didn't show you any more.      They didn't show you any
 8         more photographs.    That was Paul and that was it.      When we
 9         asked for them, I mean I've got bundles of letters there.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     These photographs were used at Lord
11         Taylor's Inquiry and at the inquest.
12   MRS. STRINGER:     We weren't shown anything at the inquest.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am afraid this is a mystery.
14   MRS   STRINGER:    Can you understand now what--
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I understand your concern about it.
16         I do not think I am going to be able to resolve it for
17         you.     I do not think the timings can be that wrong.
18   MR.   BONE:    This 14.49 photograph inside the pen comes from the
19         BBC, does it?
20   MRS. STRINGER:      Yes, it is from the BBC, I got these off other
21         families.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We will have to look at the body
23         file on this and see what it is, but I mean one can
24         understand the confusion one gets in a situation like
25         this.
26                 At the last paragraph on page 2 of your letter you
27         say, "The emergence of recent photographic evidence
28         disturbs me even further.     Despite Popper's statement on
29         day one of the mini-inquest that there was one casualty
30         point at the Leppings Lane end of the crowd it now seems
31         that there was another unofficial casualty point where
32         bodies looked to have been simply dropped in a heap.        This
33         was a slip-road down by the River Don, little wonder
34         ambulances could not find them.      This was in addition to
35         the ambulances that were prevented from getting onto the
36         pitch by the police."     What are you referring to?


                                        14
1    MRS. STRINGER:     This photograph.
2    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     These are ambulances here, are they
3          not?
4    MRS. STRINGER:     Yes, that's one ambulance.
5    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Where is that taken?
 6   MRS. STRINGER:     Back of Leppings Lane.   That's where Paul left
 7         for 80 minutes.
 8   MS    ADLINGTON:    Near the concourse area near to the tunnel.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Is that Gate C?
10   MISS STRINGER:     That's Gate C.
11   MR.  BONE: From the inside? Yes.
12   MISS STRINGER: Apparently when the bodies were taken through
13         they were put on the floor.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     We have always known that there was
15         an ambulance collecting point at that end.      The ambulances
16         were coming in at the Leppings Lane end into that south
17         road and they were picking up people from there.       That .is
18         what these photographs are of, is it not?       Have we got the
19         plan?    What these photographs are of, I think, is just
20         this area here.    Do you want to come and see, Miss
21         Adlington?    That photograph is looking like that or more
22         like that, there is Gate C there and looking across there
23         and this is looking the other way, it is looking that way
24         and the ambulances were coming in here and they were
25         collecting people from there.
26                 There were actually three places where ambulances
27         were collecting, the main place was here, the gymnasium,
28         they came in here and then came out here.       There were also
29         some being collected from somewhere here, the fire brigade
30         were taking people out this way and the people who were
31         taken out through the tunnel were taken through here and
32         those who were taken to hospital were put onto ambulances
33         there.     Those who were not were sadly left and then taken
34         at a later stage I imagine to the mortuary.
35   MISS STRINGER:      Paul was left for 80 minutes without attention
36         and then he was certified dead by a Dr. Monaghan at 4.35


                                           15
 1          and we're told Paul was the first person taken off the
2           terrace at 3.15.
 3   MRS.   STRINGER:    It was not 3.15.
 4   MISS STRINGER:      I'm saying that's what we were told by the West
 5          Midlands police, Paul was taken     off the terrace at 3.15,
 6          yet in the   terrace he was still   standing up and he was
 7          alive at eight minutes past three.
 8   MRS. STRINGER:      He was resuscitated at sixteen minutes past
 9          three by a male nurse which the police took the male nurse
10          .off my son and told him it was time for him to get out and
11          had fans carrying —    instead of putting —    the first
12          ambulance was right by pen 4 at the time.      Instead of my
13          son being put into that ambulance the fans were ordered to
14          carry him back out through the tunnel and left on the
15          floor.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Where did you get this from?
17   MISS STRINGER:      Michael Hollinhurst, the psychiatric nurse who
18          dealt with Paul.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Have we got a statement from him?
20   MRS. STRINGER:      It should be in the body file, it's .took me
21          years to get it.
22   MISS STRINGER:      Mr. Hollinhurst - when he first became aware of
23          Paul it was not that he found Paul on the floor, Paul was
24          alive, when Mike Hollinhurst first got to him because he
25          felt Paul climbing up his legs, he wasn't unconscious like
26          we were told at the mini-inquest.     Paul was actually
27           climbing up his legs, he was quite strong and this was
28           after eight minutes past three because we've seen him on a
29          photograph at eight minutes past three.       He was getting
30           himself up so he .was strong enough to actually do that and
31           the police tell us that within 7 minutes Paul was crushed
32           on the floor, resuscitated and carried back through a full
33           terrace and he was dead and I simply won't accept that
34           because Paul was so strong.
35   MRS. STRINGER:      The Coroner did not present this before the
36           jury, he did not make the jury aware that Paul was alive,


                                        16
 1        climbing up this chap's legs and the chap had hold of his
2         hand, lost his hand, then he had his hair.    What the
 3        Coroner produced at the inquest was that when a space was
 4        created 15 minutes later Hollinhurst became aware of Paul
 5        on the floor.   That was not true.   That was not true to be
 6        said at inquest when Dr. Popper had that statement in
 7        front of him what was given--
 8   MS   ADLINGTON:   Sir, that statement only came to the families
 9        attention towards the end of —   during the judicial review
10        proceedings actually in November 1993.     Hollinhurst's
11        first statement is referring to Paul actually climbing up
12        his legs only came to the family's attention during the
13        judicial review proceedings in November 1993, it was never
14        referred to at the inquest.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I can look at what was said at the
16        inquest and I can look at the body file.
17   MISS STRINGER:    Can I also add, sir, that at the resumed
18        inquest when Michael Hollinhurst gave evidence it was
19        during lunch, I was walking up the corridor and the social
20        worker who was dealing with the both myself and Mr.
21        Hollinhurst come out of the Coroner's office and she
22        actually told me the Coroner gave us a room downstairs for
23        something that she had to tell me.    As far as we were
24        concerned we knew everything about that Paul; that he was
25        found dead on this terrace and as the court resumed and
26        Mr. Hollinhurst gave evidence I was taken to a room
27        downstairs at the Coroner's consent and was told that Paul
28        was actually alive and was told then that he was climbing
29        up Michael Hollinhurst's legs.    So that was the first time
30        I'd heard that, not in the court, but in a room in
31        Sheffield, underneath the courtroom while Michael
32        Hollinhurst was giving evidence, I was not even in that
33        court when he gave evidence.
34   MRS. STRINGER:    The social worker wanted to make us aware of
35        what happened before we got into the court but she needn't
36        have bothered because it was never heard at the inquest.


                                      17
 1        The Coroner made sure that that evidence never came out
2        before the jury.       If you look at the transcripts every
 3        time Mr. Hollinhurst tries to talk the Coroner interferes,
 4        he butts in every time if you look at the transcript.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I will look at that.   Is there
 6        anything else in particular because we are really running
 7        out of time now.      I have got more people to see
 8        afterwards.
 9   MRS. STRINGER:  I just wanted to ask, you know Hillsborough
10        itself on the day was it treated as a crime scene?         Have
11        you got any knowledge of this?
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not quite know what you mean.
13   MRS. STRINGER:    Every time I have requested anything they said
14        all Paul's    files are with the West Midlands police crime
15        file and I    said, "My son has never committed a crime in
16        his life.     Why is myson's file...", they said, "Because
17        Hillsborough was treated as a crime scene all the files
18        are kept at the scene of crimes department."       But my son
19        never committed a crime.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not think anyone-—
21   MRS. STRINGER:     I wasjust wondering, I    can't get no answer.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      If that is so it would be because
23        there was a potential investigation of crimes committed by
24        other people.       I mean, as you know, the question of
25        prosecution of various people was considered by the
26        Director of Public Prosecutions.        So it may be that that
27        is what it refers to.       I am afraid I do not know but
28        nobody is suggesting your son committed a crime, I cannot
29        believe it.
30   MRS. STRINGER:     I don't tell lies, sir.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What crime are they suggesting he
32        committed?
33   MRS. STRINGER:     No.    They said my son's file was kept at the
34        scene of crimes department.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That may be so because if the
36        police were treating the action of other people, such as


                                         18
 1         the police superintendents, and so on, as potential crimes
2          then the evidence would be kept in the scenes of crime
 3         department.     There is nothing surprising about that.
 4   MRS. STRINGER:      I don't understand that type of law because I
 5         have never been involved with that.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      If that is the position there is
 7         nothing sinister about that.
 8   MRS. STRINGER:      Will you see the evidence that was given to the
 9         Director of Public Prosecution against the police?
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes.
11   MR.   BONE:   Perhaps it would help if I add that I have heard
12         through a number of sources, though I've not been able to
13         check it yet, that Hillsborough was treated as the scene
14         of a major crime at the time, which meant it was taped off
15         and police were posted all round to make sure that nobody
16         interfered with the evidence that was left at the ground.
17         The ground was isolated by police.     First South Yorkshire
18         and then the West Midlands police treated is as a
19         potential crime, they mounted what amounted to a criminal
20         investigation, not of the spectators, of course but of the
21         police officers effectively.
22   MRS. STRINGER:      Them same police officers were allowed to
23         attend that crime scene who they were investigating.
24         That's the ironic part about it.     The fans were not
25         allowed---
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Nobody else could have isolated it
27         at the time apart from the police.      I do not think anyone
28         else could have isolated it.      It would have to be the
29         South Yorkshire police in first instance and then the West
30        Midlands police.
31   MRS. STRINGER:  I still think to this day that it was the fans
32         that they intended to say committed the crime of going in
33         in their thousands, drunk - they were the accusations that
34         Duckenfield made, the lies that they told that they
35         smashed the gate down and that was the whole start of all
36         this trouble because they should have just admitted what


                                        19
1        they done.
2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I agree.
3   MRS. STRINGER:     They done nothing and they've put us through
4        hell for eight and a half years.
5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It has caused more harm than
6        anything else that particular lie.     Thank you very much
7        for coming.

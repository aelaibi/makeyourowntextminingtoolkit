          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S REPORT



          ^eMhaS^h
                 gaSfhatLaSoi^^      tal discussion with you today about
                                    iment's response to this report
          which was due to be published shortly. Mr McDonald, Mr
          Kinghan, Mr Lee and Mr Newsom were also present.

          2.The Minister proposed that officials prepare a position
          paper as a matter of urgency including advice on whether the
          FLA could be established without the FMA and covering factual
          errors and omissions from the report. This has already been
          received.

          3.The Minister discussed in detail what options might be
          considered.These seemed to be:-

                    with the scheme
          â€” abandon the whole idea of a membership scheme
          - defer the timetable, pe      by more extensive testing of
            the technology.

          The Minister indicated that he saw little option but to
          pursue the first of these, though he thought there might be
          political difficulties. These were developed further in the
          meeting with the Secretary of State.

          4.Mr Moynihan asked in particular whether copies of the bid
          submssions might be obtained as a matter of urgency, together
          with the evidence ACPO put to Lord Justice Taylor.
          We have already taken steps to try and secure the first of
          these but I should be grateful if Mr Kinghan would pursue the
          second.

           I am a single man living at the above address.                        On Saturday?       15th

           April,    1989 (150489)     I went to Hillsborough,             the Sheffield Wednesday

           Football Club ground to watch the F.A. Cup Semi Final                        betw           y club,

           Liverpool and Nottingham Forest,             I have been a life-long                       pool fan

           and was a season ticket holder until                 last y e a r .    I met my travelling

           companions for the day outside the Bow and Arrow public house,



           I travelled down with                          and                          who I call

                     We left Liverpool  between 1130 a n d / 1 145am (1130 and 1145) in

           my pick-up.     We only had one hold-up on/the Motorway near S tockport

           where we spent about 3/4 hour travelling a mile.                        We d i d n ’t stop on

           the way and arrived in Sheffield atf 2.20pm                  (1420).      We parked the

           pick-up in either Withers Averiue^r Crofton Avenue about 2 minutes

              walk to the ground.           nad been           some days before the trip and

              was in fact                    on the day.    None of us had tickets for the
                C/VT        TlCiCAT TOOT5
              match but we wer§f confident we would get some because there are always

              spare ticketfe          these sort of matches.       As a matter of fact I went

              to the same fixture last year and managed to get a ticket outside the

              ground.      On the way to the ground,^t was very relaxed,         I only saw one
                                                  ^'
       £      Liverpool     fan who was obviously drunk but there were fans drinking

              from cans.         We got outside the Leppings Lane entrance about 2.30pm

              (1330).      The crowds around the entrance were backed-up into Leppings

              Lane     itself.     I took one look at the crowd, and as I was

              thought to myself I ’m not going in there.            My two mates went

              into the crowd to try and get some tickets they came back about ten

              minutes later and told me there w a s n ’t any to be had.          I stood away

              from the main crowd on a little rise just over the bridge on the

              river.     From here I could flee all the turnstiles and turnstile area in
                                          /
              frp-ti't of me . Numerous pj/ople we re mi 11 i ng around by me, all ask i ng
               y
              for spare tickets,     At/about 2.40 (1440) - 2.45 (1440) the

              crowd outside was        chifcka and many fans were starting to wa 1k away,

              realising they w e r / n ’t getting in.   All of a sudden the gate on the
                        GrA^F
              right hand side of the ’st an d i n g ’ turnstiles opened.  Fails started to

              rush through this gate and people were shouting that the gate was
CWAUTtt
& s j T£.y.   open.     Everybody in earshot turned round and made a run towards the
              —— — —        ^
              gate.     People were coming from everywhere.  The gate stopped open for

              S0'‘*secondfi to one minute then it closed.           This made the situation

              worse outsiwie because people had the expectation of getting              in and

              they all     crowded round.         went into this crowd and I didn't see him

              again till the evening.         Me a n d s t a y e d     where we were, we could

              see the crowd building up.                e time the right hand gate was

         about hobbling in when the crowd had gone but decided against                                    it.      I ’m

         glad I did.       As I said earlier,           I went to the same match last

         year.     I arrived at the ground about 2.30                  (1430)        I hung around

         outside and about 2.55 (1455)             people with spare tickets were selling

         them at below face value.

         Last year there were two lines of policemen outside the Leppings Lane

         turnstiles      checking tickets and searching people.                       This slowed peoples

         approach to the turnstiles which allowed them to queue.                                 This year

         when I got to the entrance, all                I could see by way of police were

         three mounted officers and a bobby with a flat cap.

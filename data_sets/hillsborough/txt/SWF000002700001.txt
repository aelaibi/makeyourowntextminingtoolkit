turnstiles,             although            thi s      could          have       been      caused         by the        police w h o            w

searching            t h e m as       t h e y a r r i v e d at             the     g round.          The       ge n e r a l    mood       of    t

fans      appeared          to     be      good       humoured             and     although           I c o u l d smell             alcohol

on the        o dd    fan,        nobody appeared                     to     be the w o r s e            for    drink.

It w a s      abou t       an     h ou r    l ater         that       things        started          to get         out of          hand,

the      crowd       had     increased and                   there         were     big q u e u e s        forming            at    the

turnstiles.                I noticed             then        t hat      people were              starting           to get

impatient            and     I s a w at          least          1 0 - 1 2 fans        climbing            over      the w a l l          above

the      turnstiles             and      they       j u st      sat     on    the wall.               I saw and h«ard                    varic

asked      them       for       their       tickets.              Some        of    them       just       shrugged            their

shoulders            and     from        t h e ir     gestures             it s e e m e d      to me       that       they         didn't

have      any    tickets           and      in f act            I didn't           see     any      tickets         taken          from

anyone.          Although             I would          like        to      po int     out      that       in m y o p i n i o n at

time       to    ej ect       the       fans       back       into        L e p p i n g s Ln.          It was          t he n     I saw a

senior          po li c e     officer           who      Iw o u l d      describe           as        b e i ng    a b ou t       5 ,c? - 5 ' 1 0

wearing          a flat           cap.        I think          he       either       had a mou s t a c h e                 or was        clean

shaven          an d    he w a s        aged       between          late       thirty's           or     e a r l y forty's.                  I

didn't          notice        what       rank      he was           but       I saw h i m         carrying             a    radio        in his

r i g ht    hand.            The    officer           climbed            onto       the     roof       of the          turnstiles

number          1 - 1 6 a n d wa s         c l os e      to    gate          *B’.         I didn't           h e a r what

instructions                 he g a v e       to    the       r a dio        but    he wa s       speaking             into       it for

quite a          bit.         While        he w as        th e r e ,         more and more               fans       kept         coming

o ve r     and     he wa s         shouting           for      the f an s          to get        down.           I would          estimate

that       at    least        another           30-40         fans a g a i n got                in that          way.         While       this

was      going         on    I could          hear       fans       walking          on our           portacabin              roof       and      I

th e     situation which                   seemed         to       be    getting           out of        hand,                    refus ed

to     go a n d        collect          any     more      money          f     r     o      m     s      o        we a s k e d a

police          officer           who    did what             we    asked.           While        all        t h is was          tak i n g

place,          I heard a           crash and a                fan       had trod           on the           edge      of     sorre

asbestos           guttering             a nd      the    whole          lot       ha d    come       crashing             down.         T he

police          again        tried       to m o v e       the       crowd away              from        the      debris          but     there

was      no w a y       for       them     to      go,    so       I can o n l y a s s u m e              that      the       police

themselves              moved       it a w a y        from         the       fans.

I began          to     notice          by t his         t im e     a ch a n g e          in the m o o d          of       the     crowd,

there       were        more       people          arriving             aged       between        15-30,          where          before          it

was mainly              family          groups        and      older          fans.         Some        of the         fans        smelled

strongly           of       booze a n d         there         was       one    or    two        v e r y drunk,             although          I

d i d n ’t a c t u a l l y         see     anybody            drinking             from      cans.           There         was     one y o u t h

He    was      wearing           a denim         coloured           sweatshirt,                it had       two    or three

buttons          at     the      front         and a white             collar,          and     he m a y     have     been w e a r i n

either         a white           t shirt         or    shirt        u n der       it.      He wa s         also    wearing        very

baggy       denim        jeans,           I particularly                noticed           the     jean s     because        the

Liverpool             accent        and after              speaking          to him he e i t h e r            was     very d r u n k

or    th i c k .        The      youth,          upon        reaching         the cabin w i n d o w ,          f irst      asked       fo

programme,              but      didn't          offer       a n y mo n e y .        WhenI asked             hi m for a         pound

which       wa s      the      cost       of     the    programme,                he t ol d      me   no a n d       he    told me to

to m y      right.

It w o u l d       be     only       a few m i nutes               later      that        the     same      youth     came      back        t

me.      He      had      his       fist       c l e n c h e d a n d a g a i n a s k e d me for a                  p r o g ram me .         I

asked       hi m for           his m o n e y         and     from      his    clenched            f is t    he d r o p p e d E p

programme.                He     ju st     looked          at me w i t h          threats         in his       eyes       trying       to

stare       me     out      and      he    then        I think         tried        the       same a p p r o a c h    on

He    then       came       back,         threw        the S p      into      the       cabin and           said,

"Programme".                   I picked           up    the      two    penc e       piece a n d           gave    it him       back.

He    then       stared          at me         again       and     then      said,        "N e v e r m i n d,      I'll      get     you

at    h al f     time."             He    then       g r i n n e d at me a n d            left.        I noticed           then      that

he j u s t       stood about               ten y a r d s         away from           the       cabin waiting              for    frienc

and     I started              to    get       worried        in    case      he     returned with                some     of    his

mates.

After       the       incident            with       the     yo ut h,     I lost          track       of    time,     but       anyway

the     fans       kept        coming          a n d we      were      kept       b u s y all       the     t im e a n d     I heard

fans      shouting             from       behind        the      turnstiles              and everybody was                  j u st   tryi

to    get      in.        I did          notice        then      that     gate          'B'    being       opened         by the

gateman          and      a Policeman                was     present.             The     c o n s t r u c t i o n of the          gate       i

such       that     one        h alf    of       the    gate       o p en s      towards        the       p o r t a c a b i n -and the

other       half         towards        turnstiles                1-16.          W h e n the      gate      was       opened,      the

reason          I b e l i e v e was          to     relieve         the       pressure          from       outside,          abo u t

200-300          f a ns     ran t h r o u g h          the    gates         and     from where             I was       I then      lost

sight       of     them.

There       then seemed                to    be a s i l e n c e ,           w h i c h was       ver y s t r a n g e      after         all

the    noise        and        shouting*               The    gates         were       then almost              closed,       just

allowing           no m o r e        than        two    people        at a time            to     en ter        or    leave,      closel

supervised               by a P o l i c e m a n         and Gateman.

From       what      I could           see       b e t w e e n the        gap,      t h e re    appeared             to be     no m o r e

fans       waiting          to    get       in f r o m       that     particular               area,       although          people

were       s till        c omi n g     in a bit          at       a time         through        the       turnstiles.             I thin

I made          s om e    comment           to    the    other        two        in the        c a b in    to the       eff ect        that

it a p p e a r e d        as     if all          the    crowd were               in a n d that we w o u l d              not      sell

m any more           programmes -

We    all       then      started           to    check what              p r o g r a m m e s we      had s o l d a n d to             star

counting           th e     takings-              We w e r e       joined         then     by

They       first         of all        came       in w i t h       their         money     and      t hey t h e n       returned

unsold          programme            which        they       passed         to    us    t h r o u g h the w i n d o w .

While       we w e r e         counting           the    money                    left     to go a n d w a t c h             the m a t c h

and    I think            t hats       when       I heard          o ve r     the P / A        system        for a Mr M E A D O W S

and    then        t h e re      was    a message             which         I didn't           hear.

The    reason            I ca n      remember           the w o r d s         MEADOWS,          that       is the       key w o r d

that       is u s e d       by the          Club       in an       emergency and                that's when Police                     have

to    go    to a         particular              area-        When        the     message         came       through,          I s a w at

least       10-12 Police                Officers             run f r o m the            turnstiles              1-16    through         the

gate       at    the      r i gh t     hand       side       of    the      portacabin and                 disappear           f r o m out

of my       view.           I remained              in the         cabin wit h           the      p r o g r a m m e s as the           ot he

three       had      taken        all       the     takings          to     the     gymnasium             for    c hecking.

It w a s        only      a few minut es                l a te r     I saw         pe opl e      com in g       back    fro m     the

West    S t a n d a r ea-             Some      of    them were            obviously            in pain,          others    were

just    complaining                 about       being        squashed.             They      started        to ask me           for

drinks       and water              and    I think           I was       then       joined        by                    who      ther

left    either          with        programmes             or m o r e      mon ey.         I gave         some     of t h e m    orar

and    from       the     general           conversation                I had w i t h        them,        the     general

complaints            were       of    overcrowding                a n d of        being     badly squashed.

As    more    people           began       to    come        out    there were             then        conversations            about

deaths       or    the        p o s s i b l e 'bad      injuries           and      p eo p l e w e r e     being      aggressive

towards       any groundsman                    or a n y b o d y        in a u t h o r i t y .

People       were        saying        and      showing           tickets with them                     intact,     stating        the

there       had    been        no     co n t r o l    over        pe opl e      co mi ng       in w i t h o u t    t ick et s.

At    the    s a me      t ime       I saw a g r o u p            of a b o u t      six y o u t h s       c a r r y i n g a lad

face    down.            They walked across                       the     b ac k    of     the West        Stand away            from

me,    they       then        returned with                 the y o u t h       still       in the        same     position,

walked       across           the     front      of     the       cabin      , t h r o u g h gate 8 a n d             into

Leppings          Ln.

The    youth       they were               carrying          appeared           to be of           heavy     build.        He     was

wearing       a black            sweatshirt,                black       jeans       and     he m a y      have     had either           i


white       lining        or w h i t e       t shirt           underneath.                 I would        estimate       his      age

as    being       about         late       teen s     or     early        twenty's.             The      lads     who w e r e

carrying          hi m    all        appeared          to    be    of     the      sa me    age     g r o u p a n d also

appeared          to     be     friends         of     his.        From      the      b rief       glimpse        I ha d of       him,

I couldn't             see      if    he w a s        dead     or w h a t       injuries           he    had.

After       they       h ad     gone,        I was      j o i n e d by                      [and    f r o m the      crowd who

were     coming          past        the     portacabain,               I felt        t h at     the m o o d was        getting

very    ugly and              t h e r e was       a    feeling          that       s o m e b o d y was     going      to get

seriously          h u rt       by    the     crowd.

I locked          the     portacabin              and       I went        with                     to    the N o r t h S t a n d

Gym,    and       it was         then        I realised             the     extent         of what        ha d h a p p e n e d    and

saw a       l a rg e     group        of     people         who    were       obviously            dead     outside        the    gym

             I waited          at     the      entrance            of      the     Gym     until      I c o u ld     e nter w i t h o u t

             getting          in a n y b o d y ' s        way-          Once       in s i d e    I again       saw bo die s        along       a

            The      far      e n d of        the    gym were              the     rest      of the       programme          sellers,

             including           my      f ather.

            After        a brief           c o n v e r s a t i o n w i t h m y fa ther,                  I discovered            that              hat

             not     returned            so    I went        looking             for     him.       I w ent       through        the    side

             entrance,           back         under       the N o r t h S t a n d            and    onto      the    t r a ck    by the     s i de

             of    the      S p i o n Kop.           I then           saw a        line      of P o l i c e    Officers          across     the

             full      width        of     the      pitch.            I walked           towards         the W e s t S t a n d     an t hro u gh

             a g r o u p of P o l i c e m e n .

             Upon      returning              back    towards              the     Hop     end,     I was       stopped         by a

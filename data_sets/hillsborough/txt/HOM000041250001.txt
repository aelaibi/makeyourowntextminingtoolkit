  Throughout the incident both outside and inside the ground there seemed to be communication
problems. It seemed that many did not know what was going on or what was the best course of
action. The crush outside the ground could possibly have been better controlled with more Police
Officers and a better regulation of the flow of fans up to the turnstiles. At the time when the crush
reached its height particular serial seemed to be down to a quarter strength of what should have
been. I believe that opening the outer gates was a very necessary decision as the situation was
becoming out of hand and at serious risk o f injury. Knowing the Hillsborough Ground as I do, and
how the Leppings Lane end fills up, it might possibly have been better to direct the fans coming in
through the open gates into the flank areas, which I saw were by no means full”,(p. 199)

                At 11.15 am we made our way around to the rear of the West Stand ir

                preparation for the turnstiles being opened about 11.45 am.

                At 11.45 am I commenced duty directly outside turnstiles A & B in

                company with PC 607 Taylor;       TTn the early stages there we re just

                From approximately 2 pm onwards the number of fans entering the

                ground at this end steadily increased.                          During this build up the

                Exit Gate B and a single blue barrier which runs away from the

                turnstiles.

                                                                        r

                Many were shouting and pleading at us to do something.                 There were

                punches thrown as some fans came around the barrier and tried to j

                the crush nearer thr: t ...-r.31 i 1 e s .   A small boy was passed over the

                head of the crowd to us.          I pushed a small space to allow a young

                to escape ythe crush,      but he wouldn't      come under the barrier shouti

                at me that he wanted to see the match.

                Behind/me there were a large number of fans standing away from the

                main/crush just outside Exit Gate C.             Many fans were shouting and

                pleading for the gates to be opened to ease the crush.                 I could se

                that there were numerous fans climbing on top of the outer wall an

                entering the ground.        There was some talk amongst the Police Offic

                present and Inspector^ Purdy informed the j3^^£grs directly outside
  t
   ' f o r r f i Gate C that   it was going to be opened.           The Gate was opened a shor
                                                                                >AGE

   someone stumbled as they went through.            The gate V a j ^fctTen closed

   again.    It had been opened for approximately 30-60 seconds.              It had

   the effect of clearing the area directly outside the Gate but did

   nothing to ease the general crush at the turnstiles.               The situation

   continued to deteriorate,          people were   in distress many fans continu

   to shout for the gate to be reopened.            That they all had tickets,

   seemed that    it was only a matter of time before someone was injurec

   if not already.        Many fans were helpless      in the crush and could

   hardly move as the pressure from the fans behind forced them towarc

   the turnstiles.,           I could see 3 or 4 police horses up near the larc

   iron gates bordering on Leppings Lane,            the crush of fans seemed to

   stretch well    into Leppings Lane itself.          Most of the Police Officer

   I couLd see were between the blue barrier and the temporary barrier

   guarding the sterile area at the rear of the South Stand,

    ith the situation getting worse the Exit Gate C was opened again

   from the inside.           This time there was a much larger influx of fans

   into the ground.           The majority of them weren't running but all were

   anxious to escape the crush and get          into the ground.      I positioned

   myself directly outside Gate C in the flow of fans who had to pass

   either side of me.           They were told not to rush, to take their time.

   Hundreds of fans must have passed me.            Only a few running,     the othe

   were orderly.        The    influx died down to a small trickle after a few

   minutes and the Gate was narrowed to allow one fan at a time, and

   this trime each showing their tickets to a steward.             The area outsic

   the ;/tur ns t i 1 es was now clear.    I regrouped with officers from my

^^^^rial.      Almost    immediately someone    reported that there was a pitcl~

   invasion.     In company with other officers         I went in through Gate C

   paflT'the tunnel to the Centre section of the terracing into the S o l

   stand and onto the pitch.          There were many people walking and

   standing on the pitch.          There was a lot of confusion as to what was

               happening.   I could see that there were numerous police officers nt

                   perimeter fence behind the Leppings Lane end goal.          I couldn't

                   crowd beyond.    Next the police officers began to pass injured

                   le out from an open gate in the fencing.         Along with others I

                    them from these officers and placed them in a safer position

               further on the pitch.     Many seemed short of breath and distressed         i

               each person I helped was alive and conscious.          I helped one youth »

0^^   OSAO ■   said to me that people were dying in there         pointing at the terrace

               At this time due to the number of people on or around the fence I

               still couldn't see through to the terracing.          I moved closer and I

               that there was a mass   crush of bodies      just inside the fence.   It w-

               a confusion of heads arms and legs.          I saw one man who was obvious

               dead but he was held upright by the crush and his body moved with

               crowd.   By this time I was directly outside the small open gate.

               Officers inside the terracing were      passing the injured onto the pi

               and giving first aid if necessary       I worked my way across to betwe

               the ambulance which had pulled onto the track and the perimeter fe

^              which had been forced apart.     I continued to assist in carrying

               injured onto the pitch.

               After a short time   I climbed into the terracing through the hole i

               the fence and assisted in carrying      people to the fence.     I assiste

               with approximately 10 people all      of whom were already dead.

               Eventually the Centre section of the terrace cleared.          I remember

               that soon after this an announcement was broadcast that the match

               would not be continued.     Whilst   I was    in the terracing and on the

               pitch helping the injured many Liverpool         fans were directing their

               anger at the Police.    Calling us murderers and that it was our

               fault.    Others thanked me.

               After the terracing had cleared I joined other officers on the

               halfway line.   Eventually we made our way back to the North Stand
                                                                              PAG

             the Leppings Lane terracing.

             Throughout the incident both outside and inside the ground there

             seemed to be communication problems.    It seemed that many didn't k

             what was going on or what was the best course of action.    The crus

             areas, which I saw were by no means full.

After    2.30    pm,    the   crowd     outside     the   turnstiles   appeared      to   swell

enormously within a few minutes and from the queues being orderly and well

defined, it suddenly became one large mass pushing towards the turnstiles.

I    found myself      being pushed into the wall           at the side of the turnstile

entrance.       A Police horse came up to the entrance in an effort to regulate

the crowd but this had very little effect as the pressure from the back of

the crowd grew.         Eventually myself and Police Constable 2980 forced our way

 into the turnstiles and into the ground.                  We went around the back out of

 the large Exit Gate C and continued to try and control the crowd, which

 seemed to be trapped into the area between Exit Gate B and a single blue

 barrier which runs away from the turnstiles.

    From my position at the side of this barrier I could see that the crowd

    pressure was becoming severe.         People near the barrier were red in the face

    and straining to push back.          Some fans were panicking.          Many were shouting

    and pleading at us to do something.            There were punches thrown as some fans

    came around the barrier and tried to join the crush nearer the turnstiles.

    A small boy was passed over the head of the crowd to us.                  I pushed a small

    space to allow a young        lad to escape the crush, but he wouldn't comeunder

    the barrier shouting at       me that he wanted to see the match.

    Behind me there were a large number of fans standing away from the main

     crush just outside Exit Gate C.             Many fans were shouting and pleading for

     the gates to be opened to ease the              crush.      I could see that there were

     numerous fans climbing on top of the outer wall and entering the ground.

     There was some talk amongst the Police Officers present and Inspector Purdy

     informed   the    officers       directly    outside Gate    C that    it was   going to be

     opened.     The Gate was opened a short              time afterwards    from    inside and a

large number of fans rushed inside, someone stumbled as they went through.

The gate was then closed again.            It had been opened for approximately 30-60

seconds.     It had the effect of clearing the area directly outside the Gate

but did nothing to ease the general crush at the turnstiles.                      The situation

continued to deteriorate, people -ere in distress, -any fans continued to

shout for the gate to be reopened.                That they all had tickets.          It seemed

 that    it was     only a matter     of   time     before    someone   -as   injured,    if not

 already.        Many fans .ere helpless in the crush and could hardly move as the

 pressure from the         fans behind forced them towards the turnstiles.               I could

 see 3 or 4 Police         horses up near the large iron gates bordering on Leppings

 Lane,     the    crush of   the   fans    seemed    to stretch well      into Leppings Lane

 itself.         Most of the Police Officers I could see were between the blue

  barrier and the temporary barrier guarding the sterile area at the rear of


  the South Stand.
                                 «     F t -it Gate C was opened again from the
  With the situation getting worse the
  inside.        This time there was a much larger influx of fans into the ground.

  The majority of them weren't running but all were anxious to escape the

  crush and get into the ground.             I positioned myself directly outside Gate C

   in the flow of fans who had to pass either side of me.                     They were told not

   to rush, to take their time.            Hundreds of fans must have passed me.              Only a

   few running,        the others wereorderly.               The influx died down to a         small

   trickle after a few minutes and the                  Gate was narrowed to allow one fan ata

   time,    and     this   time   each showing their tickets to a steward.               The area

   outside         theturnstiles was now clear.          I regrouped

   serial. Almost            immediately     someonereported       that   there    was    a    pitch

    invasion.        In company with other officers, I went in through Gate C past
the tunnel to the Centre section of the terracing into the South Stand and

onto the pitch.       There were many people walking and standing on the pitch.

There was a lot of confusion as to what was happening.                             I could see that

there were numerous Police              Officers    near the perimeter fence behind the

Leppings Lane end goal.              I couldn't see the crowd beyond.               Next the Police

Officers began to pass           injured people         from an open gate in the fencing.

Along with others I          took them        from these officers          and placed them in a

 safer   position     further    on     the   pitch.       Many   seemed short of breath and

 distressed but each person I helped was alive and conscious.                             I helped one

 youth   who   said   to me      that    people     were    dying    in    there    pointing at the

 terrace.      At this time, due to the number of people on or around the fence,

 I still couldn't see through to the terracing.                         I moved closer

  that there was a mass crush of bodies Just inside «he fence.                                It was a

  confusion of heads, arms and legs.                   I saw one man who was obviously dead

  but he was held upright by the crush and his body moved with the crowd.                             By

  this time I was directly outside the small open gate.

  Officers inside the terracing were passing the injured onto the pitch and

  giving    first aid,       if necessary.          I worked myway          across    to between the

  ambulance which had pulled onto the track and the perimeter fence which had

  been     forced apart.        I continued        to assist        in carrying injured onto the


  pitch.
   After a short time, I climbed into the terracing through the hole in the

   fence    and   assisted      in    carrying     people    to   the     fence.      I   assisted with

   approximately 10 people, all of whom were already dead.

   Eventually,      the Centre        section of the terrace cleared.                 I remember that

   soon after this an announcement was broadcast that the match would not be




                                                                                    2j&lvClviUj^

continued.     Whilst   I was in the terracing and on the pitch helping the

injured,   many   Liverpool   fans   were    directing   their   anger   at   the Police.

Calling us murderers and that it was our fault.           Others thanked me.

After   the   terracing had cleared,        I joined other officers on the halfway

line.   Eventually we made our way back to the North Stand via the Leppings

Lane terracing.

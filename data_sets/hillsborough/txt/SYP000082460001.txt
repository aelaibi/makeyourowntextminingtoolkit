of    the       crowd         behind         them.           They were          let      through         and      I took        them       to a

 moveable              barrier          where          they were          let      into     'the c o r r e c t         s ide    of    the

the      crush         of     people         outside          for       being      unable        to    get       into     the      correct

turnstiles                smelled          strongly           of a l c o h o l .         The     b est      way     I can       describe

it    is    'passing             a     public          house       doorway'.             I did        not    see       evidence           of    the

fans       drinking             but     it w a s        obvious          that      quite       a few        had.
                                                                                                                            O-
Whilst          working          at     the       turnstiles             I did      notice        that       the       larg e g^tres to

my                  were      opened         and       then       closed again,             but       I did       not     t^Tnk       it

unusual          at       the    time        because          they       had    been       opened        several          times       during

the      day        to a l l o w       officers          with       prisoners            through         from       the      outside.

When       the       turnstiles              were       eventually             closed,         I was        immediately              called

to    give          assistance             in     the    tunnel          a r ea.      I w as      told       to m o v e        people          out

of    the       ground          because           people          had    been      crushed        outside.              It     proved

impossible                to m o v e       the- c r o w d who            became       very       abusive.              I made        my    way

When    all    the       injured         had       been moved            from      the       ’ p e n ’ I t ook      up a

were    trained          in F i r s t     Aid       and    also       a doctor,,

The    general          mood    of      the    c r o w d at       this        t i me   was        very angry        and    a    lot

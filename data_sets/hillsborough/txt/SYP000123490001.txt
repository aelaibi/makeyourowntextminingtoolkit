Q. You have no recollection of passing anything like this
   on? - A. No, sir.

Q. The timing of that is 1508 or thereabouts? - A. Yes.

Q. You do not know but are you able to say when you would
   have sent the message to Snigg Hill for ambulances? -
   A. Not exactly but that would be on the transcript from
   the tape.

Q. What about later on?  You were in the Control Room, Mr.
   Duckenfield was there and I think various other people
   came into the Control Room, is that right? - A. Indeed,
   sir.

Q. Did you hear any conversations or explanations being
   given as to what caused the problems with which
   everybody was grappling with at the time? - A. Various
   people came to the Control Room and all wanted
   information about what had taken place.  Is there any
   one particular individual?

Q. Yes, when Mr. Kelly came to the Control Room was
   anything said? - A. The Chief Superintendent did have a
   conversation with Mr. Kelly.

Q. That is Chief Superintendent Duckenfield so that we
   know? - A. Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

Q. Do you recollect what was said in that conversation? -
   A. Not the whole of the conversation but certain
   reference was made to the initial thought about the
   gates being forced open.

Q. You recollect that that was said? - A. Yes.

Q. What you are saying is that you cannot remember the
   full extent? - A. That was only part of the
   conversation he was having.

Q. Would you be able to confirm that the main opening of
   the gates had been authorised from the Control Room? -
   A. Yes, that is right.

Q. At what-point did you yourself, never mind.what anybody
   else said or did, realise that there was a major
   disaster developing -in ~front-of -your eyes? j-as.A *airthink
   that is really a matter of record again* on the tape
   when I passed a transmission to Headquarters saying
   that we now realised there was in fact fatalities.         It
   wasn't just a series of people who were injured.         I
   seem to recollect that would be around 3.15.         Again it
   is difficult to tie things exactly down but it would be
   recorded on tape the time that conversation occurred.

Q. It was a very short period, was it not? - A. Probably
   40 seconds which is twice as long as that.

Q. Tell me, when you did witness the conversation you have
   told us about in relation to Mr. Duckenfield with Mr.
   Kelly, this was in the Control Box, was it not? - A.
   That is right.  Mr. Kelly came to the doorway of the
   Control Box.

Q. Who was Mr. Kelly, do you know? - A. He was connected
   with the FA.  That is my knowledge of him.

Q. How close to the Control Box door were you
   positioned? - A. Perhaps three or four feet.

Q. You clearly do have a recollection of Mr. Duckenfield
   telling Mr. Kelly about a gate having been forced? - A.
   I remember a conversation taking place and that was
   part of the conversation, yes.

Q. You do not remember any other part of the conversation?
   - A. No.

Q. So certainly you do not remember anything along the
   lines of, "And we, the Police, opened a gate to let a
   lot of people in"? - A. No.

Q. Just tell us again then your recollection of exactly
   what you heard Mr. Duckenfield tell Mr. Kelly? - A. Mr.
   Kelly came to the doorway.  There was a conversation
   taking place between him and Mr. Duckenfield and part
   of that conversation included comments regarding the
   gate that we believed had been forced, which was gate
   C-

Q. And what happened? - A. After the Police had regained
   control of the gates?

Q.    No, no, what did Mr. Duckenfield tell Mr. Kelly apart
     from saying that a gate had been forced? - A. I don't
     remember, sir.

Q. Did he not say that there had been an inrush of i
   supporters into the ground? - A. If that is part of the
   transcript from Lord Justice Taylor then that is what I
   said and that is what I remember at that time, yes.

Q.    Mr. Bichard, there is no ifs and buts about it, is
     there? The impression you gained at that time was that
     Mr. Duckenfield was telling Mr. Kelly of the FA that
     the cause of what had gone wrong was that the gate had
     been forced with the result that a lot of supporters
     had rushed into the ground.  That is the effect of what

   he was saying as the cause? - A. I d o n ’t know what
   other things were being said at the time, that the two
   people there were having a conversation and there were
   other things happening in the Control Room.

        MR. KING: All right,   I will not take that any
   further. Thank y o u .

                 Cross-Examined bv MR. iSAAra

Q. Mr. King is trying to suggest to you that the snippet
   of conversation that you heard was all that was said
   about this matter and there in that snippet was Mr.
   Duckenfield's whole assessment a number of minutes"
   after the event of the cause of what was going on.
   That I think is what is being suggested.  Let me just
   try and put all this in context.  First of all, the
   conversation that you did hear was just a snippet of
   the total conversation between the men? - A. Yes, that
   is right.

Q. As I understand it, it was not a conversation that
   concerned you? - A. No, it was not connected with me.

Q. Would it be fair to say that you had a good deal on
   your plate at that time? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Therefore, it is fair to say you would not have been
   concentrating terribly on that conversation? - A. I
   wouldn't have been concerned of somebody coming to the
   door wanting further information.

Q. You have fairly told Mr. King that you do not know what
   else was said? - A. No, I don't.

Q. So far as what you heard was concerned that so far as
   your own recollection was concerned was absolutely
   true.  You had believed that fans had forced the gate
   and that there had been an inrush of fans into the
   ground? - A. Yes, when gate C opened for the first time
   there was no doubt.  I didn't feel any doubt in my mind
   that the gate had been forced.

Q. In so far as you heard Mr. Duckenfield say that, what
   he was saying so far as you were concerned was
   absolutely right? - A. Yes.

Q. As you told Mr. King, you do not know whether what Mr.
   Duckenfield was saying had a continuation namely "And
   after that the gate was opened on our authority"? - A.
   He may well have qualified that with further
   conversation.

This would apoear, from the way you put it, to be before
-he hitting of the bar by Mr. Beardsley, by Peter Bearcsley?
- A. Yes, I believe so because I did not see that incident.

And one would imagine that you would have been concentrating
on the game if you had not had yor concentration oivertec
bv something else? - A. Yes I would because it was an exciting
opening to the game until my attention was taken elsewnere.

■•’hat was your first reaction, incidentally Mr.             Kelly, when
vou saw the perimeter fence being scaled? - A.               My iirst
reaction was to cuestion what was going on.    I             did not
make any assumptions.    I did not know what was             going on.

Once the game was stopped did you go down on to the pitch
yourself? “ A. Yes, I did.
    that to try and find out what was happening? - A. Well _
I walked a little way on to the pitch alongside Mr. Dalglisn
and made a comment to him, yes.

Yes, what comment was that? - A. "What the hell is going on?"

Did you go up to the Leppings Lane end to see for yourself
at all? - A. No, I didn't, no.

what c ’d you in fact co? We know at some stage you w.^t
ud to the Control Bo::. What did you co between the time
o £ leaving your seat and going on to the pii_ch and going
n l to the Control Box? - A. I stood at the entrance to
the olayer's tunnel with various Oiticials in d u c i n g une
match referee and linesman.

 Has <t obvious to you by then that it was not a straight­
 forward pitch invasion, it was something other than t.*at,
 it was not hooliganism? - A. Yes, it did not appear to
 be hooliganism.

 So did you .decide to go to the Police Control Box to fine
 out what actually was happening? - A. Yes, i asked
 Mr. Hackrell to take me.

  nid vou hear anv announcements over the Tannoy, any
* relevant announcements over the Tannoy before you went
  Sp to ths control Box? - A. Ho, I didn't.

 When -you got to the Control Bo:: you spoke I think, to the
 Police Officer in charge who you now know to js C.jief
 Superintendent Duckenfield? - A. Y e s , I did.

    n   Mn-; this oicture then v/as not a reply of the forcing of the
        ca<-e but ‘
                  s imply a camera showing the gate which had been
        forced,   is that what you are saying? - A. That is my
        recollection.       It was a black and white picture of, I don ^
        know'what it was quite honestly because tne re was so many
                  alonq the top and y>y experience is not of loo.-.ing
B       at them? I n t l t e Y - i d : "That is the gate. It has been
         forced. There has been an in-rush .

    o   Can vou recall now whith gate it was that was being snov/n
        ofi the monitor? - A. I am afraid I have no icea, no.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  But the way it was put to you
    Q. the forcing of the gate had permitted an in-rush into tne
       ground? - A. Yes.

                                                        G. KELLY

q            mr, coLLiNSs   who was it-1 c&n you refflsmbsri who told you
        this? - A. It was Mr. Duckenfield.

Q       Did he ask you, indicating the match was likely to be
        abandoned, but did he tell you anything about his intentions
        as to making any announcements or doing anything? - A. I c a n ’t
        recall that he told me of his intentions at that stage.  I put
        in my statement what I recall he said to me.  I can't recall
        anything else.

q       But there was still a possibility, as I understand your
        statement, that the match might go ahead? He was not ruling
        out that possibility?  Is that correct? - A. My recollection
        is that the match was in all probability going t o be
        abandoned, at that stage.

q   . It was about 10 minutes later you had a meeting again with the
      Police Officer, the referee and the representatives of the
      three clubs concerned, that is Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham
      and Liverpool, and by then the Police had not ruled out the
      possibility of a continuation? - A. That is what they were
      saying, although I suspect that....

Q. They were just saying that. - A ....... they did not want people
   to know that the match was being abandoned.

0       And you go on and indeed it is clear from the video we have
        seen there then followed a considerable period of uncertainty,
        with no announcements and no-one really knowing what was
        happening? - A. Yes, that is correct, Mr. Collins.

Q 'You had, I think, representations from the team managers that
   they wanted to know, and indeed in the case of Nottingham they
   effectively wanted to go? - A. I have no doubt they wanted to
   know.  I do n ’t recall a representation from Mr. Dalglish, but
   I certainly received a message from Mr. Clough they were going
   home.                   -
q             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     What stage was that? - A. That was
        about 4 o ’clock, my Lord.

    q          MR. COLLINS:       Did you form any opinion at the time, Mr.
         Kelly, about whether or not there ought to have been more
         information given, that is to everyone, including the people
         sitting or standing in the ground? -A. Yes, I think that
         everybody was concerned to know what was going on, not least
         the 5 0 ,0 0 0 -odd people in the crowd.

    Q    Once the disaster had occurred did you get the impression or
         did you yourself receive any direction from the senior Police
         who were supposed to be in charge of the whole thing? - A. You
         mean at any time, Mr. Collins?

    Q    Yes? - A. No.    At the end of the meeting - I had two contacts
         with the Police;    the one in the control box at about 3.20 anc
             ir^-eting in the Eosrdroom cf all interested parties at
         about 2.30.    At the conclusion of tne 2.20 r.eetmg I as:-;ec Mr.

                            -examined by Hr. WOODWARD:

         \<y K e iiv inav   I ".ust ask you about that last matter w m c n
         •r' Kallipetis     has been pursuing with you. You went up

         not?     A. Yes,   Hr. Ilackrell took me and my colleague,
         Mr. Kirton.
          So that was three of you who went into that box?               A. Yes.

          And tafere were already tne police officers in there?                    A. Yes.

          And there    was a lot happening at that time outside?              A.      rnere
          was a lot    happening inside as well.

          There was a lot going on both inside and outside?              A.    Yes,
          obviously.
          -ir. Du-cMenfiel^ said something to you?           A. Yes. - ..

           Yo" ar= not sayina that in fact he pointed to a particular
           screen^ are you?         A.  No, I'm not saying that.    I r.
           s a v i n a :nv attention was drawn to a screen w m c n puroortea
         ' tS'represent the broken gate, the forced gate or gates.

          your attention was drawn to a screen, you say, which
    Q.    nuroorted to represent a broken gate?   A. The rorced
          gate or gates;  the forced point or entry.

           what was s a i d about tnis screen to which your attention
           waJ drawn’       A.  I said "What has happened?" anc Mr.
           Duckenfield said "The Liverpool fans have iorced a ga_e
           and my attention was drawn either by him or one or m s
           officers to tne screen above me.

           And the screen had a picture on it, did it?              A.      Yes.
    Q.
           A view of something?           A.   Yes.
    Q-
           A gate?      A. Yes.

 thl time and we would view the prospect of going back to a
 lit of pitch invasions as there were 10 years ago with some
 concern.
 a couple of other matters finally.     Some suggestion has been
      about the idea of having television screens at the home
 grounds so that fans d o n ’t go to the match, the Semi-Final,
 they watch it at their home ground. - A. Yes.

 Are you able to tell us about any experiments with television
 screens at any grounds in this country? - A. There have been a
 number of occasions over the years.   This is not exactly a new
 development    It goes back 20 years, but I d o n ’t think that it
 his been wiidly successful over that time.    There have been
 technical p roblems. It is a help.    It can be a help in
 relieving the demand on the match, but I d o n ’t think it is a
     panacea.
     Tn the last say 5 years have any clubs as far as you areaware
     employed a television screen for this purpose?

        MR COLLINS:    It may be unfair to Mr. KelTy and to Hr.
  Dyson but we do have some information about I think in 1988
  of a Liverpool match against Hull, a Cup match 1 think, where
  1 screen was employed at Tranmere Rovers for the purpose of
 ' showing the match to Liverpool fans who could not get there,
      are seeking more details about it, but my understanding is
   fhat did happen and proved relatively successful.  Me are
   seeking further details about it, and I am afraid it was only
   S a m to my attention this morning because it so happened that
   the gentleman from Humberside who was involved in it was here
         this morning.
              THE W I T N E S S ’ I have no doubt that is right.  I think
         you will find it was 1989, Mr. Collins.        It is a recent
         match.  It was a 4th or 5th round this year.

                          MR. COLLINS:    Yes, you are right.   I think it was this
         year.
              MR DYSON-    Are you not able to speak from your own
Q.
         knowledge about other experiences of television screens being
         tried out and the extent to which they have been employed m
         the last say 5 years?
              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think rather than asking Mr.
         Kelly to come unrehearsed to this, there is a second stage
         which can be put on paper, no doubt.

        the football supporters? - A. The view is o„uen exp^ess^c
        v’ithin football circles, and I would largely suoscnoe
        i-o it that the football industry in general does not
        relate veil to its customers, the football supporters.

        not say.

        u^e* the word "Ombudsfan" or have a person or organisation
        that fulfils that function.             I would like to see tne

                          Cross-Examined bv MR. KALLIP2TIS:

o       Mr Kirton, I believe you are the person who can answer
        cuest^ons about the satellite relay to countries cutsics
        of this country during that afternoon? - A. Yes, I can.

O     Just a cuestion .his Lordship a sh ec. yesterday,    tr.e re.en^s
      r e c e i v e d from that. Do you have that figure by any cr^nce.
      - ? n o , I d o n ’t. What I can tell you is that the Football
      association's total income from satellite brcaccasting
      and th» sale of videos of matches overseas in the course
    ' o s a year would be about Elm. The semi-final woulc r.ot
      be a large proportion of that.        The main proportion is t/;e
      F.A. Cup Final itself.

O        vou were obviously aware that arrangements had been made
         to broadcast this semi-final by satellite.          As rar as
         vou a^e aware were, the Club aware of that cirrancemen
         -A.  It c e r t a i n l y would not have been conveyed to the
         Club on any official basis.

    0     Do you know from anything that-was said to you wnetner
          or not thev were aware? - A. Ho, the subject was not
          mentioned on^ the day or subsequently.

    O     v0u were asked about the incident in the Control Room when
          mv Duckenfield told you the explanation for tiie crus.i
          in*the oens.   was Hr. Hackrell with you when he tolc_you
          that”5 — A. Yes, this was on tne rirst occasion t.ia-^ i
          went to the Control Room v;ith iir. Kelly and ilr. i.ac/^-dl.

        And   where was Mr. Mackrell? - A. I believe he was behind me.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I did hot catch what the topic
        was?   Crush in the pens?

             MR. KALLIPETIS:    It is the story.Mr. Duckenfield told
        Mr. Keliy as to the reason why there was a crush in the pens,
        the fans had forced a gate and people had rushed in.   I am
        sorry, sir, I was trying to shortcut it:

        Mr. Kirton, were you present yesterday when I asked questions
        of Mr. Kelly about that? - A. Yes, I was.

        And I am not going to repeat all the questions.   Do you differ
        from him in his recollection of what was said and whether
        other people could have heard it and seen what was shown? - A.
        No there was a lot of movement, as M r . Kelly said,  there was
        a lot of activity, but not an excessive level of noise in the
        control room.
        So would you agree with his answer, bearing in mind that there
        were people working in that control box, "There may have been
        people who were not aware of what was being said to me but a
        significant proportion, the majority of people in that control
        box would have been aware what was said to m e ” . Would you
        agree with that? - A. Yes, I would.

a       And s i m i l a r l y , "Would they also be aware of what was being
        shown to support that story?" "Yes” . Do you agree that? - A.
        Yes.
0. Lastly this, please, Mr. Kirton.   Can you help me. Can you
   give any explanation or assist us as to how John Motson or the
   BBC was’ able at 15.13 to say precisely the same story which
   was untrue, namely that fans had forced a gate and had rushed
   into the centre pens? - A. I have made enquiries.   I have
   spoken to him personally, and he was told by his producer.   I
   have spoken to the producer, who cannot remember where it came
   from.
                        Cross-Examined bv MR. GLASGOW:

q        Mr Kirton, you heard what Mr. Kelly said yesterday about the
         conversation in the control box with Mr. Duckenfield? - A.
         Yes.
Q        Do you confirm your recollection is the same as his, that you
         w e r e -behind him, and I think the words he used were that Mr.
         Mackrell was on the steps or coming up the steps? - A. I think
         he used the words, "Pushing up the rear” .

    0. Pushing up the rear? - A. That is my recollection, yes.

    o    Pe-haos we can just clarify this.   Although Mr. Mackrell will
         not i' think dispute anything you have said or that Mr. Kelly ...
         has said, it would not surprise you if he was unable to
                                                * 1/-i   ‘n 1

No, it would not surprise me.

Mr. Kirton, one other matter.  I should ask you this.  Did the
Police ever ssk the Football Association whether the game
should be postponed and the kick-off postponed? - A. No, they
did not.
And that was a matter which was of considerable concern to you
that that should be established, I think? — A. Yes.

You were, understandably, worried that it should be said or
thought by anybody that the FA had been asked for a
postponement and had not responded to it? - A. Yes.   The day
immediately following the match when we were in the Football
Association office there was a press call from the Sheffield
     or Telegraph, one of the two, in which the journalist
said that the Police had said that they had requested a delay,
and the Football Association had said No . I was at great
pains at that time to say that that had not been the case.

I think you again perfectly properly, wanted to speak to as
many people as you could to refresh your memory that there had
been no such incident, and that the FA had never been asked
for a postponement? - A. Yes, I spoke to Graham Kelly.  I
spoke to Ray Lewis and to, I believe, Ernest Brown, the
Chairman of the Challenge Cup Committee.
                                 i                •



If I can jog your memory a little further, I think you
telephoned Mr. Mackrell on the Monday morning? Do you recall
that7 ~ A. Yes, that is correct, I spoke to Mr. Mackrell.

'And one of the matters, apart from a courtesy that his family
 had looked after your child, which was a courtesy call, the
 Question of the rumour that you understood to be circulated,
 putting it c r u d e l y , against the FA, was worrying to you, and
 you mentioned it to him? - A. Yes, as I recall that
 conversation I said I could find nobody from the Football
 Association who was aware of any such request, and was he
 aware on behalf of the club of anybody having asked him or
 anybody from the Football Association.

  I think that almost precisely accords with his recollection,
' that you asked him to confirm that he was not aware of any
  request that had been made by the Police at all about a
  postponement? - A. Yes.

 Mr. Kirton, you appreciated that that was a very serious
 matter as far as both you and M r . Mackrell s club were
 concerned, and that both of you took this rumour at that stage
 very seriously? - A. Yes.
  And to get it in context, without wish i n g to mak e any. t rouble
  for the Police or a n y b o d y else, both you and he wanted it
  *'irmlv established that neither the F A nor the club had been
  c o n s u l t e d about postponement at all? - A . Yes. In nany cases
  when you ansver press queries you have to give an honest
  -■--s./-:         resoonse, and then you subsequently atter.pt to
                             67                                 6

                                                    G. KIRTON

     His statement continues, "Graham responded to the effect
     'Can we get them in? Are we to capacity?' and Mr. Lock
     responded that we were not".  Do you follow?   A. I do.

     You see, there is a similarity in the subject matter between
    * this conversation that Mr. Lock is speaking of and some
      of the things that you recall, a similarity in the view
      that people would be got in - do you follow?   A. Yes.

     This account   that Mr. Lock gives, could it be a part of
     the whole of   the conversation that you were having with
     Mr. Mackrell   discussing delaying the game?   A. No.   My
     recollection   is that the conversation was with Graham
     Mackrell and   Graham Mackrell alone.

     You went up to the control room eventually?      A. Yes.

q      When you did, you were accompanied   by Mr. Kelly and Mr.
      Mackrell? A.   That's correct.

O     Did you all get into the control room? A. To the best of
      my recollection we did, yes;  certainly Graham Kelly and
      mvself, and I believe Graham Mackrell was behind.

0     Did you know that by that time Mr. Mackrell   had been down
      to Gate C?   A. No, I did not.

Q. You speak of your attention feeing drawn to a television
   monitor?   A. Yes.

0     0* course, there is a bank of monitors there. Were they
     ’all running?   A. To the best of my recollection, they
      were all on, yes.

Q. I suppose you are not able to say what each of them showed?
   A. No.

 . m crt whatever it is, if he is going to delay the game
It w o u l d h av e been oat of the Bo, and d o ™ the tunnel to
the Directors' place and seen the F.A. people.

That seems entirely logical.             Were you aware of a policy
a b o u t d e T a y i n g kick-offs to this effect, that If there
was a particular reason such as a motorway blocKage or
foa for people to be late               it would be delayed, but
if they just turned up late it wouldn't? ~ A. Yes, I aia
aware of that, yes.
Now where are you aware of that from please? - A. Generally.
It was not from hearing anything in the box.   It was ijust
some thing I have known for some while but if tnere are
s oecific reasons, for example fog, road accidents on motor­
ways yes, you will delay it.   When the spectator is
unavoidably detained you would then delay it, yes.

 But if he is just late you don't? - A. That is correct
 sir.
 You are aware of that as a general policy, you say? - A.
 Yes sir.
 Actain a different matter.     Do you recall after the match
 hId been stopped that Hr. Kelly, who is the Chief Executive
 of the Football Association, came into the police Control
 tjq.j- v/ith another man? - A. I know someone came in.   Two
 people came in. I don't know Mr. Kelly or the other cnap
 obviously.      I know two people came in.

^ And they had a conversation with Hr. Duckenfield? - A. Uell
  I would assume so sir, yes.

 VJell you were there? “        A. I was there, yes.

  v;ere they asking what had happened? - A. I d o n ’t know.
’ A* this particular time obviously we wer$ very very busy
  so though I am aware that people are coming in and going
  from the box I am not aware of who they are talking to
  unless it is me personally or what they are saying.

     Tf vou are saying that you don't remember anything tnat
     was said between the two men and the Police Commencer

I am writing to request that you institute an immediate enquiry
into the propriety of the remarks passed yesterday by Police
Officers of the South Yorkshire Police Force about the conduct of
fans at the FA Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on Saturday last.

Given that the Home Secretary had announced the judicial enquiry
into the disaster the day before, and the solicitor for 30 of the
victims' families had begun proceedings against the Chief
Constable and his Force these remarks should never have been
made.

By what right did Police Officers make statements calculated to
be prejudicial to the reputation of Liverpool football club and
its supporters, and which seem to be part of a smokescreen of
propaganda aimed at diverting attention from the truth.

Lord Denning once said that "be they ever so mighty they are not
mightier than the law".  I trust that you will use your good
offices to examine how such statements came to be, and on whose
authority they were issued. Perhaps you would let me know what
guidlines exist.

What guidelines exist for the publication of statements once a
judicial enquiry has been announced.  I am copying this letter to
the Rt Hon Douglas Hurd MP .

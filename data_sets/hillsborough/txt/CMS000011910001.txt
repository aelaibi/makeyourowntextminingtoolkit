AMBULANCE SERVICE


What was the response of the ambulance service to the incident

         4" ®^-   A    <   ?   V   w   .            tV O V K   itc f   S t   JH   vk   a   y v O > jlo v v v t/   V P u ftw iff -

the ambulance service at 12 minutes past three. Tn .rnr]-inr|rni tn

lateir.       Within ± 5 * minutes a total of 2& ambulances had attended.

BACKGROUND


There is criticism of a slow and badly coordinated response by
the ambulance service in today's "Times" and elsewhere.                                                             These
criticisms will be matters for the inquiry to consider.

FIRE BRIGADE


W hat was the response of the fire brigade to the incid^nt


The brigade received the first call about the incident at 14
minutes past three.                        The first appliance reached the scene some
six minutes later and was quickly joined by five other appliances
together with support vehicles.                         A further four appliances were
called for and, in total, 65 fire brigades staff attended.

BACKGROUND


When the brigade arrived at the scene all rescues had taken
place.        Brigade staff used resuscitation equipment to treat
casualties - one set of resuscitation equipment is carried on
each appliance.                    Other brigade staff gave mouth to mouth
resuscitation and gave general assistance.
HOSPITAL SERVICE


What was the role of the hospital service, can further
i nformation be g iven about the number of h i n r i oc


As I said in ^ s t a t e m e n t ,   (94) people died in this tragic
incident and          people were injured.      The injured were taken to
Northern^General Hospital and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.             Of
these («=?) people were treated and discharged on the day.             -»»S0
were admitted /sf-^hom-f H has einoo-died.          The latest information
I have is that (    ) people are still in hospital of whom (             )
are critically ill.
Why perimeter fences?


I entirely understand the reaction of those who respond to these
distressing scenes by calling for the abolition of perimeter
fences.


We cannot take decisions on this without the most full and
careful review of the relevant factors.          That is why I have
announced such a thorough enquiry into these events and their
implications.     Safety is of the very highest concern.         But a
crucial factor is also the prevention and control of football
hooliganism.    We should not need any reminding of the tragedy
that can also befall football as a consequence of hooliganism.
Effective perimeter fences provide effective segregation, which
is an important consideration in preventing hooliganism.


These are all questions that must be examined fully, to see how
safety - including the prevention of hooliganism - can best be
dealt with.


Clubs with no perimeter fence


The decision as to whether a club must have a perimeter fence or
not rests with the local authority that issues the safety
certificate.


Background note


Some major clubs do not have perimeter fences, including Arsenal,
West Ham and Queens Park Rangers.       The Metropolitan Police
comment that as a consequence these London clubs require heavier
policing that others and experience more frequent interruptions
to play as fans spill onto the pitch.         We understand that most
clubs in the Scottish Premier Division do not have perimeter
fences.


Roy Hattersley MP, Joe Ashton MP and the engineering consultant
to Sheffield Wednesday all called for the abolition of perimeter
fences on news broadcasts on Sunday evening 16 April.

All seated grounds?


This is a matter the Inquiry to consider as it thinks fit.


If pressed I note the comments by Mr Graham Kelly of the FA last
night on television supporting a move towards greater use of
seating for spectators. This is a point he may wish to make to
the Inquiry in due course.

FA/HILLSBOROUGH

             telephoned. Were they sitting on Monday?
Adrian had not come back from Sheffield yet so I would ask
him and let Herbert Smith know because
         Articled clerk wanted to go back.

I received a bundle of documents he had sent to me today
enclosing transcripts and an index.

He thought that Kirton and Evans had been OK. There was
just one point with Kirton on being good friends with
McKrell. I asked whether there was any indication that
Evans had tripped up last year at the semi-final which was
causative in the decision to hold it at Hillsborough this
year.         phere was not, Evans had been fine.

Engaged 10 minutes including dictation

Dear Eric,
        Annual Inspection and Certificates as Required in the
        Conditions attached to the Certificate of Ground Safety
        I now have pleasure in enclosing two copies of my
certificate relating to the structural aspects of the ground.
        Also enclosed is a note of a few remaining points
requiring attention which were raised during the inspection by
the local authority representatives last April.   I consider
these to be maintenance items which can be dealt with in due courwe.
You have of course already seen to most of the items mentioned during
the visit.
        I have sent a copy of the Certificate directly to David
Vaughan, and have sent a copy of a report on the barrier testing
to Don Sherriff at the Town Hall.

                                  Yours sincerely,
                                                                        FILE

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.,              12 November 1980
Hillsborough,
Sheffield,
S6 1SW.

For the attention of Mr. E. England

Dear Mr. England.
            Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
         Thank you for sending me a copy of the letter from
South Yorkshire County Council dated 7 November 1980.
         In the letter Mr. Vaughan raises a number of points
and our comments are as follows s-

(a)     We did of course carry out ttee test of the emergency
        power supply and this is covered by Mr.
        certificate dated 11 August 1980.    The certificate
        is headed "Emergency Lighting Inspection and Test
        Certificate" which might have given the impression that
        only the lighting circuits etc. were tested but it will
         be seen that on sheet 2 w,e certified that the battery
         system is working properly.    It is not unreasonable
         that the batteries should have to be tested annually
         and subject to your approval we will do this.

(b)     I have not had any contact with the ' uilding Authority
        representatives other than the joint inspection which
        was made on 28 August.   During that inspection the
        various items of maintenance which were listed with my
certificate dated 11 September were discussed. The
Local Authority representatives also mentioned
possible rounding off of the steel cantilevering
to form the emergency exit from the West stand,
the possible hazard of the concrete step near the
top exit from Spion Kop and the possibility of
placing a rail in front of certain glass panels within
the South stand.   It will be recalled that we
indicated at the meeting .prior to the semi-final
in the spring that these three matters would be attended
to in due course (even though the fire officers
did not consider the rail in front of the glass Was
necessary). However we also indicated that in our
view these were such minor matters that they did not
need attention within the immediate future.    No
doubt the Club can give consideration to carrying tohem
out as part of the normal maintenance programme or
alternatively, of course,, we can include them
with any future works which are carried out under
our control for the Club.

I am a little at a loss to know what is meant by
this particular paragraph.   It is absolutely normal
for IEE certificates to be issued for periods
which may be as long as five years for completely new
installations.   Within our firm we carry out inspection
work in many types of building including, for example,
schools. Where the electrical installation ii
completely new it is standard practice for the certificate
to be valid for five years.   We have issued such a
certificate for the wiring of the South stand which has
been completely renewed under our control and also for
the emergency lighting which has been completely rewired.
In the case of the North and West stands, we have issued
a certificate for two years, this period being based
on the results of the test which we carried out
and the known age of the installation.
We would strongly resist any suggestion that the whole
of the electrical installation should be inspected
every year and I suggest that the South Yorkshire
County Council be asked whether that is their
intention or whether they merely wish to see a
further copy of our two year and five year certificates
in 1981.   Perhaps it is appropriate to point out
that because of the lengths of the various runs of
cable within the stadium .and because of the complexity
of the electrical system,, the checking of the North
and West stands plus the various outside circuits
which was carried out during the summer of 1980 cost
approximately £1000.    It would be less costly on
future occasions because the routing of the various
circuits has now been established and recorded but
nevertheless if the whole stadium had detailed ch«cks
every year it is likely that it would cost a four figure
sum.                      ,

This paragraph is merely reminding the Club of the
requirement that any proposed alterations must be
intimated to the County Council at least 21 days
before they are begun.

                         Yours sincerely,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

I thank you for the Certificates enclosed with' your letter dated
16th September.

Whilst these are generally acceptable for the purposes of the Conditions of
the General Safety Certificate, I would make the following points

(a)   paragraph 12(2) of the General Safety Certificate requires a certificate
       from an independent Electrical Engineer as to the condition of the
       Emergency Power Supply at least once in each period of twelve months;

(b)   certain additional points to those mentioned in the certificate required
       by paragraphs 24 and 25 have been taken up directly between the Building
       Authority and the Club's Consultants, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners;

(c)   paragraph 26 of the General Safety Certificate requires a certificate from
      an independent Electrical Engineer not less than once in each period of
      twelve months as to the electrical installation within the Stadium; and

(d)   paragraph 29 of the General Safety Certificate requires that the Stadium
       facilities and structures shall be maintained as existing at the date of
       the Certificate and that no alterations shall be made unless prior notice
       in writing is given to the County Council in accordance with paragraph
       5(2) (which requires at least 21 days written notice to the County
       Council before any proposal to carry out any alterations or extension
       of the Stadium or its installations is begun).

An additional copy of this letter is attached in case you should wish to pass
it to the Club's Consultants.

                                                Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,                              13 NOV 1980

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
Further to your letter of the 7th Noveober, all your
points are noted, and the additional copy of your letter
has been forwarded to Eastwood & Partners.
Under Paragraph 'd* can I point out what is happening
at the nonent at Hillsborough:~
   We are presently building showers and changing
   accomodation attached to the gyxanasiuB at the
   back of the North Stand. This din no way in*
   fringes on any part of the stadiura nor does
   it inpede or restrict any entrances or gang­
   ways. Planning permission etc. has all been
   granted by our local council.
   Our caterers in conjunction with ourselves are
   erecting a Chip Shop at the back of Spion Kop.
   Here again, planning permission etc. has been
   granted by our local council, and the work is
   out to tender.
   Our present disco unit is now being used as a
   police control rooa, and the area below it is
   being built in and made into a new disco unit.
South Yorkshire County Council           11th November 1980

  In the embryo stage we are considering extending our
  reception lounge, moving our kitchen area and building
  a new Directors' Room. This, of course, is all within
  our own domestic area, and in no way will it interfere
  with admission or exit of the public; and the Leppings
  Lane end of the car park under the South Stand which
  is an open area, this particular area along with the
  rooms which are behind it are being looked at with a
  view to constructing a social club.
If any further information is required, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Yours faithfully,




Secretary

For the attention of Mr. J. Strange

Dear Sirs,

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .
Replacement Crush Barrier Posts

We are in receipt of your letter dated 4th August 1980 and would make
the following observations and comments:

We, first of all, find it totally unfair to state that we were "taking
advantage of the situation".

We took the view at the time that the work would best be carried out on
a time and materials basis, in which case payment may have indeed
reflected a shorter duration than anticipated.

As explained to Mr. Strange, small works, as in this case, tend to be
out of scale with, say, constructing many more bases, purely by dis­
proportionate establishment costs, together with high charges for small
quantities of materials.   Mr. Strange also indicated that a similar
quotation from another contractor was fairly close to our own.

We trust you will also appreciate that the work was carried out by a
contractor already on site, working not more than 20 metres away from
the work.

We hope that the foregoing helps to clear any anomalies and that it
will not inhibit any future enquiries.

Yours faithfully,
for and on behalf of
Tarmac Construction Limited

Dear Eric,
                   New Barrier Posts on Splon *2E
      We have today forwarded certificates for the payment of
        and £       to Shaw Engineering (Sheffield) Ltd. and
Hallamshire Builders Ltd. respectively for the work done last Friday
and Saturday inserting the new barrier posts.   The originals are
enclosed. A copy of the certificates together with their invoices
will as usual be presented to you by Messrs. Shaw Engineering and
Hallamshire Builders.
       The total expenditure unfortunately exceeds the £     authorised
by Mr. Sheppard last week but we found ourselves paying a premium to
obtain services during the shutdown period and of course for overtime
working. This we felt was justified under the circumstances.
       We gave Tarmac Construction the first opportunity to do the
excavation and concreting, as is appropriate under the conditions of
contract.    They quoted £j   . A second tender was obtained from
Hallworth Builders Ltd. of £        Both were rejected.
       We were looking for a figure in the region of £   '- e|   and
we were pleased to obtain the tender of £     from Hallamshire Builders
Ltd. This we consider was a fair rate bearing in mind the short time
scale.    The posts were concreted last Saturday very efficiently, thus
giving time for the concrete to harden before the game
       As indicated in our telephone conversation today I will visit
the ground to make an inspection on Friday afternoon prior to
issuing a certificate.
                                                Yours sincerely,
                                                   W E/JA S/P M /2419

Dear Mr
          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.,
          New Barrier Posts on Spion Kop
     Thank you for the prompt and efficient action taken to provide
the new barrier posts last week. This was much appreciated both by
our client and ourselves. The workmanship was again to your usual
high standard.
     We therefore have pleasure in enclosing a copy of our certificate
in the agreed sum of £which should be presented     together with
your statement for the same amount to Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club Ltd.
     Because the posts, clips and angles are new we consider that
the appropriate rate of V.A.T. is zero.
     Once again, thank you for your help.




                          Yours sincerely,

     Dear Sirs,

                                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Lt d .
                                                     Replacing Crush Barrier Posts

                     Thank you for meeting John Strange last week at such short
     notice.                 As discussed over the telephone we were not able to
     recommend the acceptance of your price for the work.
                     We thought that the figure quoted was far too high and that
     you may possibly have been taking advantage of the situation.
     You will be interested to know that the holes were excavated
      last Friday, and the new posts concreted in on Saturday morning.
     The work was successfully carried out by Hallamshire Builders
     Ltd. for a cost of less than £ | L


                                                                                  Yours faithfully.

Dear Sirs,
             Sheffield Wednesday Footbill Club Ltd.
              Remedial Work to Existing Barriers
     Thank you for meeting John Strange yesterday at such
short notice. We write to confirm,on behalf of Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club Ltd., the acceptance of your fixed
price of £365 for the work discussed.
     The work involves the installation of five posts type
B and two posts type A (as our drawing 1610/14B) together
with two clips and two base angles.
     We have not yet agreed a price with Tarmac for their
foundation work. In fact it may be another contractor who
does the work, but we propose thatyou be paid directly by
our client for the steelwork.
     Meanwhile please proceed   with all speed.

                                    Yours faithfully,

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan



Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                    Safety of Sports Grounds 7ict - 1975
     I have now been able to talk with Mr. Clough regarding
the exit signs and have pleasure in replying to your points
ii, iii and iv.


Para ii
     I find the exit signs were erected under the supervision
of John Strange who is still- on holiday.      I have quickly
looked through the certificate of ground safety and have not
been able to find any reference to lettering size.         Because
you do not say which exit signs have not been sited in
accordance with the plans xt is a little difficult for me to
comment and I suggest this matter be left in abeyance until
John Strange returns.      With regard to the illumination of the
exit signs, it may be that you are unaware that we are rewiring
the South Stand and it may be that the signs you have in mind
will be appropriately illuminated by both systems when this
work is complete.
Para ill
     We have not been able to understand what it is
which you say does not comply with the requirements
of paragraph 12 of the certificate.     The agreement
with the Fire Service (Mr. K. Jones) was set out in our
letter of 12 December.   So far as we can see the only
possible variation from that agreement is thfet because
of the rewiring which is now taking place we did not
implement     agreed measures in the case of the two exits
referred to in the fourth paragraph of our letter of 12
December.


Para iv
     The fire warning system is conplete except for the
supply of the trickle charger and battery equipment.      These
items were ordered some months ago and if the original
delivery dates had been adhered to would have been installed
by now.   Unfortunately the suppliers have failed to
deliver on time.   We have been applying appropriate pressure
and the latest information is as set out in the attached
copy letter from our electrical contractors which was dated
24 March.   As you will see from this, two of the four
outstanding items have very likely been delivered by now
but the signal Indicator panel was not expected for four
weeks from 24 March and the industrial batteries complete
with steel stand and ancillary equipment was due to be
delivered by Friday, 25 April.


     I understand that there is to be a meeting at the ground
on Thursday, 10 April, when these can no doubt be discussed.


                                 Yours sincerely,

Barnsley.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
               Safety of Sports Grounds Act
      Mr. England has sent me a copy of your letter of 31
 March and of his reply dated 3 April.
      I am in a little difficulty in replying to some of the
 points raised as Mr.        is on holiday until Tuesday, 8
 April, and Mr. Strange is away until Monday, 14 April.
 Because we are carrying out re-wiring in the South Stand
 and Mr. Clough is better equipped to deal with the comments on
 the Exit signs I will delay replying until he returns.
      With regard to the comments from the Building Control
 department I may need to reply in greater detail when John
 Strange returns from holiday.   However, my first comments
 are as follows :-
(XI The cracks between the door frames and supporting wall
      will be re-inspected. I can only assume that this is
      something which was not noticed in the inspection which
      we made and the inspections which were made by the
      Building Control department at the end of the work.    It
      may be that due to shrinkage of the timber a slight
      gap has opened since that time.    We will, of course, have
    the cracks mortared or covered if this is needed, but
    might I suggest that minor matters of this kind do not
    need a letter or need to be dealt with between the
    periodic inspections which you and we will be carrying
    out.   After all the next inspection is less than three
    months away.

iii) I have not been able to discuss the paint used on the
    south stand partitions with the Contractor, who is
    closed down until 14 April.    However, one of my assistants
    believes that Mr. i         has recently told Mr. Strange
    that Mr. Mills saw a painter with a tin of Dulux instead
    of the Nullifire which we specified. It would have been
    appreciated if a telephone call had been made at the time
    so that we could have checked with certainty and if
    necessary taken corrective action. I will write to you
    again on this point.

(iil) Mr. Strange mentioned that Mr.          had queries in a
      recent telephone conversation whether wired glass has been
      used where appropriate.   Mr. Strange said that so far
      as we know wired glass had been used everywhere that the
      fire officer had requested it, and that the fire officer
      had of course, made his awn inspection.   The conversation
      had ended with Mr. Cherriff saying that he would check with
      the fire officer.

(iv) We presume that the reference to 'clearance' refers to
     the vertical headroom. It will be recalled that some
     ingenuity was needed to devise this particular exit, as
     we were constrained by the levels in the existing stand
     and the level of the top of the terracing and the exit
     route.   Our drawings and calculations were submitted to
       the Building Control department for comment. They
       inspected during construction and after the work was
       completed.   I am not amused by the fact that the
       headroom is now being queried.   In any case this is
       a matter for the fire officer, not the Building Control
       department.   With regard to the sharp edges I suggest
       we leave the matter until the inspection in June/July
       as the season is now almost over, and there is no
       time to agree further work and have it carried out before
       the season ends.

 (v)   Hie perimeter fencing at the north-east comer of the
       Spion Kop has been appraised for condition and strength.
       Bearing in mind the likely pressures at that location,
       the tests which we carried out where oossible, and that
       we are dealing with an existing ground, the fence is
       satisfactory in my opinion.

 (vi) We will look at the step obstruction, but again unless
      this is something which is obviously dangerous (in
      which case X would have expected the matter to be raised
      last December) suggest that discussinn be left until the
      June/July inspection.

 (vii) The mesh fencing under the North stand was discussed
       with Mr, Jones of the fire service and he, like me, was
       satisfied that there is no hazard which justifies the
       making of changes.       ,    '

      I will writ© to you again after Mr. Clough returns from
 holiday.

Dear Mr. Mallett,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Further to your letter of the 31st March, my Chairman
is away for another three or four weeks; so you will
appreciate that I cannot give you Board decisions or
opinions. My personal reaction is surprise, as under
the above act work has been going on continuously since
it was started last summer and at no time do X feel
that the Club have lagged behind in its actions to do
everything that has been promised to be done.
To take Item 4 of your letter - this is very much in
the progress, and we are in the hands of the contractors.
As regards the training of safety stewards, this was being
left until the warning system was installed. However, on
receipt of your letter I did contact Mr. Vaughan and
suggested that if he would like to contact the County
Fire Service, all our stewards would be at the ground
for our match on Haster Monday, and that might be an
opportunity to deal with this particular item. The
officers of the Fire Service had intimated to me
previously that any time would be suitable to them.

All your other items under Paragraphs 2 & 3 willbe
dealt with, and in fact a copy of your letter 1 have
sent to Dr. Eastwood for his professional advice
Yours sincerely,




Secretary.

     D ear Sir,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

     The County Council is disturbed to find that, following recent visits by the disciplines
     represented on the Officer Working Party, there are still outstanding at the Hillsborough
     Stadium various m atters which it was required Or agreed would receive attention*

     F o r instance, the Chief F ire Officer informs me that:-

     (i)       Whilst the County F ire Service offered assistance in the training of safety
               stew ards as to th eir actions in an emergency (as required by Paragraph 9
if             of Schedule 2 of the General Safety Certificate), to the best of my knowledge
             : no steps have been taken in this direction;

     (ii)    Contrary to Paragraph 11 of Schedule 2, some exit signs having inadequate
             lettering size have been provided and sited otherwise than in accordance with
             the certificate {dans, whilst the exit signs at the re a r of the South Stand
             are not illuminated by both the norm al and emergency lighting;

     (iii)    The emergency lighting provisions in the South Stand and the gangways
              leading from it do not comply with the requirem ents of Paragraph 12 of the
              Certificate, as amended by my le tte r of 21st December, 1979;

     (iv)     No fire warning system has yet been provided to satisfy the requirem ents of
              Paragraph 13 of Schedule 2.

     The Building Authority had advised the Club's Consultants, M essrs. Eastwood and
     P a rtn ers, that the following m atters require attention

              The fire resisting door fram es to be sealed against the supporting walls;




                                                                  “1

     Secretary,                                                           /m

Mr. E. England                                                    Slst March, 1980




(ii)    Confirmation that fire retardent paint has been used on the partitions within
        the South Stand;

(Lii)   Whether wired glass has been used where appropriate on the partitions
        within the South Stand fo r fire and/or safely purposes;

(iv)    Whether the new s ta ir construction at the South-West Stand has adequate
        clearance, with the sharp edges to the steelwork being removed and
        consideration being given to providing a tim ber fascia;

(v)     The p erim eter fencing a t the N orth-East co rner of the Spion Kop to be
        appraised for condition and strength;

(vi)    The upper exit a re a on the Spion Kop to be checked fo r step obstruction;

(vii)   The mesh fencing under the North Stand to be assessed for strength and
        potential hazard to crowd serg es.

The County Council is naturally concerned in the legal sense that some of the conditions
attached to the Safely Certificate are apparently not being satisfied, but equally in a
practical sense it has in mind that the m ajority of spectators who will be attending
the F .A . Cup Sem i-Final on 12th April will not be fam iliar with either the lay-out
o r facilities at the Stadium.

It may well be that the d u b has given attention to the points mentioned in the la st
few days, bat perhaps you will le t me have your comments as a m atter of urgency.

                                                   Yours faithfully,

              Dear Sir,
              Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
              Following approval by the County Council and clarification of certain
              structural aspects of the South Stand construction, I am now able to formally
              issue the attached General Safety Certificate in respect of the Hillsborough
              Stadium.
              As previously mentioned to you, the fee payable has yet to be determined by
              the County Council and I will, of course, contact you further on this point
              as soon as possible.
              I would particularly draw your attention to the following paragraphs of
              Schedule 2 of the Certificate
              8(1) - the existing First Aid facilities are accepted on an interim basis
                     only pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980
                     close season;
              12(1) - the arrangements for Emergency Lighting in the South Stand (as set
                       out in the letter frcm Messrs. Eastwood & Partners to the South
                       Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 12th December, 1979) are
                       regarded as acceptable only for the duration of the existing
                       battery life;

              14   - the existing Police facilities are accepted on an interim basis only
                      pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980 dose
                      season;

              30   - use of the Stadium in excessively high wind conditions
                                           and
                   - use of the Stadium in excessively high snowfall conditions.
              Perhaps you would also treat this letter as the formal notice of issue required
              by Paragraph 7 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976.

Should you have any queries on the Certificate, Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff
will be happy to discuss them with you.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity of recording the County Council's
appreciation of the co-operation and goodwill which the Club and its Consultants
has extended to the Officer Vforking Party over the months of the necessarily
involved detailed investigations.

                                        Yours faithfully,

P.S. Whilst it may be stating the obvious, the issue of the Certificate is
     of course, conditional on payment of such fee as may be determined by
     the County Council.

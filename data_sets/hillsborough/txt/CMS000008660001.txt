Dear Sir

RE;   THE TAYLOR REPORT

According to my newspaper, you "poured scorn on Mr Hattersley's critisism
of the proposal for mandatory seating at grounds", you accused him of "Trivialising"
the report and of "demeaning" himself with "wholly irresponsible and stupid
remarks" in the House of Commons on 29th January.

I do not often find myself in agreement with Mr Hattersiey but on this
particular issue I am.  If you really think that the perfectly reasonable
case put forward by him against all seating stadiums deserves such
intemperate comments from yourself then perhaps it is time for me to consider
withdrawing the support which your party has had from me for the last
three general elections (which cover my entire adult life).

Since when has the conservative party been in the business of accepting
lock, stock and barrel recommendations of this kind?.

I find your attitude to football fans and your determination to override
their wishes .disgusting.

Yours faithfully

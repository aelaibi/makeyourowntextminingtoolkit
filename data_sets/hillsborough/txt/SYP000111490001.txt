was    impossible                    to    do a n y t h i n g a b o u t                the     fan due       to        the    enormous

surging         and       I was          fearful          at       that       time       and        fans     around          me    also

appeared            in a s i m i l a r             frame       of m i n d          to    myself.             We     had      to    fight           our

way    through            the       crowd          in o r d e r         to    return           to    our     s erial.             Several           tim e s

backwards            by       the       crowd and           I had            to    push        her    forwards               to h o l d       her       in

an    upright          position.                   I was       relieved                when     we    eventually               reached             our.

].' t h e n    became          part        of      the    barrier             again          between         the       two     opposing

groups         and     crowds            of     pet) pie w e r e             crushed           up a g a i n s t        us b o t h        on    the

Whilst         in this          position              around 2.30pm                     a man        on the N o t t s .            Forest           side

Liverpool            s ide           of    the       b arrier an d laid                      him     down      at      the    b ack of         the

round after               a    short          t ime      a n d we        cleared a space                     for       h i m at         the    back

and    sat      him       dow n.          His       name       was            Chris          f r o m N o t t i n g h a m he r e m a i n e d

there         for    a while             then       1 do       not            know       w h e r e he went.

AT 3.04pm            I saw          a     large       number            of    f ans      spilling            o nto      the       pitch        from

the L e p p i n g s           Lane       stand        and      I    thought             there        h ad    been an           invasion             of

the    pitch.             I    continued              to w a t c h           for       several        minutes.               The        mood       of    the

fans     still         crushed against                      me      and       other          officers            appeared          to     be a

little         frightened                by     the      crush          t hat      they        were     still          in.        I did        not
        know what           was    happening                at     the     other         side       of    the       ground        and       after

        several         minutes         I heard             something              about       fatalities                in the        g ro u n d ,      I

        was      then      directed          by my S e r g e a n t             to'escort'a                group          of L i v e r p o o l      f ans

        in our       section           out     of      the       g r o u n d as         they       wished       to       leave.         This       I did

        together           with    other          officers            again         including             PC    Bellemy.               We    escorted

        them      through         the      Notts.           Forest         fans         to    the       middle       entrance            into      the       -

        Kop      where      we    parted          company with                 them.           The       journey          through           the    crowd

        this      t im e    did     n ot     appear           as    when       I last          made       my w a y        through           the    fans,

        there      w a s n ’t as        much        of a         crush,        once          you    had       cleared           the    section

        where      our      barrier          was.

        On    reaching           the    middle             entrance           to t h e        Kop myself             a n d PC B e l l e m y           were

        a Doctor           and    wanted          to       help     on     the      pitch          c o u l d we      get        him    down

        there.          Myself         and     PC      Bellemy           escorted             him       out    of    the        stand and          down

        onto      the      pitch       during          t his       journey          I recall             seeing          several         drunken

        fans      towards         the      back        of     the     Hop      and       at    the       back       of    the     turnstiles.

        We    took      the      Doctor        down         to     the     pitch         together             with       his     father

        entering           onto    the       pitch          by     through          the       entrance          between           the       Kop and

        and      I saw      numerous           people            being        carried          past       me    on       bill     boards          some

                                                          Woodseats Police Station,
                                                          Sheffield.


Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at Woodseats Police Station at 8.^5 a.m. that
day together with numerous other Officers from my Station. We were transported to
the Hillsborough Football Ground, where following a briefing I then formed part of
unit serial number 8 under the command of Police Sargeant 1203 Marples and Insp Calvert.
At 11.15 a.m. that day I commenced duties on the Bpion Kop Stand at this time our duties
were to form a barrier between the majority of Nottingham Forest fans in the stand and
a small section reserved for Liverpool fans. I remained in this position till 2.10 p.m.
when I had cause to arrest a Nottingham Forest fan one|                 ^ who was arrested
by me for being drunk in a designated sports ground. At the time I was accompanied by
P.C. 411 Bellemy and other Officers who also had cause to arrest several other fans for
the same offence.             together with myself and P.C. Bellemy was taken to the Police
Room where he was photographed and processed then detained in mobile cell unit.
I th®prepared the file forI           H   "he mood of the fans in my section of the ground
at the time of the arrest was jovial but no trouble though several near me smelled of
Intoxicants.
Following the process of|            |l returned to my position on the Kop Stand and
rejoined my serial. On the return through the crowd in the Kop 1 had cause to remote a
can of beer from one fan though it was impossible to do anything about the fan due to
the enormous amount of people in the stand and the crush that we were in, the beer being
merely removed from his hand and poured away. Several times, during this journey through
the crowd in the stand my self and P.C. Bellemy who was still with me were forced backwards
by the crowd surging and I was fearful at that time and fans around me also appeared in
a similar frame of mind to myself. We had to fight our way through the crowd in order to
return to our serial, several times during the journey a young girl who was infront of
me was forced backwards by the crowd and I had to push her forwards to hold her in a
upright position. I was releived when we eventually reached our serial which was now
virtually cut off from other Officers in the ground and as far as I could see were the
only Officers in the Kop.
I then became part of the barrier again between the two apposing groups and crowds of
people were crushed up against us both on the Liverpool side and the Nottingham Forest
 aide of the human barrier. Whilst in this position around 2.50 p.m. a man on the
Notts Forest side of the barrier fainted due to the crush and I pulled him to the
Liverpool side of the barrier and laid him down at the back of the Liverpool section
 and together with P.C Bellemy we aided him. He came round after a short time and we cleare
 a space for him at the back and sat him down. his name was            rom Nottingham he
 remained ther for a while then I do not Know where he went.
 At 3 . 0 k p.m. I saw a large number of fans spilling onto the pitch from the Leppings Lane
 stand and I thought there had been an invasion of the pitch I continued to watch for
                                                                                             y'/

 Several minutes* he mood of the fans fetill crushed against me and other Officers appeared
 to be a little frightened by the crush that they were still in# I did not know what was
 happening at the other side of the ground and after several minutes I heard something about
 fatalities in the ground. I was then directed by my Sargeant to escort a group of Liverpool
 fans in our section out of the ground as they wished to leave. This I did together with
 other Officers again including PC Bellemy. We escorted than through the Notts Forest fans
 to the middle entrance into the Kop where we parted company with them. The journey through
 the crowd this time did not appear as when I last made my way through the fans, there wasn’S
 as much of a crush, once you had cleared the section where our barrier was.
 On reaching the miidle entrance to the Kop myself and PC Bellemy were approached by a
 young man and his father, the younger man     said he was a Doctor and wanted to help on the
 pitch could we get him down there. Myselfand P.C. Bellem escorted him out of the ptand and
 down onto the pitch during this journey I recall seeing several drunken fans towards the
 back of the Kop and at the back of the turnstiles.
 d e took the Doctor down to the pitch together with his father entering onto the pitch by

 through the entrance between the Kop and the North Stand. At this location we parted company
 with the Doctor and I saw numerous people being carried past me on bill boards some of which
 were injured and several of which appeared dead, the only dead person I recall was a large
 fat male with a orange T shirt pulled over his face, I did see other people that appeared
 dead but I cannot recall what they looked like. The people were being carried by both fans
 and Police Officers, the scene was chaotic and I felt horrified at what I was seeing.
 I tried to comfort some distraught fans that were near me they were upset though they did
 smell of drink I can definitely say that. I then walked onto the pitch and saw numerous
 injured people with various people tending to them. Together with P.C Bellemy I went to
 another fern, who v/as lying on the floor with people round him he appeared dedd we were about
 to try resusitation on him when a man -'ho    said he was a Doctor came    and hetended tothe
 fan, the fan v^as about thirty stocky build   with jeans on.
 I then saw fans running down the pitch from the direction of the Leppings Lane stand and
 we were ordered by either a Insp or Chief Insp to form a line across the pitch to prevent
 disorder which we did. I remained in this position till the first tannoy message to clear the
 the ground which was about ^fO minutes on the pitch the scene was still chaotic, during this
 time numerous Liverpool fans were abusive towards us and a lot were drunk, some still
appeared to want to fight I just couldn’t believe their actions.
The cordon sort of moved backwards and forwards several times with lots of people shouting
 orders, in my opinion we look unproffesional.
 I saw Cheif Superintendent Nesbit whilst on the pitch this was after quite some time and
he appeared to take some control over the situation.
Fans started to clear the ground and the flow of casulties which had been coming past me
had now almsst ceased, and together with other Officers I was ordered onto Penistone Road
opposite the Gym Entrance and I remained in this position for about 30 minutes I then saw
PS Marples and I rejoined my serial, which was now depleted outside the Gym we were then
ordered onto Transit patrol by a senior officer and we went on patrol and parked up in the
 Transit on Mifldlewood Hoad.
After some time we were stood clo'-n an;1 returned to the ground’ ’/hero v/e were 'stood do n. b

           I am a single man and live at the above address with my parents.                  I am

           employed by                                             Liverpool and have been

           employe^l by them since July 1983.

           On Saturda> 15th April     1989 I went to the             up Semi Final match at

           Hillsborough between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                I am a

           Liverpool   supporter.

              on my behalf by                      and I paid £7 for the Leppings Lane

              standing area, Liverpool area          (marked LL'1) this was about a week

             before the match.

             We left Liverpool at about           10.30am and went straight to Sheffield

             without stopping.          We had no real delays only a couple of slight

             ones on the M62. As far as           I know there was no drinking of alcohol        on

             the coach.

             We arrived in Sheffield at some time between 1pm x 1.15pm.               The coach

             was   parked in a side road near the ground althougnSL d o n ’t know the

             name it was the sanie\road we parked in last year as I attended the

             co r r es pondi ng match last* year,

             From there we walked straight to the ground. We received no specific

             Police directions or escort to the ground.            We just wandered to the

             ground in a group, we knew where to go having been there               last year.

             Whilst walking to the ground I saw no disorder,             fighting or drunkeness

             in fact     I d o n ’t remember seeing anyone drinking alcohol

         I   5^r    6 Police Officers on duty at our turnstiles they were
    L--U     searchrng people on the way into arid out of the turnstile.

             I was only searched havingsJgot through the turnstile and handing my

             ticket    in.

             The Policing was quite different at this            point f rfom th\ previous year,

             last year it all          ran alot Smoother around the t ur nst il es \ there were

             certainly more officers on duvy^ a r o und the turnstiles.

             I did not receive any steward direction at this point of the ground

             either this year or last year.

             I had no difficulty in finding the turnstile we simply went with the
                                                                                            PAGE

            flow of people.       I did not see any of the large steel gates open at

            this time nor did I see them being opened at any time.                I did not

            witness any unauthorised entryXto the ground.

                    inside the ground I did not s & ^ a n y signs directing us where to

            go either visible or from stewards. We went to the same place as                    last

            year.

            I cannot honestly remember using the tunnel               to the standing area,

            and cannot    remember any further police or steward directions from this

            point on.

            It was about       1.45pm when I took^up niy match viewing         position.   This was
^   4   -
            in Pen 4 I went to the terraces wrth

                                   went    to another    part of the ground.

            At this time there was         no trouble,    in the terraces at    all,   and at    this

            time the crowding was moderate and we were able to stand almost

            directly behind the goals and about 6'~ 10* away from the fence                    in a

            position that our eye         level was     level with the pitch.

            After about 5 - IQmins                       suggested that we move back       abit

            to get a better view.         So we went back up the terracing to get a better

            view and stood behind a crash barrier.

            At no point did I see anybody drinking alcohol               in the ground.

            At about 2.45wn I first began to notice that the crowd had got

            e x c e s s i v e l y crushed so much so that I could hardly move my arms,

            Once the Liverpool       players    came onto the pitch the crush really

            started to get bad.       I began to be pushed slowly towards the barrier                  in

            front of me. This was when I first noticed people being passed forward

            over our heads,      towards the pitch.        I d o n ’t know whether they were

            simply collapsed or dead.           \                                          \

            By kick off I was right up against the barrier by this time and K w a s

            beginning to be crushed up against             it.   I noticed in front that    people-?

            had climbed and were       climbing over the f enci ng\j>nto the pitch.

             Somehow,    and I'm still not sure how I managed to get round the barrier
         «
             and I then had fairly free passage to the front of the pen and

             started to clirnb the fencing to get out.         I was then approached by a

             Police officer,    he said,    " I ’m sorry lad you c a n ’t do that."

             I said,    " What do you expect me to do" He said,         "Either stand your

             ground or go back." So I stood my ground. The Police officer then went

0 \ T               so 1 'then noticed a gate    in the fence open to my left and I went
cmns,        through that onto the pitch where there were            large numbers of people

             As a result of the crusty* I recieved bruising around my midriff at the

             front,

             On the pitch I managed to meet up again with                               who I ’d

             been seperated from for a short while.

             We kept well out o K the way and infact after a few minutes we went

             back    into the terracing    in Pen 6.

             I feel that the ambulance service took too long to turn up but that                     is

             about the only comment       I ’d like to make about the way the incident

             was handled. The only point        I felt that should be made to the        inquiry

             is that the ticket allocation was wrong for this match,             with

             Liverpool    being given the smaller end.

             We left the ground at about 4.55pm of our own accord.             At no         time did

             witness anything    I consider to be a        criminal    offence. I cannot

             remember anything about the officer who spoke to me,

             One other comment    I ’d like to ntskke      is that    initially there        d i d n ’t

             seem to be enough Police officers onxluty to deal with the incident,

             But, at one point some Liverpool          fans went towards the Nottingham fans

             who out of ignorance of what was happening were jeering us, at this

             point a large number of officers          carne out onto the pitch and lined

             themselves up across the width of the halfway line, what             I ’d like to

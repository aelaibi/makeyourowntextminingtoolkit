D ear Mr Spearritt

I undertook to write to you following our telephone conversation on Tuesday.

I inform ed you that, regrettably, we were unable to provide copies o f further correspondence from Mr
W ardrope until we had received his consent to disclosure.

I indicated that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith would have considered the hospital records in reaching the
conclusions set out in his scrutiny report, including his comments relating to you at page 45 o f the report. I
understand these to be the same hospital records to which you have previously been given access. I am not
aware that any additional records exist.

In his report, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says that he was ‘unable to ascertain w hat time you reached the
hospital, though according to Mr W ardrope it was before 5pm’. I believe this statem ent was based on the
N ursing Record which apparently showed admission to CITU at 17.00, which suggests that you would have
passed through Accident & Emergency by that time - although there is no way o f knowing when exactly. I
am sorry that I cannot clarify this any further at present.

                                        Yours sincerely




                                        M J Pyne

c rowded          particularly                 the       entrance          off     Leppings          Lane           to      the

turnstiles.                   We    looked          for       the    signs       for     which       entrance               we      were        to go

into.            Th e    entrance             was    Leppings           Lane       standing          Section 8 which were

th e    six       or     seven        turnstiles               to    the /fight          side       of    the        entrances               to      the

ground.           There        was       no    o r d e r l y -q^ue/e a n d          people          were        just        crushed             in a

large        m a ss      in f r o n t         of    the       turnsvij.es for             Section             8.     There          seemed           to

be     no    o r g a n i s a t i o n of            queues       by P o l i c e      or S t e w a r d s          to       control           the

flow        of    people           into /the t u r n s t i l e s .            All      I could           see        were       about         three

mounted           Pol i c e m e ft             amongst          the     crowd       by    the       wrought              iron       gates.            We

joined           the     crowd        going\into               the     turnstiles.

As we        were        in the          crowd       it w as         obvious        that       it wa s          very        tightly             packed

around           the     turnstiles                and    p eo p l e   were        getting          pushed           and       shoved.            The

Police           seemed        to     be      having          difficulty           controlling                 the       crowd and              I s aw

a mounted Policeman                           just       b e h i n d me     move       into     the       crowd          just         backing

i nto       people        knocking             them       backwards           or    sidewards.                  This        obviously

made        people        very       angry          as    it s e e m e d      to    serve       no       purpose            and       merely

moved        people           out     of      the    horses          way.     Some       people          did        shout        at      the

Policeman               however          there       was       no    show     of    aggression                or     violent

themselves.                   In f ac t        under          the    circumstances              I would              say       th at       the

At     a p p r o x i m a t e l y ,2.50 - 2 , 5 5 p m                I managed             to    reach         the      turnstiles             and

At     approximately                2,50       - 2.55pm             I managed             to    reach         the      turnstiles             and

go t    through          into       the       open       a re a .      Just     behind          the       turnstiles              between

them       and     the      s ta n d .        I wai te d a             fe w    seconds          for      my     f r i en d a n d        t h e n we

walked       away        from       the       turnstiles               towards        the       only         visible         entrance

into       the     standing           area.

This       turned        out     to      be    the       tunnel         entrance           into         the     two        centre

standing           sections           of      the     Leppings           Lane        end       stand.           As/we        walked

towards          the     tunne 1 I looked                    to m y       right       aririr s a w        t H y concertina               g at e

outside          towards         the       turnstile              area)        opened.             The       g at e    was    opened

fully       by     1 think          a Steward              a n d a P o l i c e m a n but                I ’m not           sure    excactly

who     opened         t h e m as        then       quite         a number           of    people            came      in t h r o u g h       the

open       gate.         I remember                saying         to my        friend          something              like    " W e ’ve       just

queued        up the re a n d              now      they've            let     them       i n. "        We    then w a l k e d          through

the     tunnel         and     straight             on     to     go    to     the    terraces.                 I did        not       look

back       round       to     the     open         gate      t h e n , so       I cannot             sa y     how      long       it    stayed

ptn a n d    I saw          the     players           warming             up.         I could            see      that      t h is     section

was      very     full        but      under        the w e i g h t            of     people         after         a minute            or    two we

managed          to j_et f o r w a r d          to      the      front          of       this       section.             At    this         point

the      g ou nd was           packed         and     it w a s        difficult                to m o v e.         Within         a minute              of

being       in t h is         position           I f e lt        myself             being       pinned            against         the       crash

being       G7.        I was        pushed          very        tightly             against          the       barrier         on m y        hips

and      groin area.                The       normal        height             of a       barrier            would       probably            be

about       stomach           height,          bu t     with         the       pressure             of    people         b e h i n d me

bar re r but           I couldn't              move        at    all.           I could             h ea r     people         shouting               "Get

serious          problem          as    I have          b e e n at         a    lot       of    big       games        at     Anfield            and

all      over     the        country,          people           were       screaming                and      in u s i n g      a ll     my

became       very          frightened.                I saw          people           c l i m b i ng      over       the      fra/it        fences

s i t u at i o n .         I was       now     getting           more       and          more       crushed against                   the

barrier.          I shouted             to                      to    tr y a n d          he 1 p me          but    he      just      c o u l d n ’t

move      me.         My    head       was     bent        downwards                towards          the       floor        I couldn't                see

I concentrated                   on m y       breathing              and       I ’m      convinced             that      this        s t o p p e d me

from      passing           out.        At     t hi s      time       1 lost             sight       of m y        f ri e n d .      I didn't

see      anything           of    the     game        since          the w a r m          up.        I just         heard         the

occasional             roar       of    the     crowd.

                                                                                                                                               S65

Gradually             the       pressure              of    the      crowd          eased         off      a    little        because          I

could move             myself           a       little.             This       was       probably              sometime           after       the

game     had      stopped.             People              must      have         go t      out     of     the       pe n    either       at       the

front       or    side          because           I was          able        to     stand         up     properly.                I then       saw a

pile     of      people          heaped           on       top      of    each         other        probably about                  f o ur     or

five     deep where                  they        had       obviously              fallen and               had       been     crushed.               This

was    just       to m y         r ight          at    the       front         of      the       section            below     the       fencing.

I saw       st rai ght           away           that       s om e    people            at    the       bottom          had a l r e a d y       turned

a    blue     and      white          colour           and       their         lips         were       purple.              One    man    ha d

vomit       coming             from     his       mouth.

I made        my way a               few y ar ds            to      t hi s     pile         of    pe ople,             I took       ho 1 d of a

man who          was       at    the        top       of    the      pile,          under         his      arms       and     pul 1 ed        hi m

free     with         the a i d         of a n o t h e r            man.          We     saw      t h at       he    seemed        alright           so    I

passed        him      u n d e r the             crash        bar r i e r .            We    pulled a second                      man    from        the

pile,       he a p p e a r e d          to       be    in his            mid      twentys,             other         than     that       I cant

describe          h i m at           all.        He    also         seemed          to      be    okay.

One    man       we    pulled           out       was       possibly              dead       I think            he     had a grey             or     grey

and white             top.

It w a s      no w     t h at        the P o l i c e f i n a l l y                came       into        the        pen t h r o u g h     the        ga te

at    the     front            fence        and       they       took        charge          and       did w h a t          they    could          to

h elp.      After          a    couple bf              minutes            I was          helped          up a n d       went       through           the

open     gate         at       the    front\/ence.                       I saw         that       the m e s h          fencing          had    been

partly        r ipped.           I would              think         to a l 1 ow          people          to     get     out       I was       quite

dazed       and       had       be come         separated                from my            friend

Four     of      Five          other        supporters               and myself                  used an a d v e r t i s i n g            hoarding

to    c a r r y an         injured              person       across            the       pi tc h .         I then went              back       to the

terracing             and       found                            I then           found          the     rest        of m y       friends          in

the    Cantilever                North          Stand.              I eventually                  l eft        the    ground with              my

f riends         just          after        4    pm.        We      left       the       g round         through            the    t u n n e 1 unde r

the    North          West       Upper          Terrace             by    the       refreshment                 bars.

             I cant         assist          with      identifying               the     deceased.                   I was      so    shocked          that       1

             c a nt    remember.

             I can         honestly          say      that      at    no     stage         of       developments               were

             there         any    signs        of     drunkeness            or       aggression                or   violent          behaviour          by a n y

             of     th e    Liverpool           Supporters              that         I saw          in or       around         the       ground.        In

             fact      but       for    th e    quick          actions          of    the       supporters               particularly             on    the

             terraces            before        any Police             arrived           onto         the       terracing            and also          out    on

             t he     pitch       trying        to     resuscitate               and      tending              to   or    carrying             injured

             supporters            there would                 almost        have       been more               fatalities.               I think       that          a

             major         cause       of    t hi s    disaster            wass       the       f a ct     that L i ve rp oo l             supporters

             Police         b e h a v i our     towards          fans        could        be        improved            both     in a n d       outside          the

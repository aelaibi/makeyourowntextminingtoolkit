       HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF DR EASTWOOD

       I took the liberty the other day of asking Dr Chris Nicholson to comment on
       the submission prepared on behalf of Dr Eastwood.

       He has since replied giving his critique of the submission which I think
       Sir Peter and yourself might find of some assistance.

 Dear Mr Jones

 HmSBO KW GH INQ03EY - SOBKESSICMS CN BEHAIF OF J3R ERSTW00D
% canmention the above document axe as follows;

||jttWnptW....l(i)Sftnfl ?; This submission contains no mention of corrosion, or
its assessment, trtiich should have footed part of the inspection procedure.
Dr Eaa?ts#xl agreed in his evidence (day 26 pl09) that barriers which contained
          holes would have been condemned. The collapsed barrier contained
TOtTodsd holes (HSE Report para 3.4) vftiich would have been visible at the 1988
 inspection.
ParaqraBb-lg? Since deflections were not measured on each span fdav 26 t>H3
Collins/Eastwood) how can it be said that both spans passed?                                                ^'
                                                                                                            I*
ftOTWWEfaJls ^ Eastwood stated (day 26 pll3) that "there has been an error
in testing” and henoe this paragraph is confusing.

          12*     ^   accepted eventually fcy Ear Eastwood that deflections could
get larger with successive load applications (day 26 pii7 ) and henoe it is by
no means certain that the span requiring a re-test would have passed.

Paraqrap^ 13: It has not been proved that barriers 128 and 137 were deformed
on or before 15/4/89* Die test results supplied to HSE by Dr Eastwood
(covering letter Eastwood/Jaanes dated 1/6/89) state that for barrier 128 the                         :«r
"first load application, 135 to 1.4 tonnes resulted in a 75% recovery after
release of load" which suggests that, for this barrier, plastic deformation
occurred at less than 1 .2 tunes the design load for a new barrier (5 kN/m)»
Eastwood's data require explanation.

Recent HSE raail1~k (not available when the report was issued) indicate that the
crwd density was similar in pens 3 and 4 and hence "crush pressure" would a I s o
have been similar in the two pens.

Baragygph 14: The Green Guide does not quantify "crowd pressure" and henoe
this statement could be challenged.

BuagiaEiLl6 i A definition of "significantly**- is required here, certainly

                                                  i
    ^E^'SHEF^IELD                 TEL_N o .0742 755792             13,07,89    15:53      P .03




                       Mast barriers at the Leppings lane End had been positioned so as
        to prevent spectators starviing on the same step as the barrier. The exanples
        chosen by Dr Eastwood were not typical (day 27 p61).
        Paragraph 20; Some spectators have stated that they were pressed over the
        barriers, thus compressing those an the lower side. Hie hei<£it of the barriers
        is therefore very relevant.
        paragraph 22; The alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers is
        specified in the Green Guide. This does not appear to have been considered by
        Dr Eastwood. Same of the gaps in the lines of barriers were well in excess of
        the Guide recotroendations. For exanple, the gap between barriers 136 and 136A,
       Jfenediately above the collapsed spans of 124A, was 57% larger than the Guide
       iPxiRium.
        paragraph 33; I do not agree with this statement. In the absence of radial
        fences, spectators would have spread more uniformly along the leppings lane
        Terrace, thus reducing crcwd density in the central area.
        Paragraph 42: In Pen 3, a configuration of barriers complying with the Green
        Guide would have led to a reduction in pressure on specific barriers
        (particularly 124A) and henoe barrier collapse may have been averted* Crushing
        injuries may still have occurred but the death toll would, in ray opinion, have
        been reduced substantially. The situation in Pen 4, where the barrier
        configuration was better, and the crcwd density was similar, supports this
        view.
        paragraphs 45. 47. _48 and 50; The capacity of Pens 3 and 4 is not given,
        although that of Spion Rap is! It is not credible that "a loss in capacity"
        (para 47) or "the effect on capacity" (para 48) could be quantified or
        discussed unless the original capacities had been calculated already. Likewise
        the only sensible way of allocating spectators to a particular pen would be on
        the basis of a known and agreed capacity. The term "visibly full" (para 50) is
        meaningless in this context.

        Do not hesitate to contact me if yew require clarification of any of the above
        points. I expect to attend the Inquiry tcmonxw (14th) from 9,30am onwards.

        Yours sincerely

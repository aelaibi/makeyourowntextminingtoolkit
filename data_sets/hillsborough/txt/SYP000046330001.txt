                                                     open this month will produce a very different
                                                     picture of what actually happened.
                                                         It has been clear for a long time that the

                                                         This continuing dispute over Hillsborough
                                                     Is regrettable because It revives agonising
                                                     memories but It is essential that the full truth
                                                     Is known and recorded.
                                                         If it Is true that Lord Taylor's report falls to

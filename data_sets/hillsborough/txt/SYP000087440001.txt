            the gymnasium and asked us to go out onto the pitch as there appeared

            to be a pitch invasion.



            I can remember being accompanied by                                            (Ante cedents

            Office).       We walked along the front of the Norl/ft Stand towards the

            Leppings Ln Stand, when about half way along>the stand I saw that

            there appeared to be about four or five rows deep of people on the

            track behind the goal.                  I saw a well built youth run onto the pitch

            from the Leppings Ln end.                 I went onto the pitch Jt,o take him from

            field,    he was hysterical,             shouting,   "They a r ^ d y i n g   in there,"

            pointing back towards the Leppings Lane/€tand where I saw that there

            was many people squashed against £>fe f e n c e , they appeared to be dead,

            they were dark in colour and protruding tongues and dilated pupils.

          earlier before the doctor arrived,              then searched the body of HENERS

             On   Saturday             '15048?         I went      to    th e    football         match          at    Hillsborough.                       I

             support        Liverpool              Football         Club,         I went         with      a     friend         of m i n e

                            who        lives       at    Blidworth.              I got      my    ticket          from       Liverpool

             Football         Club        because         I am      a season          ticket          holder          at    Anfield,              I

             paid £6         for       the    ticket         and      it w a s    for      Leppings            Lane        standing          a r ea.           I

             travelled            to    the    match          in m y     friends        car.          We   did        not    stop       on     the w a y

             to   the       ground.           We       joined      the    Ml     at        junction            S ? a n d th e    traffic              was

             heavy -         This       was       at    about      1 1. 45am.              We    c ame     off the m o t o r w a y           at

              junction 34              because          there      were     signs          saying      don't          leave      the     motorway

             at   junction             33,        The    traffic         was     very       heavy      all        the w a y       in    to     the

             ground.          We       parked          in a     car     p ark    at        the    side         of the S p i o n        K op.          We

             .got to        the     car      park at          about      1315pm,

             On    the      way     to      the    ground        there      were       people         drinking             outside        all         the

              pubs     we     passed.             They       would      be N e t t i n g     Forest           supporters           because             we

              came      the    same         way    they       did.

              I have        been       to    the       ground      a number           of    times        so     1 knew       where        to      go

              once     we     had      parked          the    car.        I did       not       see   any       Police       officers             giving

              directions.
                                                                                                                                                 PAGE


0ii d       not       see     anyone          causing            trouble            ar    fighting              people             where       singing

but       nothing        else.

I got       to    the        entrance           to       the     ground         at       about        2pm.           There          was       a queue

of     about      20     people          at     each       turnstile.                    I was        surprised                that        there

were       so    few      people          going          in.

There       were        a few Poli ce                Officers             directing                 fans        to    the          seats      and

standing              area.        But     there          were        not      as    many           Police           Officers            as     I

thought           there       would        be       nor     as       many      as    there           were          last        year      at      the

 sa m e     match.           There        were       stewards             by     the          gate        and      the        turnstiles

 directing             fans,

 I did       not       have        any    difficulty                 finding          my       entry         point            as    I have          been        a

 number          of    times        before,              I would            like         to    say        t ha t     once          through          the

 turnstiles              there       is       no     sign       to    say      that           you     can       go       to    the       right        or

 left       to    ge t       to    the     enclosures.                    Having          been        there          before             I know        t hat

 you      can,        but     someone          who       did        not     know         the    ground             would           not     know       that

 vou       could       get        around and              if y o u        look       r i g ht        or     left         it    seems        as      if     it

  is      a dead        end.        A H       that        a fan w o u l d            see       after          comroing             through          the

  turnstiles             would        be      the        centre        tunnel            and        the     p i t c h at           the     end      of

  it.       He    would           automatically                  go    that         w ay.           I did          not    see       any       stewards

  in t ha t           part    of    the       ground           either.

  I did          not     have      any     difficulty                 entering                the    ground.                  I went       in t h r o u g h

  the       turnstiles             Nos     A - G.               I     did    not         see    any         gates         open          other       than

  the       turnstiles              I did          not         see a n y     gates            being         opened.                I did       not       see

  anyone          getting           in o t h e r         than        through          the       turnstile.                     I knew          exactly

  where          I was        going       to       stand        and went            straight               to      the        place.           I went

     down    the       tunnel        at    about           1415pm.             There           was        a steady             trickle           of    fans

     going       down        the    tunnel.              There        were       no P o l i c e            Officers                in the        Tunnel

     or    in the        standing             area             but I d i d          see       some        Police          up       in    the     West

t hought             to m y s e l f        there            is no        way      I am       going          to    stay        in h e r e .         I

    reached          forward           grabbed           th e P o l i c e             Officers          coat       and        pulled        myself          up

    on    to    th e      pitch.            I though              to     myself            I d o n ’t       care       if     I go     to    prison            I

    am    not       staying          in t h e r e .            As      I was          pulling          myself          out     I saw a Police

    Officer          run       from my           right         on      to       the    Pitch.           L.a t e r t h a t         evening          when        I

    watched          the       scenes        on the            television                  I saw a Po li c e                Officer         run        on   to

    the    Pitch          to     the       referee           and       the       match was              stopped.              This     was      the

    Police          Officer          I had        s e e n as           I was          climbing           out      of     the       pen.After

    getting          on     to      t he    pitch           I turned             around          to     face      the       crowd        in pen 3

    there       were        about          2-3     hundred             people          some        standing             some       l y i n g down.             I

    and    other           people          were     shouting                to       the     crowd       to m o v e         back     to     ease         the

    pressure           at      the     front        but         t h e y w o u l d n ’t.                I was      looking           into     Pen 3 and

    at    the       front        I could           see        about         6    people          squashed              against        the      fence

    there       faces          were        purple           and     they were                not      moving           I thought          t h at       they

    were       dead.           There        was        one      woman           in    particular              who       was    about        25 years               oi

    age.        She       was       very      purple            her      tongue            was        hanging          down     by h e r       chin.

    People          all     around           were       going            purple.             People         were        being       helped          qv         th«

    f e n c e . There          were        some        St     Johns         Ambulance                 people       there          giving       mouth        to

    mouth.            There          were     about           20-30           Police         Officers            there        by    this       time

    helping            people         out     of       the      pens.            There           were    also          about       100 P o l i c e

    officers            across          the       half        way        line,         because          the      Forest           fans    at    the

    other           end were           chanting.                 I think             t hat       if    some       of    the P o l i c e        Officers

     had       gone     around          to       the    other            side         of    the       tunnel       and       made     people           come

     out       of    the       pen     that        way        it w o u l d           have     eased         the        pressure.

     The       only       injuries           I     had        were       bruising             to      the    arms       and        ribs     and        grazes

     to    legs        and arms.                 I did         not       attend            any    hospital.                 she    delay       in

     opening           the       gates       may       have         been         contributory                in     causing          deaths         and

     injuries.                 If    the     gates           had       been       wider          or    more       gates        1 f e el      more

     r,D0 r,ie w o u l d            have     been           s av e d .

           I eventually         left     the    g r o u n d at    about      1630pm,        I left    of    my    own

           accord      and   went   to    the    car      park    and   my    friend       was    already    in the       car.

           The   only    incidents        I saw      on    the    pitch      were    carnermen      being    pushed away

           because      they were        trying      to    take    photos.          There    did    not    seem    to    be

           any   control      it w a s    total     mayhem.         There      were    2    off    duty    Police

           Officers      from    Liverpool         who     were    trying      to    organize       things.

You wrote to the Home Secretary on 19 April 1989 enclosing one
from Mr             about the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.
Miss Bannister, in her letter of 25 April 1989, mentioned that
your letter and your constituent's had been forwarded to me as
the Secretary to the Inquiry.
I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice Taylor who has
noted it.

        The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your letter of 19
April, with which you enclosed one from Mr              ^of
Stockport, who makes suggestions as to how another tragedy such as that
which took place at Hillsborough might best be avoided in the future.

        As you know, an inquiry tinder the chairmanship of Lord Justice
Taylor has been formed to investigate the events at Hillsborough and to
make   recommendations.   I   have   therefore forwarded yours   and your
constituent's correspondence to Mr Robert Whalley,      Secretary to the
Inquiry, who can be contacted at this address,

MR                                STOCKPORT

I enclose a copy of a letter I have received from the above
constituent regarding the Hillsborough disaster. Mr          has
made his own observations drawn from personal experience about
open terraces in football stadia and makes several points in
conclusion.

I should be very grateful for any comments you are able to give on
the points Mr        Jias raised.

ATTORNEY GENERAL

copy to      SOLICITOR GENERAL
             Private Office




As you are aware, the Hillsborough Inquest has again been the

subject of representations.             You have replied to a number of MPs

and I have written on your behalf to the Chief Executive of

Liverpool City Council.



Beneath this note (green flag A) is a letter from Mr John Glover,

the father of Ian Glover - one of those who died.                     It is not

clear whether he is seeking that you order some form of further

independent public          inquiry or renewing an application under

section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988.



So far as any further independent inquiry is concerned, that is

a matter for the Home Secretary.                As to an application under

section     13   of   the    Coroners    Act   1988,   the   letter     does   not

constitute a further application and is not supported by any
evidence.



As the result of what was in that letter, I have procured a copy

of   the    judgment    of    the   Divisional     Court     relating    to    the

unsuccessful application for judicial review.                  It is attached

opposite.        It is apparent that the only two items in Mr Glover's

letter which relate specifically to his son represent issues
which have arisen since you refused the section 13 application

but have been considered by the Divisional Court who found that

they did not affect the merits of the case at all.                   Those pieces
of information are:



(i)    the   further    statement    from       a       South   Yorkshire       Police

Constable referred to as item 1 on page 2 of Mr Glover's letter,
and

(ii) the comments of Dr Ian West referred to as item 3 on page
3 of the letter.



They   are   dealt     with   at   flags    B       and    C    in^-the— judgment

respectively.          So far as the comments off Dr Ian West yare

concerned,    the observation by the Divisional Court tljat his

evidence could have found in application under section 13 of the

Coroners Act 1988 cannot be construed as a criticism of the

original decision.       The document is question came into being two

months after your decision not to consent was granted and has

still never been referred to us in any way, shape or form.

There is no point in inviting them to submit it now because the

Divisional Court has been very scathing about Dr West's evidence
                                                    —                       _       _
and made it clear that it is far too speculative to warrant the

ordering of a fresh inquest.           Moreover, it referred to other

deceased persons and counsel on behalf of the Glovers could only

argue on the basis that if some of the pathologist's evidence was

tainted, so too might that relating to their son.                           A very
tenuous argument indeed.
A draft letter to Mr Glover is attached opposite.    I have not

dealt with the other points in the letter which deal with other

deceased persons save by the general comment that they were also

considered by the Divisional Court.   The reality is that there

is absolutely nothing new in all of the recent representations.

You will also be impressed with the thoroughness of the judgment
of the Divisional Court.

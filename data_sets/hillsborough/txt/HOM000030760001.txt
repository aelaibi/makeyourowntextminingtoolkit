At   10    am   Wednesday,          22   March   1989,     I    attended    a   planning    meeting      at

Hammerton       Road      Police     Station,    chaired       by Chief Superintendent Mole,             to

discuss the organisation of the F. A. Cup Semi Final tie between Liverpool

and Nottingham Forest               Football Clubs.




On   Monday,         27     March    1989,   I was   promoted      ChiefSuperintendent        of   'F'

Division and assumed responsibilities for the forthcoming football match.




In   the    period which            followed leading      to     the    semi final     I liaised     with

Assistant        Chief        Constable      (Operations)         Mr.      Jackson     regarding      the

arrangements.




At   10    am Wednesday,            29 March 1989,    I had ameeting with               Superintendent

Murray,     Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector Sewell in my office to discuss

the operational order and our arrangements for the day and to ensure these

were progressing satisfactorily.




At   2.30       pm     on     10    April    1989     I    had     a    meeting      with   the    Sector
Superintendents,          representatives       from   'D'     Division,    Road    Traffic     and

British Transport Police to discuss our arrangements.




At 2 pm Wednesday,          12 April    1989,    I held a press conference at Hammerton

Road Police Station and met with media representatives.




At   10 am Friday,        14 April    1989,   I held a pre match briefing in the North

Stand    at    the Hillsborough Football Stadium for officers of Inspector and

above.     See Appendix 'A'.



The purpose of this was to give a full briefing to supervisory officers and

then for them to have the opportunity to examine their respective areas of

responsibility and familiarise themselves with the ground.




I    conducted    the     main   briefing     with   Superintendent    Murray,     and   then   the

respective area Superintendents held their own briefings, in and around the

ground,       dealing more       specificially with     their needs,       and requirements of

their areas of responsibility.



At   10 am Saturday,        15 April    1989, I briefed the officers on duty for the

semi     final   tie    in the North     Stand of the Hillsborough Football Stadium.

See Appendix 'B '.



It was a shortened version of the previous day's briefing.                         Superintendent

Murray,       Detective    Sergeant    Charlesworth      and   Inspector    Sewell    also    dealt

with matters       such as Emergency Evacuation Procedure,                 Crime    Intelligence,

and Administration.
On   completion   of   the   briefing    I spoke      with   officers   in   the   ground   and

toured the area.



I re-entered the ground about 1.15 pm and in due course made my way to the

Police Control Box about 1.50 pm and liaised with Superintendent Murray.




We left a short time later to see the referee and linesmen to advise them

of our emergency procedures.



They were on the pitch and eventually they left and we followed them to the

official's room.



On leaving there about 2 pm we returned to the Police Control Box and met

with Mr. Jackson, Assistant Chief Constable (Operations).




In the Control Box were the regular operators - PS Goddard, PC Ryan and PC

Bichard.



I had a general discussion with Mr. Jackson about the operation, which was

progressing satisfactorily at this stage.               He left a little while later.




About 2.30 pm, when examining the ground situation, I noted that the Spion

Kop was almost full with the Nottingham Forest fans, and that was the

general view in respect of their other areas of the ground.




A number of Liverpool supporters had obtained tickets for the Spion Kop and

were   accommodated    in    the North   East       part of this section of the ground.

They were    segregated      from   the Nottingham Forest        supporters    by a line of




                                                3
police officers.



The North Stand         for Liverpool       supporters     was   possibly     half full at this

time,      the West    Stand was     filling,      but there was      space    at thefront       and

sides      of the Leppings Lane Terrace.               I asked for    a tannoy message           to be

relayed for fans to move forward and spread along the terrace.




I    can   recall   about     this   time Superintendent Marshall           asked     for Leppings

Lane to be closed and saw on the CCTV monitor                      the crowd situation           and a

SYPTE      double decker bus passing.



I was aware of a crowd build up buttraffic was still able                        to       flow and I

questioned in my mind the need for the closure.




At    this   time     there   must   have   been    some   difficulty    in    closing     the    road

because I remember more than one request for                     this to be done as though the

first had not been implemented.



I was aware from the CCTV monitor of the increasing number of supporters in

Leppings Lane and           in those waiting to enter the ground.               Whilst examining

the situation outside I visually made an assessment from the Control Box of

the way in which the ground was filling and asked Superintendent Murray for

his assessment of the situation, bearing in mind the crowd outside and the

space inside at this time.



This was about 2.30 pm and he said that with half an hour to kick off we
                                                             \
should get them all in on time.




                                                                                      /

                                                   4
V




    About    this     time    I    asked     Superintendent             Murray    to    clarify       with   me   the

    circumstances under which we would consider delaying the kick off.




    We had      previously agreed that if there was an identifiable problem, e.g. a

    serious     incident,     accident          on    the motorway        or   fog on        the Pennines which

    would prevent large numbers of fans arriving on time we should consider a

    delay     as    opposed       to    those    who       had   been    brought       to    the   area   within    a

    reasonable time but had chosen not to enter the ground as soon as possible.




    I took      the   view    that      at   this      time,     with    all   the     information available,

    there were no grounds to delay the kick off.



    Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd continued to increase and I monitored

    the Liverpool         fans on        the Spion          Kop and actions being taken by officers

    there.



    I examined the situation at the Leppings Lane End of the ground from the

    CCTV monitor and saw the increasing crowd situation.




    I was aware that action was being taken to increase the number of officers

    at   this      location       as    horses       and    reserve     serials      were     being    directed     to

    assist by Control Room personnel.



    In addition, a tannoy message was being relayed to the crowd outside at the

    Leppings       Lane   end      to    ease        back    and   not    to     push       forward    against     the

    turnstiles.
About     2.40     pm     the    radio    developed        a       fault    and    there   were    obvious

communication difficulties.



A request was made              for a Communications Officer                to attend and repair the

fault and he arrived almost immediately.



He restored communications and we were able to contact officers once more.




The crowd was continuing to increase at the Leppings Lane end turnstiles,

and Superintendent Marshall                   asked    for PC Buxton        to attend with        the Land

Rover which is equipped with a public address facility.



In addition,        at 2.44 pm,          I requested a traffic mobile                 to assist and for

continued        tannoy      messages    to the        crowds outside to relieve              the pressure

upon the turnstiles.



The     crowd    had    by    now   increased         considerably         and fans were      beginning   to

climb over the walls into the ground.



The     crowd    situation       was    changing       rapidly,      it had       increased    in numbers,

Superintendent          Marshall        had    asked     for   a    vehicle with      a P.A.      facility,

tannoy messages were being relayed to ease pressure, Mounted officers were

having difficulty and extra resources had been sent to assist.




I looked at the situation on the Leppings Lane terrace and saw there was

room for supporters,             and considered because of                 the deteriorating      situation

whether or not to delay                 the kick off to ease               the difficulties.      I looked
through the Control Box window to my right and saw a half circle of press

photographers      on   the pitch at the players'          tunnel,   obviously waiting for

the teams to appear,         and at that point,         whilst considering the position,

the first team ran out onto the pitch.




I considered this option had been removed.




I looked at        the CCTV camera trained on the service road at the Leppings

Lane end showing Gate C, and a Mounted officer was in some difficulty as

his horse was being jostled by the crowd.




It was     about    this   time,    14.47 pm,    that   the first message        came       over   the

radio from Superintendent Marshall with a request to open the gates .




I again looked at the CCTV monitor showing Gate C and my immediate reaction

was not to do this.          We had supporters outside the ground who may not have

tickets, some may be drunk or worse for drink,                they were not co-operating

with   the police nor responding           to our requests.          To   open   the    gates      and

allow them into the ground would defeat our objective that no one would get

in without a ticket, who was drunk or may be carrying weapons.




The    crowd   situation      was    extremely    difficult    and    this   was       an    unusual

request,    and whilst I was considering the position, assessing the space in

the ground and looking at the CCTV monitor,                 I saw Gate C burst open and

supporters enter the concourse area at the -year of the Leppings Lane stand

and terrace.




I remember thinking,         'the gate's open anyway':        I had not given permission
but at that point a Mounted Officer retrieved the situation and closed the

gate.



A further message came over the radio from Superintendent Marshall to open

the gates and he used words to the effect that if the gates were not opened

someone was going to be killed.



This was an urgent message which conveyed to me by the tone of his voice

that this was a serious situation and was a demand rather than a request.




The     previous     thoughts    crossed   my     mind   once     again   about    monitoring      and

control of supporters entering the ground.



It was a serious step to take.               I looked at the CCTV monitor - there was

crushing      outside,    supporters       were    climbing       over    the    turnstile      walls,

officers were under pressure.



On the inside of the ground there was space in the terrace, there was space

on    the   inside   of the     turnstiles      in the       concourse,   and room    to ease      the

situation.



If the gates were opened there may be crushing and injury on the inside but

the message I was receiving from the outside was that unless I opened the

gates and eased the pressure people would be seriously injured or killed.




Superintendent        Marshall    is   a very      experienced      police      officer   and   if he

wanted the gates opened,           which is not normally a consideration,                    then the

situation must be very serious indeed.                   N




                                                   8
Whilst     I    am    considering    the   position   and   considering   the   options

Superintendent Murray said to me,



"Mr. Duckenfield, are you going to open the gates"?




I remember standing there and saying my thoughts aloud so that others, if

they heard it, would realise it was a considered decision.            I said,




"If there's likely to be serious injury or death I've no option but to open

the gates - open the gates".




Superintendent Murray passed this message.



About this time I heard another radio message from someone who said words

to the effect,



"It does not matter whether you open the gates or not, this gate's going in

anyway".



I was advised this was 'A' Gate.



I took this to mean that crowd pressure on a particular gate was such that

it was in danger of collapsing and people being injured.




My   immediate       reaction   to that was that if a gate collapsed due to crowd

pressure those immediately in front of the gate would fall and no doubt be

injured.       In addition, those falling may be trampled upon.
The     gate        to     the     North    Stand     was    opened       and   I   immediately     issued

instructions for extra resources to be deployed into that area to provide

cover on the landings and prevent a pitch invasion from non ticket holders.




I also asked for manpower for the perimeter track to monitor the position.




I watched           the    Leppings      Lane     terrace   intently      for   any developments     as a

result of the gates opening.




In taking stock of the situation I looked at the West Stand and it appeared

full.     The centre two pens of the terrace appeared to be almost full, but

there was still some room at the front of the two wing pens.




I saw a PC opening either gates 3 or 4 from the Leppings Lane terrace onto

the perimeter track and a handful of people were coming out on to the track

and walking towards gate 1.                       They seemed to be calm and appeared to stand

aimlessly on the track without any direction.                             The policewoman standing at

Gate    1,     who        was    only   a   few    yards    away,   was    totally   unaware   of    their

presence.           There was room at the front of this pen and there was a need to

open this gate and allow these people into this part of the ground.                                  Chief

Inspector McRobbie who was                   in the Control Room in civilian clothing went

down    on     to    the        track   to assist     her   and draw her attention         to what was

happening.




There was an increasing number of people coming onto the track from Gates 3

and 4 area.              No radio traffic was being received and I was still unable to

assess the situation but considered there may have been a pitch invasion or
that people were being taken out for re-location in the two wing pens.




I asked for Superintendent Greenwood                     to go to Leppings Lane end and find

out    what    was     happening.         1    saw     him    coming   fromthe     players'        tunnel,

walking along          the perimeter          track towards      thePolice Control         Box     and the

incident behind the Leppings Lane end goal.                       An increasing number of people

were    now    being    helped     on   to     the   track     through    the    gates   and some were

climbing over the perimeter fencing on to the track.




The    supporters      from     this    location were now spilling on to the track and

were standing on the grass behind the touch line.                            I was not aware of any

radio    messages       but     then    saw    Superintendent      Greenwood       standing      head   and

shoulders above the people at the back of the goal, presumably standing on

an advertising hoarding and waving his arms.




He was waving          his arms andcrossing them as he did                      so, which indicated to

me he wanted the game to be stopped.                         I agreed the game should be stopped

and I sent Superintendent Murray from the Control Room on to the track to

stop the game.          I then saw Superintendent Greenwood running onto the pitch

to stop the game.             Superintendent Murray then returned to the Control Room.




I saw officers trying to indicate to fans in the rear of the pens to move

back.



People    were       spilling    onto    the    pitch    and were        moving    further    across    and

towards       the    centre    line.     I was       still unaware       of any radio        traffic    and

exactly       what    the   problem     was,     but   some     people    were    now    sitting   on   the

pitch.
The   Assistant    Chief Constable         (Operations)    Mr.   Jackson joined me         in the

Control Box and asked for an appraisal of the situation.                        I was unable to

give an accurate        account of what       the situation was other than a possible

pitch invasion which had resulted in us stopping the game.



The Assistant Chief Constable              (Operations) went         to the pitch and a short

while later returned.



Superintendent Murray was asked to return to the pitch and try and get it

cleared     so   that    from       the Control Box   we   could       assess   the    situation,

especially as now people appeared to be on the pitch who were injured.




An ambulance was requested but I was unaware of any radio message asking

for this and was still relying on my visual assessment of the situation.




It was      difficult    to    assess as    the   crowd was      flowing    onto      the pitch    in

increasing numbers, police officers were present, and there was a movement

of supporters towards the centre line.



I     was   concerned    about the crowd          situation:     a    difficult    situation      was

 developing and we       could not control the pitch.            It was necessary to form a

 cordon to continue segregation and further assistance was requested to help

 with the     increasing      injuries I could see in front of me from the Control

 Box.



 I called for     'Operation Support'.            In turn I was aware of a request for a

 fleet of ambulances,         and      as a result of that message I became aware of
the gravity of the situation.



I then began to give instructions to the Control Room staff in conjunction

with Mr. Jackson for the implementation of the Major Disaster Plan.




I asked   for   the Casualty Bureau   to be    set up,    to warn hospitals    of the

large number of injuries,    any doctors in the ground to Leppings Lane goal

for   deployment,   off   duty   police   officers   to   be   called   to   duty   and

rendezvous at Hammerton Road Police Station.



Mr.   Jackson supplemented my requests, asking Superintendent Torr to attend

in respect of the Casualty Bureau; Detective Chief Superintendent Addis to

attend to co-ordinate the investigation side of the enquiry.            I asked for a

Counselling Service and Victims Support Staff.



I was aware of a request for wire cutters and following on from that the

attendance of the Fire Service.




Whilst all this was taking place I asked PC Ryan to continue broadcasting

for calm among the supporters and for them to clear the pitch so we could

determine what people were injured and where because the fans were milling

around and obstructing the view.



Advertising hoardings were by now being broken up for use as stretchers and

 injured people were being removed across the pitch towards the exit by the

police room.




                                          13
Fans   were   distressed   and   a single   ambulance   was   in position   behind   the

Leppings Lane goal.



The Fire Service cleared a gangway near the Police Control Box in front of

the South Stand to remove casualties          from the ground by a more expedient

route.



Superintendent Murray returned to the Police Control Box and told me that

there were many injuries and possibly some fatalities.



I was later requested to attend the Board Room with Mr. Jackson,               the ACC

(Operations),    and left Superintendent Murray in charge of the operation in

Police Control.



We attended the Board Room within the Directors Lounge at the football club

and saw officials of both clubs and the F.A.



I was    asked for an assessment of the situation and I told them there had

been a serious incident and a large number of casualties.




I was    told by one gentleman that he had seen two dead supporters on the

pitch.



I related the situation as I saw it at that time, and that in my view the

game would have to be postponed but that I did not want this communicating

to the crowd.



The reasons for this were that they may create an additional public order
problem - at this stage I did not have the manpower to deal with this - and

it was    essential        that   all   the    casualties and dead were removed from the

area before any announcements were made.




It was    agreed      the game would be postponed                 but    that no one in the crowd

would be told until I gave permission.                      Mr. Jackson reinforced this, and we

very quickly left.




I returned to the Police Control Box with ACC (Operations) and continued to

monitor the situation.             The rescue was progressing, we now had fatalities

and a temporary mortuary had been arranged in the gymnasium.




I was approached in the Police Control Box by Mr. Clough and Mr. Dalgleish.




They asked for            an assessment of the situation and whether or not the game

was postponed.              I told them it was my intention to postpone the game                     but

asked them not            to tell anyone and gave my reasons for this.




Mr.    Clough left but I asked                Mr. Dalgleish to make an announcement to the

Liverpool fans for calm and to bear with us for the time being.




It is my view that this was beneficial to the operation.



The rescue operation progressed and eventually, about 4 pm that afternoon,

there    was    only one      casualty    awaiting          transportation    to hospital     and    the

point had arrived where the crowd could be told of the situation.




I     asked    for   an    assurance    that     all    trains     and    buses   were   available    to

patrolling the streets and that we were ready for the crowd dispersal.




The    final      ambulance    left   the    ground        and   an   announcement   was   made   by

Superintendent Murray to the crowd that the match had been postponed and

they were asked to leave.




The crowd applauded the decision and left without any major difficulty.




After the ground and the surrounding area had cleared Chief Superintendent

Mole arrived and took over responsibility for the ground.




I left the Police Control Box with Mr. Jackson and walked across the pitch

to    the    Police    Room.     We   met    with    Mr.    Barron,    a Director    of Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club, and passed comment about the disaster - he was in

tears but praised the police operation.




I left the football ground for Force Headquarters about 5-15 pm, together

with        the   Assistant     Chief       Constable        (Operations)     Mr.    Jackson      and

Superintendent Marshall.




On    arrival     at   Force   Headquarters,        about    5-^5 pm,    I met with    the Deputy

Chief Constable, Mr. Hayes, and in due course the Chief Constable.




About 9 pm that evening I left Force Headquarters for Niagara Police Sports

Ground to meet the Minister for Sport who was due to arrive by helicopter

to meet with the Chief Constable.

     He arrived about 10.20        pm and          I escorted him tothe football groundwhere

     he met with Mr. Wright,       the Chief Constable.



     I was present whilst he       toured          the ground and metwith thepress.




     When   he   concluded   his   visit to   the    football   stadium,   I escorted him   to

     Force Headquarters to see Mr. Hayes, the Deputy Chief Constable.




     I returned     to   the Police Sports    & Social Club at Niagara and counselled

     officers who had been involved in the events               that afternoon who had just

     retired from duty.



     I eventually returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and went off duty at

At   10    am   Wednesday,          22   March   1989,     I    attended      a    planning   meeting     at

Hammerton       Road      Police     Station,    chaired       by Chief Superintendent Mole,               to

discuss the organisation of the F. A. Cup Semi Final tie between Liverpool

and Nottingham            Forest Football Clubs.




On   Monday,         27    March    1989,    I was   promoted     Chief       Superintendent        of    *F '

Division and assumed responsibilities for the forthcoming football match.




In   the    period         which followed leading         to    the    semi       final   I liaised      with

Assistant        Chief         Constable      (Operations)        Mr.      Jackson        regarding       the

arrangements.




At   10    am Wednesday,            29 March 1989,    I had a meeting with Superintendent

Murray, Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector Sewell in my office to discuss

the operational order and our arrangements for the day and to ensure these

were progressing satisfactorily.




At   2.30       pm        on   10    April    1989    I    had     a    meeting       with    the   Sector
Superintendents,          representatives     from    'D'    Division,    Road     Traffic     and

British Transport Police to discuss our arrangements.




At 2 pm Wednesday,          12 April    1989, I held a press conference at Hammerton

Road Police Station and met with media representatives.




At   10 am Friday,        14 April 1989, I held a pre match briefing in the North

Stand    at    the Hillsborough Football Stadium for officers of Inspector and

above.    See Appendix 'A'.




The purpose of this was to give a full briefing to supervisory officers and

then for them to have the opportunity to examine their respective areas of

responsibility and familiarise themselves with the ground.




I    conducted    the     main   briefing   with   Superintendent   Murray,       and   then   the

respective area Superintendents held their own briefings, in and around the

ground,       dealing more       specificially with   their needs,       and requirements of

their areas of responsibility.




At   10 am Saturday,        15 April 1989, I briefed the officers on duty for the

semi    final    tie    in the North     Stand of the Hillsborough Football Stadium.

See Appendix 'B'.




It was a shortened version of the previous day's briefing.                       Superintendent

Murray,       Detective    Sergeant    Charlesworth    and   Inspector    Sewell    also     dealt

with matters       such    as Emergency Evacuation Procedure,            Crime Intelligence,

and Administration.
On   completion   of   the   briefing    I spoke   with   officers   in   the   ground   and

toured the area.




I re-entered the ground about 1.15 pm and in due course made my way to the

Police Control Box about 1.50 pm and liaised with Superintendent Murray.




We left a short time later to see the referee and linesmen to advise them

of our emergency procedures.




They were on the pitch and eventually they left and we followed them to the

official's room.




On leaving there about 2 pm we returned to the Police Control Box and met

with Mr. Jackson, Assistant Chief Constable (Operations).




In the Control Box were the regular operators - PS Goddard, PC Ryan and PC

Bichard.




I had a general discussion with Mr. Jackson about the operation, which was

progressing satisfactorily at this stage.           He left a little while later.




About 2.30 pm, when examining the ground situation, I noted that the Spion

Kop was almost full with the Nottingham Forest fans, and that was the

general view in respect of their other areas of the ground.




A number of Liverpool supporters had obtained tickets for the Spion Kop and

were   accommodated    in    the North   East part of this section of the ground.

They were   segregated       from the Nottingham Forest      supporters     by a line of




                                             3
police officers.




The    North Stand      for Liverpool       supporters         was   possibly half full at this

time,      the West    Stand was     filling,       but      there   was   space    at. the    front    and

sides of the Leppings Lane Terrace. I asked for a                            tannoymessage            to be

relayed for fans to move forward and spread along the terrace.




I    can    recall   about    this   time Superintendent Marshall                  asked   for Leppings

Lane       to be closed and saw on the CCTV monitor the crowd situation and a

SYPTE double decker bus passing.



I was aware of a crowd build up but                         traffic wasstill able to flow             and I

questioned in my mind the need for the closure.




At     this   time    there   must   have   been     some      difficulty     in     closing    the    road

because I remember more than one request for this to be done as though the

first had not been implemented.



I was aware from the CCTV monitor of the increasing number of supporters in

Leppings Lane and in those waiting to enter the ground.                              Whilst examining

the situation outside I visually made an assessment from the Control Box of

the way in which the ground was filling and asked Superintendent Murray for

his assessment of the situation, bearing in mind the crowd outside and the

space inside at this time.




This was about 2.30 pm and he said that with half an hour to kick off we

should get them all in on time.




                                                -   4   -
About       this        time I      asked     Superintendent        Murray       toclarify         with   me   the

circumstances under which we would consider delaying the kick off.




We had       previously agreed that if there was an identifiable problem, e.g. a

serious      incident,         accident       on the motorway or             fog on the Pennines which

would prevent large numbers of fans arriving on time we should consider a

delay       as    opposed      to     those    who     had   been      brought      to       the   area   within     a

reasonable time but had chosen not to enter the ground as soon as possible.




I    took    the        view that at         this    time,   with      all   the    information available,

there were no grounds to delay the kick off.




Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd continued to increase and I monitored

the Liverpool            fans on       the    Spion Kop and actions being taken by officers

there.




I examined the situation at the Leppings Lane End of the ground from the

CCTV monitor and            saw the increasing crowd situation.




I was aware             that action was being taken to increase the number of officers

at    this       location      as     horses    and    reserve      serials        were      being   directed        to

assist by Control Room personnel.




In addition, a tannoy message was being relayed to the crowd outside at the

Leppings         Lane    end     to    ease     back     and     not    to   push        forward     against    the

turnstiles.                                                                              /




                                                             5
t




    About     2.40     pm    the    radio       developed    a        fault and     there     were obvious

    communication difficulties.



    A request was made             for a Communications Officer to attend and repair the

    fault and he arrived almost immediately.




    He restored communications and we were able to contact officers once more.




    The crowd was continuing to increase at the Leppings Lane end turnstiles,

    and Superintendent Marshall                 asked    for PC Buxton          to attend with the Land

    Rover which is equipped with a public address facility.



    In    addition,     at 2.44 pm,         I requested a traffic mobile              to assist and for

    continued        tannoy messages        to the       crowds       outside    to relieve    the pressure

    upon the turnstiles.



    The     crowd    had    by now     increased        considerably       and fans were      beginning   to

    climb over the walls into the ground.



    The     crowd    situation      was   changing       rapidly,       ithad   increased     in   numbers,

    Superintendent          Marshall      had    asked     for    a   vehicle with    a   P. A.    facility,

    tannoy messages were being relayed to ease pressure, Mounted officers were

    having difficulty and extra resources had been sent to assist.




    I looked at the situation on the Leppings Lane terrace and saw there was

    room for supporters,            and considered because of              the deteriorating       situation

    whether or not to delay the kick off to ease                           the difficulties.       I looked
through the Control Box window to my right and saw a half circle of press

photographers         on   the pitch at the players'             tunnel,   obviously waiting for

the    teams    to appear,      and at that point,         whilst    considering the position,

the first team ran out onto the pitch.




I considered this option had been removed.




I looked       at    the CCTV camera trained on the service road at the Leppings

Lane end showing Gate C,               and a Mounted officer was in some difficulty as

his horse was being jostled by the crowd.




It was     about      this   time,     14.47 pm,    that   the    first message        came       over   the

radio from Superintendent Marshall with a request to open the gates.




I again looked at the CCTV monitor showing Gate C and my immediate reaction

was not to do this.             We had supporters outside the ground who may not have

tickets,       some may be drunk or worse for drink,                they were not co-operating

with    the     police     nor responding     to our requests.             To   open   the    gates      and

allow them into the ground would defeat our objective that no one would get

in without a ticket, who was drunk or may be carrying weapons.




The     crowd       situation    was    extremely    difficult       and    this   was       an    unusual

request,       and whilst I was considering the position, assessing the space in

the ground and looking at the CCTV monitor,                       I saw Gate C burst open and

supporters enter the concourse area at the rear of the Leppings Lane stand

and terrace.



I remember thinking,            'the gate's open anyway':           I had not given permission




                                                     7
but at that point a Mounted Officer retrieved the situation and closed the

gate.



A further message came over the radio from Superintendent Marshall to open

the gates and he used words to the effect that if the gates were not opened

someone was going to be killed.




This was    an urgent message which conveyed to me by the tone of his voice

that this was a serious situation and was a demand rather than a request.




The   previous      thoughts    crossed    my     mind    once   again    about   monitoring      and

control of supporters entering the ground.




It was a serious step to take.               I looked at the CCTV monitor - there was

crushing     outside,    supporters       were     climbing      over    the   turnstile       walls,

officers were under pressure.




On the inside of the ground there was space in the terrace, there was space

on the     inside   of   the    turnstiles       in the   concourse, and       room   to ease      the

situation.




If the gates were        opened there may be              crushing and injury            on the insidebut

the message I was        receiving from the               outside was that unless I openedthe

gates and eased the pressure people would be seriously injured or killed.




Superintendent       Marshall    is   a very       experienced     police      officer   and    if he

wanted   the gates opened,        which is not normally a consideration,                   then the

situation must be very serious indeed




                                                   £
Whilst     I    am    considering    the   position   and   considering   the   options

Superintendent Murray said to me,



"Mr. Duckenfield, are you going to open the gates"?




I remember standing there and saying my thoughts aloud so that others, if

they heard it, would realise it was a considered decision.            I said,




"If there's likely to be serious injury or death I've no option but to open

the gates - open the gates".




Superintendent Murray passed this message.




About this time I heard another radio message from someone who said words

to the effect,



"It does not matter whether you open the gates or not, this gate's going in

anyway".




I was advised this was 'A' Gate.



I took this to mean that crowd pressure on a particular gate was such that

it was in danger of collapsing and people being injured.




My   immediate       reaction   to that was   that if a gate collapsed due to crowd

pressure those immediately in front of the gate would fall and no doubt be

injured.       In addition, those falling may be tr,        ■,~J




                                              9
The     gate    to     the     North          Stand   was     opened      and I   immediately       issued

instructions for extra resources to be deployed into that area to provide

cover on the landings and prevent a pitch invasion from non ticket holders.




I also asked for manpower for the perimeter track to monitor the position.




I watched the Leppings              Lane        terrace      intently     for any developments       as a

result of the gates opening.




In taking stock of the situation I looked at the West Stand and it appeared

full.     The centre two pens of the terrace appeared to be almost full, but

there was still some room at the front of the two wing pens.




I saw a PC opening either gates 3 or 4 from the Leppings Lane terrace onto

the perimeter track and a handful of people were coming out on to the track

and walking towards gate                 1.     They seemed to be calm and appeared to stand

aimlessly on the track without any direction.                             The policewoman standing at

Gate    1,     who    was    only   a     few    yards      away,   was    totally   unaware   of    their

presence.           There was room at the front of this pen and there was a need to

open this       gate and      allow these peopleinto this part of the ground.                       Chief

Inspector       McRobbie who was          in the Control Room in              civilian clothing went

down    on     to    the    track   to    assist her        and draw her attention        to what was

happening.




There was an increasing number of people coming onto the track from Gates 3

and 4 area.           No radio traffic was being received and I was still unable to

assess the situation but considered there may have been a pitch invasion or




                                                                                        \\l/
that people were being taken out for re-location in the two wing pens.




I asked for Superintendent Greenwood                   to go to Leppings Lane end and find

out    what    was    happening.        I    saw   him     coming     from     the    players'     tunnel,

walking along the perimeter track towards                      the Police Control Box and the

incident behind the Leppings Lane end goal.                     An increasing number of people

were    now   being     helped    on    to   the   track    through      the    gates    and some were

climbing over the perimeter fencing on to the track.




The    supporters      from     this   location were now spilling on to the track and

were standing on the grass behind the touch line.                            I was not aware of any

radio    messages       but    then    saw   Superintendent         Greenwood        standing    head    and

shoulders above the people at the back of the goal, presumably standing on

an advertising hoarding and waving his arms.




He was waving his arms and crossing them as he did so, which indicated to

me he wanted the game to be stopped.                     I agreed the game should be stopped

and I sent Superintendent Murray from the Control Room on to the track to

stop the game.          I then saw Superintendent Greenwood running onto the pitch

to stop the game.             Superintendent Murray then returned to the Control Room.




I saw officers trying to indicate to fans in the rear of the pens to move

back.



People    were       spilling    onto    the   pitch     and   were     moving       further    across   and

towards       the    centre    line.     I was     still unaware        of any radio           traffic   and

exactly       what    the     problem was,     but   some      people    were    now    sitting     on   the

pitch.
4




    The    Assistant   Chief Constable        (Operations)     Mr.    Jackson joined me        in the

    Control Box and asked for an appraisal of the situation.                      I was unable to

    give an accurate        account of what the situation was other than a possible

    pitch invasion which had resulted in us stopping the game.




    The Assistant Chief Constable             (Operations) went to the pitch and a short

    while later returned.



    Superintendent Murray was asked to return to the pitch and try and get it

    cleared     so   that    from       the Control Box   we   could     assess   the    situation,

    especially as now people appeared to be on the pitch who were injured.




    An ambulance was requested but I was unaware                     of any radio message asking

    for this and was still relying on my visual assessment of the situation.




    It was      difficult    to   assess as    the   crowd was        flowing   onto    the   pitch    in

    increasing numbers,        police officers were present, and there was a movement

    of supporters towards the centre line.



    I     was   concerned    about      the crowd    situation:      a   difficult     situation      was

    developing and we could             not control the pitch.        It was necessary to form a

    cordon to continue segregation and further assistance was requested to help

    with the      increasing      injuries I could see in front of me from the Control

     Box.



     I called for 'Operation Support'.               In turn I was aware of a request for a

     fleet of ambulances,         and      as a result of that message I became aware of
the gravity of the situation.




I then began to give instructions to the Control Room staff in conjunction

with Mr. Jackson for the implementation of the Major Disaster Plan.




I asked   for   the Casualty Bureau       to be   set up,   to warn hospitals of the

large number of injuries,    any doctors in the ground to Leppings Lane goal

for   deployment,   off   duty   police     officers   to   be   called   to   duty   and

rendezvous at Hammerton Road Police Station.




Mr. Jackson supplemented my requests, asking Superintendent Torr to attend

in respect of the Casualty Bureau; Detective Chief Superintendent Addis to

attend to co-ordinate the investigation side of the enquiry.              I asked for a

Counselling Service and Victims Support Staff.




I was aware     of a request for wire cutters and following on from that the

attendance of the Fire Service.




Whilst all this was taking place I asked PC Ryan to continue broadcasting

for calm among the supporters and for them to clear the pitch so we could

determine what people were injured and where because the fans were milling

around and obstructing the view.




Advertising hoardings were by now being broken up for use as stretchers and

injured people were being removed across the pitch towards the exit by the

police room.                       X, /

    Fans   were   distressed   and   a single   ambulance   was   in position   behind   the

    Leppings Lane goal.




    The Fire Service cleared a gangway near the Police Control Box in front of

    the South Stand to remove        casualties   from the ground by a more expedient

    route.




    Superintendent Murray returned to the Police Control Box and told me that

    there were many injuries and possibly some fatalities.




    I was later requested to attend the Board Room with Mr. Jackson,               the ACC

    (Operations),    and left Superintendent Murray in charge of the operation in

    Police Control.



    We attended the Board Room within the Directors Lounge at the football club

    and saw officials of both clubs and the F.A.




    I was asked for an assessment of the situation and I told them there had

    been a serious incident and a large number of casualties.




    I was told by one gentleman that he had seen two dead supporters on the

    pitch.



    I related the situation as I saw it at that time, and that in my view the

    game would have to be postponed but that I did not want this communicating

    to the crowd.



    The reasons for this were that they may create an additional public order
problem - at this stage I did not have the manpower to deal with this - and

it was    essential       that   all   the    casualties   and dead were removed from the

area before any announcements were made.




It was      agreed the      game would be postponed           but    that no one in the crowd

would be told until I gave permission.                Mr. Jackson reinforced this, and we

very quickly left.



I returned to the Police Control Box with ACC (Operations) and continued to

monitor the situation.            The rescue was progressing, we now had fatalities

and a temporary mortuary had been arranged in the gymnasium.




I was approached in the Police Control Box by Mr. Clough and Mr. Dalgleish.




They asked for an assessment of the situation and whether or not the game

was postponed.            I told them    it was my intention to postpone the game                but

asked them not to tell anyone and gave my reasons for this.




Mr. Clough left but I asked              Mr. Dalgleish to make an announcement to the

Liverpool fans for calm and to bear with us for the time being.




It is my view that this was beneficial to the operation.



The rescue operation progressed and eventually, about 4 pm that afternoon,

there    was    only one     casualty    awaiting     transportation      to hospital     and the

point had arrived where the crowd could be told of the situation.




I   asked      for   an   assurance    that    all   trains    and    buses   were   available    to
    »•

         transport the supporters away from the ground, all available officers were

         patrolling the streets and that we were ready for the crowd dispersal.




         The    final      ambulance     left   the    ground       and   an   announcement   was   made   by

         Superintendent Murray to the crowd that the match had been postponed and

         they were asked to leave.



         The crowd applauded the decision and left without any major difficulty.




         After the ground and the surrounding area had cleared Chief Superintendent

         Mole arrived and took over responsibility for the ground.



         I left the Police Control Box with Mr. Jackson and walked across the pitch

         to    the    Police     Room.     We   met   with Mr.       Barron,     a Director   of Sheffield

         Wednesday Football Club, and passed comment about the disaster - he was in

         tears but praised the police operation.



         I left the football ground for Force Headquarters about 5-15 pm, together

         with        the    Assistant     Chief       Constable       (Operations)     Mr.    Jackson      and

         Superintendent Marshall.



         On    arrival      at   Force   Headquarters,     about      5.^5 pm,     I met with   the Deputy

         Chief Constable, Mr. Hayes, and in due course the Chief Constable.



         About 9 pm that evening I left Force Headquarters for Niagara Police Sports

         Ground to meet the Minister for Sport who was due to arrive by helicopter

         to meet with the Chief Constable.




                                                           16   -

          He arrived about 10.20        pm and          I escorted himtothe football groundwhere

          he met with Mr. Wright,       the Chief Constable.



          I was present whilst he       toured          the ground andmetwith thepress.




          When   he   concluded   his   visit to   the    football   stadium,   I escorted him   to

          Force Headquarters to see Mr. Hayes, the Deputy Chief Constable.




          I returned    to the Police Sports       & Social Club at Niagara and counselled

          officers who had been involved in the events               that afternoon who had just

          retired from duty.



          I eventually returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and went off duty at

          1.30 am

At   10    am   Wednesday,          22   March   1989,    I    attended    a    planning   meeting    at

Hammerton       Road      Police     Station,    chaired      by Chief Superintendent Mole,           to

discuss the organisation of the F. A. Cup Semi Final tie between Liverpool

and Nottingham            Forest Football Clubs.




On   Monday,         27    March    1989,    I was   promoted    Chief      Superintendent       of   'F '

Division and assumed responsibilities for the forthcoming football match.




In   the    period         which followed leading         to   the semi        final   I liaised with

Assistant        Chief         Constable      (Operations)        Mr.     Jackson      regarding      the

arrangements.




At   10    am Wednesday,            29 March 1989,    I had a         meeting with Superintendent

Murray, Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector Sewell in my office to discuss

the operational order and our arrangements for the day and to ensure these

were progressing satisfactorily.




At   2.30       pm        on   10    April    1989    I    had    a     meeting    with    the   Sector
Superintendents,          representatives       from   'D '   Division,    Road    Traffic      and

British Transport Police to discuss our arrangements.




At 2 pm Wednesday,          12 April    1989,   I held a press conference at Hammerton

Road Police Station and met with media representatives.




At   10 am Friday,        14 April 1989,    I held a pre match briefing in the North

Stand at     the Hillsborough Football Stadium for officers of Inspector and

above.     See Appendix 'A'.




The purpose of this was to give a full briefing to supervisory officers and

then for them to have the opportunity to examine their respective areas of

responsibility and familiarise themselves with the ground.




I    conducted    the    main   briefing    with    Superintendent    Murray,      and   then   the

respective area Superintendents held their own briefings, in and around the

ground,     dealing more        specificially with      their needs,      and requirements of

their areas of responsibility.




At   10 am Saturday,        15 April 1989,      I briefed the officers on duty for the

semi     final   tie    in the North Stand         of the Hillsborough Football Stadium.

See Appendix 'B ' .




It was a shortened version of the previous day's briefing.                        Superintendent

Murray,     Detective      Sergeant    Charlesworth     and   Inspector    Sewell    also    dealt

with matters       such    as Emergency Evacuation Procedure,             Crime    Intelligence,

and Administration.
On   completion   of   the   briefing    I spoke   with   officers   in   the   ground   and

toured the area.



I re-entered the ground about 1.15 pm and in due course made my way to the

Police Control Box about 1.50 pm and liaised with Superintendent Murray.




We left a short time later to see the referee and linesmen to advise them

of our emergency procedures.



They were on the pitch and eventually they left and we followed them to the

official's room.



On leaving there about 2 pm we returned to the Police Control Box and met

with Mr. Jackson, Assistant Chief Constable (Operations).




In the Control Box were the regular operators - PS Goddard, PC Ryan and PC

Bichard.



I had a general discussion with Mr. Jackson about the operation, which was

progressing satisfactorily at this stage.           He left a little while later.




About 2.30 pm, when examining the ground situation, I noted that the Spion

Kop was almost full with the Nottingham Forest fans, and that was the

general view in respect of their other areas of the ground.




A number of Liverpool supporters had obtained tickets for the Spion Kop and

were   accommodated    in the    North   East part of this section of the ground.

They were   segregated       from the Nottingham Forest       supporters    by a line of




                                             3
police officers.




The   North Stand     for Liverpool       supporters was        possibly half      full at this

time,      the West   Stand was     filling,     but there was       space     at thefront      and

sides      of the Leppings Lane Terrace.              I asked for     a tannoy message          to be

relayed for fans to move forward and spread along the terrace.




I    can   recall   about   this   time Superintendent         Marshall    asked    for Leppings

Lane to be closed and saw on the CCTV monitor                    the crowd situation and a

SYPTE      double decker bus passing.




I was      aware of a crowd build up buttraffic was still able                   to      flow and I

questioned in my mind the need for the closure.




At    this   time   there   must   have   been       some   difficulty    in   closing    the    road

because I remember more than one            requestfor this         to be done as        though the

first had not been implemented.




I was aware from the CCTV monitor of the increasing number of supporters in

Leppings Lane and in those waiting to enter the ground.                        Whilst examining

the situation outside I visually made an assessment from the Control Box of

the way in which the ground was filling and askedSuperintendent                          Murray for

his assessment of the situation,            bearing in mind         the crowd outside and         the

space inside at this time.




This was about 2.30 pm and he said that with half an hour to kick off we

should get them all in on time.




                                                                                   ■j

                                                 4
About    this     time    I    asked       Superintendent        Murray       to      clarify      with   me   the

circumstances under which we would consider delaying the kick off.




We had      previously agreed that if there was an identifiable problem, e.g. a

serious     incident,     accident         on    the motorway or           fog on the Pennines which

would prevent large numbers of fans arriving on time we should consider a

delay     as    opposed       to     those      who    had been brought          to    the    area    within     a

reasonable time but had chosen not to                      enter theground as soon as                 possible.




I took      the   view    that        at    this      time, with all       the information           available,

there were no grounds to delay the kick off.



Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd continued to increase and I monitored

the Liverpool         fans     on    the Spion         Kop and actions being taken by officers

there.



I examined the situation at the Leppings Lane End of the ground from the

CCTV monitor and saw the increasing crowd situation.




I was aware that action was being taken to increase the number of officers

at   this      location       as    horses      and    reserve      serials     were       being    directed    to

assist by Control Room personnel.



In addition, a tannoy message was being relayed to the crowd outside at the

Leppings       Lane   end      to    ease       back    and   not     to   push        forward      against    the

turnstiles.                                                   v~\             r...     /
About    2.40     pm    the    radio    developed       a        fault    and    there   were    obvious

communication difficulties.



A request was made            for a Communications Officer                to attend and repair the

fault and he arrived almost immediately.



He restored communications and we were able to contact officers once more.




The crowd was continuing to increase at the Leppings Lane end turnstiles,

and Superintendent Marshall                asked    for PC       Buxton    to attend with the Land

Rover which is equipped with a public address facility.



In addition,       at 2.44 pm,         I requested a traffic mobile                 to assist and for

continued       tannoy messages        to the crowds         outside       to relieve       the pressure

upon the turnstiles.



The     crowd   had    by now     increased        considerably          and fans were      beginning   to

climb over the walls into the ground.



The     crowd   situation      was   changing       rapidly,       it had       increased    in numbers,

Superintendent         Marshall      had    asked     for    a    vehicle with      a P.A.      facility,

tannoy messages were being relayed to ease pressure, Mounted officers were

having difficulty and extra resources had been sent to assist.




I looked at the situation on the Leppings Lane terrace and saw there was

room for supporters,           and considered because of                 the deteriorating      situation

whether or not to delay              the kick off to ease                the difficulties.      I looked
through the Control Box window to my right and saw a half circle of press

photographers         on   the pitch at the players'             tunnel,   obviously waiting for

the teams      to appear,       and at that point, whilst             considering the position,

the first team ran out onto the pitch.




I considered this option had been removed.




I looked       at    the CCTV camera trained on the service road at the Leppings

Lane end showing Gate C, and a Mounted officer was in some difficulty as

his horse was being jostled by the crowd.




It was     about      this   time,    14.47 pm,    that    the    first message        came       over   the

radio from Superintendent Marshall with a request to open the gates.




I again looked at the CCTV monitor showing Gate C and my immediate reaction

was not to do this.             We had supporters outside the ground who may not have

tickets,    some may be drunk or worse for drink,                   they were not co-operating

with   the police          nor responding    to our       requests.        To   open   the    gates      and

allow them into the ground would defeat our objective that no one would get

in without a ticket, who was drunk or may be carrying weapons.




The    crowd        situation   was    extremely    difficult        and    this   was       an    unusual

request, and whilst I was considering the, position, assessing the space in

the ground and looking at the CCTV monitor,                       I saw Gate C burst open and

supporters enter the concourse area at the rear of the Leppings Lane stand

and terrace.




I remember thinking,            'the gate's open anyway':           I had not given permission
but at that point a Mounted Officer retrieved the situation and closed the

gate.



A further message came over the radio from Superintendent Marshall to open

the gates and he used words to the effect that if the gates were not opened

someone was going to be killed.



This was an urgent message which conveyed to me by the tone of his voice

that this was a serious situation and was a demand rather than a request.




The   previous      thoughts    crossed   my     mind   once   again   about    monitoring      and

~ontrol of supporters entering the ground.




It was a serious step to take.              I looked at the CCTV monitor - there was

crushing     outside,     supporters      were    climbing     over    the    turnstile      walls,

officers were under pressure.




On the inside of the ground there was space in the terrace, there was space

on the     inside   of   the   turnstiles      in the   concourse,     and room    to ease      the

situation.



If the gates were opened there may be crushing and injury on the inside but

the message I was receiving from the outside was that unless I opened the

gates and eased the pressure people would be seriously injured or killed.




Superintendent       Marshall    is   a very     experienced     police      officer   and   if he

wanted the gates opened, which is not normally a consideration,                           then the

situation must be very serious indeed.




                                                 8
Whilst     I    am    considering    the   position   and   considering   the        options

Superintendent Murray said to me,



"Mr. Duckenfield, are you going to open the gates"?




I remember standing there and saying my thoughts aloud so that others, if

they heard it, would realise it was a considered decision.            I said,




"If there's likely to be serious injury or death I've no option but to open

the gates - open the gates".




Superintendent Murray passed this message.



About this time I heard another radio message from someone who said words

to the effect,



"It does not matter whether you open the gates or not, this gate's going in

anyway".



I was advised this was 'A' Gate.



I took this to mean that crowd pressure on a particular gate was such that

it was in danger of collapsing and people being injured.




My   immediate       reaction   to that was   that if a gate collapsed due to crowd

pressure those immediately in front of the gate would fall and no doubt be

injured.       In addition, those falling may be tr,°mr''1

                                                                                ./
The     gate       to      the    North      Stand     was    opened       and   I    immediately     issued

instructions for extra resources to be deployed into that area to provide

cover on the landings and prevent a pitch invasion from non ticket holders.




I also asked for manpower for the perimeter track to monitor the position.




I watched          the     Leppings      Lane      terrace    intently     for   any developments      as a

result of the gates opening.




In taking stock of the situation I looked at the West Stand and it appeared

full.        The centre two pens of the terrace appeared to be almost full, but

there was still some room at the front of the two wing pens.




I saw a PC opening either gates 3 or 4 from the Leppings Lane terrace onto

the perimeter track and a handful of people were coming out on to the track

and walking towards gate 1.                        They seemed to be calm and appeared to stand

aimlessly on the track without any direction.                              The policewoman standing at

Gate    1,     who       was     only    a   few    yards    away,   was    totally    unaware   of   their

presence.          There was room at the front of this pen and there was a need to

open this gate and allow these people into this part of the ground.                                   Chief

Inspector McRobbie who was                    in the Control Room in civilian clothing went

down    on    to     the       track    to   assist her      and draw her attention          to what was

happening.




There was an increasing number of people coming onto the track from Gates 3

and 4 area.          No radio traffic was being received and I was still unable to

assess the situation but considered there may have been a pitch invasion or
that people were being taken out for re-location in the two wing pens.




I asked for Superintendent Greenwood to go to Leppings Lane end and find

out    what    was     happening.        I   saw   him     coming    from     the    players'     tunnel,

walking along the perimeter track towards                      the Police Control Box and the

incident behind the Leppings Lane end goal.                     An increasing number of people

were    now    being    helped    on    to   the   track     through    the    gates    and some were

climbing over the perimeter fencing on to the track.




The    supporters      from     this    location were        now spilling on to the track and

were standing on the grass behind the touch line.                           I was not aware of any

radio    messages       but    then    saw   Superintendent         Greenwood       standing    head    and

shoulders above the people at the back of the goal, presumably standing on

an advertising hoarding and waving his arms.



He was waving his arms and crossing them as he did so, which indicated to

me he wanted the game to be stopped.                     I agreed the game should be stopped

and I sent Superintendent Murray from the Control Room on to the track to

stop the game.          I then saw Superintendent Greenwood running onto the pitch

to stop the game.             Superintendent Murray then returned to the Control Room.




I saw officers trying to indicate to fans in the rear of the pens to move

back.



People    were       spilling    onto    the   pitch     and were      moving       further    across   and

towards       the    centre    line.     I was     still unaware       of any radio           traffic   and

exactly       what    the   problem     w a s , but   some    people    were    now    sitting     on   the

pitch.
The    Assistant    Chief Constable             (Operations)       Mr.       Jackson   joined me     in the

Control Box and asked for an appraisal of the situation.                                  I was unable to

give an accurate         account of what the situation was other than a possible

pitch invasion which had resulted in us stopping the game.




The Assistant Chief Constable                (Operations) went to the pitch and a short

while later returned.




Superintendent Murray was asked to return to the pitch and try and get it

cleared      so   that   from    the       Control      Box   we    could       assess    the    situation,

especially as now people appeared to be on the pitch who were injured.




An ambulance was requested but I was unaware of any radio message asking

for this and was still relying on my visual assessment of the situation.




It was      difficult    to    assess      as    the    crowd   was      flowing       onto   the pitch    in

increasing numbers,           police officers were present, and there was a movement

of supporters towards the centre line.



I     was   concerned    about       the    crowd      situation:        a    difficult       situation   was

developing and we could not control the pitch.                           It was necessary to form a

cordon to continue segregation and further assistance was requested to help

with the      increasing injuries I could see in front of me from the Control

Box.



I called for 'Operation Support'.                      In turn I was aware of a request for a

fleet of ambulances,           and         as a result of that message I became aware of
the gravity of the situation.



I then began to give instructions to the Control Room staff in conjunction

with Mr. Jackson for the implementation of the Major Disaster Plan.




I asked   for   the Casualty     Bureau   to be   set up,   to warn hospitals of the

large number of injuries, any doctors in the ground to Leppings Lane goal

for   deployment,   off   duty     police   officers   to   be   called   to   duty   and

rendezvous at Hammerton Road Police Station.



Mr. Jackson supplemented my requests, asking Superintendent Torr to attend

in respect of the Casualty Bureau; Detective Chief Superintendent Addis to

attend to co-ordinate the investigation side of the enquiry.              I asked for a

Counselling Service ?nd Victims Support Staff.



I was aware of a request for wire cutters and following on from that the

attendance of the Fire Service.




Whilst all this was taking place I asked PC Ryan to continue broadcasting

for calm among the supporters and for them to clear the pitch so we could

determine what people were injured and where because the fans were milling

around and obstructing the view.



Advertising hoardings were by now being broken up for use as stretchers and

injured people were being removed across the pitch towards the exit by the

police room.




                                            13
Fans    were   distressed   and   a single   ambulance   was   in position behind   the

Leppings Lane goal.




The Fire Service cleared a gangway near the Police Control Box in front of

the South Stand      to remove casualties     from the ground by a more expedient

route.




Superintendent Murray returned to the Police Control Box and told me that

there were many injuries and possibly some fatalities.




I was later requested to attend the Board Room with Mr. Jackson,              the ACC

(Operations),     and left Superintendent Murray in charge of the operation in

Police Control.




We attended the Board Room within the Directors Lounge at the football club

and saw officials of both clubs and the F.A.




I was    asked for an assessment of the situation and I told them there had

been a serious incident and a large number of casualties.




I was    told by one gentleman that he had seen two dead supporters on the

pitch.



I related the situation as I saw it at that time, and that in my view the

game would have to be postponed but that I did not want this communicating

to the crowd.



The reasons for this were that they may create an additional public order
problem - at this stage I did not have the manpower to deal with this - and

it was    essential        that   all   the   casualties and dead were removed from the

area before any announcements were made.




It was    agreed     the game would be postponed               but    that no one     in the crowd

would be told until I gave permission.                 Mr. Jackson reinforced this, and we

very quickly left.



I returned to the Police Control Box with ACC (Operations) and continued to

monitor the situation.             The rescue was progressing, we now had fatalities

and a temporary mortuary had been arranged in the gymnasium.



I was approached in the Police Control Box by Mr. Clough and Mr. Dalgleish.




They asked for an assessment               of the situation and whether or not the game

was postponed.            I told them      it was my intention to postpone             the game   but

asked them not to tell anyone and gave my reasons for this.




Mr.    Clough left but I asked             Mr. Dalgleish to make an announcement to the

Liverpool fans for calm and to bear with us for the time being.




It is my view that this was beneficial to the operation.



The rescue operation progressed and eventually, about 4 pm that afternoon,

there    was    only      one   casualty   awaiting    transportation      to hospital      and the

point had arrived where the crowd could be told of the situation.




I     asked    for   an    assurance    that   all    trains    and    buses   were   available    to
transport the supporters away from the ground, all available officers were

patrollihg the streets and that we were ready for the crowd dispersal.




The    final      ambulance    left   the    ground     and   an   announcement   was   made   by

Superintendent Murray to the crowd that the match had been postponed and

they were asked to leave.




The crowd applauded the decision and left without any major difficulty.




After the ground and the surrounding area had cleared Chief Superintendent

Mole arrived and took over responsibility for the ground.




I left the Police Control Box with Mr. Jackson and walked across the pitch

to    the    Police    Room.     We   met    with Mr.    Barron,    a Director    of Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club, and passed comment about the disaster - he was in

tears but praised the police operation.




I left the football ground for Force Headquarters about 5-15 pm, together

with        the   Assistant     Chief       Constable     (Operations)     Mr.    Jackson      and

Superintendent Marshall.




On    arrival     at   Force   Headquarters,     about    5-^5 pm,    I met   with   the Deputy

Chief Constable, Mr. Hayes, and in due course the Chief Constable.




About 9 pm that evening I left Force Headquarters for Niagara Police Sports

Ground to meet the Minister for Sport who was due to arrive by helicopter

to meet with the Chief Constable.




                                                 16
He arrived about 10.20 pm and I escorted him                   to the football groundwhere

he met with Mr. Wright, the Chief Constable.




I was present whilst he toured the ground and met                 with the press.




When   he    concluded   his   visit   to   the      footballstadium,   I   escorted him   to

Force Headquarters to see Mr. Hayes, the Deputy Chief Constable.




I returned     to   the Police Sports       & Social Club at Niagara and counselled

officers who had been involved in the events                  that afternoon who had just

retired from duty.




I eventually returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and went off duty at

1.30 a m .

At   10    am   Wednesday,          22   March      1989,     I    attended        a    planning    meeting    at

Hammerton       Road       Police    Station,       chaired       by Chief Superintendent Mole,                to

discuss the organisation of the F. A. Cup Semi Final tie between Liverpool

and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs.




On   Monday,         27    March 1989,       Iwas    promoted        Chief    Superintendent          of    'F *

Division and assumed responsibilities for the forthcoming football match.




In   the    period         which followed           leading       to the    semi       final   I liaised     with

Assistant        Chief         Constable         (Operations)         Mr.     Jackson          regarding      the

arrangements.




At   10   am Wednesday,             29 March     1989,      I had a meeting with Superintendent

Murray, Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector Sewell in my office to discuss

the operational order and our arrangements for the day and to ensure these

were progressing satisfactorily.




At   2.30       pm        on   10    April      1989     I    had     a     meeting        with     the    Sector




                                                                                                I
Superintendents,          representatives       from   'D '   Division,    Road    Traffic      and

British Transport Police to discuss our arrangements.




At 2 pm Wednesday,          12 April    1989,   I held a press conference at Hammerton

Road Police Station and met with media representatives.




At   10 am Friday,        14 April 1989,     I held a pre match briefing in the North

Stand    at    the Hillsborough Football Stadium for officers of Inspector and

above.    See Appendix 'A'.




The purpose of this was to give a full briefing to supervisory officers and

then for them to have the opportunity to examine their respective areas of

responsibility and familiarise themselves with the ground.




I    conducted    the     main   briefing    with   Superintendent    Murray,      and   then   the

respective area Superintendents held their own briefings, in and around the

ground,       dealing more       specificially with     their needs,      and requirements of

their areas of responsibility.




At   10 am Saturday,        15 April 1989, I briefed the officers on duty for the

semi    final    tie    in the North     Stand of the Hillsborough Football Stadium.

See Appendix 'B ’ .




It was a shortened version of the previous day's briefing.                        Superintendent

Murray,       Detective    Sergeant    Charlesworth     and   Inspector    Sewell    also    dealt

with matters       such as       Emergency   Evacuation Procedure,        Crime    Intelligence,

and Administration.
On   completion   of   the   briefing   I spoke   with   officers   in   the   ground   and

toured the area.




I re-entered the ground about 1.15 pm and in due course made my way to the

Police Control Box about 1.50 pm and liaised with Superintendent Murray.




We left a short time later to see the referee and linesmen to advise them

of our emergency procedures.




They were on the pitch and eventually they left and we followed them to the

official's room.




On leaving there about 2 pm we returned to the Police Control Box and met

with Mr. Jackson, Assistant Chief Constable (Operations).




In the Control Box were the regular operators - PS Goddard, PC Ryan and PC

Bichard.




I had a general discussion with Mr. Jackson about the operation, which was

progressing satisfactorily at this stage.          He left a little while later.




About 2.30 pm, when examining the ground situation, I noted that the Spion

Kop was almost full with the Nottingham Forest fans, and that was the

general view in respect of their other areas of the ground.




A number of Liverpool supporters had obtained tickets for the Spion Kop and

were   accommodated    in the North     East part of this section of the ground.

They were   segregated       from the Nottingham Forest     supporters     by a line of




                                            3
%




    police officers.




    The North Stand      for Liverpool       supporters was possibly          half    full at this

    time,   the West     Stand was     filling,     but there was    space     at the front and

    sides   of the Leppings       Lane Terrace.       I asked for    a tannoy message             to be

    relayed for fans to move forward and spread along the terrace.




    I can   recall     about   this   time Superintendent Marshall        asked       for Leppings

    Lane to be closed and saw on the CCTV monitor the crowd situation and a

    SYPTE   double decker bus passing.




    I was   aware of a crowd build up buttraffic was still able                      to   flow    and I

    questioned in my mind the need for the closure.




    At   this   time   there   must   have   been    some   difficulty   in    closing      the    road

    because I remember more than one request for this to be done as though the

    first had not been implemented.




    I was aware from the CCTV monitor of the increasing number of supporters in

    Leppings Lane and in those waiting to enter the ground.                     Whilst examining

    the situation outside I visually made an assessment from the Control Box of

    the way in which the ground was filling and asked Superintendent Murray for

    his assessment of the situation, bearing in mind the crowd outside and the

    space inside at this time.




    This was about 2.30 pm and he said that with half an hour to kick off we

    should get them all in on time.                          \
About    this     time    I    asked    Superintendent              Murray    to    clarify       with   me   the

circumstances under which we would consider delaying the kick off.




We had      previously agreed that if there was an identifiable problem, e.g. a

serious     incident,     accident          on    the motorway        or   fog on the Pennines which

would prevent large numbers of fans arriving on time we should consider a

delay     as    opposed       to    those    who       had   been    brought       to    the   area   within    a

reasonable time but had chosen not to enter the ground as soon as possible.




I took      the   view    that at       this       time,     with    all   the     information available,

there were no grounds to delay the kick off.



Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd continued to increase and I monitored

the Liverpool         fans on        the Spion Kop and actions being taken by officers

there.



I examined the situation at the Leppings Lane End of the ground from the

CCTV monitor and saw the increasing crowd situation.



I was aware that action was being taken to increase the number of officers

at   this      location       as    horses       and    reserve     serials      were     being    directed     to

assist by Control Room personnel.



In addition, a tannoy message was being relayed to the crowd outside at the

Leppings       Lane   end      to    ease        back    and   not    to     push       forward    against     the

turnstiles.
About     2.40    pm    the       radio    developed        a fault and        therewere      obvious

communication difficulties.



A request was made for a Communications Officer                           to attend and repair the

fault and he arrived almost immediately.




He restored communications and we were able to contact officers once more.




The crowd was continuing to increase at the Leppings Lane end turnstiles,

and Superintendent Marshall               asked    for PC       Buxton    to attend with the Land

Rover which is equipped with a public address facility.




In addition,       at 2.44 pm,       I requested a traffic mobile to assist and for

continued       tannoy messages       to the       crowds       outside    to relieve   the pressure

upon the turnstiles.



The     crowd    had   by   now   increased       considerably      and     fans were   beginning   to

climb over the walls into the ground.



The     crowd    situationwas      changing       rapidly,      ithad     increased     in   numbers,

Superintendent         Marshall    had     asked    for     a   vehicle     with   a P.A.    facility,

tannoy messages were being relayed to ease pressure, Mounted officers were

having difficulty and extra resources had been sent to assist.




I looked at the situation on the Leppings Lane terrace and saw there was

room for supporters, and considered because of the deteriorating situation

whether or not         to delay the kick off to ease the difficulties.                       I looked
through the Control Box window to my right and saw a half circle of press

photographers       on   the pitch at the players'        tunnel,    obviously waiting for

the teams      to appear,    and at that point,        whilst considering the position,

the first team ran out onto the pitch.




I considered this option had been removed.




I looked at        the CCTV camera trained on the service road at the Leppings

Lane end showing Gate C, and a Mounted officer was in some difficulty as

his horse was being jostled by the crowd.




It was     about   this   time,    14.47 pm,    that   the first message        came    over   the

radio from Superintendent Marshall with a request to open the gates.




I again looked at the CCTV monitor showing Gate C and my immediate reaction

was not to do this.         We had supporters outside the ground who may not have

tickets,    some may be drunk or worse for drink,            they were not co-operating

with   the police nor       responding   to our requests.           To   open   the gates      and

allow them into the ground would defeat our objective that no one would get

in without a ticket, who was drunk or may be carrying weapons.




The    crowd    situation    was    extremely    difficult   and     this   was    an    unusual

request,    and whilst I was considering the position, assessing the space in

the ground and looking at the CCTV monitor,                I saw Gate C burst open and

supporters enter the concourse area at the rear of the Leppings Lane stand

and terrace.




I remember thinking,        'the gate's open anyway':        I had not given permission
but at that point a Mounted Officer retrieved the situation and closed the

gate.



A further message came over the radio from Superintendent Marshall to open

the gates and he used words to the effect that if the gates were not opened

someone was going to be killed.




This was     an urgent message which conveyed to me by the tone of his voice

that this was a serious situation and was a demand rather than a request.




The    previous      thoughts    crossed   my     mind   once   again   about    monitoring      and

control of supporters entering the ground.




It was a serious step to take.               I looked at the CCTV monitor - there was

crushing      outside,     supporters      were    climbing     over    the    turnstile      walls,

officers were under pressure.




On the inside of the ground there was space in the terrace, there was space

on    the   inside   of   the   turnstiles      in the   concourse,     and room    to ease      the

situation.



If the gates were opened there may be crushing and injury on the inside but

the message I was receiving from the outside was that unless I opened the

gates and eased the pressure people would be seriously injured or killed.




Superintendent        Marshall    is   a very     experienced     police      officer   and   if he

wanted the gates opened,           which is not normally a consideration,                then the

situation must be very serious indeed.
Whilst     I    am     considering   the   position   and   considering    the      options

Superintendent Murray said to m e ,




"Mr. Duckenfield, are you going to open the gates"?




I remember standing there and saying my thoughts aloud sothat others,                    if

they heard it, would realise it was a considered decision.                I said,




"If there's likely to be serious injury or death I've no option but to open

the gates - open the gates".




Superintendent Murray passed this message.




About this time I heard another radio message from someone who said words

to the effect,




"It does not matter whether you open the gates or not, this gate's going in

anyway".




I was advised this was 'A' Gate.




I took this to mean that crowd pressure on a particular gate               was suchthat

it was in danger of collapsing and people being injured.




My   immediate       reaction   to that was   that if a gate collapsed due to crowd

pressure those immediately in front of the gate would fall and no doubt be

injured.       In addition, those falling may be trornr'1




                                              9   -
The     gate        to     the     North     Stand     was    opened    and   I   immediately      issued

instructions for extra resources to be deployed into that area to provide

cover on the landings and prevent a pitch invasion from non ticket holders.




I also asked for manpower for the perimeter track to monitor the position.




I watched           the    Leppings      Lane      terrace    intently forany developments         as a

result of the gates opening.




In taking stock of the situation I looked at the West Stand and it appeared

full.     The centre two pens of the terrace appeared to be almost full, but

there was still some room at the front of the two wing pens.




I saw a PC opening either gates 3 or 4 from the Leppings Lane terrace onto

the perimeter track and a handful of people were coming out on to the track

and walking towards gate 1.                        They seemed to be calm and appeared to stand

aimlessly on the track without any direction.                           The policewoman standing at

Gate    1,     who        was    only   a    few    yards    away,   wastotally   unaware     of    their

presence.           There was room           at the front of this pen and there was a need to

open this gate and allow these people into this part of the ground.                                 Chief

Inspector McRobbie who was                    in the Control Room in civilian clothing went

down    on     to    the        track   to   assist her       and draw her    attention     to what was

happening.




There was an increasing number of people coming onto the track from Gates 3

and 4 area.              No radio traffic was being received and I was still unable to

assess the situation but considered there may have been a pitch invasion or
that people were being taken out for re-location in the two wing pens.




I asked for Superintendent Greenwood to go to Leppings Lane end and find

out    what    was    happening.        I    saw   him     coming    from     the    players      tunnel,

walking along the perimeter              track towards         the Police Control Box and the

incident behind the Leppings Lane end goal.                     An increasing number of people

were    now   being    helped     on    to   the   track    through     the    gates    and some were

climbing over the perimeter fencing on to the track.



The    supporters      from     this   location were now spilling on to the track and

were standing on the grass behind the touch line.                             I was not aware of any

^adio    messages      but     then    saw   Superintendent         Greenwood       standing    head    and

shoulders above the people at the back of the goal, presumably standing on

an advertising hoarding and              waving his arms.



He was waving his arms and               crossing them as he did so, which indicated to

me he wanted the game to be stopped.                     I agreed the game should be stopped

and I sent Superintendent Murray from the Control Room on to the track to

stop the game.          I then saw Superintendent Greenwood running onto the pitch

to stop the game.             Superintendent Murray then returned to the Control Room.




I saw officers trying to indicate to fans in the rear of the pens to move

back.



People     were      spilling    onto    the   pitch     and    weremoving          further    across   and

 towards      the    centre    line.     I was     still unaware        of any radio      traffic       and

 exactly      what    the     problem was,     but   some      people   were     now    sitting    on   the

 pitch.
The   Assistant    Chief Constable          (Operations)     Mr.   Jackson joined me       in the

Control Box and asked for an appraisal of the situation.                        I was unable to

give an accurate        account of what the situation was other than a possible

pitch invasion which had resulted in us stopping the game.




The Assistant Chief Constable            (Operations)        went to the pitch and a short

while later returned.



Superintendent Murray was asked to return to the pitch and try and get it

cleared     so   that   from    the    Control    Box   we    could   assess    the     situation,

especially as now people appeared to              be on the pitch who were injured.




An ambulance was        requested but I was unaware of any radio                 message asking

for this and was still relying on my visual assessment of the situation.




It was      difficult to    assess     as    thecrowd   was    flowing   onto        the pitch    in

increasing numbers, police officers were present, and there was a movement

of supporters towards the centre line.



I     was   concerned   about    the   crowd     situation: a      difficult         situation   was

 developing and we could not control the pitch.                    It was necessary to form a

 cordon to continue segregation and further assistance was requested to help

 with the increasing       injuries I could see in front of me from the Control

 Box.



 I called for 'Operation Support'.               In turn I was aware of a request for a

 fleet of ambulances,          and     as a result of that message I became aware of




                                                                                 /
the gravity of the situation.



I then began to give instructions to the Control Room staff in conjunction

with Mr. Jackson for the implementation of the Major Disaster Plan.




I asked   for   the Casualty Bureau     to be       set up,   to warn hospitals of the

large number of injuries, any doctors in the ground to Leppings Lane goal

for   deployment,   off   duty   police   officers       to   be   called   to   duty   and

rendezvous at Hammerton Road Police Station.



Mr. Jackson supplemented my requests, asking Superintendent Torr to attend

in respect of the Casualty Bureau; Detective Chief Superintendent Addis to

attend to co-ordinate the investigation side of the enquiry.                I asked for a

Counselling Service and Victims Support Staff.



I was aware of a request for wire cutters and following on from that the

attendance of the Fire Service.




Whilst all this was taking place I asked PC Ryan to continue broadcasting

for calm among the supporters and for them to clear the pitch so we could

determine what people were injured and where because the fans were milling

around and obstructing the view.



Advertising hoardings were by now being broken up for use as stretchers and

injured people were being removed across the pitch towards the exit by the

police room.                        \



                                           13   -
Fans    were   distressed   and   a single   ambulance   was   in position   behind   the

Leppings Lane goal.




The Fire Service cleared a gangway near the Police Control Box in front of

the South Stand to remove casualties          from the ground by a more expedient

route.




Superintendent Murray returned to the Police Control Box and told me that

there were many injuries and possibly some fatalities.




I was    later requested to attend the Board Room with Mr. Jackson,             the ACC

(Operations),     and left Superintendent Murray in charge of the operation in

Police Control.



We attended the Board Room within the Directors Lounge at the football club

and saw officials of both clubs and the F.A.




I was asked for an assessment of the situation and I told them there had

been a serious incident and a large number of casualties.




I was told by one gentleman that he had seen two dead supporters on the

pitch.



I related the situation as I saw it at that time, and that in my view the

game would have to be postponed but that I did not want this communicating

to the crowd.



The reasons for this were that they may create an additional public order




                                             14
problem - at this stage I did not have the manpower to deal with this - and

it was   essential         that   all   the    casualties and dead were removed from the

area before any announcements were made.



It was   agreed      the    game would be postponed               but    that no one     in the crowd

would be told until I gave permission.                   Mr. Jackson reinforced this, and we

very quickly left.



I returned to the Police Control Box with ACC (Operations) and continued to

monitor the situation.             The rescue was progressing, we now had fatalities

and a temporary mortuary had been arranged in the gymnasium.



I was approached in the Police Control Box by Mr. Clough and Mr. Dalgleish.




They asked for an assessment                  of the situation and whether or not the game

was postponed.            I told them         it was my intention to postpone the game               but

asked them not to tell anyone and gave my reasons for this.



Mr. Clough left but I asked                   Mr. Dalgleish to make an announcement to the

Liverpool fans for calm and to bear with us for the time being.




It is my view that this was beneficial to the operation.



The rescue operation progressed and eventually, about 4 pm that afternoon,

 there   was    only one      casualty        awaiting    transportation       to hospital    and the

 point had arrived where the crowd could be told of the situation.




 I   asked     for   an    assurance     that    all     trains    and    buses   were   available    to
transport the supporters away from the ground, all available officers were

patrolling the streets and that we were ready for the crowd dispersal.




The    final      ambulance     left   the   ground    and   an   announcement      was   made    by

Superintendent Murray to the crowd that the match had been postponed and

they were asked to leave.



The crowd applauded the decision and left without any major difficulty.




After the ground and the surrounding area had cleared Chief Superintendent

Mole arrived and took over responsibility for the ground.



I left the Police Control Box with Mr. Jackson and walked across the pitch

to    the    Police     Room.     We   met   with Mr.    Barron,    a Director      of Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club, and passed comment about the                    disaster - he was in

tears but praised the             police operation.



I left the football ground for Force Headquarters about 5-15 pm, together

with        the    Assistant      Chief      Constable (Operations)Mr.        Jackson       and

Superintendent Marshall.



On    arrival      at   Force    Headquarters,    about           5-^5 pm,   Imet   with theDeputy

Chief Constable, Mr. Hayes, and in due course the Chief Constable.



About 9 pm that evening I left Force Headquarters for Niagara Police Sports

Ground to meet the Minister for Sport who was due to arrive by helicopter

 to meet with the Chief Constable.




                                                  16
He arrived about 10.20         pm and          I escorted himtothe football groundwhere

he met with Mr. Wright,        the Chief Constable.



I was present whilst he        toured          the ground andmetwith the        press.




When   he    concluded   his   visit to   the    football   stadium,   I escorted him    to

Force Headquarters to see Mr. Hayes, the Deputy Chief Constable.




I returned      to the Police Sports       & Social Club at Niagara and counselled

officers who had been involved in the events                that afternoon who had just

retired from duty.



I eventually returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and went off duty at

1. 3 0 am.

  Further to our discussion in connection with the John Motson commentary on the
  BBC video (our ref MAP 7) I have had the tape examined and the following are
  the timings and the comments made:-

        1. 15.04.07

       "I think there may be a slight overflow in the crowd at the Liverpool end,
   at Leppings Lane end of the ground.  But there is room in the sections to
   either side if they can shift them over."

        2. 15.05.34

       "I can only think thats overcrowding.                   It doesn’t look to me to be any sort
   of misbehaviour.”

        3. 15.10.11

       "I have to say that it was crushing that seems from here to have caused
   accidents and the injuries."

  With regard to the plan of the eround. I have arranged for a scale plan to be
  prepared which will include the lettering and numbering of the gates and
  turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end. It will be produced on A3 size which can
  then be reduced to or folded to A4 size.




    PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                  Sheffield
With regard to M r _________ who wrote to the Football Association and the Sports
Minister about last year’s game, I enclose a statement taken from him.

With regard to the traffic delays for Liverpool fans attending the match, work
is in hand to produce a summary note on this subject.

I am arranging for a visit to the ground for 0845 hours on Thursday 1st June to
view the communications arrangements and the CCTV facilities.  These aspects
will be demonstrated by a South Yorkshire Police Officer not directly involved
in the incident.  Chief Superintendent Pemberton will be in attendance to
advise on the specific aspects from a general police point of view.

With regard to the levels of manpower, with effect from Friday I will have
reduced to a total of 125 officers involved on enquiries on behalf of Lord
Justice Taylor and H M Coroner. There will be 38 here in Sheffield, 33 in
Liverpool and 54 at Nechells in Birmingham.  In addition there will be 22
civilian staff. Most of those people who contacted the inquiry either by
writing to Lord Justice Taylor, to yourself, to us, or to others have been
contacted where they are thought to be material witnesses. Questionnaires have
been completed in every case and statements in most.

Enquiries will continue to re-interview many of the fans who were in pens 3 and
4 specifically to identify where they were, who they were alongside and
whether they were witnesses to deaths or injuries.   In particular we will be
attempting to identify the precise time that the crash barrier collapsed. I do
not intend to interview any other categories of persons outside those pens
unless something specifically emerges from the analysis phase on the
information we have gathered.   The analysis should be able to begin in earnest
in about one month’s time. As you appreciate we have a considerable amount of
information whic’h has not yet been processed owing to the need to supply
Treasury Solicitors for the oral hearings.

I trust that this information is of some assistance.

At a pp ro x im a te l y           1.30 pm the S pi cn Kop on the South Stand were                                        fairly

full      but     I noticed that              the N orth Stanbd that was                      opposite a pp ea re d t

be empty-             1 remember           particulary noticing                   the shortage                in the N o rt h

Stand       but      I cannot         recall        how    full the West Stand was at this                                 time.

 However        by S. 3 0 p m        I can recall           that the           central       area of the West Star

 was weel           o c c u pi e d but      the outer wings               of this      area significantly                       not

 well     occupied.               I now this terrace                   area well     because at the same

 fixture         last yea;           I a ct ua l ly stood on tha                  central       terrace of the West

 top of the            radio        fencing.         On looking across                this year               I was aware o^

  either        Police Officer               or S te wards at thece gates.

  At ar ou nd 3. 0 0 p m            I became        aware of what appeared to me of                                crowd

  surging           in t h e ' sect io n of the We*t End terracing and                                  it gave the

             or 5 mninutes               after       the game ending        it became apparent that the^e was

             a serious           s ituation and          casulaties were          being     brought out.           At this

             point Pol ic e action seemed to change                            but to despite this there

             •appeared to still                 be surging        in the    back of the        crowd.       I would also

              say that           for at       least half an hour           there was       still    no co-ordination o

              action by t h e Police.                    I would say though that              the P o l i c e ,    St Johns

              very hard at an                  individual       level.

              As time        p r og re ss ed         I became    aware    of the seriousness of the situatior

              as more and more                  casulaties were          receiving first aid such as mouth-tc

                injured          lying        down*     I recall an ambulance            coming onto the pitch and

                 at the time why does                   it, just drive across           the   pitch.

              The who 1 e are« was           packed solid to the           point were   it       j^oaible          '

              personal          safety.     As the     result    of the crush an urnt-eUla           I was

              holding       in n-y hand, was          .r*P("d    in half agaln»t      the crush barrier         in

              fror-t of me,           I would emphasis*          that the    concern over safety        related

              to th* shear           numbers admitted           and not    to crowd behaviour »hat was

              good.        My    concern over safety            was such and at times         it was   impassatl

              to breathe          that at half time when there was movement                   for toilets,

              refreshments           etc    I mana ge d to extricate myself           from the terrace,

              having taken the              view that my        personal    safety was more      important      tha

              w at c hi ng      the second half.          This    unfortunate    overcrowding spoiled for

               get many         people what would and should have been a pleasant and

               e njoyable f o ot balling             occas^ion.

               S uc h w ith my        concern that       I wrote    to the Secreatry of the FA Mr

               Crocker          setting     out what    had     taken plac e and asked me how

               over cr ow di ng wit h the direct                impact    on, crowd safety was allowed          to

               occur        in an ail       ticket match.         I wrote    in similar    terms to the

               Minis te r        of Sport Rt Ho C.B.          Moynihar      but for some inexplicable           rea

               my tem po ra ry secretary addressed this                     letter to

                                                       and regretably        1 failod to notice this mist

                I       received    neither    a cknowledgement          or reply to either      of these      lett

                1 was       therefore       particulary       concerned that having          pointed out a

                serious          o ve rc rowding     problems    that occured     in the     1988,   that such

                a p pa ul in g     tragedy should        be allowed to develop on the            15th April      19

                I Should say that              not    receiving aletter       from the Minister        of S port

                maybe       u nd er st an di ng on the letter wrongly addressed.

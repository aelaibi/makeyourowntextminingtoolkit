ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE FOR THE HILLSBOROUGH TASK TEAM

1      When a person is referred to the Hillsborough Task team a
       HERALD INFORMATION SYSTEM referral form should be completed
       (see example 1)

2      On completion of the referral form and within two working days
       the form should bq passed to the Admin staff who will:

     •i        Create or amend a computer record

       ii      Create or update the persons computer log sheet.

       iii     Return the referral form to the filing system in,the
               social work team room.

       If a social worker has taken a referral and is planning to visit
       the p,erson they should check with the Admin team to see if the
       person is already known. If they are, the Admin team will be able
       to provide background information held.

       For each subsequent visit to a person who has already been
       referred, a HERALD INFORMATION SYSTEM continuation sheet (see
       example 2) should be completed.

       On returning from the visit, or within 2 working days, these
       sheets should be passed to the Admin staff who will:

       a)     Amend the persons record with any new information

       b)     Amend the agency page information with date last seen.
              seen by   .......

       d)     The form will then be returned to the filing system in
              the social work team room. An entry should be made on the
              persons Computer update Log Sheet.

       When information is received about people and a computer record
       needs to be set up, first check to see if the person is already
       known (using update)

       i     If they are, check that information tallies (if it does not
              explain to the Admin Assistant) amend anything that needs it.

       ii    If they are not known create a record (see ccmputer system
              instructions)

      When a telephone call is received

       a)    If it is a referral for social work transfer it to the
              social work team (if they are all out, complete a referral
              form, and say someone will ring back).

       b)     If it is a reauest for helc/information etc write it in the
              log book, in the appropriate columns.
c)   In the majority of cases do not give information without
     either:        -

     i     The person requesting it being   known to us. -

     ii    Checking it*out with the Admin Assistant or team leader.

     iii   Saying to the person you will ring them back.

The Admin Assistant should check through    the Log Book at the
beginning of each week to:                               ^

a)   Tick off in red action completed, when all the items on
     a page have been actioned put a red tick in the top corner
     of the page.   ‘

b)   follow up any items without a tick, or that need dealing with.

On leaving the building or returning social work staff should call
in at the Admin Office to record where they are on the signing in and
out board. (So Admin staff know when someone will be in and for
security and fire drill purposes).

For information about security of offices and the computer system
staff should refer to guidelines and procedures for the information
base.

Office equipment and stationery when requested should be coded to
the Disaster Fund (R FA 900 .... then the appropriate code) and
ordered direct from General Admin.

Staff should familiarise themselves with information about the
Library on the Library Information Sheet, check fire procedure
notices, and closing times.

Rooms in the Library can be booked for meetings by contacting
Rae or Pat in Libraries Personnel (4709) explain who you are and    ""
which rooms you would like to book and the dates.

The social work team leader and Admin Assistant both have a set
of keys for the Library.

The Admin Assistant has a spare key for the desks and filing
cabinets.-

Post, typing and photocopying is taken to Meade House, there
is a "Meade House" basket in the Admin Room, and a Task Team
post box at Meade House. Post needs to be collected and sent
each day.

The filing system in the Admin team room should be kept up to
date, and reviewed regularly to remind everyone what information
is held.

APPENDIX 9
         _   -   CLASSIFICATION CODES

People are given Classification codes according to the classifications
quoted by Beverley Raphael in her book 'When Disaster Strikes'. This
provides for six levels as follows:

        Primary victims:  Those in the front line who have experienced
        maximum exposure to the cat astrophic event.

        Secondary victims:      Griev in g relatives and friends of the
        primary victims.

        Third-level victims:   Rescue and recovery personnel who might
        "neeid help to maintain their functional efficiency during any
        operation and to cope with traumatic psychological effects
        afterwards".

        Fourth-level victims:  The community involved in the disaster,
        including those who converge, who altruistically offer help,
        who share the grief and loss, or who are in some way
        responsible.

        Fifth-level victims:  People whose emotional equilibrium is
        such that, even though not dir ectly involved in the disaster,
        they may be precipitated into states of distress or
        disturbance.

        Sixth-level victims:  Those who, but for chance, would have
        been primary victims themselves, who persuaded others to the
        course that made them victims, or who are in some way
        indirectly or vicariously involved.

However, this classification may not necessarily be available at the
time of initial entry of the person to the system, so the default is
zero .

    COPING          AFTER           HILLSBOROUGH
  A chance to meet up with other people from Merseyside and
  Sheffield, together with colleagues from further afield, who
  are involved in Hillsborough work.

  This will be an opportunity for those who feel isolated to
  make links with other workers.
  For those who don't feel isolated but would like the chance
  to discuss with others how the work is going, this is your
  opportunity t o o .

  The theme will be linking up and exchanging ideas.  We will
  also be looking at how to take care of yourself whilst
  managing demanding emotional work and handling feelings of
  uncertainty: such as how much to push families and when to
  leave things be; worries about suicide risk; how to help
  people express their anger safely.

  We can also exchange ideas on how to be pro-active and
  encourage people who were at the match to come forward if
  they are finding it hard to cope.

  We are very fortunate to be offered the resource of
  Burton Manor, a Conference Centre in South Wirral, close
  to the end of the M.56 motorway, for our meeting.   This
  resource has been donated free of charge by the Principal of
  Burton Manor as a contribution towards the Hillsborough effort.

  For those people who are travelling some distance, we have
  a lso been offered accommodation on the preceding evening
  if you need it (it would probably be possible to arrange it
  on the night of the Conference as well if you let me kn o w ) .
  Accommodation will also be free of charge.

  The Conference is being arranged by             , an experienced
  Training Consultant, Bereavement Counsellor and Crisis
  Intervention Worker.  She has been appointed as the Staffline
  Co-ordinator on Merseyside by the seven Local Authorities
  involved in Hillsborough work, in conjunction with B.A.S.W.
  to co-ordinate an independent staff consultation and support
  scheme.

  It is important that you let her know as soon as possible
  whether you wish to attend the Conference, so she can send
  you details of how to get there and let Burton Manor know
  about expected numbers.   We appreciate that some people will
  be on holiday and are considering holding another Conference
  later in the year.

3. Please note, it may only be possible at this stage to offer
   places to people who are directly involved in face to face
   work with bereaved families and people present at the match,
   in terms of limited space.  Numbers are insignificant.
   If you are working with only one person affected by Hillsborough
   this Conference is for you too.

             You will note that we will be meeting at 10.00.a.m. for
             co f fe e.

             The Conference won't be very formal.  As you can see, there
             will be plenty of opportunity for meeting and talking with •
             other people on a small group basis as well as over coffee
             and m e a l s .

             For those people staying overnight on the 16th, dinner will
             be available from 6.45.p.m.  I will be there from 6.00.p.m.
             onwards to meet you and will be staying overnight.  I would
             be grateful*if you would let me know by return if you will
             require dinner.

             I look forward to meeting you and to a Conference which
             stimulates and supports you in your work with people who
             are learning to survive this tragedy with your help.

            Yours sincerely,

EFFECT ON INCOME SUPPORTV-PAYMENTS FROM DISASTER APPEAL FUNDS

1 If money paid is compensation for personal injury to claimant or
partner and is put into Trust, then DSS will ignore the value of the
Trust for 2 years or longer if reasonable.

Any payments made from the Trust will count in full as income or
capital depending on whether the payment is made in a lump sum or on a
weekly basis.                                              -.

If the money is not put into a Trust it will   be counted in full.


2 Money put into Trust for a child following a personal injury    (to
the child) will be ignored until such time as the child ceases    to be
treated as your dependent.


3 Money paid to the next of kin of people deceased will be counted in
full as capital or income depending upon the nature of the payment.


WHAT EFFECT DOES CAPITAL HAVE ON INCOME SUPPORT?


If you have more than £6,000 in capital you cannot claim Income
Support (Capital includes cash, premium bonds, National Savings
certificates etc).

If you have capital between £3,000 and £6,000 DSS assume you receive
£1 per week as income for every £250 or part you have over £3,000.

Therefore if you have £3,501 DSS will reduce your Income Support by £3

WHAT IF YOU HAVE OVER £6,000 CAPITAL

DSS will not allow you to "give the money away" or "spend it un­
reasonably" in order that you can claim Income Support.

However, it would be reasonable for you to spend some of your
capital on say:

paying off some of your mortgage,
going on holiday if you needed to get away following bereavement,
pay off any debts you may have, eg HP or rent arrears.

 It may be possible to use your capital "reasonably" in other ways but
 it would be advisable to seek advice from your local Citizen’s
 Advice        before doing so.

                                 STATEMENT BY MR H HADFIELD


                                 On Saturday,  15 April 1989* I attended the football fixture
                                 at Hillsborough involving Nottingham Forest Football Club and
                                 Liverpool.   I was off duty,     in plain clothes,     and was
                                 accompanied by my son who is aged 2*4 and two colleagues.

                                 We travelled to Sheffield by private car which I parked near
                                 to Hammerton Road Police Station.     We walked from there to
                                 the football ground and at about 2.20 pm walked by the
                                 Leppings Lane Stand from the western end towards the side of
                                 the ground allocated to the Nottingham supporters,            I
                                 therefore walked by the turnstiles where subsequently a
                                 disaster took place.    At about 2.3-5 Pm the road leading to
                                 the turnstiles was very crowded indeed,         and there were
                                 mounted officers amongst the crowds trying to get to the
                                 turnstiles.    I would describe the scene as very crowded and
                                 congested but this, in itself, did not cause me any alarm.
                                 What did strike me however is that on the periphery of that
                                 congested area were hundreds Of supporters who X would
                                 describe as boisterous. There were certainly some who were
                                  worse for drink. It was also very noticeable that there were
                                  many people who had no tickets and I was asked on at least a
                                  dozen occasions if I had any tickets for sale. I did not get
                                  the impression that the officers at the turnstiles entrance
                                  were unable to control the entrance, although it was very
                                  apparent that there was dense congestion.   I walked alongside
                                  the river down to the main road and turned left towards the
                                  Side of the ground allocated to the Nottingham Forest
                                  supporters •   I made my way through the entrance xnto the
                                  South Stand, Gangway 5* Row Y. I reached my seat, which was
                                  at the very back of the stand, 'at about 2.35 P"1-

                                     I immediately noticed that the Liverpool supporters in the
                                     Leppings   Lane Stand were extremely dense and        crowded
                                     immediately behind the goal. This was made more noticeably
                                     so as the two extremities of that stand were relatively quiet
                                     and there were certainly open spaces and it was very apparent
                                     that the crowd needed to be dispersed more in that stand.

                                     As it neared 3.00 pm 1 was conscious that some spectators
                                     from the centre part of the Leppings Lane Stand were being
                                     bodily lifted into the air and into the seated stand above
                                     them.   My first impression was that these people were
                                     unlawfully gaining access to the seated area. It was equally
                                     apparent, however,   that the area from which they were
                                     escaping was extremely tightly packed and that the side areas
                                     which I referred to earlier had by then filled.

                                     The game commenced at 3*00 pm but I found that my attention
                                     was still drawn to that stand where it was obvious that there
                                     was a problem and I noticed that police officers were
                                     beginning to stand on the perimeter wall facing the crowd and
                                     spectators were trying to climb over the barrier fence.    It
                                     was very clear, even from where X was, that this action was
                                     not motivated by either fighting or an attempt at a pitch
iJ-03   09-'24   NottsPolice S Lodge Admin   0602 670400        P. 03




  invasion.   I say this because in my experience the behaviour
  of the crowd around would have been different. Suddenly the
  area at the back of the goal was filled with spectators and
  police and I assume that it was at that point that a gate had
  been opened and there was an immediate incursion on to the
  playing area which, again, was quite apparently not a
  deliberate pitch invasion and I saw a senior officer run
  towards the centre of the field and gain the attention of the
  referee. The game ended and the pitch incursion increased.
  At no time did 1 feel that this was a pitch invasion or an
  attempt by    Liverpool   supporters to stop the game or
  antagonise the Nottingham supporters or even fight amongst
  themselves.   From that point onwards it was difficult to
  maintain a clear view of what had taken place behind the
  goal. My seat was approximately 50 yards from the scene and
  there quickly became so many people involved and police
  officers that it was difficult to see any detail.

  There followed a period of twenty minutes or so when the
  pitch incursion grew and it was obvious that some people had
  been injured.There were undoubtedly     some  spectators who
  were behaving   in a disorderly manner and    one particular
  individual gained the attention of the entire stadium by
  approaching the opposite end of the ground and gesticulating
  at the crowd.      He was arrested and that    arrest caused
  spontaneous applause from the crowd.

  I feel I can add little further in terms of individual
  conduct which     will not be adequately described in the
  television photographs which were taken.  1 have considerable
  experience in handling football crowds having served earlier
  in Greater Manchester and policed the First Division grounds
  in that area, and having been the Assistant Chief Constable
  (Operations)  in Derbyshire and policed matches there which
  have been the subject of Football League Inquiries due to
  crowd disorder involving clubs like Chelsea and Leeds.      I
  would not wish to comment on the manner in which the policing
  arrangements unfolded as I have insufficient knowledge of
  what was being transmitted as information to those on duty,
  save to make the following general observations:

  1.      In a very short period of time there were ample police
           officers on the playing area       to deal with any
           incidents which may have unfolded.      I would assume
           their number to have been well in excess of 200.     A
           considerable amount of their effort was        clearly
           centred upon preventing the pitch incursion moving
           towards the Nottingham end. On at least two occasions
           they prevented small waves of supporters so doing.

  2.      I left the ground, as it was apparent there had been a
           serious incident, at about 3-30 pm.     I particularly
           Felt that some form of public announcement should have       i
           been made. There may be factors which prevented this
           but the Nottingham supporters immediately close to me
           were incensed by what they clearly interpreted as a
           pitch invasion and some form of information to them
           would have altered the temperature of the remaining
           spectators who were not involved.

  3*      In terms of the allocation of sections of the ground
           to the two Clubs, I feel that it was correct in
03   09^25   NottsPolice S Lodge Admin   0602 670400        P.04




       policing terms to allocate the stands to Nottingham
       which were most accessible from a southern approach on
       the Ml*

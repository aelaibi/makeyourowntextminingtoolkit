roughly where                      to    go as         there       were       a    lot    of    cars        parked        and      people

going          to    the       Match.            We     had       parked          about       three-quarters                of a m i l e         from

     arrived            at      the     turnstiles              it     seemed          that      they       weren't          operating                 as       no

                  passed       out     shortly            after           and     I'm s u r e          he'd     died.

                  would       die.        There          was       people        that           had    fallen         d o w n all        over       the     place.

                   People       were       trying             to    avoid        standing              on    them,




                 There        were     people            trying           to    climb           onto    the     pitch        from        the    Pen,         A

                  lot    were       panicking.                  The       police        obviously              did     not       know      what       was

                  happening.              They       were          pushing           people           back     into        the     Pen.        People

                 were        screaming         at        t he      police,           telling           them     what        wa s    happening,               They

                  obviously           could       do      nothing.

People        started           to       pass     people         out        of    the     Pen    forward,           over      th e       fence




A    couple        of     police          had     started          helping           at    this       point,         I could             see

th at      there        was     a    line       of    police        across           the     centre          line.        I c o u l d n ’t

think        what       they        were      doing.         They           should        have     been       helping.             There

were       others         at    the       Liverpool          end who              w e r e n ’t h e l p i n g       either.           I

couldn't           think        why.          It wa s       as     if       they     didn't        care.




To    the     left        of me          I saw       the    fence        get       ripped        up    by     supporters             and       a

The     Pen       started           to    e m p t y a bit          and       I cobid         see      bodies        all      over        the

but     I'm       s ure    some          were    dead.




I ha d       helped        lift          a few       people        forward,             lifting        them        over      our     heads

out     of    the       Pen,



I helped           another           lad w h o        had    obviously               had     some      drink.           He    was

conscious           but        was       obviously          not     well.            Eventually              me   and     some       others

g o t h i m o nto          th e      pit c h ,




     eventually            got       out     onto      the       pitch           with     thi      g ir 1                    and     her

     iter                       she       had also          been        in the Pen.

A    long     t ime     after        this      had     started          I sa w a        policeman        open    the    gate

was     after        I "d got        out     o nt o    the       pitch    which was           about      3.30pm    (1 5 3 0) .

There        was     s t ill    a    lot     of    people         in the Pen.




I    could       see    loads        of     people      laying          on the      pitch.        Quite        a few    I'm       su.

were       dead.




At    no     t ime     did     I witness          a    c r i m i n a l -offence.




                     s eriously           i.n j u r e d m y s e I f .

b ack      and     rimit       shoulder.




The     only announcement                    that      was       made    wa s    one    to    cle a r    the    pitch.        I

c a u l d n ’t be Ii eve            it.




I eventually             left        the     Ground         at    about       5.20pm      (1720)        on the    advice

of a S t e w a r d .           The    Ground          was    virtually           empty       then.




I think          the    main        factors       that       contributed           to    t his    disaster        wass-



1       No    police         organisation              of    crowds       outside        t he    turnstiles.




2       Too      much    delay        in     realising            what    wa s    happening          o nc e    incident

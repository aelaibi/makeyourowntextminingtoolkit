               been open on the               route from the m o t o r w a y to the ground.                              I

At about           2-10    pm      (1410)        we a r r i v e d at       the ground.            M a n y -fans were

loosely       c on g r e g a t e d and moving                    f r e e l y about.       The t u rnstiles were

aui'te quiet             with approximately                      ten to fifteen           people      in each queue 4_,

My    carrier         bag was        s e a r ch ed         by a Policeman.               Once    inside      the
                                                             ’                                                              j.
t u r n s t il e    it was         a ga in easy            Vo— Drove sbo.ut fr e e l y and           my young        brother

bought       a ‘p r o g r a m m e ,        My    carrier          bag    was    s e a r c h e d a gain by a P o l i c e m a

inside       the t u rnstile.                   I v i s i t e d the Gents           and then we made               our way

tn the       t e r ra c i n g - the             c e n t r e - section.         Walking       thro u g h the        tunnel    t

the    t e r ra c i n g was         not     difficult,              there was       no    pushing or         crowding at

that     stage.           On       reaching          the    terrace we found              that     it was     already

n u ’te full .            We     d ec i d e d to move             to the       right     (looking at         the    pitch)

away from the tunnel.



Two of us            reached         the    point          about        ten yards       from the      pitch fence          and

r e a l i s e d we were             separated          from the          other     two.      On seeing         them highe

up we made             our way up to the                    crowd to join them about                       fifteen to

twe n t y yards           away from the                perimeter           fence a n d five yards              from the

fence       s ep a r a t i n g      the    centre and side                 sections       of the terracing.



Between 2.20               pm      (1420)       and 3.0 0          pm    (1500)    we    gra d u a l l y    became more

 a nd more          t ig h t l y    packed.           Much more           so than even           in a tight        crowd on

 the A n f i e l d Hop.              It became             so tight        that    o c c a s i o n a l l y surges     of

 pushing           and    pressure         did not a c t u a l l y          cause       any m o v ement       of note.

 Occasional              groans      of    pain were              heard.       I specifically mentioned                    to m

 friend       " I t ’s so tight                 in her e . t h a t we are          not     even surging at all,

 just     o s c il l a t i n g more             or   less    on the        spot."



 I n o t i c ed that            despite          this       increase       in pressure           in the      centre

 section,           fans       on the other                side of the fence              (ie.    in the side sectia

 to our        right)          were m oving            about fr e e l y and that section did not                           ..
                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                  S771

appear     to     be fill i n g        2   1 all.



I looked up from                time       to time     to the front of the                 stand above            and

behind us - there was                      a Po l i c e S e r geant    there         o b serving      the
                                                       'Z

A few     p ol ic e m e n on the             pitch side       of the       perimeter         fence       did not        seen

to have        n ot i c e d    (1)    how t i g ht~we were           packed and            (2)   that     the     side

s ect i o n was       n o t i c e a b l y more       empty.



Fans    began to express                   their     discomfort        by criticising              the    ground.          11

brought        no r e s ponse         in terms        of a c t i o n from the           police.



I v ag u e l y     remember          a tannoy        announcement          asking       us to move          down to

thp front         - there were               ironic     jeers     from the       crowd       in response           to

this.



The     game     started.            I didn't        feel    any surge         in terms          of m o v e m e n t -

just a no t h e r        n o t i c ea bl e     increase       in the       by now abnormal              level     of     bod;

 pressure        all      round.           People    stood     on barriers            in front and shou t e d

 “G^t    back,       get      back.”          This was        impossible,        we were          all    pinned

 s t a t i on ar y by the            pressure       from front,        sides and back.



 P o l i c e m e n at     the    perimeter          fence at        last    seemed to notice                the

 problem.          The        gate was       opened.         A policeman tried               in vain to           pull    a

 fan out.           I could not             see    the game w h i c h had star t e d never m ind what

 was    h ap pe n i n g       on the       t e rracing      below    us.       The    policeman          looked     very

 w o r r i e d and s e e m ed to shout                into    his    radio as         he   looked to his            left

 and my        right.          I got       the    i m p r e s s i o n he was    saying       “Stop       it,    stop     it,

 stop     it" ~ I a s s u m e d he meant^_the match.                                                                      _____

Of    the    si;-: minutes        of the m a t c h         (I heard        later     it was     six minutes)           1

an eye       on my y oung         brother wijipwa's            pressed firmly against                   the side

fence       a few yards          away.      He see m e d okay but                I c o u l d n ’t get   near    him

anyway .



Fans    se e m e d to spill            over the front              perimeter       fences      but they were

walk i n g    and     running       although obviously                shaken,



The m a t c h s to p p e d and man y               police     a r r i v e d at the      perimeter       fence.



Fans    next       to the      side     fence       had begun to           climb over       in small      numbers

to    reach the        side      s ec t i o n of terracing.                A very distraught            young     man

on the other           side      of the      fence        (he had     p reviously        been    in the       centre

section)          shou t e d    "Get over          the    fence - t h e y ’re getting            s q u ashed at

the    bottom,"



One    by one        fans      climbed over,             I f o l l o w e d my brother       over    and by then

I saw       the    first       of the    injured or dead being                    lifted out       at   the

front.        I im m e d i a t e l y    headed for           the    pitch gate.          At the gate          there

were    two       or three       pol i c e m e n    inside     the terrace an d one              or two on the

trackside.            I shou t e d      "I'm a doctor,              let me on the          pitch."        I was

pushed awa y          as a body was           passed t h r o u g h         (having      been    lifted over        th

side    fence        and    carried to the gate                in the side           sect i o n where      I by

then was          situated).           I put my foot           on the wall and a p o l iceman calle

me as       I leapt up.           My head struck              the    crossbar        of the gate with a

heavy       blow.      Adrenalin         coursing          t h r o u g h my body rendered the              blow

virtually          painless       but    I fe 11.Jixnsteady for              a few seconds.                       — .

pulseless.            I knelt        next to linn ’thumped and thum p e d his                        chest    hard

three      times.          I c o mmenced m o u t h to m o u t h           resuscitation and              instructe

the ma n next          to me to give               cardiac mass a g e         in the      ratio 3-1.          I made

a conscious           d e ci si on     "This man was            one of the first             o u t , therefore,

give     him a decent             chance      at     cardiopulmonary            resuscitation. ,r"



As we      con t i n u e d to give CPR               I s h o u t e d to nearby        pol i c e m e n to find

out     if we     could get a D e f i b r i l l a t o r           and some oxygen.              We    con t i n u e d

w ith CPR and          I      d i s co v e r e d my assistant           was     a mal e      nurse.



We were       by now          s ur ro u n d e d    by m i l l i n g   figures    in black -          p o licemen an

policewomen.            A distr a u g h t          teenage      fan came over an d             put    his    face       up

to that       of the          body and y e l l e d words              like "Come on mate,            don't      die,

y ou    can't die,            yo u ' r e   a Liv e r p o o l    fan."     I     was    told that         there was               n

Defibrillator              but    I was     given an ox y g e n         cylinder an d          infor m e d that              i

was     s w i t c h e d on.       I pulled the flimsy ventimask                       off     the    tube    and    put

the open tube              in my own m o u t h           to enrich the oxygen                in the air       I was

giving      to the         patient.



We     c o ntinued w i t h CPR.              I soon       realised nothing             was    coming     out of         th

tube.       The    valve was           turned on and             I looked at          the gauge w h i c h

s h o w e d an e mpty tank.                I discarded           the tube.



People      kept      coming       up an d shouting              advice       and I kept       inf o r m i n g them

that     I was     a doctor          and knew what             I was    doing.

                                                                                                                 S771

A g e n t l e m a n w i th a blazer and tie                  ind i c a t e d he was         a doctor and gave

encouragement.



Ten minutes             passed.       The    patient        seemed    to have         lost       some    of his
                                                                                                                        -



cyanosis          but    he was      still    pulseless,            A-t ten minutes              I said    "Five

more."           By now there was            3 c a cophony         of sound ar o u n d me and from the

terracing.              However,      as    I was    s u r r o u n d e d by    people ma i n l y standing,

I could          not see       anything       that was      h a ppening        at the front             of the

centre       section.          A dis tr a u g h t    young      fan was "making it difficult                      for

me    to    concen t r a t e    and    I asked a p o l i c e m a n to           "Get       rid of him."           He

g ently e s c o r t e d the          fan away.



At about          f if te en minu t e s      I was    about        to say to a policeman to                     cover

the    body w hen his           heart       sprang    to    life and he d e v e l o p e d a good

pulse.           He was    still      not    breathing        so    I co n t i n u e d to ventilate              him.

A policeman asked               if    I needed a str e t c h e r a n d           I said yes.              One

arrived          and we     lifted the man            bn to     it.     We     lifted and started

towards          the a m b u l a n c e w h i c h had a r r i v e d behind       the        goal.



As    I stood up          I saw for         the first        time    some      s u g g e s t i o n of the scale

of the       casualties.             To get    to the a m b u l a n c e we had to step over abou't

ten bodies.              They m o s t l y    looked      like young           men,    some       had their       heads

cove red w i t h Police              raincoats.



We had to stop every few                     paces     so    I could give            the    patient a breath

into       his    lungs.       As we       lifted him        into    the a m b u l a n c e       I saw the bodie*

of two y oung m e n a l r e a d y            in there.          I con t i n u e d     to ven t i l a t e    him witt

m o u t h to m o u t h      r e s u sc it a t i o n an d he began to make                  his    own breathing

efforts.

it is almost        impossible      to express my thoughts      at that time.        Mo

words will      do but   it felt      like a chaotic nightmare overloading            all mj

senses.


                                           -                                                 Va   ,



I told the ambulance man ancTl^pol i ce sergeant                that the man was

seriously     ill an d needed a hospital            "Now."   The ambulance man said

he   couldn't    get out.       This added to the f rustration - not helped

by my thoughts        that    in view of the       length of time he was       pulseless,

it w ould    probably be kinder- if he died*             I am sure he must have           been

sevsrly brain damaged by that              time*



I left him lying on his             side breathing on his own and asked a

policeman to try to get             him to hospital     as soon as   possible*        I said

I w ould go to see       if    I could help somebody else.           It seemed at that

time that     the    perimeter      fence was   obscured by policemen and some             fan?

trying    to get     people out of the terraces*



I s e a rched for s o m e b o d y needing help*        I stopped a group of fans

lifting a body on a makeshift              stretcher,    some of them seemed to be

trying    to do CPR*         I saw that    it was a boy a g e d about    14*     I said to

them that     if they want ed        to give him a chance,      they should stop and

do the    resuscitation        properly*



They    put him down and        I started m o u t h to m outh - filling        his   lungs

with air*       A girl   next    to me did the heart massage.           His    face was

covered w i t h vomit and he was obv i o u s l y dead so we stopped within

about    6Q seconds*



I looked d e s pe r a t e l y for   somebody not dead but seriously            ill who    neet

help*     I could not        find anybody! in that      category   in the goal area. ...
                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                    S771

They were all            either       dead or okay with nothing              in between.      I looked

up and saw three or four groups                       of people at the other            end of the

pitch giving CPR.                   I ran to 'the other         end.

                                                                                                          v   -


The first        body        I came    to was^^'m'an about 25 years old.                 A dark hairec

young w o m an       in a Celtic football                 shirt was    trying to give him CPR.             ‘1

a sked    "Has he a pulse," she                 said "I d o n ’t think        so."      I started

giving      him m outh to m ou t h as she did the                   cardiac massage.         After    a

short while we swapped over.                        Opposite me his friend             (or brother?)

was   beside       himself with o v e r w helming grief                 and distress.       He was

shouting       words         like    "Come on,      y o u ’re not dead" and looking at me and

shouting       "Keep going,            d o n ’t stop,      d o n ’t stop."



I said to the girl                  quietly    " H e ’s gone."      She   replied calmly but

o b vi o u s l y very sadly "I know."                 His    friend     (brother)      was so much    in

despair.         Another young doctor                 took my place doing heart massage.                      I’

was    hopeless.



I went      to the othe r two or three bodi e s .                      People we re do ing ve ry gooc

c a r d i o p u lm on ar y    resus c i t a t i o n but    it was   obv i o u s l y too late for them.



I said to a photograph er                    that    I hoped that the         papers were    going to

"Hammer       this     ground for what              happened today."          I told them my name ai

about the absence                of equipment.            They took a photograph despite me

telling       them not to.



I went to the            side       of the    pitch    (opposite the         players    tunnel)   and sav

quite a few          people         propped up against          the hoarding wit h somebody

helping       the m all.            I shouted that         I was a doctor and did anyb o d y neec

any help.          All       I heard in reply was            that they were all okay.             The             _
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     S771

only people         I had seen       carried up the field were dead so I headed

back to the Leppings LN end.                     I passed through the              line of policemen

across      the entrance          (what were         they doing,        I thought - not much

As    I went through I asked four                    or five of them        if they could tell tije
                                                 -                                              J            .



where there might               be injured ~*pWo pie I-eould help.                 The general       reply

was that       they couldn't and that they were sorry.



I am fairly sure that               I went      back      into the goal area at the Leppings

LN end.        I have to admit that              by now I was angry,           confused slightly

an d feeling        quite helpless-             I did definitely ask a policewoman                    "I ar

a doctor,        can you tell me where                  the   injured may have been taken so                 I

might     help?"        No she     could n o t .



There     did not seem to be much                 I could do at that end.              Some    people

lying down with            people helping            said they were okay.            I could not f i m

a n y b o d y ser i o u s l y   ill needing      help.        Just dead or seemingly minor

injuries and shaken people.



I headed towards the other end again.                           Quite a few people asked me

how   I was - I r e membered my head and my face was                          now covered       in

blood.        I kept saying         "I'm okay"           but I really didn't feel            okay.



I a k s e d the     police a g a i n where           I should go.        They did not know.



B y now the       c o m b i nation of having             been in the      crush,    trying    to do

r e s u s c i t a t io n on hopeless     cases,         trying to find others          to help,       the

a b s olute    cacophony and         confusion,           the lack of information from the

police an d the bang on my head became too much.                              I felt very a n g r y

at the w a y we had been treated.                        I knew who was to blame - the

Police.        I felt      c o mpelled to tell           some senior Liverpool          football

club official              not to 1st them blame the fans               for this.



I went      up the         players'      tunnel    saying    "I'm a doctor.          I need to see^--

so m e b o d y    in a ut ho r i t y from LFC."          These words     opened the police

line.       Outs i d e      the    changing     rj|m's: it wa-s very confused.           Lots of men

in suits,            blazers and ties.



I saw Jimmy HILL                 (BBC)   and forced him to listen to my account of wha

happened.             He   looked       pale and very concerned.             T h e n a man said "Will

you    come and say that on the air?"                       I said "Why?"          but agreed to.       He

took me a few yards to the                     laundry.      He   put headphones on and wrote

down my name.               He shou t e d into a microphone             "Tell Peter to h and over

to me now!"



Next     he was        talking and         introducing me,        and then shoved the big

m i c r o p h on e    up to my face.           I felt awful,         a ngry and upset     but   I just

s t a r t e d talking.            The    last words      I said were     "It's an absolute

d isgrace."            I meant         the way we were allo w e d to get so tightly packed

and on the            pitch the total          lack or organisation and equipment after

disaster          struck.         I said on the air that             I had seen eight to ten

dead.        In retrospect              I had probably seen about fifteen so I thought

probably twenty to thirty were dead overall.                                 The   radio men said

thank you            in a very sombre          voice.       I said    "Was    that going out      live.

He said thank you a g a in and shook my hand.



 I went      out and saw K enny DALGLISH.                    I told him what had happened and

that      he must          not   let    the fans   get the blame.            I told him that      the

 ground          (Hillsborough)          was   "Shit."      He told me that LFC were not happ1

about       the gr o u n d being          used but     these things were           out of their

 control.            He was very shaken.

A linesman or the           referee      showed me      into their    room to get     cleaned

up.     I did this and         inspected the split          in my scalp - it needed tw$-

or three     stitches       but   that    could wait      I thought*       I remember             %
                                               -                                                   J.   -



a p o l o gising    for getting      b l o o £ ’5 n V a towel - how ridiculous!



I went    back on the         pitch*     All       the bodies    had gone*    I climbed back

on the terrace          up to my brother and friends,                I saw policemen in the

now almost         empty centre section             collecting    belongings*     I told the

lads what      had happened on the             pitch.     All    of a sudden for the first

time    I felt      a searing     pain in my head and said "God,              my head harts,"



At no time at H i l l s bo r o ug h did I realise               people had died    in the

tunnel-      At     no time did I see anything             to substantiate       claims    that

policemen were          a s s ault ed or bodies were        looted.        I saw brave young

fans    trying      to save    lives     hopelessly*       I saw brave       lads organise

t hem selves       to make mak e s h i f t   stretchers     to carry the dead.          I saw

some    police      d es pe r a t e l y trying to save     lives.     I also saw some       polics

s tanding    idly - not knowing what was                 happening    or making    any attempt

to. find out.



I did not see at any time any fan                     (whether    before   or after   the brief

game)    misbehave       deliberately        in any way.



After    the game       had been a b a n d o n e d we    left the ground via the          centre

section on the tunnel.              Remembering         the fan we had resuscitated I

gave    a p o l iceman my name and address.                I felt    it very unlikely that

he w o u l d have s u r vived an d       reconciled myself          by the fact   that    if he

had he would have           been brain damaged.

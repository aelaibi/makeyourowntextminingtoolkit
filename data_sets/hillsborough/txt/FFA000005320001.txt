FA/HILLSBOROUGH

I spoke to Glen Kirton. I said we were sending round to
Graham 8 submissions. We had not received the bereaved and
injured yet although JGW had a copy. That was the only one
that was likely to make significant allegations against the
FA. We would be travelling up on Friday morning. Please
could make sure Graham and/or he could make it on Friday
morning. He said they had a meeting with the sponsor of the
FA Cup that morning. However he may be able to get
      to go.

I said there may be important points of principle to deal
with especially with regard to recommendations some of the
parties were advocating. In addition there were points on
liability that the bereaved and injured may be taking
against the FA which would be dealt with by way of oral
argument.

We had fixed up a con on Thursday afternoon at 5 oclock with
John Dyson and it would be necessary if the FA did not want
to attend to give me their comments on the submissions by
them. That basically left tomorrow and I understood that
     and Graham were at a course at Lillishall today. Glen
confirmed that was right but would phone Graham.

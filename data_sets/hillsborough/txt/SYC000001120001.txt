            In the next two cases a company was accused and it was. held liable; for
        the fault of a superior officer. In Director o f Public Prosecutions V. Kent
        and Sussex Contractors L td. [1944] K.B. 146 he was the transport manager.
        In R e x v. I. C. R . Haulage Ltd. [1944] K.B. 551 it was held that a company
        can be guilty of common law conspiracy. The act of the managing director
    B   was held to be the act of the company. I think that a passage in the judg­
        ment is too widely stated, at p. 559:
             “ Where in any particular case there is evidence to go to a jury that the
             criminal act of an agent, including his state or mind, intention, know­
             ledge or belief is the act of i.he company, a .d , in cases where the
             presiding judge so rules, whether the jury are satisfied that it has been
    q        proved, must depend on the nature of the charge, the relative position
             of the officer or agent, and the other relevant facts and circumstances
!            of the case.”
      This may have been influenced by the erroneous views expressed in the two
      Hammett cases. I think that the true view is that the judge must direct the
      jury that if they find certain facts proved then as a m atter of law they must
    D find that the criminal act of the officer, servant or agent including his state
      of mind, intention, knowledge or belief is the act of the company. I have
      already dealt with the considerations to be applied in deciding when such
      a person can and when he cannot be identified with the company. I do not
      see how the nature of the charge can make any difference. If the guilty
      man was in law identifiable with the company then whether his offence was
      serious or venial his act was the act of the company but if he was not so
    ® identifiable then no act of his, serious or otherwise, was the act of the
      company itself.
          In John Henshall (Quarries) Ltd. v. Harvey [1965] 2 Q.B. 233 a com­
      pany was held not criminally responsible for the negligence of a servant in
      charge of a weighbridge. In Magna Plant v. Mitchell (unreported)
      April 27, 1966, the fault was that of a depot engineer and again the
    F company was held not criminally responsible. I think these decisions
       were right. In the Magna Plant case Lord Parker C.J. said:
                 “ . . . knowledge of a servant cannot be imputed to the company unless
                 he is a servant for whose actions the company are criminally respon­
                 sible, and as the cases show, that only arises in the case of a company
                 where one is considering the acts of responsible officers forming the
    q            brain, or in the case of an individual, a person to whom delegation in
                 the true sense of the delegation of management has been passed.”
         I agree with what he said with regard to a company. But delegation by
      an individual is another matter. It has been recognised in licensing cases
      but that is in my view anomalous (see Vane v. Yiannopoullos [1965] A.C.
      486).
    H     The latest important authority is Series v. Poole [1969] 1 Q.B. 676.
      T hat was an appeal against the dismissal of an information that the holder
      of a carrier’s licence had failed tc keep or cause to be kept records required
      by the R oad Traffic Act 1960 with regard to the driver of a vehicle. That was

                   The appellants, a limited company with its registered
              office and place of business in Scotland, and M., a director
               of the company, were charged in England with aiding and
              abetting, counselling and procuring the causing of the death of
              six people by dangerous driving. M. had instructed an em­
              ployee of the appellant company to drive a lorry belonging to
              the company from Scotland to England. The front offside
              tyre of the lorry, as both M. and the employee well knew, was
              in a defective and dangerous condition. Whilst the employee
              was driving along a motorway at some speed in England, the
              tyre “ blew out ” and caused a head-on collision between the
              lorry and a motor car on the other carriageway of the motor­
              way, killing the six occupants of the motor car. Before
              arraignment the appellants put in written pleas to the jurisdic­
              tion of the English court but those pleas were refused by the
             judge. Both the company and M. were convicted. On
              appeal, on the grounds that where the dangerous driving ‘
              alleged arose not from the manner of the driving but by
              reason of some defect in the vehicle, there could be no such
              offence as counselling and procuring the causing of death by
             dangerous driving; and that the offence was completed when
             the driver set out from his Scottish base and was not therefore
             triable before an English court:—
                  Held, dismissing the appeals, (1) that the appellants, having ,
             instructed their employee to drive a heavy vehicle knowing
             that it had a dangerously defective tyre and that there was
             a serious risk of harm resulting to other road users, were
             guilty of counselling and procuring the causing of death by
             dangerous driving of persons killed in an accident caused by
             the bursting of the tyre (post, p. 72c-f).

                  (2)    That the appellants were guilty, not of some self-
             subsisting crime, but of participating in the crime committed
             by the principal offender, namely, causing death by dangerous
             driving which was committed in England by their employee

      A p p e a ls from Fisher J.
     On February 24, 1969, the appellants, Robert Millar (Contractors)
 Ltd. and R obert Millar, were convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court on
 six counts of aiding and abetting, counselling and procuring causing death
 by dangerous driving. The appellant, Robert Millar, lived at Bridge of B
 Weir, Scotland, and the appellant company, Robert M illar (Contractors)
 Ltd., of which he was a director, was registered at Bridge of Weir also.
 The appellant R obert Millar had on June 5, 1968, instructed an employee
of the company, one Anthony Hart, to drive a heavily laden lorry south
into England. On the return journey the next day, whilst the lorry was
being driven north on the M 6 motorway near Newton-le-Willows in
Lancashire, the front offside tyre burst, with the result that the lorry
crashed through the central reservation on the motorway and collided
head-on with a motor car travelling south. The six occupants of the
motor car were killed. The driver was tried and convicted on six counts
of causing death by dangerous driving at the same time as the appellants:
he did not appeal against that conviction. Before arraignment on the
indictments both appellants entered written pleas to the jurisdiction of
the English court on the grounds that any acts of aiding and abetting were
committed in Scotland.

   F is h e r J. The charges against Anthony H art, R obert Millar and              >
Robert Millar (Contractors) Ltd. in this indictment are that Anthony Hart
caused the death of six people by driving in a manner dangerous to the
public and that Robert M illar and R obert M illar (Contractors) Ltd. aided
and abetted, counselled and procured those offences.
   Mr. Wright, on behalf of Robert M illar and R obert Millar (Contractors)     F
Ltd., has put in a plea to the jurisdiction of the court and he has quite
correctly done so at this stage of the trial before the defendants have
been arraigned. The plea reads as follows in the case of the defendant
company:
       “ Robert M illar (Contractors) Ltd. say that the court ought not to
       take cognisance of the indictment against them because: The court G
       has no jurisdiction to try the defendants on charges of being an
       aider and abettor . . . when the acts of aiding and abetting counselling
       and procuring alleged in the indictment if committed were committed
       outside the jurisdiction of the court namely in Scotland where the       ’
       defendants’ registered office and place of business is situated.”        >
The plea in the case of the defendant Robert M illar reads:                     H
        . . the court ought not to take cognisance of the indictment against
      me because: There is no evidence in the depositions of any act or
                                                                                                               57

                                           omission by me committed within the jurisdiction and therefore the
                                           court has no jurisdiction to try me on the charges laid in the
                                           indictment.”
                                        In order to make the plea intelligible, I should state shortly what is
bert M iliar (Contractors)          alleged against the defendants. Before I do that, I should say that Alfred
.iverpool Crown Court on            George Keats, the clerk of the court, has joined issue on behalf of the
d procuring causing death
                                    Queen with that plea.
Millar, lived at Bridge of BJ     B     The charge arises out of a terrible accident on the M 6 Motorway
)bert M illar (Contractors)         when an articulated lorry crossed the central reservation to the other

                                    the vehicle handled the vehicle on the road and that it was not an offence
                                    under this section to drive a vehicle which was by reason of its mechanical
                                    condition likely to break down or become out of control and so give rise
                                    to danger; but it has been held by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Reg- v.
Millar (Contractors) Ltd.           Spurge [1961] 2 Q.B. 205 that it is an offence under the section dealing
                                    with driving in a manner dangerous to the public to drive a vehicle on
                                    a road if it is in a mechanical condition such that it may become out of

  dangerous driving.
      ■ The bursting of the tyre and the resultant accident took place in
   England. R obert M illar (Contractors) Ltd. is a Scottish company. Its
   place of business is in Scotland. M r. M illar was, at all material times, in
   Scotland and the circumstances from which an actual or imputed know­
                                                                                 B
   ledge of the state of the vehicle is to be inferred are all matters occurring
   m Scotland. It was at that place, if anywhere, that M r. Millar and the
  company required or permitted M r. H art to take the vehicle on the road.
  But it appears from the depositions—at least, I infer from the depositions
  • c          ? instructions to him were to drive the vehicle to a destination
  in bngland and it was in the course of travelling to that destination or
  returning from it that the accident occurred.
       It is common ground that in the absence of a statutory provision to the
  w ntrary no person can be tried under English law for an offence committed
 outside the English jurisdiction and for this purpose Scotland is a country
 outside the jurisdiction of the English courts. The question which I have to
 determine is whether the offence with which Mr. M illar and the company
 are charged, assuming the allegations in the depositions to be true, was
 committed outside England or in England.
    , * 0 “^ “ Archbold’s Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice, 37th
 ed. (1969), para. 67, the following statem ent:
        “ . . . a person who from a foreign country initiates acts which take
        effett m England and are criminal by the law of England appears to
        be liable to indictment and punishment in the county or place in           1
        cngland in which the acts take effect.”

    " ^ fre are ^ e e cases cited in support of that proposition, but two of
    a             e M arny [1907] 1 K -B- 3 8 8 and R ex v. Stoddart (1909) 2
v-r.App.K. 217), appear to me to have little relevance.
    The remaining case is R e x v. Oliphant [1905] 2 K.B. 67. In that case:
       The defendant was employed by a firm, carrying on business in 1
    London, to manage their branch establishment in Paris. It was his
    daily duty to enter on slips an account of all sums received by him
    m Pans for his employers, and to transmit these slips to them in
    London m order that the amounts might be entered up in a cash­
    book kept m London. On a certain date the defendant received three
    sums m Paris which he fraudulently appropriated to his own use
    and omitted to enter the receipt thereof on the slips sent by him on C
    that day to London, knowing and intending that the same would in
    consequence be omitted from the cash-book, as was the case The
    defendant was indicted at the Central Criminal Court under section 1
    of the Falsification of Accounts Act, 1875, for omitting, or concurring
    m omitting, material particulars from the cash-book, and convicted.”

It was held by the Court for Crown Cases Reserved: “ that the court had H
jurisdiction to try the case, and that the defendant was rightly convicted.”
    Lord Alverstone C.J. said that in his opinion the case came within the

                                         In that case, as in R ex v. M unton 1 Esp. 62, it seems that the person in

        as done within English territory, although the person who did the
       act may be outside the territory; for instance, a person who, being
       abroad, procures an innocent agent or uses the post office to commit
        a crime in England is deemed to commit an act in England. If a
       person, being outside England, initiates an offence, part of the essential
       elements of which take effect in England, he is amenable to English
       jurisdiction ” [and the cases cited in support of that proposition in­
       clude M unton and Oliphant]. “ It appears that even though the B
       person who has initiated such an offence is a foreigner, he can be
       tried if he subsequently comes to England. Where, however, an intel­
       ligent acting agent has been interposed between the initiation of the
       crime abroad by a foreigner and its commission in England, difficulties
       may arise as to the jurisdiction of the English courts over the foreigner.
           “ If a person, being outside English territory, were intentionally
      to fire at and kill a person in English territory in such a manner C f
      that the act amounts to murder, the person who fired could be tried         -$■

      outside England, and by means of the representation obtains goods

case;
      “ A clerk whose duty it was to remit at once to his employers in
      Middlesex all moneys collected by him as their clerk, collected at           1
      York . . . a sum of money as such clerk, but never remitted any
      portion of it.”
                                                                                   I
He wrote letters from Yorkshire to his employers in Middlesex “ making
no mention of the money so collected,” and also a letter
      “ which was intended to make them believe that he had not then in
      fact collected the money in question. These letters were duly received
      by the employers in Middlesex ”
and it was held by Kelly C.B., Field, Lindley and Manisty JJ., Huddle­
ston B. dissenting,
        that the receipt of the letter of the 21 st of April in Middlesex was
      sufficient to give jurisdiction to try the prisoner in Middlesex.”
Field J. said, at p. 34:
       “ Now, it may be, under these circumstances, that he might have
       been well tried in Yorkshire, but that is not the question before us.
      The question before us is, whether there was jurisdiction to try him
       in Middlesex; in other words, was a material part of the crime com­
      mitted in Middlesex? Upon this it is to be observed, that the law
      presumes innocence until guilt is proved. If a complete embezzlement
      had been proved in Yorkshire, no part of which was committed in
      Middlesex, a different question would have arisen, but here there is
                                                                             H

dangerously is committed continuously by the driver from the moment that                     in Ei
he drives off with a lorry which he knows or ought to have known was in a                    the v

persons alleged to be aiders and abettors. The offence of causing death by                   prese
dangerous driving is plainly not committed until the death occurs and in the                       N

so long as the driver is driving the vehicle in that condition on the road.                   felon
    If the true view is that the driver is liable to be charged with dangerous                be d

allegations in this indictment are correct, the employer could be charged        m            demt
at that moment with counselling and procuring and if that is right, then if                   althc
at any particular moment the dangerous driving by the driver causes some­                     curir

leaves me in an easy             ted, was committed at the time when the offence was complete, that is to

he offence of driving             driver, if it was so caused, and at the place where that took place, namely,
rom the moment that               in England. If I apply Winn J.’s test, it seems to me that the substance of

i of causing death by             present purposes they are, that was the situation.
:ath occurs and in the                 Mr. Wright advanced one further point in support of his argument and
 employer with actual             that is that there was until the passing of the Criminal Law Act, 1967, a
 state of the vehicle             statutory provision in force expressly providing that where a felony was
oad he is, so this in-         E committed in England any accessory before the fact could be tried in any
ployee to drive that              place where the principal felony could be tried. That section is section 7
>n sense of the matter             of the Accessories and Abettors Act, 1861. But that section has been
as act which persists              repealed by the Criminal Law Act, 1967, and, since the distinction between
dition on the road,                felonies and misdemeanours has been abolished, all offences are now to
arged with dangerous               be dealt with in the same way as misdemeanours were formerly dealt with
; would appear to be               and the law in regard to aiders and abettors of misdemeanours is that

fe r v w 1 be charged              demeanour is liable to be tried as a principal off ender. In this indictment,
t that is right, then if           although it is in form alleging aiding and abetting, counselling and pro­
s driver causes some-              curing, against M r. Millar and the company, they are charged as principal
selling and procuring              offenders.                                              .    .
bility) would amount                    M r Wright submits that the presence of that section in the Act of 1861
: death by dangerous               shows that if it had not been present it would not have been the law that
ployer had up to that              accessories could be tried in any place where the principal felony could be
the dangerous driving              tried. •It seems to me that it would be wrong for me to draw that inference
ience of the driver is             from the presence of that section in relation to accessories before the tact
e road in the case of              when I am dealing not with an accessory before the fact charged as such,
ng in the case of the               but with an aider and abettor charged as a principal offender, and where m
a cannot be guilty of               my judgment the whole tenor of the authorities which I h a v e quoted points
                         H      H to the conclusion that the aider and abettor can be tried in England if the
md until the principal
                                    offence with which he is charged becomes complete within the jurisdiction,

     F or the reasons which I have endeavoured to give, I give judgment for
 the Crown on this plea to the jurisdiction.

                                                              Plea refused.

     The appellants appealed from the decision of Fisher J. refusing their
 pleas to the jurisdiction pursuant to his certificate therefor under section 1
 of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1968, dated February 24, 1969, on the ground          bj
 that the question whether the court had jurisdiction to try. both appellants
 on the six counts in the indictment of aiding and abetting causing death by
 dangerous driving was a question fit to be considered by the Court of
 Appeal.
     Both appellants further applied for leave to appeal against conviction on
the grounds that ( 1 ) a submission of no case to answer should have been
upheld as neither appellant was present at the scene of the accident and
could not be found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving, even if
they had been aware that the tyre which caused the accident was defective-
(2 ) that the conviction was against the weight of the evidence and was un­
safe or unsatisfactory; (3) that the Court of Appeal should receive further
evidence under section 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1968, to show that
the appellants did not know that the tyre was defective.
                                                                                  D
     Gerard Wright for both appellants. The company is domiciled in
 Scotland and its director was at all material times in Scotland. The
 question is whether there was jurisdiction to try the offence in England.
 [Reference was made to Archbold's Criminal Pleading Evidence and
 Practice, 37th ed. (1969), para. 67.]
     Two possible solutions have been suggested; one is that there should
 be jurisdiction at the place where an offence is completed and the other is
 that jurisdiction should be where the offence is initiated. Fisher J. in fact
adopted the terminatory solution but the initiatory theory has much more
in its favour in that it avoids hardship to an accused person. [Reference
was made to Reg. v .B la n d fo rd [1955] 1 W .L.R. 331, 335.] It is in the
 interests of international comity that the State where a crime is initiated
and where it can be controlled should have jurisdiction rather than the
 State where a crime is completed, for the latter place may be coincidental
and difficult to determine. In fact English law in recent years has not
adopted either solution; its solution is to examine the alleged offence,
pinpoint the gist of the offence, and say that the country in which that
has taken place should have jurisdiction.
     The cases sometimes show confusion between the law of venue and that
of jurisdiction. Archbold, 37th ed., defines venue in para. 6 6 . Conflicts
of jurisdiction can be ( 1 ) international, where a crime has been committed
m more than one country, and (2 ) domestic (a) where the conflict is
between counties or (b) between common law and admiralty jurisdiction.
Originally the coincidence between venue (the place from which the jurors
were drawn) and the place where the crime was committed had to be
                                                                               H
exact and thus the law as to venue and jurisdiction was the same. [Refer­

 tyre had been fitted, but he said that the offside front wheel tyre had not
 been replaced, although he had complained about it.
     In resolving this issue of fact the jury had evidence before them that
 the day after the accident, R obert M illar had gone to the police station at
 Chamock Richard where the police had the wheel and the tyre concerned:
 and at that stage it must have been perfectly clear to him that the allegation
 was that the bursting of the front offside tyre on the vehicle owned by his
 company had been responsible for killing six people. But, on the evidence,
 he made no suggestion at that stage (or, indeed, at any time before the trial)
 to the police of any change having been made by H art to the new tyre fitted
to the front offside wheel. When he was cross-examined by Mr. Booth at
the trial he said he did not even trouble to examine the wheel to see if it
was the same wheel. Furthermore, although H art had returned for some
period after the accident to employment with the same company, Millar
agreed that at no stage had he said a word to H art about this possible theft
and substitution: though presumably it would have been the best answer
for him on any criminal charge to be able to find out what had happened          I
to the new tyre which he claimed had been fitted shortly before the accident;
and if it was true that he really thought that six new tyres were on that
vehicle when it set out on that journey it does seem to the court incredible
that he would have said nothing at the time to the police or later on to Hart. D ;
On reading the evidence one sees that none of the witnesses called for the
defence—and that included David and John M illar (John M illar being the
son of the appellant) who worked as mechanics in the business, or a
mechanic called Conerey—had any knowledge that H art had stolen the new
tyre some time in the course of the journey.
     In the view of this court, on reading all the relevant evidence (as we
have done) and, particularly, the cross-examination of Mr. Robert Millar,
the jury were fully justified in rejecting the suggestion made against H art
and in deciding that the vehicle was sent out on that trip with a defective
and dangerous front offside tyre and that Mr. R obert Millar must have
known all about it.
    The trial ended on February 24, 1969. On December 3, 1969 (5 days
before the hearing of this appeal) notice was given of an intention to apply
to call fresh evidence; two witnesses to testify that when employed by
another haulage company at an earlier date H art had, in fact, stolen a new
wheel and tyre off one of their vehicles, replacing it with one old and worn-
out tyre. This new evidence must have been known to the appellants for
months past; and until a few moments ago it certainly appeared that it had
been kept in reserve until the last possible moment when it might be too
late for the prosecution to obtain any evidence to contrary effect. But Mr.
Wright gives us the explanation that the evidence reached the Scottish soli­
citors who were acting on the Scottish law. They knew that no fresh evi­
dence was allowed at the hearing of an appeal, and they assumed (in fact
wrongly) that the same rule would apply in this country. However, the
new evidence having been served, the police spent a very busy weekend,
                                                                                H

 act and one likely to do harm to another person and death results, even
 though the death was neither intended nor foreseen.
     He accepts, further, that you may have a counsellor or procurer of the
 offence of causing death by dangerous driving in certain circumstances.
 F or example, he accepts that if an employer orders his employee to drive a
 m otor vehicle from point A to point B in a very short time so that to obey
 his orders the driver will have to drive down crowded streets at excessive
 speed, and the employee in trying to obey his orders does, in fact, drive at B 'f
 a dangerous speed down a crowded street and kills a pedestrian or other
 road user, then M r Wright agrees that the employer could properly be held
 to have counselled and procured the offence of causing death by dangerous
driving. But Mr. Wright says that that cannot apply to the Spurge type of
dangerous driving, where he says, in effect, that driving in a manner dan­
gerous only begins at the moment that the tyre bursts or the failure occurs
or whatever it may be that causes the accident.
     The members of this court cannot see why exactly the same principle
does not apply to a Spurge type of case. Reg. v. Spurge [1961] 2 Q.B.
205 itself was a case of a man being convicted of driving in a m anner dan­
gerous to the public, although the disaster was caused by him applying his
brake and, because it was a defective brake, it caused his vehicle to swerve
dangerously across the road. In our view, if a driver is sent out by his
                                                                                d ;
employer to drive a heavy vehicle on a trip extending over some hundreds
of miles carrying heavy loads with a dangerously defective front offside
tyre, by an employer who knows that the tyre is dangerous, and there is a
serious risk of harm resulting to other road-users, then if that tyre does
burst and thereby causes an accident killing somebody the employer is
guilty of counselling and procuring death by dangerous driving, and it is no
answer to that to say that the driver of the vehicle at the time was said to E
be doing his best and was steering the vehicle properly, controlling it as well
as he could and so on and there would have been no accident but for the
bursting of the tyre. In our view, a man is driving in a m anner dangerous
to the public if he drives at some speed on the road a vehicle with a tyre
which he knows is dangerous and defective and liable to burst at any
moment.                                                                         p
    We turn now to Mr. Wright’s second point. He has assembled with
very great industry a mass of authorities going back 2 0 0 years or more; but,
in our view, he has been unable to find any case which establishes his pro­
position. He has against him at least two statements of the law by very
learned authors. I refer first to Russell on Crime, 12th ed. (1964), pp. 128,
129, where the law is stated in this way:
     “ A simple but important point is sometimes overlooked, namely, that
     when the law relating to principals and accessories as such is under
     consideration there is only one crime, although there may be more
     than one person criminally liable in respect of it; if there are more
     than one person, then the question arises as to the category in which
     each one is to be placed, that is, whether he is accessory before the fact,
     or principal in the first or second degree or an accessory after the fact,    jj*
     There is one crime, and that it has been committed must be established         J
     before^ there can be any question of criminal guilt of participation in
                                                                                   73
       B                      Reg. v. Robert Millar Ltd. (C.A.)
           “ To make a m an responsible for a crime, whether felony or m isde­

       It seems to us that in this case the company and M r. Millar set m motion

    “ S       e    ^     S      t ^      S    S    f v     U       l e    ^
    appears in an article in (1965) 81 L.Q.R. 518 at p. 530, where he is dealing
    with secondary parties, accessories and abettors. H e says.
         “ Where a crime is committed in England, a secondary party (acces­
         sory or abettor) can be punished even though he was not withm Bntish
         territorial jurisdiction at the time when the crimc was w e t t e d
         when he gave his assistance-at least if he is a citizen of the Umted
         Kingdom ” IThese are the important words: ] ‘ This is an apphcatio
         of the principle that secondary parties are guilty not of.^
         crimes on their own account but of participation in a crnne committed
        by another.”
       We think the law is correctly stated in the passages that I have read,

  common law makes it desirable that that offence with its infinite flexibility                                 Solicitors: Director of Public Prosecutions; Herbert Sm ith & Co.
  should remain and should not be fragmented, as acceptance of Mr.

       I must therefore reject that argument and hold without doubt that
  the offence of causing death by reckless driving of a motor vehicle on a
 road is still manslaughter by the law of England even though since 1977 E                               E
 it is also a statutory offence. Indeed, although it was rarely charged as such,
 it has been a statutory offence since 1956.
       My Lords, I can deal much more briefly with the remaining three
 prerequisites to a successful application for extradition. As to the second
 there is no doubt that the offence in question of manslaughter is, both in
 England and California, punishable by imprisonment for m ore than one p
 year.                                                                                                   F
       My Lords, the third question gave rise to some controversy. Mr.
 Littm an argued that this type of manslaughter was not a felony in
 Californian law because of the power of a jury by their verdict to prevent
 imprisonment in a state prison and thus, in the circumstances which I have
 described by reference to the relevant statutory provisions, reduce the

 accept this argument. The character of the offence depends upon the
 category into which it falls by the Californian law and not upon the
question of what lesser offence a defendant may ultimately be convicted,
if at all.
       My Lords, as to the fourth prerequisite, it was properly conceded that
the evidence before the learned stipendiary m agistrate would in England H
justify committal on a charge of causing death by reckless driving of a
m otor vehicle on a road. Since in my view in English law the ingredients
of the statutory offence are co-extensive with the ingredients of the relevant

   R e fer en c e by the Attorney-General.
    The Attorney-General referred, under section 36 of the Criminal
Justice Act 1972, a point of law for the opinion of the Court of Appeal
in the following term s:
      “ Whether an accused who surreptitiously laced a friend’s drinks
      with double measures of spirits when he knew that his friend would
      shortly be driving his car home, and in consequence his friend drove
      with an excess quantity of alcohol in his body and was convicted of
      the offence under section 6 (1) of the R oad Traffic Act 1972, is
      entitled to a ruling of no case to answer on being later charged as
      an aider and abettor counsellor and procurer, on the ground that
      there was no shared intention between the two, that the accused did
      not by accompanying him or otherwise positively encourage the friend
      to drive, or on any other ground.”
   The Attomey-General’s contentions were that a person who was solely
responsible for the condition of the driver of a vehicle being in breach
of section 6 (1) of the R oad Traffic Act 1972 and who brought about
                                                                                                     775

irinks was                   as a person who had aided, abetted or procured the commission of the
 what had                    offence. It was irrelevant that the driver was unaware of what the accused
lefendant’s                  had done (save that being unaware he might not appreciate the risk in
have com-                    driving) because, inter alia, his offence was an absolute one and required

was a case                   no particular state of mind. Further it was contended that aiding, abetting
 the ruling B              B or procurement in that context did not involve encouragement to commit
                             the offence but might co-exist with indifference or even discouragement,
                             provided there was a deliberate act done which was contributory to the
                             commission of the principal offence with foresight of that consequence or
6;   [1959]                  with recklessness as to whether that consequence ensued or not.

                                  Sir Joseph M olony Q.C. and Nigel Hamilton for the Attorney-General.
                             The problem posed in the point of law is of considerable practical
     #         '             im portance because it permits the driver convicted of an offence under
                             section 6 (1) of the R oad Traffic A ct 1972 to contend that the offence was
ch [1975]                    caused by the alcoholic m inistrations of someone else and that he is
                             morally free of blame; and that it is a special reason within section 93 (1)
0, D.C.                      of the A ct of 1972 for not ordering him to be disqualified. M oreover, it
 3 W.L.R.
               D           D opens up the possibility that a person may say out of friendship and with
                             im punity that he had laced the drink, but contrary to the truth.
                                  The main grounds put forward for rejecting the prosecution’s case
10, D.C.
  [1970] 2                   were as follows. First, that there was no common intent, com m unity of
7, Fisher J.                  purpose or shared intention. T hat was based on the fact that the driver s
                              drinks were laced surreptitiously and the friend did not disclose what he
                              had done. The second ground was that there was insufficient encourage­
                       %      m ent to am ount to aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring.
                                  The second ground causes little difficulty because, on the authorities,
Jl; [1965]                    it appears that a consequence is intended if in fact a person contributes
                              by his actions to a criminal outcom e, if in fact his actions set the scene
                              and play a relevant part in the crime. Although it m ay be that he does
                              not desire that outcome to ensue and m ay even discourage it, neverthe­
  Criminal         F          less his conduct combined with his foresight m ake him liable.
of ^ ^ e a l                       As to the first ground, it is not suggested that the way is clear. The
                              question is whether mutuality of purpose with the principal offender is
                              an essential element in the offence of being an accessory before the fact,

end would

    The case of the person who laces drinks in the circumstances set out                          ;
in the reference is presented as a case of procuring the commission of
the offence under section 6 (1) of the A ct of 1972. It is accepted that no                       <
previous authority establishes the position of a person not present at a                          j
crime and who cannot be said to “ counsel ” it because of the absence                     C t
of community of mind. T he present case is an appropriate one in which                      1
to establish the principle, being a case of absolute liability in the principal             1
offender, so that the necessity for his state of mind being at one with the                       1
alleged accessory is much less apparent than in the norm al case. Since                           c
the principal offender commits his offence without mens rea, there is no                          j
hardship or illogicality in saying that the person who contributes markedly D             D
to the commission by the principal offender of that offence should be at                          C
risk under the law w ithout m utuality of mind. F urther, to the extent                           e
that social and public considerations come in, it is obviously desirable                          p
that persons should not confess openly to being responsible for the com-                          i:
mission of a crime without incurring legal liability for so doing.                                t
    John Marriage Q.C. and Christopher Gardner for the Treasury Soli-
citor as amicus curiae. It is conceded, first, that if the lacing of drinks is 41         E d
an offence then the appropriate offence is procuring; and, secondly, th at                   c
there is no logical reason why procuring cannot stand on its own and                         g
apart from aiding, abetting and counselling. Providing th at the act fits                    tl
into one of the four words, aid, abet, counsel and procure, it would be                      [
sufficient.
    The next question is how the suggested procuring occurs. W hat act p                  F       ^
am ounted to procuring? The prosecution’s suggestion is th at it is the                           rc
provision of alcohol. A n offence under section 6 (1) of the A ct of 1972                         rt
has two features, namely, excess alcohol in the blood and driving. Plainly
a person who knows that another has had too much to drink and tells
him to take and drive that person’s car is a procurer of the offence if the
car is driven. If he is present when the car is started, he is an aider and                cr
abettor.                                                                         G       G ui
    The next question is w hether the provision of alcohol which makes                     he
the person concerned into a condition in which, if he does drive, he will
be guilty of an offence, as such am ounts to a sufficient actus reus to con­
stitute the offence of procuring.
    The possible consequences should be considered. If the court is to
hold that the mere provision of alcohol am ounts to provision of the tool, h         j   jj

       The present question has no doubt arisen because in recent years there c
  have been a num ber of instances where m en charged with driving their
 m otor cars with an excess quantity of alcohol in the blood have sought
 to excuse their conduct by saying that their drinks were “ laced,” as the
 jargon has it; that is to say, some strong spirit was put into an otherwise
 innocuous drink and as a result the driver consumed more alcohol than
 he had either m tended to consume or had the desire to consume. The
relevance of all that is not that it entitles the driver to an acquittal D                1
because such driving is an absolute offence, but that it can be relied on                 I
as a special reason for not disqualifying the driver from driving. Hence                  ^
no doubt the im portance which has been attached in recent months to                      -
me possibility of this argum ent being raised in a norm al charge of driv­
ing with excess alcohol.                                                                  i
    The question requires us to say whether on the facts posed there is a E               •
case to answer and, needless to say, in the trial from which this reference
is derived the judge was of the opinion that there was no case to answer
and so ruled. We have to say in effect whether he is right.
    The language in the section which determines whether a “ secondary
pa^ y’, ,aS    “ sometimes -called, is guilty of a criminal offence com­
mitted by another embraces the four words “ aid, abet, counsel or pro-                l
cure.    The origin of those words is to be found in section 8 of the F
Accessories and Abettors A ct 1861, which provides:
     “ Whosoever shall aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of
                                                                                    1
     any misdemeanor, w hether the same be a misdemeanor at common                    ■3

     be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender ”
           .                                                                      G           G
    Thus, m the past, when the distinction was still drawn between felony             -
and misdemeanor, it was sufficient to m ake a person guilty of a mis-                 S'
demeanor if he aided, abetted, counselled or procured the offence of                  1

a secondary party is sought to be convicted of an offence there has been

cent months to              terms of the offence which they have in mind. But we do not see why a
 charge of driv-            similar principle should apply to procuring. We approach section 8 of

ary party guilty H      tt blem posed to us, it m ay well be that, in similar cases where the lacing
                              of the drink or the introduction of the extra alcohol is known to the
instances where               driver, quite different considerations may apply. We say that because,
i there has been              where the driver has no knowledge of what is happening, in most instances
 780
                    A.-G.’s Reference (No. 1 of 1975) (CA.)            [1975]
  he would have no means of preventing the offence from being com­

                                                                                     B t
  ence is that, following and in consequence of the introduction of the
  extra alcohol, the friend drove with an excess quantity of alcohol in his              /
  blood. Causation here is im portant. You cannot procure an offence
  unless there is a causal link between what you do and the commission of
  the offence, and here we are told that in consequence of the addition of
  this alcohol the driver, when he drove home, drove with an excess quan-
 tity of alcohol in his body.                                                    ^
      Giving the words their ordinary meaning in English, and asking one­
 self whether in those circumstances the offence has been procured, we are
 in no doubt that the answer is that it has. It has been procured because,
 unknown to the driver and without his collaboration, he has been put in
 a position in which in fact he has com m itted an offence which he never
 would have committed otherwise. We think th a t there was a case to            d
 answer and that the trial judge should have directed the jury th at an              D
 offence is committed if it is shown beyond reasonable doubt th at the
defendant knew that his friend was going to drive, and also knew that
 the ordinary and natural result of the additional alcohol added to the
friend’s drink would be to bring him above the recognised limit of 80
milligrammes per 1 0 0 millilitres of blood.
     It was suggested to us that, if we held that there m ay be a procuring      ®
on the facts of the present case, it would be but a short step to a similar
finding for the generous host, with somewhat bibulous friends, when at
the end of the day his friends leave him to go to their own homes in
circumstances in which they are not fit to drive and in circumstances in
which an offence under the R oad Traffic A ct 1972 is committed. The
suggestion has been made that the host m ay in those circumstances be            p
guilty with his guests on the basis that he has either aided, abetted,
counselled or procured the offence.
     The first point to notice in regard to the generous host is that that is
not a case in which the alcohol is being put surreptitiously into the glass
of the driver. T hat is a case in which the driver knows perfectly well
how much he has to drink and where to a large extent it is perfectly right
and proper to leave him to m ake his own decision.                              ®
     Furtherm ore, we would say that, if such a case arises, the basis on
which the case will be put against the host is, we think, bound to be on
the footing that he has supplied the tool with which the offence is com­
mitted. This, of course, is a reference back to such cases as those where
oxy-acetylene equipment was bought by a man knowing it was to be used
by another for a criminal offence: see Reg. v. Bainbridge [1960] 1 Q.B.         jj
129. There is ample and clear authority as to the extent to which sup­               H
plying the tools for the commission of an offence m ay am ount to aiding
and abetting for present purposes.

Manslaughter—Killing by Unlawful A ct—Dangerous A ct Inadvertently Causing
   Death— Youths Pushing Paving Stone From Bridge Over Railway Line on
   to Oncoming Train—Train Guard Killed— Whether Youths Guilty of
   Manslaughter.
       A defendant is guilty of manslaughter if it is proved that he intentionally
    did an act which was unlawful and dangerous and that act inadvertently
    caused death, and it is unnecessary to prove that the defendant knew the act
    was unlawful and dangerous.
       The test is still an objective one—in judging whether the act is dangerous
    the test is not did the defendant recognise that it was dangerous, but would
    all sober and reasonable people recognise its danger.
       Dictum of Humphreys J. in L arkin (1942) 29 Cr.App.R. 18, 23, and
    Church (1966) 49 Cr.App.R. 206; [1966] 1 Q.B. 59 applied.
       Dictum of Lord Denning M.R. in Gray v. B arr, P rudential Insurance
    (Third Party) [1971] 2 Q.B. 554, 558 disapproved.
       The appellants, youths aged 15, were on a railway bridge. One of them
    pushed part of a paving stone over the bridge parapet towards an oncoming
    train. It fell on the driving cab, killing the guard who was sitting next to the
    driver. The appellants were convicted of the manslaughter of the guard. On
    the question whether a person can properly be convicted of manslaughter
    when his mind is not affected by drink or drugs if he did not foresee that his
    act might cause harm to another, Held, that the appellants had rightly been
    convicted of manslaughter for they had done an unlawful act which was also
    dangerous and which act, although done quite inadvertently, had caused
    the death of another person.
       Per curiam: In directing juries in manslaughter cases, judges should do so
    in accordance with the law as correctly laid down in L arkin (supra) and
    Church (supra).
       Decision of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) affirmed.

  Appeal by the defendants against a decision of the Court of Appeal (Criminal
Division) dismissing their appeals against conviction.

    The appellants, Neil Newbury and Robert Jones, were, on Februaiy 24, 1975,                                         seq
 convicted of manslaughter and were sentenced by Watkins J. both to five years’                                       Me
 detention. In each case the jury were discharged from giving a verdict on count                                      api
 2 of the indictment which alleged endangering the safety of persons in a railway
 carriage, and no verdict was taken on count 3 which alleged malicious damage.                                        sai<
 Both appellants appealed against conviction and sentence with leave of the single                                    wr<
 judge. Their appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal (Lawton and Geoffrey                                            cas
 Lane L.JJ., and Goff J.) on November 7, 1975.                                                                        Co
   The following facts are taken from the judgment of Lawton L. J.                                                    (19
   At about 11.45 a.m. on October 11, 1974, a train from Pontypridd to Cardiff                                        I re
 passed under a bridge. In the driver’s cab was the driver and a guard, Mr. Davies.                                     '
 The driver gave evidence that as the train approached the bridge, he noticed                                         Co
 three heads above the parapet. They appeared to be the heads of young boys.                                          (15
 One of them pushed something over the side of the bridge. The next thing that                                         sail
 happened was that the front window of the train was smashed and a part of a                                          bet
paving stone came through into the cab. That paving stone struck Mr. Davies and                                       or
killed him.                                                                                           doi
   It was suggested at the trial that that piece of paving stone was part of a concrete                                pei
paving slab, which some workmen had left on the bridge. Three other parts of it                                        fac
were found later by the police still on the bridge and another part of the same                                        am
stone was found on the track.                                                                                         tha
   The police made inquiries about the young boys who lived in the street near                                        dej
the bridge. At the trial the appellant Newbury by his counsel admitted in open                                        on:
Court “ that he was a party to pushing a stone over the Crobett Road Railway                                           eng
bridge and that this stone struck and caused the death of Maurice Davies.” The                                         act
other appellant, Jones, through his counsel, admitted that the stone which had                                        the
been pushed over the bridge had struck and killed Mr. Davies, but he denied                                           gui
being present at the time. At the trial his defence was an alibi. That defence                                        of t
was not accepted by the jury. When he was at the police station being interrogated                                       I
by the police, he had admitted his part in this incident. The only thing that he                                       sta
did not admit at the police station was that he had pushed the stone over. He                                          wh
alleged that the appellant Newbury had done so. Fortunately for justice there                               ‘          for
was other evidence which established that he was the one who had infact                                               jud
pushed the stone over.                                                                                          sue

 D a v fl^ n d   o r doubted. I f a person is engaged in doing a lawful act, and in the course of
                 doing th a t lawful act behaves so negligently as to cause th e death o f some other

                  th a t it will n o t am ount to m anslaughter unless th e negligence is o f a very high
 street n ea r    degree.” T hen he m ade a fu rth e r com m ent w hich we need not set out. H e w ent

ad Railway        engaged in perform ing is unlawful, then if a t the sam e tim e it^ is a dangerous

 which had        th e doer of th e act causes the death of th a t other person by th a t act, then he is

lat defence       o f the law, which has been applied m any times.

istrce th ere     form ulation used by E dm und Davies J. h as becom e th a t used nowadays by

                  to, at least, the risk of some harm resulting th erefrom , albeit n o t serious h arm .”
med and as            A t th e trial counsel pointed o u t to W atkins J. th a t th e application o f the
il pouj^vas       statem ent of principle enunciated by E dm und D avies J. m e an t th a t all the

act, the learned judge went on to the second head of his directions: “ If that is
your conclusion you then proceed to consider whether the next ingredient, as it
is called, of this offence of manslaughter has been established. It is this: that the
unlawful act was such as all sober and reasonable people would be bound to
realise must expose someone such as the guard on this train or, members of the
jury, the driver on this train to, at least, the risk of some harm although not
serious.” He then went on to explain what he meant by that direction and no
complaint is made of the explanation that he gave.
    In our judgment in directing the jury in the terms he did, he was following
a judgment of this Court which was binding upon him. That judgment has been
followed in later cases in this Court. A particular one is M a ck ie (1973) 57
Cr.App.R. 453.
    In our judgment it is our duty to follow C hurch (supra). We go further and
say not only do we conceive it to be our duty to follow C hurch (supra) but in our
judgment that case was rightly decided. The appeals against conviction must be
dismissed.
    Before we leave this topic, we invite attention to the fact that in a number of
cases since G ray v. B arr (supra), trial judges have directed juries in accordance
with that case. It may be that in doing so they were taking a course which was
favourable to the accused and which helped the prosecution by making it difficult,
in the event of a conviction, for an appeal to be taken on a point such as has
been argued in this case. There has been no decision of this Court in support of
G ray v. B arr (supra), the correct direction, in our judgment, is that set out in
C hurch (supra).
    We turn now to the problem of sentence. On the day of Mr. Davies s death, these
two boys were playing truant from school. Neither of them was academically
able: Newbury, as I have already said, had a low intelligence. They were occupying
their time out of school in useless ways and on this occasion in highly dangerous
ways.
    At the date of this accident Newbury was just over 1 4 i and Jones was 15.
It is said that they probably did not appreciate what risks they were creating for
those who were being carried on the train. We find that difficult to accept.
Although Newbury’s intelligence was not high, the educational authorities had
been of the opinion that he was capable of benefiting from education in an
ordinary school. Mr. Lewis has not suggested that his client Jones was other
than of normal intelligence. Boys of 14-J and 15 must be taken to know that if
they throw pieces of paving stone on to a moving train, there is a risk of harm
being done to someone on the train.
    The learned judge was clearly very disturbed by the facts of this case. There
was a serious accident causing Mr. Davies’s death. Unfortunately the learned
judge knew, and this Court knows, that this kind of conduct is all too common.
Cases have occurred in the past few years of harm being done to persons travelling
 on trains through stones being dropped or thrown from bridges. Mr. Lewis, with
 his usual frankness, has told us that recently cases of this kind have occurred
on bridges over motorways.                                      , • ,
    Something has clearly got to be done by the courts to make it clear from one
 end of England and Wales to the other that youngsters who behave in this way
 must expect to lose their liberty. This Court can see no other appropriate way of
 dealing with this class of offence. It follows that it was right for the trial judge
 to pass sentences which had the effect of depriving the accused forthwith of their
 liberty.                                                            ,           . ..
     He was, however, in a difficulty, because of the law governing the powers of the
 Courts to impose sentences on young adolescents. He was no longer able to make
 approved school orders. He could have made an order putting both the appellants
  in care. Judges have had experience of what the consequence of that so often is.
  A sentence of detention would have been wholly inadquate for a case of this

  “ If that is    gravity. The next alternative was borstal and in the case of Jones, having regard
edient, as it     to the fact that he was of normal intelligence and it was he who had undoubtedly
lis: that the     either thrown or pushed the piece of paving stone over the bridge, borstal
je bound to       training was inadequate to show the Court’s disapproval of such dangerous
nbers of the      conduct.
Jthough not          In the case of Newbury, the problem is different, because, as we have already
tion and no       said, he personally did not throw the stone over. He admitted from the very
                  outset his complicity in the offence. At his trial his learned counsel admitted the
as following      offence subject to the legal point to which I have already referred. Newbury did
:nt has been      not go into the witness box to say that he had not intended to do harm to anybody.
e (1973) 57       He has got caring parents, as indeed Jones has. It seems to us that in the case
                  of Newbury, as distinct from Jones, training rather than punishment is the
 further and      appropriate form of sentence. In those circumstances we propose to quash the
e) but in our     sentence of five years’ detention and to impose a sentence of borstal training.
ion must be       I should add we have given thought to the problem of his age. He was 15 on
                  February 12, 1975. The relevant date for the purpose of a sentence of borstal
i nuni• . off     training is the age at the date of conviction. It follows that on February 24, 1975
. accordance      he could have been sent to borstal. As I have already indicated, in our judgment

 such as has         So far as Jones is concerned, his case did require punishment. But we bear in
l support of      mind that at the age of 15 time passes slowly. For an adolescent of 15 to be
it set out in     sentenced to five years’ detention is very severe punishment indeed. It will be
                  difficult for him to envisage the end of this sentence. We take into account the
 death, these     fact that virtually the whole of his late teens will be spent in custody. He had one
icademically      previous conviction for an entirely different type of offence.
re occupying         We adjudge that the appropriate sentence on him should be three years’
y dangerous       detention and not five. Accordingly in his case the sentence of five years’ detention
                  will be quashed and there will be substituted a sentence of three years’ detention.

  manslaughter which, of course, they did; but this does not mean that n o th in g
 short of such facts can prove manslaughter. Lord Denning’s judgment is certainly
 capable of being read in a contrary sense, and indeed has been so understood by
 some judges, but I doubt whether he intended that it should be. If he did, then I
 am afraid I cannot agree with him. Neither of the other members of the court
 in G r a y v . B a r r (supra) said anything in support of the proposition which some
 believe that Lord Denning intended to propound. Indeed, the second member of
 that court cited L a r k i n ’s case with approval, see p. 576. [Edmund Davies L.J.
 as he then was].
    Lamb (1967) 51 C r.A pp.R . 417; [1967] 2 Q.B. 981 w as referred to by L o rd
  D enning fo r th e proposition th a t in m anslaughter th ere m u st always be a guilty
  mind. This is tru e o f every crim e except those of absolute liability. T h e guilty
 m ind usually depends on th e intention of the accused. Some crim es require w h at
 is som etim es called a specific intention, fo r exam ple m urder, w hich is killing w ith
 intent to kill o r inflict grievous bodily harm . O ther crimes need only w hat is called
 a basic intention, w hich is an intention to do th e acts w hich constitute the crime.
 M anslaughter is such a crim e, see L a rk in (supra) and C h u rch (supra). Lam b
 (supra) is certainly no authority to th e contrary. Two young m en w ere playing
 about w ith a revolver w hich, to th e ir knowledge, had two shells in cham bers,
n either of w hich w as opposite th e barrel. T he defendant in jest an d w ith n o
intention to harm o r frighten pointed th e revolver a t his friend, w ho w as also
treating th e incident as a joke. T h e revolver fired and th e frien d w as killed. T he
defendant w as charged w ith m anslaughter on two grounds (a) killing by doing a n
unlaw ful an d dangerous act and (b) killing by crim inal negligence. T h e defen dan t
w as convicted b u t his conviction w as quashed on appeal because, luckily fo r him
th ere had been a series of serious m isdirections by th e learn ed trial judge.
   Lawton L.J. had observed that in manslaughter cases, some judges are;
now directing juries not in accordance with the law as correctly laid down in
L a r k i n (supra) and C h u r c h (supra) but in accordance with the observations of
Lord Denning M.R. in G r a y v . B a r r (supra) taken in their literal sense. F or
the reasons I have already given they should cease to do so.
  My Lords, I would dismiss the appeal.

   L o r d E d m u n d - D a v i e s : My Lords, For the reasons developed in the speech of
 my noble and learned friend, Lord Salmon, I concur in holding that these appeals
against conviction should be dismissed.
   C h u r c h (1965) 49 Cr.App.R. 206; [1966] 1 Q.B. 59, which the learned trial
 judge adopted for the purpose of his direction to the jury, marked no new departure
 in relation to the offence of involuntary manslaughter. In so far as the charge
 was based on the commission of an unlawful act causing death, the Court of
 Criminal Appeal was there concerned to demolish the old notion (which the
direction to the jury in that case was thought to have resurrected) that, whenever
 any unlawful act is committed in relation to a human being which causes his
 death, there must at least be a conviction for manslaughter. In delivering the
judgment of the Court, I therefore said (pp. 213 and 70B): “ Stressing that we
 are here leaving entirely out of account those ingredients of homicide which
might justify a verdict of manslaughter on the grounds of (a) criminal negligence,
or (b) provocation, (c) diminished responsibility, the conclusion of this court is
that an unlawful act causing the death of another cannot, simply because it is an-
unlawful act, render a manslaughter verdict inevitable.” The key sentence which
followed has often been quoted. I would respectfully say that Lord Widgery C.J..
(who was a member of the Court in C h u r c h ) was perfectly correct in observing
in L i p m a n ( R o b e r t ) 53 Cr.App.R. 600, 606; [1970] 1 Q.B. 152, 159D that, “ The
development recognised by C h u r c h (supra) relates to the type of act from which a.
charge of manslaughter may result, not in the intention (real or assumed) of the:
prisoner.”
                                         D.P.P. v. NEWBURY; D.P.P. v. JONES                           299

                      But, in so far as C h u r c h (supra) has been regarded as laying down that for the
hat nothing        proof of manslaughter in such circumstances what is required is no more than
 is certainly      the intentional committing of an unlawful act of the designated type or nature,
derstood by        it followed a long line of authorities which the court there cited. Of these the
 did, then I       best known is possibly L a r k i n (supra) [1943] 1 K.B. 174, dealt with in detail in
>f the court       the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Salmon. Accordingly, if C h u r c h
which some
 member of         (supra) was wrong, so was its long ancestry.
                      I believe that C h u r c h (supra) accurately applied the law as it then existed. I
Davies L.J.
                   believe, further, that, since it was decided, nothing has happened to change the
to by Lord         law in relation to the constituents of involuntary manslaughter caused by an
  be a guilty      unlawful act. The Criminal Justice Act 1967 has certainly effected no such change,

equire what        623, 654, section 8 thereof has nothing to do with when intent or foresight or any
                   other mental state has to be established, but simply how it is to be determined
 killing with

ipra). - -lMB       permitted to introduce a personal note into a judgment, I have the best reason
/ere playing        to know that the forthcoming working paper of the Criminal Law Revision
i chambers,         Committee on offences against the person will afford those concerned in such
nd with no          important matters an opportunity to assess the cogency of the argument for a

  killed. The       and until such argument prevails and so leads on to legislation, the existing law
by doing an         has to be applied. I hold that the direction of the learned trial judge, Tasker
 e defendant        Watkins J., was in strict accordance with the settled law and that these appeals
lily for him,       should therefore be refused.

ee.                            spread very rapidly. Using a ladder from a neighbour’s house the appellant
                               rescued two of his children, handed to him by his wife from a bedroom window.
                               The fire then became too intense to save anyone else. The appellant’s wife and
      Appeal dismissed         two-year-old son died in hospital from their burns and the appellant’s girl friend
                               was asphyxiated. The appellant was charged with three counts of manslaughter
                               (counts 1 to 3), one of arson (count 4) and one of arson being reckless whether
                               the lives of those in the house would be in danger (count 5). The judge directed
                               the jury on the unlawful act aspect of the offence of manslaughter, including
                               directions more appropriate to the Lawrence (supra) type of case, which were
                               more favourable to the appellant than if they had been omitted. The appellant
                               was convicted on all counts. On appeal against the convictions for manslaughter
                               and arson being reckless as to whether the lives of those in the house would be
                               in danger
                               Held, that, for the above reasons, the case was one capable of falling within
                               either or both types of manslaughter. On the Lawrence aspect, the jury might
                               well have been satisfied that the appellant was acting in such a manner as to
                               create an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to some person, and
                               secondly that he, having recognised that there had been some risk, had
nevertheless gone on to take it. The present case was equally one for the
“unlawful and dangerous act” direction as set out above. The judge’s directions
were correct and the convictions on counts 1 to 3 for m anslaughter were neither
unsafe nor unsatisfactory; further, as to count 5, the direction was adequate in
relation to the recklessness of the appellant as to whether the lives of the
persons upstairs were in danger. Accordingly, the appeal would be dismissed.

  On July 12, 1985, in the Crown Court at Newcastle-upon-Tyne (Judge
Beaum ont) the appellant was convicted on three counts of manslaughter (counts
1 to 3), one of arson (count 4) and one of arson with intent to endanger life
(count 5) and was sentenced to six years’ im prisonment concurrent.
  The facts appear in the judgm ent.                                       .
   The main ground of appeal was that the trial judge did not direct the jury on
recklessness in accordance with R. v. Caldwell (1981) 73 C r.A pp.R . 237, [1982]
A .C . 341 and R. v. Lawrence (1981) 73 C r.A pp.R . 1; [1982] A .C . 510. Counsel
relies on Kong Cheuk Kwan v. The Queen (1985) 82 C r.A pp.R . 18.
   The appeal was argued on March 10, 1986.

   March 14. THE LORD CH IEF JUSTICE read the judgm ent of the Court. On
July 12 1985 in the Crown Court at Newcastle the appellant was convicted on
five counts of an indictment. The first three counts charged manslaughter, in
respect of each of which he was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. Count 4
charged arson, on which he was sentenced to four years’ im prisonment. Count 5
charged him with arson, being reckless as to w hether the lives of those m the
house would be in danger, and on that he was sentenced to six years
imprisonment. All sentences were ordered to run concurrently.
   H e now appeals by leave of the single judge against the convictions for
manslaughter and the conviction on count 5. continued;
    On August 14, 1984 in the early hours of the morning, the appellant set light
 to the council house he occupied at 24 Cossock Terrace, Pallion. H e poured
 petrol over the sideboard, chair and walls of the downstairs living room, and
 then set the house on fire by igniting the petrol. In the ensuing blaze three
 people died: his wife Sarah aged 22, another young woman nam ed Jillian Stuart
 with whom the appellant was having a liaison, who was in the house that night,
 and the appellant’s two year old son D arren.
    The background to these events was as follows. The appellant had been
 having difficulties with two men in the locality. O ne of them had been fined for
  damaging the front door of No. 24. Hence the appellant w anted to move. He
  had no chance of exchanging his council house for another because he was some
  “£300 in arrears with his ren t.” H e therefore conceived the idea of setting o.
  24 on fire and making it look as though the fire had been caused by a petrol

ismissed.             According to Dalzell, he, Dalzell, told the appellant it was a stupid idea, and
 ed. Director     Jillian, who was present at the time, disapproved of the plan saying that she was
!91; [1976] 2     not going to risk her life and the lives of the bairns for him (the appellant). The
  59 applied.      appellant however told the jury that the fire was Jillian’s own idea a n d that she
                   talked him into carrying it into effect. Jillian had (wisely) arranged for her three
                   children to sleep elsewhere.
                      The appellant’s three children remained in the house because, as he said, i
                   would have been suspicious if they had not been there. T he idea was that once

                   therefore escape. However the fire spread very rapidly. The appellant fetched a

                   ladder from a neighbour’s house, put it against a bedroom window and took to
                   safety two of his children handed out to him by his wife. The fir e by then was
                    too intense for anyone else to be saved. Jillian was asphyxiated inside the house.

                     had appeared in The Times newspaper shortly before the learned judge came t

                        harm; not necessarily serious harm, but some harm. This is nothing o o
 a n t ^ ^ ght          with the defendant’s state of mind. The test is would the reasonable person

; room, and              expand a little of this third point which is the general law in relation to
  blaze three            manslaughter, and I must apply it to the facts of th is case. W hat the Crown
Tillian Stuart           must prove to vour satisfaction are two further things beyond the three
e that night,            things which I have just mentioned. First, that at the mom ent Goodfellow
                         set fire to N um ber 24, the prevailing circumstances were such that the
it had been              ordinary, prudent, sober individual, and please consider yourselves as
sen fined for            having been in Goodfellow's position at that time for this purpose, the
o move. He                ordinary, prudent, sober individual would have recognised that the act ot
le was some               setting fire to the house could cause some injury, not necessarily serious
: setting No.             injury, to the other five persons in the house, and that the risk of causing
  by a petrol

       injury was not so slight that the ordinary, prudent individual would have          the
       felt justified in treating the risk as negligible. A nd please note, ladies and    The
       gentlem en, that the defendant told you in evidence that he thought he had         the
       eliminated all risks when he started the fire. But the test on this point is not   All
       what he thought, but what the reasonable man would have recognised. Now            the
       the second further thing the Crown must prove is this, that at the moment          real
      Goodfellow set fire to the house he either gave no thought to the risk of           Hoi
      injury to the inmates in circumstances when he obviously ought to have                 It
      done so, or he recognised that there was a risk of injury but nonetheless           case
      went on to take that risk. Now this latter point is the more relevant, you          not
      may think, because it is obvious, isn’t it, that Goodfellow did appreciate          (198
      that there was some risk. This emerges from what he told the police,                   Ir

                 A p p e a l against conviction.
                  On November 22, 1966, at the Central Criminal Court, before
              Glyn-Jones J. and a jury, the defendant, Terence Walter Lamb,
              aged 25, was arraigned on an indictment charging that, on Sep­
              tember 22, 1966, he unlawfully killed Timothy O ’Donaghue. To
              the indictment the defendant pleaded not guilty.
                  The following statement of facts is taken, substantially, from
              the judgment. The undisputed facts in evidence were that the
              defendant possessed a Smith & Wesson revolver, with a five-
              chambered cylinder, and that each time the trigger was pulled the
              cylinder rotated clockwise; that the defendant, in jest and with no
              intention to do harm, pointed the revolver at O’Donaghue, his best
              friend, who was treating the incident as a joke; that the revolver
              had two bullets in the chambers, neither bullet being in the
              chamber opposite the barrel; that the defendant, having no inten­                                                        of
              tion to fire the revolver, pulled the trigger, its pulling rotated the                                                   be
              cylinder and so placed a bullet opposite the barrel, the bullet was
              struck by the striking pin and O’Donaghue was killed.                                                                     th«

                low average intelligence and no appreciable sense of smell,
                and his mistress, w ho was ineffectual and inadequate, lived
                together in his house w ith his m entally subnorm al son. The
                man’s sister came to live at the house as a lodger in one
                room w ithout ventilation, toilet o r w ashing facilities except a
                polythene bucket. She was m orbidly anxious n o t to p u t on

                attem pted to w ash her w ith the aid o f a neighbour, who
                advised the mistress to go to the social services. T he licensee
                of a public house w hich the appellants used to visit advised the
                mistress to obtain a doctor. T he sister had refused to give the

         and to determine whether the prosecution had established a

          less disregard of danger to her health and welfare by in­
          difference to an obvious risk of injury to health or by actually
          foreseeing the risk and determining nevertheless to run it

           jury had been directed in accordance with the principles appli­

at death or                   because Rosy could not tolerate her any longer, she had decided to leave.

She came to live at no. 75, where she occupied a small front room. She
was in receipt of a pension of £11-60 a week and gave her brother £1-50 ^
towards the rent. She was eccentric in many ways. She was morbidly
and unnecessarily anxious about putting on weight and so denied herself
proper meals. She would take to her room for days. She would often
stay in her room all day until the two appellants went to the public
house in the evening, when she would creep down and make herself a
meal.                                                                         ]j
    In early Spring 1975 the police called at the house. Fanny had been
found wandering about in the street by herself without apparently knowing
where she was. This caused the appellants to try to find Fanny’s doctor.
They tried to trace him through Rosy, but having walked a very consider­
able distance in their search they failed. It transpired that they had walked
to the wrong village. Fanny herself refused to tell them the doctor’s name.
She thought she would be “ put away ” if she did. Nothing more was done
to enlist outside professional aid.
    In the light of what happened subsequently there can be no doubt that
Fanny’s condition over the succeeding weeks and months must have
deteriorated rapidly. By July 1975 she was, it seems, unable or unwilling
to leave her bed and, on July 19, the next-door neighbour, Mrs. Wilson,
gallantly volunteered to help the female appellant to wash Fanny. She D
states:
     “ On July 19 Mrs Dobinson and I went to Fanny’s room in order to
     clean her up. When I went into the room there was not a strong
     smell until I moved her. Her nightdress was wet and messed with her
     own excreta and the dress had to be cut off. I saw her back was
     sore; I hadn’t seen anything like that before. I took the bedclothes £
     off the bed. They were all wet through and messed. And so was the
     mattress. I was there for about two hours and Mrs. Dobinson helped.
     She was raw, her back, shoulders, bottom and down below between
     her legs. Mrs. Dobinson appeared to me to be upset because Fanny
     had never let her attend to her before. I advised Mrs. Dobinson to
     go to the social services.”
                                                                             F
    Emily West, the licensee of the local public house, the Crossed Daggers,
gave evidence to the effect that during the whole of the period, from July
19 onwards, the appellants came to the public house every night at about
7 p.m. The appellant Dobinson was worried and told Emily West that
Fanny would not wash, go to the toilet or eat or drink. As a result Emily
West immediately advised Dobinson to get a doctor and when told that
Fanny’s doctor lived at Doncaster, Emily West suggested getting a local one. &
It seems that some efforts were made to get a local doctor, but the neigh­
bour who volunteered to do the telephoning (the appellants being incapable
of managing the instrument themselves) was unsuccessful.
    On August 2, 1975, Fanny was found by Dobinson to be dead in her
bed. The police were called. On arrival they found there was no ventila­
tion in the bedroom, the window had to be hammered open and the bed i f
was so sited that it was impossible to get the door fully open. At one side
of the bed on a chair was an empty mineral bottle and on the other chair a

the appellant Dobinson, signed the deceased’s pension book because the
deceased did not seem as though she could be bothered with anything. The       A
appellant said she kept telling Ted (the other appellant), but that he would
not do anything. H e just told her, “ Leave it while tomorrow.” She was
asked why she did not get help and she replied, “ I asked him to get a
doctor. He said he had tried to, but because the deceased was not on his
panel the doctor wouldn’t come.” When asked why she did not speak to
the lady next door or to Mrs. Wilson’s daughter, who was a nurse, she is       g
said to have replied, “ I daren’t. He is boss down there. I daren’t do
anything unless he tells me. She is not my sister, so I left it to him.”
When asked, “ You are a woman and you go into her bedroom. Your own
common sense would tell you that she needed attention? ” She is said to
have replied, “ She never complained so I didn’t bother.” When asked,
“ Did you change her bed or see she was washed? ” she replied, “ About
three weeks ago me and Mrs. Wilson gave her a wash down and tried to           ^
clean her up.” When asked, “ What did you think of her at that time? ”
she replied, “ She was all sore and filthy.” When asked why she did not
call someone she is said to have replied, “ She didn’t complain, so I left
her.” In evidence she denied those parts of her statement which incrimi­
nated the appellant Stone. She disputed that she said, “ She dare not do
anything without Ted ” and “ he just would not bother to do anything and       D
he would say leave it while tomorrow.” She also denied that she said :
      “ I know she never got out of bed to go to the toilet because she was
      too ill. She did what she wanted in the bed. Anyway I kept telling
      him (the appellant Stone) to do something; but all he would say was
      ‘ tomorrow ’ and he would not lift a finger to help her.”
                                                                            E
With regard to the words she was reported to have used, “ I realised for
the past two weeks that she was not going to live, and I could see that she
was filthy and smelt ” she said she did not say that and added, “ I may
have said that I knew she was poorly.”
    The appellant Stone was interviewed subsequently. He was asked,
“ Did Gwen tell you that Fanny was in a bad way? ” He replied, “ Yes,
but Fanny was very stubborn and would not let anyone do for her.” He F
was asked “ If Gwen told you about Fanny’s condition, why did you not
get medical assistance? ” He replied, “ I tried to get our doctor to come
but he would not. I also tried to find out who her doctor was but I could
not.” He was asked, “ Why did you not get an ambulance to take her to
hospital? ” He replied, “ I did not think.” He sa id :
      “ I remember Gwen and Mrs. Wilson going up to see her. They said G
      she was in a baddish way. I said, ‘ We must do something.’ I do
      not remember whether there was any attempt to get a doctor after
      that. I did not think she was dying. Previously she had gone to bed
      for long periods of time, and she had then got up again and had been
      all right. I would ask her if she was getting up but she always said,
      ‘ When I am ready.’ I could not see her in the room and I could j j
      not tell whether she was looking all right. I went up three or four
      days before she died. I asked her, ‘ Are you all right, Fanny ’ and she
      said ‘ Yes.’ ”

                                    This was not a situation analogous to the drowning stranger. They
                               did make efforts to care. They tried to get a doctor; they tried to discover

> three or four                     Mr. Coles’ second submission presents greater difficulty. It is that the
ranny ’ and she                judge’s direction on the nature of the negligence or recklessness required
                               was wrongly stated. This is how the m atter was left to the jury:
 362
                               Reg. v. Stone (GA.)                      [1977]
        “ Have the Crown proved that either or both of these defendants was
        guilty of gross neglect of Fanny amounting to a reckless disregard ^
       for the health and wellbeing of that woman. Do not place your
       judgment on the question of recklessness as to whether she died or
       not. W hat has to be proved is not that, but that there was a reckless
       disregard for their duty of care. It may well be that that will involve
       a consideration of what they thought would be the consequences of
       their reckless disregard, if you found there was one. F or example, if jj
       I were in charge of a person and I was guilty of some m ajor neglect,
       but I genuinely did not appreciate that it would lead to any dire
       results, you would probably say, ‘ That person is not very bright, but
       I am not sure he is guilty of recklessness! ’ ”

Then, at a later stage in the direction:
                                                                                 C
        “ . . . were either or both of these defendants in grave neglect of that
        duty, were they reckless or did they show a reckless disregard for
        their obligations. Again it depends to a large extent on the extent of
        their knowledge of her condition; of their individual appreciation
        of the need to act. It depends to some extent on their appreciation of
       the consequences of inaction; it depends on the facilities which were _
       available or which they could readily have made available. Mr. Stone
       says ‘ nothing was done because I was not aware of the gravity of
       the m atter of the danger to Fanny’s life and of the situation. I did
       not know the actual conditions in which my sister was lying.’ If that
       is true or if it may be true then you will acquit him. If you are sure
       that he did know then you ask yourselves: what did he do about it,
       and what could he have done . . . You do not judge him on what ^
       you would have done yourselves; but you take the man as you find
       him . . . So far as Mrs. Dobinson is concerned . . . did she do her
       incompetent best? Certainly if she did that, then you would acquit
       her.”

    The appellants’ contention is that the prosecution in order to succeed p
must show recklessness on the part of the defendant; that recklessness in
this context means foresight of the likelihood or possibility of death or
serious injury and a determination nevertheless to persist in the omission
to provide care. We were referred to a number of 19th century decisions
which are historically interesting but of small practical assistance. Mr.
Coles relied principally on the decision of this court in Reg. v. Lowe
[1973] Q.B. 702. In that case there were two counts, one alleging man- G
slaughter of a child on the grounds that the defendants’ cruelty alleged
under the second count caused its death, and the second count charging
cruelty to a child by wilfully neglecting it so as to cause unnecessary
suffering or injury to health under section 1 (1) of the Children and Young
Persons Act 1933. The judge had directed t i e jury that if they found the
appellant guilty on the second count they must find him guilty under the j j
first count of manslaughter, even though they acquitted him of recklessness.
That was held to be a misdirection. Phillimore L.J., delivering the judg­
ment of the court, went on to say, at p. 709:
                                                                                               363
      [1977]        1 Q.B,                         Reg> v. Stone (C.A.)
endants was              “ Now in the present case the jury negatived recklessness. How then
■ss disregard ^   A      can mere neglect, albeit wilful, amount to manslaughter? This court
  place your             feels that there is something inherently unattractive in a theory of
 she died or             constructive manslaughter. It seems strange that an omission whic
is a reckless            is wilful solely in the sense that it is not inadvertent, the consequences
 will involve            of which are not foreseen by the person who is neglectful should, if
equences of              death results, automatically give rise to an indeterminate sentence . . .
 example, if B
ajor neglect,     ®     Mr. Coles submits that that passage is support for his argument that
to any dire         there must be an appreciation by the defendant of the risk of death or
                    serious injury before a conviction for manslaughter in these circumstances
' bright, but
                    can result. We disagree. The court is saying simply that there must be
                    proved the necessary high degree of negligence, and a direction which fai s
                    to emphasise that requirement will be defective. It is to Andrews v.
              c   C Director of Public Prosecutions [1937] A.C. 576, that one must turn to
?leci    that       discover the definition of the requisite degree of negligence. Lord Atkin,
isregard for        at p. 582, cites with approval the words of Lord Hewart C J . in R e x V.
he extent of         Bateman (1925) -19 Cr.App.R. 8 , and goes on to say, at p. 583:
ippreciation
                           “ Simple lack of care such as will constitute civil liability is not
ireciation of
                           enough; for purposes of the criminal law there are degrees of negli-
 which were _     D        gence: and a very high degree of negligence is required to be proved
   Mr. Stone               before the felony is established. Probably of all the epithets that can
; gravity of               be applied ‘ reckless ’ most nearly covers the case. It is difficult to
tion. I did                visualise a case of death caused by reckless driving in the connotation
ng.’ If that               of that term in ordinary speech which would not justify a conviction
 ou are sure               for manslaughter: but it is probably not all-embracing for reckless
io about it,               suggests an indifference to risk whereas the accused may have appre-
im on what ^       ^       ciated the risk and intended to avoid it and yet have shown such a
as you find                high degree of negligence in the means adopted to avoid the risk as
 she do her                 would justify a conviction.”
ould acquit
                           It is clear from that passage that indifference to an obvious risk and
                      appreciation of such risk, coupled with a determination nevertheless to
  to sA reed p     p run it, are both examples of recklessness.
d e s ^ R in                The duty which a defendant has undertaken is a duty of caring for
>f de.    or           the health and welfare of the infirm person. What the prosecution have
le omission            to prove is a breach of that duty in such circumstances that the jury feel
ry decisions           convinced that the defendant’s conduct can properly be described as
ance. Mr.              reckless, that is to say a reckless disregard of danger to the health and
?. v. Lowe             welfare of the infirm person. Mere inadvertence is not enough. The

 R v Caldwell [1981] 1 All ER 961, House of Lords
 (Lord Wilberforce, Lord Diplock, Lord Edmund-Davies, Lord Keith of Kinkel and
 Lord Roskill)

 Lord Wilberforce. My Lords, 1 would dismiss the appeal and answer the certified questions as
 suggested by my noble and learned friend Lord Edmund-Davies.

 Lord Diplock. My Lords, the facts that gave rise to this appeal are simple. The respondent had
 been doing work for the proprietor of a residential hotel. He considered that he had a grievance
 against the proprietor. One night he got very drunk and in the early hours of the morning he
 decided to revenge himself on the proprietor by setting fire to the hotel, in which some ten guests
 were living at the time. He broke a window and succeeded in starting a fire in a ground room
 floor; but fortunately it was discovered and the flames were extinguished before any serious
damage was caused. At his trial he said that he was so drunk at the time that the thought that
 there might be people in the hotel whose lives might be endangered if it were set on fire had never
crossed his mind.
    He was indicted at the Central Criminal Court on two counts of arson under s 1(1) and (2) res­
pectively of the Criminal Damage Act 1971. [His Lordship cited s 1 p 575, below].
    Count 1 contained the charge of the more serious offence under s 1(2) which requires intent to
endanger the life of another or recklessness whether the life of another would be endangered. To
this count the respondent pleaded not guilty. He relied on his self-induced drunkenness as a
defence on the ground that the offence under sub-s (2) was one of ‘specific intent’ in the sense in
which that expression was used in speeches in this House in Director o f Public Prosecutions v
M ajewski [p 87, below]. Count 2 contained the lesser offence under s 1(1) to which the
respondent pleaded guilty.
   The recorder directed the jury that self-induced drunkenness was not a defence to count 1, and
the jury convicted him on this count. The recorder sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment
on count 1 but passed no sentence on count 2, the lesser offence, to which he had pleaded guilty.
On appeal the Court of Appeal held that her direction to the jury as to the effect of self-induced
drunkenness on the charge in count 1 was wrong. They set aside the conviction on that count: but
left the sentence of three years’ imprisonment unchanged as they considered it to be an appro­
priate sentence on count 2. So it was only a Pyrrhic victory for the respondent; but it left the law
on criminal damage and drunkenness in a state of some confusion.
   The question of law certified for the opinion of this House was:
        ‘Whether evidence of self-induced intoxication can be relevant to the following
        questions—(a) Whether the defendant intended to endanger the life of another; and
        (b) Whether the defendant was reckless as to whether the life of another would be
        endangered, within the meaning of Section l(2)(b) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971.’
   The question recognises that under s l(2)(b) there are two alternatives states of mind as
respects endangering the life of another, and that the existence of either of them on the part of the
accused is sufficient to constitute the mens rea needed to convert the lesser offence under s 1(1)
into the graver offence under s 1(2). One is intention that a particular thing should happen in
consequence of the actus reus, viz that the life of another person should be endangered (this was
not relied on by the Crown in the instant case). The other is recklessness whether the particular
thing should happen or not. The same dichotomy of mentes reae, intention and recklessness, is to
be found throughout the section: in sub-s (1) and para (a) of sub-s (2) as well as in para (b); and
‘reckless’ as descriptive of a state of mind must be given the same meaning in each of them.
   My Lords, the Criminal Damage Act 1971 replaced almost in their entirety the many and
detailed provisions of the Malicious Damage Act 1861. Its purpose, as stated in its long-title was
lo revise Vk law of England and Wales as to offences of damage to property. As the brevity of the
Act suggests, it must have been hoped that it would also simplify the law.
   In the 1861 Act, the word consistently used to describe the mens rea that was a necessary
element in the multifarious offences that the Act created was ‘maliciously’, a technical
expression, not readily intelligible to juries, which became the subject of considerable judicial
exegesis. This culminated in a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Cunningham
[His Lordship cited the passage from Kenny approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal (p 64,
above)].
   My Lords, in this passage Professor Kenny was engaged in defining for the benefit of students
the meaning of ‘malice’ as a term of art in criminal law . To do so he used ordinary English words
                                                                                           R e c k l e s s n e s s a n d n egl i g e n c e   69


                          in their popular meaning. Among the words he used was 'recklessness', the noun derived from
                          the adjective ‘reckless’, of which the popular or dictionary meaning is ‘careless, regardless, or
                          heedless of the possible harmful consequences of one’s acts’. It presupposes that, if thought were
                          given to the matter by the doer before the act was done, it would have been apparent to him that
1 of   Kinkel and         there was a real risk of its having the relevant harmful consequences; but, granted this, reckless­

   going on to take it, a mental state described as ‘closing his mind to the obvious fact’ that there is
   such a risk (see [1977] 2 All ER 37 at 40. [1977] 1 WLR 600 at 604).
      R v Stephenson [1979] 2 All ER 1198, [1979] QB 695, the first case in which there was full
  argument, though only on one side, and a reserved judgment, slammed the door again on any
  less restricted interpretation of ‘reckless’ whether particular consequences will occur than that
  originally approved in Briggs. The appellant, a tramp, intending to pass the night in a hollow in
  the side of a haystack, had lit a fire to keep himself warm; as a result of this the stack itself caught
  fire. At his trial, he was not himself called as a witness but a psychiatrist gave evidence on his
  behalf that he was schizophrenic and might not have had the same ability to foresee or appreciate
  risk as a mentally normal person. The judge had given to the jury the direction on the meaning of
  reckless that had been approved in R v Parker. The argument for the appellant on the appeal was
  that this let in an objective test whereas the test should be entirely subjective. It was buttressed by
  copious citation from previous judgments in civil and criminal cases where the expressions
  ‘reckless’ or ‘recklessness’ had been used by judges in various contexts. Counsel for the Crown
  expressed his agreement with the submissions for the appellant. The judgment of the court
  contains an analysis of a number of the cited cases, mainly in the field of civil law. These cases do
  not disclose a uniform judicial use of the terms; and as respects judicial statements made before
  the current vogue for classifying all tests of legal liability as either objective or subjective they are
  not easily assignable to one of those categories rather than the other. The court, however,
 reached its final conclusion by a different route. It made the assumption that although
 Parliament in replacing the 1861 Act by the 1971 Act had discarded the word ‘maliciously’ as
 descriptive of the mens rea of the offences of which the actus reus is damaging property, in
 favour of the more explicit phrase ‘intending to destroy or damage any such property or being
 reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed’, it nevertheless intended the words
 to be interpreted in precisely the same sense as that in which the single adverb ‘maliciously’ had
 been construed by Professor Kenny in the passage that received the subsequent approval of the
 Court of Appeal in R v Cunningham.
     My Lords, I see no warrant for making any such assumption in an Act whose declared purpose
 is to revise the then existing law as to offences of damage to property, not to perpetuate it.
 ‘Reckless’ as used in the new statutory definition of the mens rea of these offences is an ordinary
 English word. It had not by 1971 become a term of legal art with some more limited esoteric
 meaning than that which it bore in ordinary speech, a meaning which surely includes not only
 deciding to ignore a risk of harmful consequences resulting from one’s acts that one has
 recognised as existing, but also failing to give any thought to whether or not there is any such risk
in circumstances where, if any thought were given to the matter, it would be obvious that there
was.
     If one is attaching labels, the latter state of mind is neither more nor less ‘subjective’ than the
 first. But the label solves nothing. It is a statement of the obvious; mens rea is, by definition, a
state of mind of the accused himself at the time he did the physical act that constitutes the actus
reus of the offence; it cannot be the mental state of some non-existent, hypothetical person.
    Nevertheless, to decide whether someone has been ‘reckless’ whether harm ful consequences of
a particular kind will result from his act, as distinguished from his actually intending such
harmful consequences to follow, does call for some consideration of how the mind of the
ordinary prudent individual would have reacted to a similar situation. If there were nothing in
the circumstances that ought to have drawn the attention of an ordinary prudent individual to
the possibility of that kind of harmful consequence, the accused would not be described as
‘reckless’ in the natural meaning of that word for failing to address his mind to the possibility;
nor, if the risk of the harmful consequences was so slight that the ordinary prudent individual on
due consideration of the risk would not be deterred from treating it as negligible, could the
accused be described as ‘reckless’ in its ordinary sense if, having considered the risk, he decided
to ignore it. (In this connection the gravity of the possible harmful consequences would be an
important factor. To endanger life must be one of the most grave.) So to its extent, even if one
ascribes to ‘reckless’ only the restricted meaning, adopted by the Court of Appeal in Stephenson
and Briggs, of foreseeing that a particular kind of harm might happen and yet going on to take
the risk of it, it involves a test that would be described in part as ‘objective’ in current legal            e1
jargon. Questions of criminal liability are seldom solved by simply asking whether the test is
                                                                                                              ir
subjective or objective.
    in my opinion, a person charged with an offence under s 1(1) of the 1971 Act is ‘reckless as to           ei
whether or not any property would be destroyed or damaged’ if (!) he does an act which in fact
creates an obvious risk that property will be destroyed or damaged and (2) when he does the act               [1
he either has not given any thought to the possibility of there being any such risk or has                    d.
recognised that there was some risk involved and has none the less gone on to do it. That would
be a proper direction to the jury; cases in the Court of Appeal which held otherwise should be                [1
regarded as overruled.
                                                                                                              A

 t one has     of reason and conscience are cast off was held to be a reckless course of conduct and an integral
y such risk    part of the crime. Lord Elwyn-Jones LC accepted as correctly stating English law the provision
 that there    in §2.08 (2) of the American Model Penal Code:
                      ‘When recklessness establishes an element of the offence, if the actor, due to self-induced

juencesof      lives of residents in the hotel owing to his self-induced intoxication would be no defence if that
ding such      risk would have been obvious to him had he been sober.
nd of the          My Lords, the Court of Appeal in the instant case regarded the case as turning on whether the

ividual on     the offence were an actual intention to endanger the life of another. For the reasons I have given,

           ‘A driver is guilty of driving recklessly if he deliberately disregards the obligation to drive
           with due care and attention or is indifferent whether he does so and thereby creates a risk
           of an accident which a driver driving with due care and attention would not create’?

 [Lord Hailsham made a speech dismissing the appeal.)

    Lord Diplock. . . . The context in which the word ‘reckless’ appears in s 1 of the Criminal
   Damage Act 1971 differs in two respects from the context in which the word ’recklessly’ appears
   in ss 1 and 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1972, as now amended. In the Criminal Damage Act 1971
   the actus reus, the physical act of destroying or damaging property belonging to another, is in
   itself a tort. It is not something that one does regularly as part of the ordinary routine of daily-
   life, such as driving a car or a motor cycle. So there is something out of the ordinary to call the
  doer's attention to what he is doing and its possible consequences, which is absent in road traffic
  offences. The other difference in context is that ins 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 the mens
  rea of the offences is defined as being reckless whether particular harmful consequences would
  occur, whereas in ss 1 and 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1972, as now amended, the possible harmful
  consequences of which the driver must be shown to have been heedless are left to be implied from
  the use of the word ‘recklessly’ itself. In ordinary usage ‘recklessly’ as descriptive of a physical
  act such as driving a motor vehicle which can be performed in a variety of different ways some of
  them entailing danger and some of them not, refers not only to the state of mind of the doer of
  the act when he decides to do it but also qualifies the manner in which the act itself is performed.
  One does not speak of a person acting ‘recklessly’, even though he has given no thought at all to
 the consequences of his act unless the act is one that presents a real risk of harmful consequences
  which anyone acting with reasonable prudence would recognise and give heed to. So the actus
 reus of the offence under ss 1 and 2 is not simply driving a motor vehicle on a road, but driving it
 in a manner which in fact creates a real risk of harmful consequences resulting from it. Since
 driving in such a manner as to do no worse than create a risk of causing inconvenience or
 annoyance to other road users constitutes the lesser offence under s 3, the manner of driving that
 constitutes the actus reus of an offence under ss 1 and 2 must be worse than that; it must be such
 as to create a real risk of causing physical injury to someone else who happens to be using the
 road or damage to property more substantial than the kind of minor damage that may be caused
 by an error of judgment in the course of parking one’s car. . . .
      1 turn now to the mens rea. My task is greatly simplified by what has already been said about
 the concept of recklessness in criminal law in R i; Caldwell . Warning was there siven against
adopting the simplistic approach of treating all problems of criminal liability as soluble by
classifying the test of liability as being either ‘subjective’ or ‘objective’. Recklessness on the part
of the doer of an act does presuppose that there is something in the circumstances that would
have drawn the attention of an ordinary prudent individual to the possibility that his act was
capable of causing the kind of serious harmful consequences that the section which creates the
offence was intended to prevent and that the risk ot those harmful consequences occurring was
not so slight that an ordinary prudent individual would feel justified in treating them as
negligible. It is only when this is so that the doer of the act is acting ‘recklessly’ if, before doing
the act, he either fails to give any thought to the possibility of there being any such risk or, having
recognised that there was such risk, he nevertheless goes on to do it.
     In my view, an appropriate instruction to the jury on what is meant by driving recklessly would
be that they must be satisfied of two things: first, that the defendant was in fact driving the
                                                                                         Recklessness a n d negligence       73

                   some other person who might happen to be using the road or of doing substantial damage to
                   property; and, second, that in driving in that manner the defendant did so without having given
                   any thought to the possibility of there being any such risk or, having recognised that there was
                   some risk involved, had none the less gone on to take it.
                      It is for the jury to decide whether the risk created by the manner in which the vehicle was being
                   driven was both obvious and serious and, in deciding this, they may apply the standard of the
illybelton,        ordinary prudent motorist as represented by themselves.
                      If satisfied that an obvious and serious risk was created by the manner of the defendant s

                    act which in fact creates an obvious risk that property will be destroyed or damaged’, he meant a
esslv would         risk which was obvious to the particular defendant. This argument was accepted by the
driving the         magistrates and is set out by them in the following passages in para 7 ot the case stated.
74   Fault

       ‘H.    That while the respondent had realised that the contents of the bottle which
              contained white spirit were possibly inflammable, she had not handled it betore
              and had not appreciated how explosively it would burn and immediately become
              out of her control, thereby destroying the shed and contents and also placing her
              own life at risk.
       1.     That the respondent had given no thought at the time that she started the fire to the
              possibility of there being a risk that the shed and contents would be destroyed by
              her actions. That in the circumstances this risk would not have been obvious to her
              or been appreciated by her if she had given thought to the matter.
       J.     We were unable to form any conclusion on the question why she had started the
              fire.
       K.     That in reaching our findings set out herein we had due regard to the age and
              understanding of the respondent, her lack of experience of dealing with
              inflammable spirit and the fact that she must have been tired and exhausted at the
              time.
       L.     That we accepted the interpretation of the effect of the decision in the case of R v
              Caldwell put forward on behalf of the respondent.
       M.     That in particular we found it implicit in the decision in that case that a defendant
              should only be held to have acted recklessly by virtue of his failure to give any
              thought to an obvious risk that property would be destroyed or damaged, where
              such risk would have been obvious to him if he had given any thought to the
              matter.
       N.     Accordingly having regard to our findings set out above, we found the respondent
              not guilty of the charge and dismissed the information.’
   Before us, counsel for the appellant has argued forcefully that the magistrates were wrong to
adopt that interpretation of the decision in Caldwell. He submits that the phrase ‘creates an
obvious risk’ means that the risk is one which must have been obvious to a reasonably prudent
man, not necessarily to the particular defendant if he or she had given thought of it. It follows,
says counsel, that if the risk is one which would have been obvious to a reasonably prudent
person, once it has also been proved that the particular defendant gave no thought to the pos­
sibility of there being such a risk, it is not a defence that because of limited intelligence or exhaus­
tion she would not have appreciated the risk even if she had thought about it.
   It is right to say, as counsel for the appellant pointed out to us, that there are passages in the
speech of Lord Diplock in Caldwell which suggest that his Lordship was indeed using the phrase
‘creates an obvious risk’ as meaning, ‘creates a risk which was obvious to the particular
defendant.’ Thus, his Lordship said ([1981] 1 All ER 961 at 964 [1982] AC 341 at 351):
       ‘Among the words [Professor Kenny] used was “ recklessness” , the noun derived from
       the adjective “ reckless,” of which the popular or dictionary meaning is “ careless, regard­
       less, or heedless of the possible harmful consequences of one’s acts” . It presupposes
       that, if thought were given to the matter by the doer before the act was done, it would
       have been apparent to him that there was a real risk of its having the relevant harmful
       consequences . . .’
  Speaking of another earlier decision of the Court of Appeal, in R v Briggs [1977] 1 All ER 475,
[1977] 1 WLR 605n, he said ([1981] 1 Ail ER 961 at 965, [1982] AC 341 at 353):‘. . . even though
the risk is great and would be obvious if any thought were given to the matter by the doer of the
act.’
   He said ([1981] 1 All ER 961 at 967, [1982] AC 341 at 35-5):
       ‘So, in the instant case, the fact that the respondent was unaware of the risk of endan­
       gering the lives of residents in the hotel owing to his self-induced intoxication would be no
       defence if that risk would have been obvious to him had he been sober.’
  The last passage was based on the earlier decision of the House of Lords in R v M ajewski
[1976] 2 AUER 142, [1977] AC 443, a decision relating to the effect of self-induced intoxication
on intent. But, quite apart from the Majewski test, the decision of the majority in Caldwell that
intoxication, even if it resulted in the defendant not thinking at all whether there was a risk that
property or life would be endangered, nevertheless did not take him out of the state of mind
properly described as ‘reckless’ is only consistent in my view with their Lordships meaning by the
phrase ‘creates an obvious risk’ creates a risk obvious to the reasonably prudent person.
   That the submission of counsel for the appellant is correct is to my mind, however, put beyond
a peradventure by two later decisions of the House of Lords. [His Lordship cited Lord Diplock s
discussion of ‘reckless’ in Lawrence, p 72, above, and M iller , p 25, above].
   In the light of these last two authorities, we are in my judgment bound to hold that the word
                                                                                     R e c k l e s s n e s s a n d ne gli g e n c e   75

:stroyed by     believe myself constrained to do so by authority. I feel moreover that 1 would be lacking in
^ious to her    candour if 1 were to conceal my unhappiness about the conclusion which 1 feel compelled to
                reach. In my opinion, although of course the courts of this country are bound b\ the doctrine ot
started the     precedent, sensibly interpreted, nevertheless it would be irresponsible for judges to act as auto­
                matons, rigidly applying authorities without regard to consequences. Where therefore it appears
he age and      at first sight that authority compels a judge to reach a conclusion which he senses to be unjust or
aling with      inappropriate, he is, 1 consider, under a positive duty to examine the relevant authorities with
jsted at the    scrupulous care to ascertain whether he can, within the limits imposed by the doctrine of pre­
                cedent (always sensibly interpreted), legitimately interpret or qualify the principle expressed in
case of R v     the authorities to achieve the result which he perceives to be just or appropriate in the particular
                case. I do not disguise the fact that I have sought to perform this function in the present case.

                would be destroyed; because first sfie did an act which created an obvious risk that the property

                arson) as ‘blazing on regardless’; nor is it even a case where failure to give thought to the
sages in the    possibility of the risk was due to some blameworthy cause, such as intoxication. This is a case
: the phrase    where it appears that the only basis on which the accused might be held to have been reckless

                ticularly where the word ‘reckless’ is used simply to characterise the relevant conduct. But such a
irived from     test does not appear at first sight to be appropriate to a crime such as that under consideration in
ess, regard-    the present case, especially as recklessness in that crime has to be related to a particular

                the facts of the present case, bearing in mind that those facts are very different from the tacts

                 critical, in articles written by j urists; and that I have studied certain of these articles with interest.

this qualification can be justified in any event. Where there is no thought of the consequences,
any further inquiry necessary for the purposes of establishing guilt should prima facie be directed
to the question why such thought was not given, rather than to the purely hypothetical question

characteristics which might be relevant to his ability to foresee the risk, would have appreciated                               ‘ii
it. He drew our attention in particular to the submission made by the prosecution before the
justices in E lliott’s case (1983) 77 Cr App R 103; [1983] 1 W'LR 939 (see p 110 and p 940 res­
pectively) ‘that in relation to the defendant aged 14 years, the proper approach was whether such
risk would have been obvious to a normal 14 year old child.’ Therefore he said he was not seeking                                A
to relate the test to the particular defendant, but merely, so to speak, to a class of which he is a                             io
member. This, he says, provides him with the same logical basis of approach to the reasonable                                    re

    reckless driving occurs at a time when the driver recognised there was a risk involved         point of law
    and had nevertheless gone on to take it. When J e n n in g s was heard in the Divisional       manslaughte
    court—see G o vernor o f H o llo w a y P r is o n , ex parte J e n n in g s [1982] 1 W.L.R.   killed as a re

    vating features which would justify a verdict of manslaughter” and “some other                should the d
    ingredient must exist to justify such a charge” when comparing the common law and             involved anc
    the statutory offence. An instance of an aggravating feature would be the use of a            the commiss

       There has been much debate in recent years upon the subject of the meaning of                The Appe

   to the conclusiveness of the opinion expressed in L a w r e n c e , (supra) but we can           Solicitor.   I
   readily understand why, because of what may to some or even many people seem to
   be the artificial co-existence of the common law and the statutory offence, the
   attempt is yet again, as it appears to be here, being made to create degrees of
   recklessness in order to demonstrate that there is a marked difference between the
   ingredients of these two offences. However, G o v e r n m en t of U n ited S tates v
  J e n n in g s (1982) 75 Cr.App.R. 367; [1982] 3 W.L.R. 450, is an authority for
  the proposition that there is no difference.                                                       LO R D .
      At pp.377 and 461 Lord Roskill said: “Since in my view in English law the
  ingredients of the statutory offence are co-extensive with the ingredients of the
  relevant common law offence of manslaughter, the concession inevitably involves
  that the evidence would justify committal for manslaughter. The further submission
  by Mr. Littman upon the absence of any finding by the learned stipendiary magistrate
  of what Mr. Littman called ‘aggravating circumstances’ does not arise.”

n recklessness is                the Police Act 1964. The defendant persisted in trying to stop the arrest and an
ng manslaughter                  information was preferred against him alleging the section 51(3) offence. At his
                                 trial the justices found that although the defendant’s interference was motivated
: given to juries
                                 by a desire to prevent what he believed to be an unjustified arrest, nevertheless
Tie was conscious
                                 his conduct in the circumstances prevailing at the time constituted an obstruction
; a matter which                 of the police constable in the execution of his duty and they convicted the
. if he can, giving              defendant. On appeal,
1 that person had                   Held, that a private citizen had no lawful excuse to interfere with a lawful
                                 arrest by a police officer; in the present case the defendant’s motive was
leal dismissed.                  irrelevant, and as his action was aimed at the police officer, it was an attempt to

1933 the matter may be approached differently if the victim is under the age of 16
years. That cannot be right. Section 1 of that Act is dealing with offences created
by that section and not reforming the law relating to other offences.
  In the present case the learned judge seems to have been led into error by the
report in G i b s o n (supra) to which he had been referred when the submissions were
made. The reference (in the passage which has been read of his direction on
manslaughter) to custody and care and to general custody and care goes to the
wording of section 1. There was no more justification in the present case for
inferring the presence of both defendants or active participation by the non-stnking
parent than there was in G i b s o n . In our view, the passage which has been quoted
from the summing-up was telling the jury that they were entitled to draw inferences
which the evidence did not allow, and which clearly they did draw because they
convicted both defendants.
   Accordingly, the convictions on count 1 must be quashed. Since the appeals
against conviction on count 2 are not pursued we say no more about them.
   The result, distressing though it may be, is that a serious crime commute          y
someone goes unpunished. But we take comfort from the words of Lord Goddard
C J in A b b o t t . Although the strict application of the wording of section 1 of the
Children and Young Persons Act 1933 to the facts of this case falls outside this
judgment, we suggest that some consideration might be given to increasing the
maximum penalty which may be imposed in cases that do fall within it.
   Accordingly, the appeals against the convictions for manslaughter will be allowed.
   We received a submission on behalf of James Lane against his sentence of two
years’ imprisonment on count 2. We see no reason to distinguish between the
 appellants in respect of sentence on that count, and that appeal against sentence is
dismissed.                                            ,            _    .      r„.
                                       Appeals allowed on count 1. Convictions fo r
                                         manslaughter quashed.

: age of 16          vessels and he and his first mate and the captain and deck officer of the oth

 cases in the Court of Appeal which held otherwise should be regarded as                     Th
                                                                                          Engl,
 overruled.”                                                        .          . .
   Lord Diplock was in that passage thus stating (in part) a negative proposition.        in L.
 He was dealing with the factual situation where there was nothing to alert the           mote
 ordinary prudent individual to the possibility of harmful consequences or where          such
 that possibility was so slight that the individual could properly treat the risk as       anott
 negligible. Such conduct was not "reckless” within the ordinary meaning of that           thou:
                                                                                          was
 ordinary English word.
   Their Lordships now move to L a w r e n c e (1981) 73 C r.A pp.R . 1, [1982] A.C.       to de
 510, There the House was dealing with death caused by reckless driving. The               provi
 House unanimouslv accepted the view of the majority in R. v. C a l d w e l l (supra)         In
 as to the meaning of "reckless” and of "recklessness” . It applied that ruling to the     have
 statutory offence of causing death by reckless driving and suggested a model              conc
                                                                                           regai
 direction in such cases.
   Lord Diplock, on this occasion speaking for all the noble and learned Lords then         Did
 present, said, after quoting from his speech in L a w r e n c e , (at pp. 11 and 526      phvs
                                                                                           trave
 respectively):                                                                 . .
 “In my view, an appropriate instruction to the jury on what is m eant by driving          defe:
 recklessly would be that they must be satisfied of two things: first, that the            giver
 defendant was in fact driving the vehicle in such a manner as to create an obvious        exist
                                                                                             Ui
 and serious risk of causing physical injury to some other person who might happen
                                                                                           Arch
 to be using the road or of doing substantial damage to property; and second, that
                                                                                           was
 in driving in that manner the defendant did so without having given any thought to
 the possibility of there being any such risk or, having recognised that there was
                                                                                           feel
 some risk involved, had nonetheless gone on to take it. It is for the jury to decide
                                                                                           negu
  whether the risk created by the manner in which the vehicle was being driven was
                                                                                           as ai
  both obvious and serious and, in deciding this, they may apply the standard of the
  ordinary prudent motorist as represented by themselves."

C r . A p p . R . 211, 216:
“We have to say that       the law as it stands compels us to reject Mr. Connell’s
persuasive submissions      and to hold that the judge s directions were correct,
although we are of the view that it is no longer necessary or helpful to make
reference to compensation and negligence. The L a w r e n c e direction on recklessness
is comprehensive and of general application to all offences, including manslaughter
involving the driving of motor vehicles recklessly and should be given to juries
without in any way being diluted. W hether a driver at the material time was
conscious of the risk he was running or gave no thought to its existence, is a matter
which affects punishment for which purposes the judge will have to decide, if he
can. giving the benefit of doubt to the convicted person, in which state of mind that
person had driven at the material tim e.”
    Learned counsel for the Crown pressed their Lordships to apply the proviso to
section 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 even though their Lordships felt
obliged to hold that there had been the misdirection already mentioned. Their
Lordships find themselves unable to take this course. They regard the misdirection
as so fundamental (especially as it was in writing and given to the jury on
retirement) that it is impossible to assert that a properly directed jury must
inevitably have reached a verdict of guilty against Kong. There was in connection
 with this part of the submission on behalf of the Crown much discussion regarding
 the facts, with a view to showing that on a proper direction a conviction was
 inevitable. Their Lordships did not find it necessary to hear counsel for Kong on
 this issue and it would not be right for them to offer any detailed comments upon
 the facts beyond observing that the summing-up does not seem to have distinguished
 between an obvious risk created by those navigating each hydrofoil by their own
 navigation and the response by those on board one hydrofoil to any obvious risk
 created by the navigation of the other.
    Their Lordships thus do not find it necessary to discuss the evidence afforded by
 the written statements of those involved or their evidential status. This last matter
 is now concluded by the decision of the Board in L e u n g K a m - K w o k v. R. (1985)
  81 C r.A pp.R . 83, judgment in which was given after the hearing in the Court of
  Appeal in the present case.
    It was for these reasons that their Lordships, in respectful disagreement with the
  Court of Appeal regarding the misdirection by the learned judge, felt constrained
  humbly to advise her Majesty that this appeal must be allowed and Kong’s

    3.     The following is a brief statement of the evidence: Walter Davies of Newbury,
 1 Glebe Way, Whitstable, a retired person gave evidence that on June 7, 1982, he
 had left Glebe Way. At the bottom of his garden had been a large wooden shed in
 good condition containing tools of various kinds, and paint and turpentine. The shed
 had been burnt when they had returned, and he valued shed and contents at £3,206.
 No one had had permission to damage property. Cross-examined he gave evidence
 'hat there had been bottle of white spirit. There might have been half a can of
 Paraffin. Turps might have been in a plastic bottle. It would only have had the notice
 s'uck on it, “white spirit.” There might possibly have been a box of matches in the
  shed.

had a ride to the Street. We then went to the Harbour in Whitstable. Then after that;
we went out of the harbour into the High Street, where we met a friend. We stayed’
around in the High St. for some time until our friend Dinyo left us about 9.30 p.®,-
We then went to Blean and Seasalter and halfway to Faversham. Then after that, we
turned around and came back to Whitstable. We returned to the alley at the rear of
Nicola’s house where she took the bike from me and went inside. She didn’t return
so I went into her back garden to see if the light was on. It wasn’t on so I went out
of the back garden and went into the houses, took the equipment and came out
again. I went into a ladies back garden and went into the shed. Then after a little:
while came out. I then went over a fence into another garden from the alley at the"
rear of Nicola’s house. I went into the shed in this garden. I had a look round. I then1
got the spirit and the matches and set it alight. I ran out and went through the front
gate of the house. I turned right the milkman was there so I went back so he couldn’t'
see me. I then just turned right and went straight up and round the comer. I then
went straight up again and turned into the alley which backs on to the rear of Nicola’*
house. I climbed over another fence and went into a different shed and hid round the
comer. I put the stereo on and then turned it off and saw the firemen coming I then-
heard the milkman talking about me. After that, when it had all finished. I came out
of the shed and over the fence. I went back down the alley then Mr. Petts came,
along and took me home. I would like to add that after returning to Whitstable from
going halfway to Faversham I visited Nicola Petts’ home and her grandmother’s
home. We also walked around Whitstable before Nicola left me.                             , ;

   (a) That the defendant had set fire to and destroyed the shed and contents.
   (b) That the defendant had acted recklessly in so doing.
   (c) That the meaning of recklessness for this purpose was defined by Lord Diplock
in the case of R. v. C a l d w e l l (1981) 73 Cr.App.R. 13; [1981] 1 All E.R. 961 in the

(2) when he does the act he either has not given any thought to the possibility of
there being any such risk or has recognised that there was some risk involved and hat
nonetheless gone on to do it.
   (d) That in relation to the defendant aged 14 years, the proper approach was
whether such risk would have been obvious to a normal 14-year-old child.                     j:

  In these circumstances, I agree that the questions must be answered as proposed
by Glidewell J. and that the appeal must be allowed.

  The Court certified under section 1(2) of the Adm inistration of Justice Act I960'
that the following point of law of general public im portance was involved in its
decision, i.e. “Can a defendant be properly convicted under section 1(1) of the
Criminal Damage Act 1971 on the basis that he was reckless as to w hether property
was destroyed or dam aged when he gave no thought to the risk; but by reason of his
age, lack of understanding, lack of experience and exhaustion, the risk would not
have been obvious to him if he had thought about it?”
  T he Court refused leave to appeal to the H ouse of Lords.
                                                                       A ppeal allowed.

   A c k n e r L .J.: O n O ctober 18, 1983 at the Central Criminal Court the appellant
pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary and to two counts of arson. H e initially
pleaded not guilty to a count of arson with intent to endanger life but later changed
his plea to guilty on that count also. O n O ctober 21 he was sentenced by Judge
A bdela on that indictm ent and on a further indictm ent, to which he had also
pleaded guilty, as follows: Indictm ent 830217—counts 1, 3 and 4, burglary, 3
m onths’ detention on each concurrent, count 5, arson with intent, 4 years’
detention, count 6 , which was an alternative count of arson w ithout the intent to
endanger life, no separate sentence was imposed. Indictment 830303—count 2,
burglary, 3 m onths’ detention concurrent. H e was also committed for sentence for
an assault for which no separate sentence was imposed. Thus the total period of
detention was 4 years. It was detention and not im prisonment because he was aged
15 at the time. H e now appeals against conviction on a point of law only and
against sentence by leave of Farquharson J.
    Indictm ent 830217, which involved the arson charges, is the im portant one. The
appellant’s two co-defendants w ere respectively Stephen Thomson, aged 16, and
Sydney Franklin, aged 17. Thom son was sentenced to 6 m onths’ youth custody on
the arson with intent count (count 5) and to 3 m onths’ youth custody concurrent on
each of the three counts of burglary. Sydney Franklin was involved, though to a
lesser degree than Thom son and the appellant, in the arson charges only. H e was
sentenced to community service after a deferm ent.
    T he facts concerning two of the burglaries on that indictment are as follows:
C ount 1— O n the morning of O ctober 22, 1982 it was found that Coles Street
School, Dollis Hill Lane, had been entered during the night. A pane of glass in one
 of the cupboards had been broken and a cash box removed. T here was no cash in
 the box. C ount 3— O n D ecem ber 5/6 the sam e school was again entered and on
 this occasion a substantial am ount of property was stolen. On D ecem ber 9 the
 police received an anonymous telephone call to the effect that if they w ent to 35
 Coom ber Close, a flat occupied by a Mrs. G aller and her daughter Simone, they
 would find the stolen property. The police took up this suggestion and they found
 the appellant with a num ber of other youths and the stolen property. He was
 questioned and adm itted his p art in the burglaries. W e come now straight to the
 arson counts because they are connected with the history which we have just given
 in relation to the events of D ecem ber 9, 1982.
     A t about 11.20 p.m . on D ecem ber 13, Mrs. G aller and her daughter were in
 their flat at 35 Coom ber Close. T hat is a ground floor flat, which is a particularly
  relevant fact. Mrs. G aller was in the sitting room and Simone was in the bedroom,
  reading. They both heard three loud bangs and the girl saw sheets of flame at her
  bedroom window. She thought her room was on fire and she ran screaming to her
  m other. They found that the fire was coming from the wall outside and blowing
  across the window. T here were three separate fires coming from three milk bottles
  on the grass close to the window. The police found blackened areas on the wall m
  close proximity to the girl’s window. T here was a m ark on the wall indicating that a
  petrol bomb had been throw n as close as some 18 inches to the girl’s bedroom
  window. The police w ent immediately to the appellant’s house. It smelt of petrol
                                           STEPHEN MALCOLM R,                                 337

           and a pair of gloves belonging to him were soaked in petrol. W hen he was asked
           w hether they w ere his gloves, he challenged the police to prove it.
              The appellant was interviewed on D ecem ber 14 and told the police that at about
           4.30 p.m . the previous day he was at Thom son’s house and from what was said
           there he and Thom son form ed the opinion that Simone had “grassed” upon them,
           given the inform ation that led to their arrest at her flat on D ecem ber 9. They
           therefore decided to do something to her and later at the appellant’s house
           Thom son suggested making petrol bombs. H e, the appellant, already had petrol.
           They inserted petrol-soaked rags into the bottle necks to act as wicks. They—
           himself, Thom son and Franklin (Thom son’s friend)— then went to the rear of
           Simone’s flat, lit the wicks, threw the bottles at the wall and ran. Each threw one
           bottle. There had been no discussion as to w hether the bottles should be thrown
           through the window or at the wall, but he said he threw his at the wall and in fact
           all the bottles hit the wall. H e said that he thought that the petrol would go out
ic ^ o r   after it had burned for only a few m inutes. They did not intend to cause Simone
w          any injury but only to frighten her. H e had considered beating her up, but then he
s ag       thought that if he did that he might lose his tem per and hurt her, and he did not
ly and     want to do that. H e said he did not realise at the time that if the petrol bom b had
           gone through the window it might have killed her. H e had only just realised when
   The     he was interviewed by the police that that danger existed.
5, and         W hen the m atter came on for trial the appellant adm itted the facts which were
>dy on     the basis of count 6 , which did not charge with intent to endanger hum an life, but
ent on
           he pleaded not guilty to count 5 on the ground that he did not have the requisite
ii to a
           intent and had not acted recklessly. T hat question—“had he acted recklessly?”—
[e was
           was the real issue. M r. Timms at the beginning of the trial sought a ruling from the
           trial judge as to the direction which the learned judge would give on the subject of
           recklessness. H e subm itted that when considering recklessness, the jury could only
 Street
           convict the appellant if he did an act which created a risk to life obvious to
in one
           someone of his age and with such of his characteristics as would affect his
 ash in
           appreciation of the risk. H e should not in law be capable of being convicted if the
nd on
           act created a risk which was obvious to an ordinary prudent person of m ature years
           and understanding, but was not obvious to him at his age and with his characteristics.
           T he learned judge ruled against that submission and accordingly, Mr. Timms, with
found      characteristic good sense, advised his client to alter his plea. The appellant then
           pleaded guilty and was sentenced as we have indicated.
               The point of law which is raised before us is the point which Mr. Timms took
           before Judge A bdela. It is said that the learned judge erred in law in deciding that
            the test of recklessness as to w hether life was endangered was as follows: A person
ere in      is guilty of the offence if (i) he does an act which in fact creates a risk to the
:ularlv     ordinary prudent m an, i.e. one of m ature years and understanding, that life will be
room,       endangered; (ii) he did the act not having given thought to the possibility of such a
at her      risk; or (iii) recognising that there was some risk, he nonetheless continued the act.
to her         The learned judge, it is urged, was wrong in law because he failed to apply the
owing       law in relation to what constitutes the “ordinary prudent man” and failed adequately
>ottles     to consider D irector of P ublic P rosecutions v. C amplin (1978) 67 C r.A pp.R . 14;
vail in     [1978] A .C . 705. H e should have found that the ordinary prudent man is
 that a     synonymous with the reasonable m an and therefore the jury should have had
Iroom       regard to the particular situation of the appellant, namely his age, and any other
            characteristics which would affect his appreciation of the risk.
338                             COURT OF APPEAL

   This arson, it is accepted by Mr. Timms (who has argued this case with great               would be destroyed con

 great       would be destroyed contrary to the same section in the Criminal D am age Age 1971
lainly       as that with which we are concerned. She was a schoolgirl who had reached the age
vhich        of 14 years in May 1982. She lived with her foster m other and was in a remedial
:h he        class at school. O n the evening of June 15, 1982 she went out with an older
 .P.P.       girlfriend. She hoped to stay the night at the friend’s home, but was unable to do
tering       so. She did not return to her own home, but stayed out all night, not sleeping for
ount,        the whole of the night. A t about 5 a.m . on June 16, 1982 she entered Mr. D avies’
>plied       garden shed. She found white spirit in a plastic container. She poured this onto the
upra)        carpet on the floor of the shed, threw two lighted matches onto the spirit, the
             second of which ignited. The fire immediately flared up out of control and the girl
■d by        left the shed. In due course proceedings were taken against her.
) that          The justices found th a t while she had realised that the contents of the bottle
leone       which contained the white spirit were possibly inflammable, she had not handled it
   that     before and had not appreciated how explosively it would b u m and immediately
: take      becom e out of her control, thus destroying the shed and its contents, placing her
            own life at risk. She had not given thought at the time that she started the fire to
ls i^ ft    the possibility of there being a risk that the shed and its contents would be
 Lore       destroyed by her actions. In the circumstances the risk would not have been
uding       obvious to her or been appreciated by her if she had given thought to it. In
on of       reaching their findings the justices said that they had paid due regard to the girl’s
ve to       age and understanding, her lack of experience in dealing with inflammable spirit
ed to       and the fact that she must have been tired and exhausted at the time. They had
vould       had the case of R. v. C a l d w e l l (supra) drawn to their attention and they said they
it the      found it implicit in the decision that a defendant should only be held to have acted
e law       recklessly by virtue of his failure to give any thought to an obvious risk that
'erent      property would be destroyed or dam aged where such risk would be obvious to him
e fact      if he had given any thought to the m atter. They therefore dismissed the information.
1) 73          The m atter was considered first in the judgm ent of Glidewell J. H e referred in
1) 73       detail to C a l d w e l l ’s case (supra), which involved destroying property by fire
•83] 2     intending to endanger life or being reckless w hether life was endangered contrary
            to section 1(2) of the 1971 Act. H e quoted from Lord Diplock who said (p. 20 and
learly     p. 354F in E ll io t t ’s case): “In my opinion, a person charged with an offence under
. 510,     section 1(1) of the Criminal D am age A ct 1971 is ‘reckless as to w hether any such
:o 2 2 ;   property would be destroyed or dam aged’ if ( 1 ) he does an act which in fact creates
ct of      an obvious risk that property will be destroyed or dam aged and ( 2 ) when he does

   rs i^   gone on to do it. T hat would be a proper direction to the jury; cases in the Court

 0 the     m ost recent decision in the Court of A ppeal on the meaning of “reckless” on which
a risk     the recorder in R. v. C a l d w e l l had based her direction to the jury was S t e p h e n s o n
           (1979) 69 C r.A pp .R . 213, 219; [1979] Q .B . 695 , 703, where Geoffrey Lane L .J. (as
-Lion      he then was), giving the judgm ent of the C ourt in th at case, said: “A man is

    o not think that that via media was for one m om ent in the mind of Lord Diplock
   The opportunity so to ingraft this im portant modification on the principle which he
      . ®"unciated had arisen in the subsequent cases and would have been just the
               (li 11 T  3 VaUd ° ne) Which We would have exPected the H ouse of

  had the opportunity to do so when considering w hether or not to give leave in

  O off L .J. that m essence “recklessness” has now been construed synonymously with

 S      h                    L C w th Lord D iplock’s conclusion in R. v. L a w r e n c e ,
 5 ?          ,  381             Hailsham said at 73 C r.A pp.R . 1 , 6 ; [1982] A .C . 510
 520: It only surprises me that there should have been any question regarding the
 existence o f mens rea in relation to the words ‘reckless,’ ‘recklessly’ or ‘recklessness.’
 Unlike most English words it has been in the English language as a word in general
 pnnl H f     SinCe     eighth Century A -D - 31111051 alway$ with the same meaning
 applied to a person or conduct evincing a state of mind stopping short of deliberate
 intention, and going beyond m ere inadvertence, or in its m odern, though not its
 etymological and original sense, m ere carelessness.” The excerpt from the speech
 of Lord Diplock is at p. 1 0 and p. 525 respectively, w here he refers to C a l d w e l l ’s
 case (supra) and says: “The conclusion reached by the majority was that the
 S i k V             WhCn USCd in 3 criminal statute, i.e. the Criminal Damage Act
 1971 had not acquired a special meaning as a term of legal art, but bore its
 popular or dictionary meaning of careless, regardless, or heedless of the possible
 harmful consequences of one’s acts. The same must be true of the adverbial
 derivative recklessly’.”
   We therefore dismiss the appeal against conviction. A lthough we would have
 preferred that the judge should have at least been entitled in law to have left to the
jury the question, would a boy of the defendant’s age have appreciated that to have
thrown petrol bombs very close to the windows of this dwelling house was a danger
to the life of the occupants of that house, we have little doubt that on the facts of
this case the answer would have been clearly in the affirmative. As we have already
stressed this was a ground floor flat and the petrol bombs w ere thrown so close to
the window where the girl whom it was sought, so it was said, to frighten, had her
bedroom, that one landed within 18 inches of that window.
   We now turn to the question of sentence. Mr. Timms has wisely accepted that
   is was serious arson. It was planned. It was vicious in the sense that it was
designed to w reak revenge upon a girl who was thought to have given information
to the police. Certainly to the adult it was redolent of serious danger to human life.
Mr. Timms does not therefore urge upon us that the sentence of four years
although a severe sentence, could itself be said to be seriously wrong. H e takes’
sensibly, his best point first and, in our judgm ent, essentially his only point, namely
that there is a gross disparity between the sentence which was imposed upon the
                                                                            \# fe-

appellant and the sentence which was imposed upon at least one of the co­
defendants, namely Thom son. H e received, as we have earlier recorded, only six
m onths’ youth custody. Thomson on the face of it was as much to blame as the
appellant. The suggestion m ade by the learned judge that the appellant was the
instigator appears to be supported by no firm evidence. W hat seems to have
affected the judge very markedly was that from a very early age the appellant had
shown his criminal disposition, although he had not in fact committed any offences                      Aiding and abetting,

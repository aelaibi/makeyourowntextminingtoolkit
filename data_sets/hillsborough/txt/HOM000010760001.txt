LORD JUSTICE TAY L O R ’S INTERIM REPORT



Mr Whalley has spoken to me about the timing of Lord Justice
T a y l o r 's interim report. On present plans the inquiry should
finish hearing all evidence around 7 July.       Lord Justice Taylor
thinks he will then need about a fortnight to write his report
and Mr Whalley thinks that it could be completed by 21 July.
Mr Whalley points out th a t , having worked as quickly as possible
to provide an interim report, Lord Justice Taylor will expect
Ministers to deal with it as a matter of urgency.       Sir Clive
Whitmore would therefore be grateful if you and copy recipients
could begin consideration of how we will process the report.

From my conversations it is clear that Mr Whalley believes that
it will be for the inquiry to publish their report. Sir Clive
is not certain that this is the right procedure.  He wonders
whether the correct approach would be for Lord Justice Taylor to
send the report to the Home Secretary and for the Home Office
then to arrange publication.  He would be grateful if you would
ascertain what happened when Mr Justice Popplewell produced his
interim report. If publication is a matter for the Home Office
perhaps you could ensure that Mr Whalley and the inquiry team
are warned of how publication should be handled. {I presume
there is no need to lay such a report before Parliament
ie, there will not have to be a delay if Parliament is in recess
when we receive the report.) If publication is for the Home
Office, Sir Clive would be grateful if you would ascertain now
the quickest way in which publication can take place and begin
making the necessary arrangements.

Sir Clive expects that Ministers would not wish to publish the
report without at the same time giving some indication of the
Government's response.  However there will not be much time to
put advice to Ministers. On present plans the Home Secretary
intends to be out of the country on leave from 8 August to
15 August.  From 18 August to 1 September he will be in the
country but still be on leave. I have asked Mr Whalley to let
me have advance sight of any likely recommendations that Lord
Justice Taylor might make if this is feasible but we must assume
that we will only have about a week to put advice to the Home
Secretary before he leaves the country.  Clearly the Department
of the Environment and the Prime Minister will also need to be
consulted on the Government's response and it would be as well
to consider now with Environment officials how their Ministers’
views can be obtained assuming that they too intend to be on
leave in A u gu s t . It may be that Ministers' leave plans mean
that publication will have to await the Home Secretary's return
to the UK.    However Sir Clive would be grateful if you could now
begin consideration of the logistics of putting advice to
Ministers on the Government’s response to the report. For
example Ministers may wish to circulate the report under cover
of a circular to the police or to local authorities and it would
be as well to establish now how quickly such circulars could be
issued.

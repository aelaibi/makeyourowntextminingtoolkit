 communications                         officer              was    at       the     control           and       he    began         looking             at     the

 that            it w a s         faulty           and       I remember              throwing              the    handset            onto       the

 control               desk.            I took           a normal             hand        he 1 d r ad i o         and       from      that          time        all

 transmissions                         were        relayed           in t h a t          fashion.

 I remember                      thinking              -another              big    match         and       the       radio      is       useless.

 In the               previous            semi          final       for       a    long      period          all       that      was          received

 was         pop m u s i c .              We       believed             that       it w a s       a    local          rad io     company             doing            a

their        way     to, the          front            and    my    thought             was     "John Charles                  and       his     t e a ms

People        were       still            climbing            the       perimeter              fencing        and        many       were       being

lifted        up     into        West       Stand            and    my       thoughts           re    the     access           to       the    stands

was     not     one      of      being           rescued           from        the      crowd        but    getting            up       there      so

they     could          have         a seat.

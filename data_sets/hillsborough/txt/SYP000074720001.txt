             I am                               aged S3 years, an unemployed single man

             living at                                                   Solihull,     where I have

             lived for about twelve months.

             I have supported Liverpool         football    club for most of my life and have

             attended most home and a.\/ty games involving the club for probably the

             past fifteen years.        I am well experienced in the crowds that attend

             matches    involving first division football           clubs, and always elect to

             go standing on the terraces at Liverpool matches.

             On Saturday     15 April   1989 (150489)      I was in Liverpool having travelled

             up there with the intention of attending the F A Challenge                   cup semi­

             final between Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C. at Sheffield

             Wednesday's ground at Hillsborough,            Sheffield.    I t r a ^ l l e d with an

             organised coach party arranged by Barnes Travel, VJelton Rd, E v e r t o n .
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     S 1898

The coach cost £5.00 and I boarded at Priory Rd, Liverpool at about

9arr. <0900).

Once on the coach,      I managed to find someone who had a spare t i c k e t ,

another supporter who I did not know and I paid him £6.00 for it,

which was for the standing area of the Leppings Ln e n d .

Also on the coach with me was my g i r l frie nd’s brother,

                          , Kirby, Liverpool,     who had a ticket for the W

Stand seats.

The    coach took us by motorway most o ^ T h e way and the only delays

which we experienced were on tty^ u t s k i rts of M a n ches ter , where there

w a s very slow moving\traff^t^ though I am not sure how long the hold­

up was for, and about v m r e e     to four miles outside Sheffield where

Police were halting coaches and other vehicles at the roadside and

searching them for alcohol and other            items. JjHur coach was stopped and

searched also, and detained for about Xejn m i n u t e s , though nothing was

found and we continued onto the grourfd.

The    coach was parked in the road near to the Bass brewery,                     which would

have been at about 1.45pm (1345),            however we did not actually get off

the coach until      1.55pm (1355) approximately.

Having got off the coach I made my way on foot to the ground with many

other Liverpool supporters and found no difficulty in finding my entry

point to the ground. En route to the ground I did not see any

drunkenness,     fighting or disorder, although some supporters were

obviously in high spirits.         I did not see any Police directions to the

ground from our arrival        point,   but then they were not riecesj^^y as

most    people knew where they were going,         having a t t e n d e d ^ m e    previous

y e a r ’s match at the same g r o u n d ,

I did see some supporters drinking alcohol             frd^Ma^Tns and bottles,           but

as I have said,      I do not think there was any drunkenness. There was no

more alcohol     consumption than is normal for most football matches,                    in
                                                                                    S   PAGE     3
                                                                                        SI 898

     my   o p i n 1o n .                                      /^
     I arrived at the entrance to the ground jLX about g.P5pm, and then

     decided to try and find a shop for soore refreshments and food. At this

     time there were quite a few crowdsy^f                 people standing near to the entry

     point,      but no crush of people as/such. Many of these people were

     asking or shouting out foe tickets,                 but this is quite normal   for a

     game of this calibre.

     I actually started queueing at about 2 . 15|>m (1415>r» and arrived

     outside the turnstiles               inside the main gates tc/find a crowd of people

     but no orderly q u e u e s . It was quite a crush pnd supporters began

     trying to organise people into queues,                 unf/rtunately they would not.        I

     only saw one Policeman outside the turnsXiIe s >                  average sized man

     wearing a flat cap and Police uniform,/and I think bearing some badges

     of rank,       but I cannot say what. He w/s trying,           unsuccessfully to

     organise the crowd and must have bfen in the crowd for some time. He

     eventually disappeared towards                   main gates and I did not see him

     again.

     The crowd was surging backwards and forwards and there did not appear

     to be any movement            into the ground. Ai*er a while some Police Officers

     on horses,            two I think,    pushed theyr way into the mass of people from

     the side and were trying to forcer people towards the turnstiles.                    This

     was making the situation w o r s e X a t h e r        than better with people getting

     more    crushed in an attempt              get away from the horses.

     After a considerable            leng^J)f of time,    by which time I had moved further

     from the turnstiles,            to the right gft them,     in the crush of people,      I

C,   saw a large gate to the side of /The turnstiles open and the crowd

     surged through.            I followed andrpassed through into ground.

     Whilst waiting            in the cruVtjAiutside the turnstiles we all had heard a

     roar from the crowd inside the ground and then the gates seemed to

     open and we were let through.               I was not in a position to see who had
                                                                                           PAGE       4
                                                                                           SI 898

             opened these gates,      just that they were opened, and I cannot really

             say at what time this happened.

             Once   inside the ground I did not see any signs directing people to the

             standing areas,     nor slid I see any stewards or Police Officers directing

             people or otherwise.       I just went with the flow of people and followed

             them into the tafrmel, through which I could see the ground and players

             on the pitc^

             Everyone was anxious to get into the groujfFd and see the match,

             obviously,      and as we entered the tunnel^»e started to run.           Inside the

             tunnel    itwas quite full but         relative/y easy flowing. The crowd slowed

             to halt just before the entranceN^i/o the terraces, A n d               I pushed my

             way through into what I think must have been pen J m r e e .

             I made my way initially to point one I have indicated on the grid

             (Ex Ref       )(Ex No       ), quite    close within eight feet of a fence to

             my right.      I could see people climbing over this fence into the

             adjoining      pen butI was    powerless to do this,     because of the crush.

             The    crush became worse and I found my arms trapped at my sides, my

             breathing became quite shallow and I began to have difficulty

             breathing at all. The       crowd was not moving at all by now, there was rio

             surging,    which would have relieved some/ pressure.

             I can remember seeing two people in -yont of me at a distance of

             about four feet or so, a big fat majf who was,           or appeared to be d e a d ,

             and a young girl who was having great difficulty breathing. The
~vX~v TbO*
^3           man I can describe as a white m y e, about 5"7—8 , between about 30 and

             40 y ea r s, of very fat b u i l d , w A h   shortish receedinq hair      (I could not

             say what    colour),    wearing a M g    thick coat quite old fashioned

             looking. He was purple in thp face and appeared lifeless,                 but leaning

             forward.The young girl        I c/rt describe as a white female,         of 15-19 yrs,

             5"E of slim build,       po< isij/ly with a ’w e d g e ’ type haircut    (I cannot say

                 It was as a noticed these people,           fleetingly,         that I was having

                 breathing difficulties,         and I can recall being           passed over peo ple ’s

                 heads and out of the pen onto the pitch.                I was    passed through the open

                 pitch gate and placed on the             pitch to     the right of the                                                 goal.

                 I was quite dazed and shocked            and was very relieved to be out                                                              of the

~T>C^            pen. As I sat on the grass I saw right next to m e a man w ho was in the

                 recovery position, a white male, E0-E5 yrs,                 of about average height

^ „     x-       anyone,       to help him,    but after some minutes a Policeman came and put a
^cXS-O, ^            J                                                       ~
       bo^-^coat       over the m a n ’s head.      I cannot be sure that this man had been

                 breathing,          it was just what   it appeared to me.

                 I recovered sufficiently a-Mirer some time to be able t o assist the

                 Police    (mainly) to rendex first aid to people and generally get people

                 on their feet and to A m b u l a n c e s   on stretchers.        Having helped a number

                 of people I decided I had had enough and left the pitch back into the

                 pen, along the tunnel and out of the ground.                 I made my way back to the

                 coach and waited for the remainder of the coach party. We eventually

                 left Sheffield at about 6pm (1800)            that evening and returned to

                 Liverpool.

                 I did not attend hospital          in Sheffield nor have I received,                                                    so far,

                 any medical treatment.          I have not to my knowledge any injuries

                 physically,         which are visible.

                 I did not at any time see anyone drinking alcohol                   inside the ground,

                 although a group of us did drink from a bottle of beer which one of

                 the other lads on the coach had outside the turnstiles, which he had

been told    to drink    before he entered the ground by the Police.

I did not    see anything which I would consider to be a criminal

offence,    however,    there were people collecting personal            belongings and

items of clothing off the pitch,           putting them into clear plastic bags,

and handing them to Police Officers. People may have thought that this

was stealing,    but it was obvious they were               collecting them for an

official    purpose.

I did not    hear any loud speaker announcements directing people                to

leave the    stadium,    in fact I do not remember hearing any loud speaker

announcements made.

At first the Police near the perimeter fence and gate on to the pitch

did not realise what was happening and were                  pushing people back into

the pen as they tried to climb out.             I think they were just trying to

stop people getting onto the pitch and did not know of the danger

inside the pens for the people. The Police suffered a lot of abuse at

the hands of the fans and I do not think it was fully justified,

people were just hot-headed and really in shock.                  I think the Police

tried their hardest having realised the seriousness of the situation.

I did not hand my ticket          in at the gate.      I have surrendered it in aid

of the appeal.

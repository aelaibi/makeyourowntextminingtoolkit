               quite          normal       at    a Liverpool                   match although              following                the     surge         the

                was    a gradual             increase          in     the      pressure             from        behind.

                on    the    field          having       a kick          about       and       I ca n      remember           they were

                announcing             over       the    load         s p e a k e r s the           names       of     the    p la y e r s .         Ire c a ll

      y         pitch       at    this       time.

                It w a s     at    about          this       time     that      I looked             around          to m y     r i g ht    and        just       to

                my    rear       and    I saw                                       I think          this       would        have     been       about        2.

                58    pm,    two m i n u t e s          before         kick     off.

                I can       remember          seeing          the      game     kicking             off w h e n       I was      still          in

                position          number          one.

                Also     1 can         say    t ha t     I was         still        at    about          position number              one       (1)       when
oat             I saw Peter             Beardsley             hit      the     cross          bar     at the         other     end    of th e        ground

                Within about                one     second         of B e a r d s l e y        hi tt i ng        the    cross        bar.        I was

                suddenly          shot       forwards          down       the       terraces,             a distance            I would          estimate

                to    be a b o u t      7 or 8 feet,                and      I ended           up     in a        pos i t i on       I have          marked

                as    number       two       (2)    on       the    attached             plan       of    the     terracing.

                By    this       time       I had       lost       sight       of

                When     I was         shot       forward          I had       to    push m ys e lf              backwards and              steady

                myself       to    stop myself                going       any       further          forwards.               1 steadied myself

                and    tried       to       step    backwards.

                A gap       had a ppeared               in f r o n t      of    where          I had        ended        up at p o s i t i o n          numbei

                  suddenly appeared,                  I can       remember        seeing       people        lying

                  on     the    terraces           about    five     feet      in f r o n t    of me.          I can        remember       seeing

                  people        climbing           over    those     people       who      were     lying      on

                  the     terracing           as    they were        trying       to    get    towards         the    perimeter          fence.

                  barrier         I saw        but    it w a s     definately a             crush        barrier.

                  Although           I d id    not a c t u a l l y      see    the     crush      barrier          break    and    I was        not

                  actually           in    contact        with    the    barrier        when      it     broke,      I believe          that     the

                  ■barrier        broke       as a    result       of    the     surge     which         occurred when Beardsley

                  h it    the     cross       bar,    the    barrier          broke     within         one   second after           Beardsley

                  hit     the     cr oss      bar.

                  I have        no    idea w h e r e       either                              or                                       Here at

                  the     time       the    barrier        went    I ha d      lost     sight       of    them      prior    to   this

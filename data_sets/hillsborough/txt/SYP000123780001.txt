  DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE j j t f T l ' H E   INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

  AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED;? U J- , / o

  THOSE POLICEMEN WHO WERE AT THE FRONl/NEAR TO THE INCIDENT DID A l L THEY COULD

  3UT THERE WERE A LOT WHO COME       INTQ/THE GROUND AFTER WHO DID NOTHING.          I

  THINK THE FIRE SERVICE WORKED       WsiLL   TOGETHER AND WERE CO-ORDINATED,

  MOST OF THE POLICE wERE ONLY INTERESTED IN CROWD CONTROL WHICH I SUPPOSE

  WAS REQUIRED AT ONE POINT BUT THAT WAS SOON OVER AND THERE WASN'T ANY

  MORE 'TROUBLE SETwEEN THE TWO SETS OF FANS AFTER EVERYONE REALISED

         F HAD HAPPENED

  IT APPEARED THAT THE FIRE SERVICE KNEW WHERE THEIR EXPERTISE WAS REQUIRED

  AND WENT TO THEIR TASK.        I DID HEAR ONE TANNOY REQUEST ASKING FOR ANY

  DOCTORS WHO WERE IN THE STADIUM TO ASSIST.


Q 17

  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

  THE SPION KOP END BECAUSE ITS THE LARGER END.

  052 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

  N0„

  Q53 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY            THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

  AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

  THE POLICE WERE BRILLIANT ONCE THE GAME WAS STOPPED AND THEY KNEW WHAT WAS

  HAPPENING.


(:■)

  Q5h     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

  JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

  THERE WAS NO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY         AS FAR AS I ’M AWARE,,   THE SUPPORTERS SHOULD

  HAVE BEEN TOLD MATCH PUT BACK.          I BELIEVE     THE OPENING OF THE CONCERTINA GATE

  CAUSED THE INCIDENT.      I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS IT WAS OPENED WAS THAT

  POSSIBLY THE POLICE WERE IN FEAR OF THEIR OWN SAFETY.             THEY LOOKED PETRIFIED

  DUE TO THEIR SMALL NUMBERS,,     NEED FOR MORE POLICE TO CONTROL AND DIRECT

  TRAFFIC EN ROUTE,.

 BE REMOVED,     SO PEOPLE COULD MOVE OUT TO ALL PARTS OF THE TERRACE.

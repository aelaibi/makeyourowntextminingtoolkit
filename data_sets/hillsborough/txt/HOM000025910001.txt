                            (AFTERNOON SESSION)

                       SUPERINTENDENT ROGER MARSHALL Recalled

                        Cross-Examined bv MR. WOODWARD (Cont)

        Q. Mr. Marshall, perhaps  it is not necessary to go into the
           detail of it.  I want to ask you about the conduct of some
           people, some fans and spectators, after the event.  Do you
           follow? - A. Yes.

        Q. Is it right that you were sworn at? - A. Yes.

        Q. And you were spat upon? - A. Yes.

        Q. And that was the fate of other Officers also? - A. Yes.

        Q. Thank you, Mr. Marshall.

^                           Re-Examined bv MR. GOLDSACK:

        Q. Mr. Marshall,    just one matter, please, and it is seeking
           information.     You gave your impression of how the perimeter
           gate came to    be open, and you rightly said that the Officers
           nearby would    be in a better position to tell this Inquiry what
           caused that?    - A. Yes.

        Q. Can you in fact identify any Officers who were near the gate
           at that time? - A. Yes, Lionel Procter, Sergeant Procter, will
           be able to tell the Inquiry about that.

        Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Was he inside or outside? - A. he
             was in the vicinity of that gate.

        Q. I know, but was he inside or outside? - A. He was inside the
           gate.

        Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   Any others that you can identify? - A.
             No.  I know there are records at Headquarters of the people
             who were there, but he is the only chap I can bring to mind
             just now.

        Q. Thank you very much.     I have no other questions.

                               Bv LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

        Q. I would just like to ask you a couple of things, Mr. Marshall.
           First of all, the arithmetic that we went through before as to
           the turnstiles, when you said it would require 32 turnstiles
           to get a certain number in in a particular time.      Do you say
           you have done that arithmetic since the event? - A. Yes.      At
           Leppings Lane there are 23 turnstiles.      Between 2 p.m. and 3
           p . m . , if you multiply 23 by the notional rate of flow of 750
           that gives you a total of 17,250.       I worked on the basis
           that Liverpool were allocated 24,000....

        Q. No, I was not doubting your arithmetic for a moment.  The
           question is this.  If you had been aware of that arithmetic at
2- .

                                    61

                                                         R. MARSHALL


          the planning stage of this match would it have concerned you?
          - A. "Concerned" may be the wrong word.  I think we would have
          noted the arithmetic, but having regard to our previous
          experience perhaps "concerned" might not have entered into the
          equation.

       Q. Put it this way.  Was it a surprise to you to find out that is
          what it worked out at? - A. No, it was not a surprise, because
          clearly the turnstiles were open for three hours as distinct
          from one hour, so based on a throughput in one hour of 17,000
          then another 7,000 hopefully would have been through the
          turnstiles in the remainder of the three hour period.

       Q. Very well.  The other thing was this.  I d i d n ’t quite follow
          what you were saying about the numbers. I appreciate it is
          only an estimate, but you said at one stage there were 6,000
          to 8,000 there and still coming? - A. Yes.

       Q. And that the numbers were growing because the rate at which
          they were coming exceeded the rate at which they were going
          through the turnstiles.  I think you said that to Mr. Hytner
          last night, if I am not mistaken. - A. Could you say that
          again, my Lord.  I am not just understanding.

       Q. At the stage when there were 6,000 to 8,000. -    A. 2.15-ish.

       Q. Yes.  At that stage the numbers that were outside were
          increasing because more were coming down than were being
          delivered into the ground by the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

       Q. If that is so what I d o n ’t follow is how by 20-to-3 you said
          this morning to me that it had gone down to about 3,000 to
          4,000 outside? - A. Yes.     The impression I had at 2.15 was
          that Leppings Lane was full in both directions on the
          pavements and spilling over on to the road.     I guessed that
          between 2.15 and 2.40 a substantial of those persons had
          actually got into the ground, and again my perception of
          numbers, augmented by the video I think I have seen at 2.40,
          would be in the region of 2,000 to 3,000 in the vicinity.

       Q. At. 2.40? - A. At 2.40,    yes.

       Q. Well, if that is right, 2.40 or thereabouts is when you began
          to become concerned? You had not been up until then. - A.
          Yes.

       Q. What I d o n ’t follow is how you began to get concerned when
          there were only 2,000 to 3,000 and had not been when there
          were 6,000 to 8,000? - A. Yes, but you appreciate that the
          mood which I described yesterday had changed or was changing.
          At 2.15 there was not a problem.     People were being admitted
          very quickly into the ground in a normal way, and nothing
          whatsoever was causing anxiety, but at 20-to-3 the mood was
          changing.

       Q. Because at 20-to-3 you were nearer to the kick-off time? - A.
          The kick-off time, and the urgency which I described yesterday
*?

              was staring to prevail within the crowd.

         Q. Thank you very much, Mr. Marshall.    - A. Thank you, sir.

                       SUPERINTENDENT BERNARD DEAN MURRAY Called

                               Examined bv MR. PHILLIPS:


         Q. Bernard Dean Murray? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. Superintendent of Police in the South Yorkshire Police? - A.
            Yes, sir.

         Q. How long have you been a Superintendent? - A. I have been a
            Superintendent since 14th March, 1988, sir.

         Q. Have you had experience in the F Division of Sheffield since
            you were a Superintendent? - A . Y e s .

         Q.   Were you there before then? - A. I have not served   in F
              Division before March 1988, no, sir.

         Q.   In particular, have you had experience of football   matches? -
              A. Yes, sir.

         Q. Were you the Officer who was in charge of the league match
            between Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool on 14th January,
            1989? - A. I was not the Officer in charge, but I was at that
            game, sir.

         Q. Can we look at Tab 21 in the second volume of the South
            Yorkshire Police documents.  Do we see there - unfortunately
            the pages are not numbered - but about the fifth page,
            Appendix B, your name under "Ground Control".  Is that right?
            - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. And above you, overall command, Chief Superintendent Mole? -
            A. That is correct.

         Q. And then we have some Chief Inspectors and some Inspectors.
            So you were the only Superintendent at that match.  Is that
            right? - A. Yes.

         Q. And were you concerned, therefore, not just with the ground
            control but with the other duties of a Superintendent at that
            game? - A. With the duties of the....?

         Q. Of a Superintendent at that game? - A. If I am in charge of a
            game I would normally run it anyway from ground control.

         Q. Yes.  Is that what happened on this occasion? - A. Chief
            Superintendent Mole would be in overall command and I would be
            the Officer in ground control making decisions on the ground.

         Q. Was Chief Superintendent Mole there at the time? - A. Where?

                                                 B.D. MURRAY


Q. At the game? - A. Yes, he would be at the game.      As far as I
   can remember.

Q. Were you concerned with the operational order that was made at
   that time? - A. Yes, sir, I would be.

Q.   And you were concerned with making it with Chief
     Superintendent Mole? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. We see from the first page of that entry, do we not, that the
   away supporters were to be accommodated - item 1.23 - in the
   West Stand and the Leppings Lane terrace? - A. yes, sir.

Q. That was the location for them.  Is it right there were no
   Sheffield Wednesday supporters at that end of the ground? - A.
   Of all the matches I have policed there we have not had
   Sheffield Wednesday supporters at that end of the ground.

Q. So the whole of the Leppings Lane terrace was available to the
   Liverpool fans? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   Would you turn now, please, to Serial 9, the duties there.   Do
     you see there in Phase 1, "Maintain order.   Ensure pens are
     filled in accordance with instructions from control"? - A.
     Yes, sir.

Q. In relation to the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You would, of course, be the one giving those instructions,
   would not you? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Why did you think it necessary to put that in the order for
   this particular match? - A. This is a league game with only a
   small crowd expected.     I think the attendance is expected of
   2,000 to 3,000.     If at all possible with away supporters to
   maintain maximum segregation we confine them to the two centre
   p e n s . That keeps them the maximum distance away from the home
   fans.

Q. So it was really to keep them apart from the Sheffield
   Wednesday fans? - A. That is the idea, yes, sir.




                           /Q. Was that in fact how
I

                                 64

                                             B.D. MURRAY


    Q. Was that in fact how it worked out when you came to giving
       directions from control that you put them all into the
       centre two pens? - A. I cannot remember, sir. We would
       try and assess the number of supporters that were coming
       and would be standing on the terraces and decide whether
       to give them the centre two pens, the centre two pens and
       the south pen or whatever.  We would try and get it accurate
       the first time because it saves the problems of supporters
       rushing round when you open pens and climbing fences.

    Q. Was that Serial in fact posted inside the pens on the
       Leppings Lane terraces? - A. They would maintain that
       from the concourse outside sir.

    Q. Would there be Officers in the pens themselves? - A. No sir.

    Q. How would they then ensure that they were filled in
       accordance with instructions? - A. If we filled the centre
       two pens there would be an Officer on the gates at the
       back of the terrace on the outside.

    Q. And otherwise the Officers would simply be directing them
       down the tunnel or wherever? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. In the case of the match that we are concerned with on the
       15th of April of this year, you accept, do you, that there
       was no similar kind of provision for organising the liverpool
       fans? - A. No sir, they were given the whole terrace and
       let them go where they want to.

    Q.   Did you think that was a practical proposition? - A. It was
         a system that had worked well in  the past and I could see
         no benefit in changing it.

    Q. Do you think it was likely that they would be able to move
       from the centre pens to the side pens? - A. They can and
       I now appreciate the difficulty because there is only one
       gate at the back.

    Q.   That is right on each side? - A.    Yes sir.

    Q.   Now coming to the match, I think  you had a good deal to
         do with the planning of the operation for the match on the
         15th of April, didn't you? - A. Yes, I did sir.

    Q. You attended various meetings.       Is that right? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. First of all on the 20th of March with Chief Superintendent
       Mole? - A. I think that was the day that we found out we
       were having the match.  I don't think it was a meeting as
       such.

    Q. Then I think with Mr. Mole and Mr. Sewell on the same day
       you came to the conclusion that you ought to repeat the
       order for the previous year? - A. Yes.
                             65

                                       B.D. MURRAY


Q. You considered that that had gone off pretty well, had you?
   - A. Yes.  There were a number of problem areas which I
   applied my mind to, but generally the event had gone off
   well.

Q. You say in your statement that the order was to be prepared
   by Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector Sewell? - A. Yes sir.

Q. What then was your role and that of Chief Superintendent Mole's
   as you understood it? - A. To overlook the order and to sort
   of input any information that was necessary.

Q. You had    an instruction, I think, to reduce the number of
   men used   on the various Aerials, didn't you? - A. I was
   asked to   aim for a reduction in manpower, yes sir.  I was
   asked to   aim for 10%.

Q. And did you in fact achieve that? - A. Well I think the
   10% was achieved, yes sir.

Q. Now you had I think some views which you expressed about
   improvements that could be made on the previous year.  Is
   that right? - A.Yes sir, I did.

Q. You had carried out the same role on the previous year,
   had you? - A. Yes, I had.

Q. And you made some alterations I think to the Serials that
   were at the junction of Leppings Lane and Penistone Road?
   - A. With a match of this nature all supporters from
   Liverpool, or the majority, would go along Leppings Lane
   towards Wadsley Bridge Station and the coaches parked up
   Penistone Road.  The majority of Nottingham supporters
   would go in that direction on Penistone Road to the coaches
   which are parked on the bus depot at Herries Road and that
   makes the Leppings Lane roundabout a natural sort of meeting
   point and one which we felt should be reinforced.

Q. Is the bus depot in fact on the roundabout itself or just
   on the corner of the roundabout? - A. You turn right and
   it is about 100 yards on the left-hand side, sir.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   In Herries Road? - A. It is
     in Herries Road.

Q. That is the bus depot for Nottingham Forest? - A. It is
   actually the Sheffield City Council bus depot but they
   allow Nottingham Forest to use it for parking their coaches.

Q.         MR. PHILLIPS:  Had you had trouble at that area the
     previous year? - A. No sir, but it always is a potential
     flashpoint and one of the Superintendents in charge of
     the Nottingham sector was particularly concerned that there
     may be a problem there and so it was foreseen that we
     might have problems and the resources there were reinforced.

              Q. Now you also I think made some alterations to Serial 1 that
                 was concerned with the perimeter track in the ground, didn't
                 you? - A. Yes sir, that was increased.

              Q.    What  was the object of that? - A. Well mainly to provide
                   more cover on the track. We were also going to support that
                   at the end of the game with several other Serials to control
                   and monitor any pitch invasion that may follow at the end
                   of the match.

              Q. Had there been a pitch invasion the previous year? - A. Yes.

              Q.   When    had that occurred? - A. That had occurred at the Leppings
                   Lane end when Liverpool supporters had come over the top,
                   over the fences and round the sides.

              Q. At what point in the game? - A. At the conclusion when
                 Liverpool had won.

              Q. As far as the West Stand Serial was concerned, did you make
                 some alterations to their duties? - A. The West Stand Serials?

              Q. Yes.  You say they were "to be particularly vigilant"? - A.
                 Oh yes sir. At half-time particularly at the previous match
                 there had been a lot of climbing from the terraces into the
                 West Stand and they were to be vigilant to prevent people
                 climbing up from the terraces on to the West Stand.

              Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  What were people doing that for?
                   - A. It was presumably to get a better view of the game, my
                   Lord.  It was obvious there was no seats for them.  They
                   were being helped up from above by supporters and quite large
                   numbers of them climbed up at half-time to the higher vantage
                   point above.

              Q.         MR. PHILLIPS: Was this from Pens 3 and 4? - A. This
                   was mainly from the railings that run between the centre
                   railings and the railings at either end of 3 and 4. Also
                   some came over from the raised terrace on the north of
                   the West Stand.

              Q. Had there been particular crowding in Pens 3 and 4 in the
                 previous year then? - A. Not that I was aware of.

              Q. Can you give us any idea of how many people were doing this
                 sort of thing the previous year? - A. I cannot give you the
                 numbers.  It was sufficient for me to be concerned about
                 it. What I was concerned about was that people were climbing
                 up only a few feet away from Police Officers who obviously
                 could not see them. When people lean over the stand it is
                 impossible for an Officer to see what is going on only a
                 few feet away from him.

              Q. Were the Officers in the West Stand given any specific
                 duties in relation to the terrace down below? - A. Not that
                 I know of, no sir.

Q. There is nothing in the printed order of course that tells
   us that? - A. The only specific duties they were given in
   relation to that was to watch for people climbing up from
   the terrace.

Q. They were not required to look into the terrace down below
   to see how it was filling up during the hour, half-an-hour
   before the match started? - A. That is not a part of their
   specific duties, no sir.

Q.^It is certainly not part of their written duties, that is
   true. - A. I would expect all Officers and all Stewards
   to be aware of those type of problems.  Similar to fire,
   we don't brief them particularly, but if it comes to
   anybody's attention I would expect to be notified that
   they had a problem of whatever type.

Q. Did you have any Officers at all who were concerned to
   keep a watch on the filling of Pens 3 and 4 of the Leppings
   Lane terrace? - A. There was no one who had a specific
   duty as such.

  Id o you think there should have been? - A. I cannot recall
   ever having a problem in the time that I have been there
   but obviously as a result of events, |tes.

Q. With hindsight you do? - A. With hindsight.

   Although it was not part of the detailed, any part of the
   Serials' written instructions, was there an oral instruction,
   to your knowledge, given to any of those Serials to look
   out for this kind of problem? - A. There wasn't an oral
   instruction given by myself or Mr. Duckenfield or anyone
   else at the general briefing.   Whether any of the Super­
   intendents, inspectors or Serial Sergeants gave specific
   instructions at their own briefings I don't know sir.

Q. But you did not in fact include it in the instructions you
   gave, in the oral instructions you gave, to the Inspectors?
   - A. No sir.  The briefing that I gave the staff at the
   start of the event I did not include it.  I did not consider
   it a particular problem.

Q. I think you made some further provisions for segregating
   supporters in the Kop? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Who belonged to the wrong side, as it were, from the rest
   of the people? - A. Yes.

Q. And some provision for buses to be outside in Leppings
   Lane and Penistone Road? - A. Yes sir.




                        /Q. That is for the end

That is for the end of the match, is not it? - A. Yes,
these were all b a s e d on the e x p e r i e n c e s of the pr ev io us
year.

Yes, an d I t hi nk you also made some alterations, did not
you, to the p r o v i s i o n of meals and call times for senior
O f f i c e r s an d so on? - A. Yes, sir.

Now, when we come to your p a r t i c u l a r role               in the po li c i n g
of the match, y o u were the S u p e r i n t e n d e n t         in Control.          Is
that r i g h t ? - A. Yes.

There was also a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t      in charge of the ground,
Hr. G r e e n w o o d ? - A. Yes, sir.

And S u p e r i n t e n d e n t s on the outside, Hr. Harshall              and Hr.
Chapman, I t h i n k ? - A. Yes, that is correct.

For the two e n d s ? - A.         Yes,    sir.

What was your r o l e ?     What w ou ld you say your role was as
d i s t i n c t from that of Hr. Greenwood, for e x a m p l e ? - A. I
wo u l d say that my role was overall control of the Control
Room and the event itself and o b v i o u s l y a d vi se r to the
Of f i c e r who was in charge, which was Hr. Duckenfield.

So you were with Hr. Duckenfield, or in tending to be with
Hr. Duckenfield, for the match itself? - A. Well, Hr.
D u c k e n f i e l d took up the role which I e x p e c t e d to take up,
which was in the Control Room.

Yes, a n d that is where you in tended to be? - A. That is
where I was for the whole - well, I intended to be for the
whole of the event.

You were, therefore, p a r t i c u l a r l y        interested,          were you
not, in c o m m u n i c a t i o n s ? - A. Yes,     indeed.

Is that one of the major              tasks that you had to u n d e r t a k e ?
- A. Yes, it was.

You had, of course, for that purpose, Se rg e a n t G o d d a r d and
some C o n s t a b l e s ? - A. S e r g e a n t G o d d a r d and two Constables.
S e r g e a n t G o d d a r d was to ca rr y out all radio operations,
both in coming an d outgoing.                 PC B i c h a r d was to opera te the
ca m e r a s an d to o pe rat e the radio link that we had with our
Force O p e r a t i o n s Room and PC Ryan was to be in charge of
the public ad dr es s sy st e m and mo nit or the t e le p h o n e s that
we had from variou s places.

Now, your task, as the Control S u pe ri nt en de nt ,                    is go in g to
be c o n s i d e r a b l y a f f e c t e d by the q u a l i t y of the
c o m m u n i c a t i o n sy st e m that you have got, is not             it? - A.
Very much so, yes, sir.

            Q.   In the 1989 preparations, you made a new                    arrangement, did
                 not you, for a C o m m u n i c a t i o n s O f fi ce r to   be a v a i l a b l e at
                 the g ro u n d ? - A. Yes, I did, sir.             Yes.

            Q.   Is that Hr. S a n d e r s o n ? - A. I did not know who it was
                 until he arrived, but I a s k e d for a C o m m u n i c a t i o n s Officer
                 to be pr e s e n t becau se we had had some p r ob l e m the pr evious
                 year.

            Q.   I was go ing to ask you about that.                   What pr ob l e m s had you
                 had the pr e v i o u s y ea r? - A. Well, the p r o b l e m s the
                 p r e v i ou s year were b r e a k t h r o u g h from some radio statio n -
                 a co mme rci al radio st ati on - music that was c o m i n g over
                 the radios.           The eq ui pm en t was c h ec k e d and we c o u l d not
                 find any fault and, on my p r e - b r i e f i n g with the Club on
                 the T h u r s d a y before the event, I c h ec ke d with th e m and
                 there were no local radio s t a t i o n s that w o u l d be o p e ra ti ng
                 and t r a n s m i t t i n g from the v i c i n i t y of the Police Control,
                 so we did not expect that, but I thought it w o u l d be very
                 h an dy to have a C o m m u n i c a t i o n s Offic er av a i l ab le if we did
                 have a problem.

            Q.   So you were not e x p e c t i n g an y p a r t i c u l a r pr o b l e m to arise.
                 It was a just in case p r o v i s i o n ? - A. That is correct,
                 yes.

            Q.   Now, I think, after this initial m e e t i n g an d these
                 a l t e r a t i o n s that you had made to the pr ev io us y e a r ’s
                 o p e r a t i o n a l order, you had further meetings, did you not,
                 at H a m m e r t o n Road on 22 n d Harch with Hr. H ol e? - A. Yes,
                 sir.

            Q.   And is this the m e e t i n g where the qu es t i o n of the
                 a l l o c a t i o n of the ends was dealt with? - A. That is
                 correct, yes.

            Q.   And this was a d e c i s i o n that was made by the Police,
                 h a v i n g h e a r d represe nt at io ns , I think, from Briti sh Rail
                 and from the Football A s s o c i a t i o n ? - A. There was someone
                 - I do not th in k they r e p r e s e n t e d the Football As so ci ati on
                 - who said that Liv er po ol were c o n c e r n e d about b e in g given
                 the lesser share of the tickets.

                           LO R D J U S T I C E TAYLOR: Well, I think we have real ly
                 c o v e r e d this ground, have not we?

                           HR. PHILLIPS:       Sir,   yes,   I am ta k i n g   it just     for
                 c o n t i n u i t y really:

            Q.   You agreed, did you, in any event, with the a l l o c a t i o n of
                 e n d s ? - A. Yes, I had a further d i s c u s s i o n with Hr. Hole
                 and we di d look at any other o p t i o n s and d e c i d e d that we
                 wo ul d have to go a h ea d with what had been agreed,

                                                                              B. D. HURRAY



     e s p e c i a l l y in respe ct of the fact that the fans had
     t r a v e l l e d to those p a r t i c u l a r ends last year and would
     p r o b a b l y do the same again, r e g a r d l e s s of where we hou se d
     the m in the stadium.

Q.   Now, you had various other meetings, I think, on 29th
     Harch a nd 5th April, and then, I think, on 10th April you
     had a m e e t i n g at H a m me rt on Road with Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t
     D u c k e n f i e l d and the the Sec to r S u p e r i n t e n d e n t s ? - A. Yes,
     sir.

Q.   And y o u also had Br it is h Tr a n s p o r t Police there at that
     time.    That is r i g h t ? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. What a r r a n g e m e n t s in p a r t i c u l a r were you c o n c e r n e d about
   at that t i m e ? - A. It was w h et he r or not we s h ou l d go
   a h e a d as p l a n n e d and it was to inform the Sector
   S u p e r i n t e n d e n t s of the new c o n t i n g e n c y ar ra n g e m e n t s that
   had been made and to find out w h et he r they had any
   p a r t i c u l a r problems.

Q. The new c o n t i n g e n c y a r r a n g e m e n t s ? - A. I am ta l k i n g about
   the su ppo rt of Off ic e rs on the track at the en d of the
   game, the increase of the fl ash poi nt at Lep pi ng s Lane, the
   fact that we were a r r a n g i n g for Off ic er s to be on standb y
   ou ts id e the g r ou nd in buses.

Q.   Yes.   Now, I think then, on 13th April,                      you went with
     In spector Sewell to the C lu b? - A. Yes,                    sir.

Q.   And had a m e e t i n g there with the Cl u b S e c r e t a r y ? - A. Yes,
     sir.

Q.   And did you look at the gr o u n d t h e n ? - A. Yes,                   I went
     c o m p l e t e l y r ou nd the gr ou n d after the meeting.

Q.   Can you r em em be r what was d i s c u s s e d at that m e e t i n g ? - A.
     There were several things.                   I a sk ed the Club if th e y were
     c o m p l e t e l y s a t i s f i e d that the ga n t r y for the TV cameras
     over the West S t a n d was safe and they were.                     We had a look
     at that a f t e r w a r d s an d it s e e m e d p e r f e c t l y safe.  We did
     d is cu s s co ach es for e x e c u t i v e s who were co mi n g to the
     match.          We d i s c u s s e d who the re f e r e e was, what the
     a r r a n g e m e n t s w ou ld be with Hr. Clough, where he wo ul d sit.
     Several things.                 General things.

Q.   Did you look p a r t i c u l a r l y at the Lep pin gs Lane end of the
     g ro u n d ? - A. Not particularly, sir.

Q. Well, you inc luded that                 in your tour of the ground,               did
   you? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were you c o n c e r n e d about the s i g n p o s t i n g at that end of
     the g ro u n d ? - A. No, sir.     I have never been c o n c e r n e d

          about signposting.         I have never n o t i c e d the signposting.
          I have just a c c e p t e d the gr o u n d as it is.

     Q.   Well, do you sa y that, if you had said a n y t h i n g about
          signposting, w ou ld that have made any difference, do you
          t h i n k ? - A. I think it may well have made.         The Club might
          have taken notes.        When I first came to Sheffield,
          Hi ll sborough, in 1988, I ha d a look r o u n d the football
          g r o u n d then an d the on l y areas of c o nc er n I had were about
          the glass in the West end of the North S t a n d and the Club
          a g r e e d to look into that and did come back to me and tell
          me that it was sha tt er -p roo f;     it co ul d not be broken.

     Q.   So you have looked       a r o u n d the g r o u n d on several oc ca si on
          then, you say, not just on this o c c a s i o n on the 10th
          A p r i l ? - A. Oh, no, sir, I have been r o u n d the gr o u n d
          before.

     Q.   And you have never at any stage taken any pa rt i c u l a r
          noti ce of the a b se nc e of signs to peop le c o m i n g through
          t u r n s t i l e s A to G? - A. It has never struck me.    It has
          never been ap pa r e n t to me, no.

     Q.   Now, I think then you went and pa rt icipated, did you not,
          in the b r i e f i n g by Hr. Duckenfield, yo urself and Inspector
          Sewell on the day before the m a t c h ? - A. Yes, sir, Friday
          14th.

     Q.   And we have your b r i e f i n g notes available,        do we no t ? - A.
          Yes, sir.

     Q.   In which I t hi nk you fo ll o w e d Hr. Duckenfield, both on the
          F r i d a y an d on the Saturday, did not you? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q.   And there is just one matt er on the b r i e f i n g notes I want
          to ask you about, Hr. Hurray.      On the se c o n d page there is
          an item he a d "T ra velling fans"? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q.         "From Liv er po ol one special train with 350 on board
                will ar ri v e at W a d s l e y Brid ge stati on at 4.02."

          Do you see t h a t ? - A.    1402,   sir.

     Q.    I am sorry, 1402, yes.  You are quite right.    Where did
          you get the figures from - the figure of 35 0 ? - A. That
          w ou ld come from our inte ll ig en ce Officers.

     Q.   Did you have that informa ti on on the Fr i d a y ? - A.          This   is
          F r i d a y ’s b r i e f i n g notes.

     Q.   Ye s ? - A. This was not included on Saturday.                 If I can
          explain, sir, my b r i e f i n g s h e e t ? These b r i e f i n g notes
          were given to the S u p e ri nt en de nt s, Chief Inspe ct or s and
          Inspec to rs on the Friday.        The b r i e f i n g took far too long

     - s o m e w h er e in the reg io n of t h r e e - q u a r t e r s of an hour.
     It was o b v i o u s that we w o ul d not be able to hold O f f i c e r s ’
     a t t e n t i o n for so long and so my b r i e f i n g notes were cut
     down c o n s i d e r a b l y and, on the originals, where there is a
     line through, it was o m i t t e d from the S a t u r d a y briefing.

Q.   I see.   So re al l y then you just c o v e r e d some of the points
     on the S a t u r d a y b r i e f i n g ? - A. Yes.

Q.   We see at the end of those notes there is a ha n d w r i t te n
     se r i e s of items, st a r t i n g with "I n f l a t a b l e s " and g oi ng on
     to v a ri ou s other th i n g s ? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were those part of the S a t u r d a y b r i e f i n g ? - A. Again the
     ones that are not c r o s s e d out were on the S a t u r d a y
     briefing.     The ones that are c r o s s e d out were p u r e l y on
     the Fr id a y briefing.

Q.   So you a s s u m e d then on the F r i d a y - and I see that is
     c r o s s e d out for the S a t u r d a y - but you had a s s u m e d on the
     F r i d a y that you w o ul d be g e t t i n g 350 people on a tra in ? -
     A.      One speci al train.

Q.   One special train, yes.  Now, on the day itself you, of
     course, were in charge of the Control Room.  You d e c i d e d
     to create a log, did you not? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   Was there, in fact, a log b e i n g kept at the Force Control
     H e a d q u a r t e r s ? - A. If I can e x p l a i n the situation, what
     h a p p e n e d with the log is Hr. D u c k e n f i e l d said that he
     w o u l d like a log kept of the events.                  One had never been
     kept before.              I spoke to the S e r g e a n t s who n o r m a l l y did
     duti es in the Control Room r e g a r d i n g a log writer and it
     was d e c i d e d that we co ul d not p o s s i b l y a f f o r d an o t h e r body
     in that small Control Room, so I said well, r e g a r d l e s s of
     that, I w o u l d like to try          and ke e p a h a n d w r i t t e n log,
     which w o u l d be useful, and what I did was o p e n e d a
     co mp u t e r log on the 11th April - that is on our Force
     Co m m a n d and Control system.          I o p e n e d an incident for any
     inf or ma ti on or any e nt ry in r e l a t i o n to the s em i- fi na l to
     be put on that co mp ut er log.

Q.   Is that at Sriig Hi ll ? - A. No, sir.                   Well, that fa cility
     is a v a i l a b l e ! t o ev er y Poli ce S t a t i o n in the Force and it

Q.   Fr o m H a m m e r t o n   Ro ad ? - A.   Fr o m Ha m m e r t o n Road.

Q.   And you also wa n t e d to keep a se pa r a t e log in the Control
     Room itself? - A. Well, I w a n t e d to try and keep a
     h a n d w r i t t e n log as well - a log from the Control Room,
     yes.

Q.   And we have both those,               do we,     in this bundle - I hope          it

is befo re you - of c o mm un ic at ion s,   one a p p e a r i n g to have
been t y p e d ? - A. Yes.

By computer, which runs up to page 15, and then there is a
su b s e q u e n t log which has been typed, but was o b v i o u s l y
h a n d w r i t t e n at some earlier s t a g e ? - A. Yes, sir.

The s e c o n d one is your handwritten, ha n d kept log, is it?
- A. Yes, up to 10.18 it was w r it te n by Se rg ea nt G o dd ar d
or PC Ryan.       Fr o m 10.40 it is my hand.

Yes,   I see.   So you kept     it from then o n w a r d s ? - A.   Yes,
sir.

Was there any p a r t i c u l a r re as o n for th at ? - A. H a i n l y it
is to act as a m e m o r y jogger.         When I was t r yi n g to recall
the p r o b l e m s that we had in the last semi-final, I found
it d i f f i c u l t after the event to recall e v e r y t h i n g that had
o c c u r r e d an d e ve ry area that c a u s e d us conce rn or a
problem, so I tri ed to keep a h a n dw ri tt en log.

And we notice,     of course,    that   it stops at     1421? - A.     Yes,
sir.

That was when it was no longer p o s s i b l e to ke ep it going,
was it? - A. I w o u l d think that at some time after that we
were too bu s y to pay much a t t e n t i o n to the log.

Yes.       Well now, I think you were c o n c e r n e d with the
br i e f i n g s there and with the issue of radios.        Is that
right?         - A. Yes.

Q. Did you there was room in the centre two pens, 3 and 4, for
   the crowds you saw outside the turnstiles? - A. I did not
   consider whether there was room in any particular pen.  I was
   looking at the terrace as a whole and the North Stand and the
   West Stand.

Q. If those people had gone to the wings, that is to say to the
   south and north end of the terraces, there would have been
   sufficient room for them? - A. Yes.

Q. Is th«t what you say? - A. Yes.

Q. Now, what did you think at this time about the prospect of
   getting those people into the ground before kick-off? - A. At
   2.30 I was almost sure we would get them in for 3 o'clock.

Q. Why did you think that? - A. Because   looking at the area and
   looking at the crowd and knowing the   turnstiles can turn
   quickly, I just thought we would get them in.

Q. But did you see the back of the turnstiles where the people
   come out into the yard? Did you see how they were operating?
   - A. I can't remember whether I saw them at that stage.   I did
   pay particular notice of them later.

Q   Because if one looks at the video in fact one sees there are
    in fact sometimes considerable gaps between one person and the
    next one coming out of the turnstile?   They were not, in
    other words, operating totally efficiently, were they? - A. I
    didn't notice that at 2.30.  I did notice it later.

Q. You did? - A. Yes, I did.

Q   At what stage did you notice that? - A. I would think just
    before quarter-to-3 I became concerned about the turnstiles.

Q. You were concerned about turnstiles then? - A. I was concerned
   that people were not coming through the turnstiles.

Q. Did you take any steps at that stage then to find out why? -
   A. I tried to get in touch with the club, the safety and
   security officer.

Q. Was that Mr. Lock? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you have any success? - A. I d i d n ’t.   I tried by radio.

Q. Had you a prearranged system of getting into contact with Mr.
   Lock? - A. Just by the radio, sir.

Q. Does he have a radio on your frequency? - A. No.       We have a
   radio on the stewards' and the c l u b ’s frequency.

Q. And you couldn't raise him? - A. No, sir.

                                                 B.D. MURRAY


Q. What else could you do, having failed to raise Mr. Lock? - A.
   With regard to the club?

Q. With regard to the turnstiles which you were concerned about?
   - A. Yes.  I could not raise Mr. Lock.I was then overtaken
   by what I consider were more serious even ts, that is requests
   for the gates to be opened in Leppings Lane.

Q. That of course was all related to the flow through the
   turnstile, was not it? - A. yes, sir.  I would think so.

Q. Can we, as it were, go back to the chronology we were on
   before.  Did you a conversation with Chief Superintendent
   Duckenfield about the crowd and getting them in? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. Did you have a conversation about the delay of kick off at
    this time? - A. Yes, sir.
   l
Q. How did that arise? - A. I think Mr. Duckenfield asked me to
    remind him what we had discussed about delaying kick-off, and
    I said that normally we would not delay kick-off if people
    were just late, but if there was something that kept them from
    getting into the ground or getting to the ground, i.e.
    accidents or physical problems over the Pennines, etc., then
    obviously we have to delay the kick-off.

Q. I am sorry, did you agree with that principle that you should
   delay it only in those circumstances? - A. I think the option
   is always open that that was the general rule.  That was our
   sort of agreement and our perception, and I think that is a
   fairly common one.

Q. This was a discussion you had with Mr. Duckenfield about the
   reasons why you may or may not delay kick-off? First, what I
   am interested in is what time did this discussion take place,
   to your best recollection? - A. It would be about 2.30.

Q. Can you think of any event or anything that   was occurring
   outside that gave rise to this discussion?    Why should you be
   thinking about it at that time? - A. It was   about the time
   that I suggested there were a lot of people   out there and we
   would get them in.

Q. If you were sure you would get them in, questions of delaying
   kick-off would not really arise, would they? - A. You would
   think not, sir, no.

Q. If you had thought they would not get in that is when you
   might think about delaying kick-off, is not it? - A. Yes.

Q. Was there a time you thought that when you were having this
   discussion? - A. Not at that time, no, sir.

Q. Did you the question of delaying kick-off, was it raised again
   before 3 o'clock? - A. No, sir.

                                                  B.D. MURRAY


Q. Did you think it was appropriate at any stage before 3 o'clock
   to consider it again? - A. i would think that it probably was.
   There was obviously just before the players came out it was
   obvious the people were not going to get in through the
   turnstiles by 3 o'clock.

Q. That would be about 5-to-3, would not it? - A. 5-to-, 10-to-3,
   yes.

Q. Did you mention it? - A. No, sir.

Q. You did, however, think it might be appropriate? - A. I did
   not think it would appropriate, otherwise I would have
   mentioned it.  Again it was a thought that didn't come into my
   head.  Things were happening then that were demanding my
   attention.

Q. I think you had various bits of information coming into
   your control room, had not you, from this point onwards, from
   half-past-2 to 3 o'clock? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   Not just of the ground and Leppings Lane but all around,   too?
     - A. There were many things happening.

Q.   I think you had some trouble with aticket tout, had not you?
     - A. Yes, sir.I can't remember the timing,     but certainly
     there was a ticket tout selling tickets outside the Leppings
     Lane end for the Kop, and our little contingency on the Kop
     was already full.   The tout was in fact arrested.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Selling tickets outside the
     Leppings Lane end? - A. Selling tickets to Liverpool
     supporters for the Kop end of the ground, yes, my Lord.

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:    So I think he was arrested, was he? - A.
     He was arrested.

Q. This was a report you had received by radio, is it? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. So the radio was working then at this stage? - A. Yes, it was.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  As a matter of interest, he was
     arrested for what? - A. He was arrested, I would think, for
     causing obstruction, my Lord.

Q. Obstructing Officers in the course of their duty or what? - A.
   By the course of his actions he would have been causing an
   obstruction in the highway.  People would have been gathering
   round him and he would be causing an obstruction.

Q.   Ifhe had been selling them for the Leppings Lane end would it
     have been any different? -A. I doubt it, my Lord, if he had
     been causing an obstruction, no matter where he was selling
     them.

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   You were keeping I think a good watch on

             the turnstile cameras during this period as well as taking
             these messages, were not you? - A. The turnstile cameras, sir?

        Q. The cameras aimed at the turnstiles and the gates? - A. I was
           trying to.  It is difficult.

        Q. Did you get a request from the mounted Inspector,   Inspector
           Hand-Davis? - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. You give in your statement a time of 14.40, 20-to-3? - A. I
           would think it would be about that time.

        Q. Yes. - A. He asked for the assistance of other mounted
           Officers.

        Q . lAnd did you do something about that? - A. Sergeant Goddard,
             who was the radio operator, picked it up straight away and
             asked Sergeant Sorsby who was in charge of the mounted
             Officers at the other end of the ground to let him have what
             he c o u l d .

        Q. Did the mounted Inspector give you any reason for his
           request or any appraisal of his problems? - A. No, sir, he
           just said he wanted additional mounted Officers to Leppings
           Lane.

        Q. Again, when you got that request did you look at the cameras
           at what was going off? - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. What did you see? - A. I saw that the crowd was now becoming a
           lot denser than it had appeared in the past, and the mounted
           Officers appeared to be getting jostled.  They did not seem to
           be working as a group.  They appeared to have been split up
           and getting surrounded with people.

        Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Your view of it was that the
             crowd was denser at 2.40 than it had been? - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. I think you probably heard Mr. Marshall say that in fact it
           had been reduced, and although it was of a different mood it
           had been reduced by then? - A. My impression was that the
           crowd was larger and denser, more tightly packed.   We had
           been looking on the video from a distance, an overview, and I
           think it was once Mr. Hand-Davis asked for assistance that we
           got a close-up, which tended to show the mounted Officers
           being surrounded.  We sent mounted Officers, and I also
           dispatched the only spare serial we had, which was the
           reserve serial in the gym.

        Q. If I can just follow this through a little ahead.  Was it then
           your view that the crowd was increasing outside in numbers
           right up until the gate was opened and let a lot of them in? -
           A . Y e s , my L o r d .

        Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:    Where did these mounted Officers go
             from? - A. They would have to come from the Penistone Road
             side of the ground.

                                                  B.D. MURRAY



Q.    What was the situation like there? Was it safe for them to
     leave that part of the ground? - A. From what I can recall it
     would be up to Sergeant Sorsby to allow what Officers he felt
     fit as he was in charged of the mounted detail at that
     location.

Q. And would they go down the south road, as it were, alongside
   the river to get to Leppings Lane? - A. I don't know whether
   they went through the South Stand or through one of the side
   r oa d s .

Q. You say you deployed one of your reserve serials? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q.   This was at the same time, 20-to-3? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   They had been in the gymnasium, had they? - A. Yes, they   had.

Q. Where did you send them to? - A. I sent them to the Leppings
   Lane end.

Q. Did you give any particular instructions where they were to go
   at that end? - A. No, they had an Inspector with them.  I sent
   them down there obviously to do what they could.

Q. Which Inspector is that? - A. Inspector Delaney.

Q. Were they to go outside or were they to stay on the inside of
   the turnstile? - A. Those instructions were not given.  I just
   sent them down there to support the Officers down there and
   see what they could do, sir.

Q. And did you then get a message to use the Tannoy system? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q.jWas that put into effect? - A. Yes.  P.C. Ryan was asked to
   Tannoy out on to Leppings Lane to tell people to stop pushing.

Q    Did he do that? - A. P.C. Ryan?

Q    Yes? - A. Yes, he did.

Q    You heard him on the machine talking into it? -A. Yes, I
     heard him talking into it, and I told him tokeep saying  it.

Q    So at this stage you have a request already for Leppings lane
     to be closed.  That was some 20 minutes earlier? - A. Yes.

Q. You have had requests for further mounted Officers, and you
   have responded and sent also a reserve serial of men? - A.
   Yes.

Q. And a request for Tannoy messages to the crowd? - A. Yes.

Q. And you had also been watching the video yourself? - A. yes,
   sir.

     Q. Were you getting then concerned about the state of affairs
        outside the gates? - A. At that time, yes.

     Q. What were you thinking you were going to be doing about it,
        apart from sending these extra Officers? - A. Well, I was
        hoping at that time that they could make the best of the
        situation and recover things.

     Q. That these extra Officers would be sufficient, you mean? - A.
        They were the only reserve I had at that time, sir.

     Q. Did you consider any other options that you had to deal with
        this particular problem? - A. I didn't - without taking
        Officers away from other locations who were on specific
        duties, I had no other reserves to deploy.

                                     B.D. MURRAY


Q. I understand that but what I am asking you is whether you
   considered that you had any other options apart from those
   that you in fact put into effect? - A. I did not consider
   taking any independent action in dragging Officers away
   from other areas.  If I had a request for them then I would
   have obviously had to look very closely where I could
   deplete other areas to provide Officers.   I had no Officers
   at immediate disposal that I could deploy.

Q. You started to get difficulty with communications, didn't
   you, about this time? - A. Yes, we did.

Q. Can you recall as exactly as you can when it was that the
   radio started to malfunction? - A. Only from records.  I
   think it was about 2.42.

Q. What record are you referring to? - A. I have seen a record
   sir where there was a message sent to the Operations Room
   and where P.C. Bichard refers in the radio message that
   the radio is down and there is an engineer working on it.

Q. I don't think we have got that.  The engineer in fact
   came out straightaway, didn't he? - A. Yes sir, what
   happened was at about that time Sergeant Goddard was sending
   a message out to one of the Inspectors and the reply came
   in that was very distorted and broken.  As you would expect
   he said:  "I can't read the message can you repeat" and then
   we got information from another Unit that our radio was at
   fault, it was us that was breaking up and they were having
   difficulty in hearing us.  I asked P.C. Ryan to get in touch
   with the gymnasium or the Police Room and get the Communications
   Officer to attend straightaway, but within a few seconds he
   appeared at the Control Room and he said he had been monitoring
   our messages.  There was obviously a problem with the breaking
   up and he had come to see if he could deal with it.

Q. Well now he tried various things, I think.  Were communi­
   cations in fact restored? - A. They were restored sir.

Q. After how long to your recollection? - A. I don't know.  I
   think it may have been only a minute or it might have been
   shorter it might have been longer.  It was a period of
   disruption because the radios are underneath the bench
   and it meant everybody moving out of their positions and
   moving round the Control Room.

Q. Now the radio which was out of action for this short period,
   this was the one that you were using to communicate between
   the Officers on the ground and your particular Control Room?
   - A.Yes sir.

Q. You had other communications with Hammerton Road, for
   example? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Did you have other channels available on the hand-held sets?
   - A. We had the Force Operations Room but we had no
   channels that we could work to the ground service.

                                           B.D. MURRAY


Q. So in fact you got a message did you through the Force
   Control Room which had been sent by Superintendent Marshall
   on a radio to them? - A. I think Mr. Marshall was calling
   for a further Tannoy message, a further P.A. message and
   also the Land Rover which is fitted with P.A. to be sent
   round to Leppings Lane.  We could hear his message and
   he could not receive what we were sending out to him, that
   was obvious, and Mr. Duckenfield also said:  "See if we
   can get a traffic car as well to assist him" and P.C. Bichard
   then got on the radio to the Force Operations Room and asked
   for a traffic car and it was then that he informed him we
   were having trouble with the radio.

Q. So you could hear from Superintendent Marshall that he wanted
   these Tannoys to be sent out and you complied with that
   request? - A. Yes sir.

Q. You also got I think the Land Rover to come along with
   Constable Buxton in it? - A. We did not get hold of the
   Land Rover from the Control Room.  P.C. Buxton heard the
   message which all units could hear and attended of his own
   accord.

Q.\ Now can you come to about quarter-to-3. low was the crowd
    getting to be outside the ground? - A. About that time it
    was getting difficult.  Again it seemed to be compacting.
    Whether it was the zoom lens that gave me that impression
    I do not know.  It seemed to be a lot tighter crowd than
    it had been before.

Q.JDid you look at what was going on in the terraces? - A. I
   don't think so sir.

Q.   At this stage? - A. Not        consciously.

Q.   Do you remember looking    at those terraces at any stage
     between say 20-to-3 and 3 o'clock? - A. I am sure that
     from time to time I would be looking all round the ground.

Q. Did anything register with you as to the quantity of people
   in Pens 3 and 4? - A. I could see that there were a lot of
   people in Pens 3 and 4, as there were in other areas of the
   ground.  There was nothing unusual.

Q. "Nothing unusual"? - A. Nothing unusual to me at all.

Q. Did you during the course of this period check the turnstile
   figures with the Ground Control Room? - A. No sir.

Q. That was a facility that was available to you, wasn't it?
   - a . That was a facility that was available and could be
   used.

Q. You would be the one I think, wouldn't you, of the Senior
   Police Officers who would be concerned with that aspect
   of it? - A. I think I would be in the best position to
   ask for those figures, yes sir.
                                   B.D. MURRAY


What, if you had asked, could you have found out from the
Control Room of the ground about this part of the ground,
about this end of the ground? - A. They could have told me
exactly how many people had come through each set of turn­
stiles leading to the different parts of the ground and the
overall total figure.

Could they have done that immediately if you had got in
contact with the Control Room? - A. At very short notice
I think sir, yes.

Was there any system for you to be informed without asking?
- A. There was an Officer down in the Control Room who
permanently works there and is in touch with the Control
Room by radio who could have notified me of any concern
that he felt himself.

Did you receive any information without asking for it? -
A. No, I didn't sir.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Can you help on this:  you
were asked what sort of information you could have got and
you said you could have learnt how many had come through
each set of turnstiles? - A. Yes, my Lord.

A point arose this morning and I just wonder if you can
follow it through.  Does that mean you would be able to say
from 1-10 which was for the North Stand, how many had gone
through that set, or how is it split? - A.I would have to
ask the Club.  I think the figures would come up probably
between Turnstiles 1-8; 9-16 and A-G.  Normally I would
ask for the total number of visiting fans.   That is a
facility I have used it for in the past.   I don't know
whether it would be an immediate reply if I asked for say
the number in the West Stand, the North Stand or the
Leppings Lane terraces.

We might have to look at this later with the Club, I think,
but as we were referred this morning to figures which
suggested that a great many more had gone through the West
Stand turnstiles than should have done, but I wonder whether
that is a fair division because people going through those
turnstiles, that is 'C' isn't it? - A. I do know, my Lord,
that Turnstiles 1-10 were used for the North Stand and
9 and 10 would be included in the West Stand total, so they
should be subtracted from the West Stand total and added
to the North Stand, my Lord.

That is what I was wondering, so there may have been a couple
of turnstiles feeding into that figure that we were given
of 5,619 which in fact were being used for the North
Stand? - A. That is correct.

So we may not have got more in than we should have done?
- A . NO.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We will look at it later.

             MR. PHILLIPS:  Was there any particular reason why
       you did not ask for these figures at any stage? - A. There
       was not a reason except I went by what I could see, my
       own visual perception.  I don't often ask for the figures.
       It was not something I do on every match or every occasion
       and it did not occur to me.

        Of course what you would see would be open spaces effectively
        in the south-west and north-west corners? - A. What I would
        see?

     Q. Yes? - A. Yes sir.

     Q. You then I think saw or heard a message asking for the gates
        to be opened? - A. Yes I did, sir.

     Q. That was from Superintendent Marshall? - A. Yes sir, it was.

     Q. You recall that message, do you? - A. Yes, I do.

     Q. Do you recall him saying that people would be crushed? - A.
        Not initially.   I recall a message from Superintendent
        Marshall saying:   "We have got to open the gates at
        Leppings Lane."

     Q. He was at pains to stress that his request was for the
        gates in the plural to be opened? - A. Yes it was, sir.

     Q. That is right? - A. Yes, indeed.

     Q. Did you yourself look at the situation at the turnstiles
        when that request came over? - A. I think I had looked at
        the situation before the request came over and I had seen
        that people did not appear to be coming through the turn­
        stiles at anything like the rate that they should have been.

     Q. Did you have any other requests at that time when the
        request came from Superintendent Marshall? - A. It was
        about that time, immediately before, shortly before, I
        cannot say from Inspector Bennett who asked for assistance
        down at Leppings Lane.

     Q. Where was Inspector Bennett? - A. Inspector Bennett I think
        he was one of the Logistics Officers and he should have
        been in the gymnasium, he had gone down to check the
        Property Store at Leppings Lane.  I think he was on top
        of the turnstiles.  That is from my knowledge.

     Q. So he asked for assistance as well? - A. He asked for
        assistance at Leppings Lane.

     Q. What did you do in response to that? - A. Well before I
        could do anything Inspector Sewell came on the air and
        told me that he had, no P.C. Ryan told me, I think
        Inspector Sewell was on the 'phone to him about another

               matter, told us that he had some spare Serials in the gym­
               nasium, I don't know whether he said eight or ten, but they
               were 'D' Division Serials.

          Q. These are the ones that have been in the City Centre bringing
             the fans from the Midland Station? - A. These are the ones
             that bring the fans from the Midland Station. If they arrive
             after quarter-to-3 they go and stand by in the gym.  He had
             eight or ten Serials and I asked for five Sergeants and
             50 men.  These were eight man Serials so Inspector Sewell
             despatched six Serials, which would be six Sergeants and 48
             men sir.

          Q. To where? - A. To the Leppings Lane end.

          Q.^|Again to the inside or the outside of the turnstiles? - A.
             To Inspector Bennett.   That is where I was sending them.

          Q. Were these men despatched before the instruction was given
             to open the gate? - A. Before the instruction was given,
            Vyes, but I don't know whether they were despatched before
             or after the first request came.

          Q. How many requests were there then to open the gate, to your
             recollection? - A. I would think there were three or may be
             four.

          Q. All from Superintendent Marshall? - A. Two in quick succession,
             fairly quick succession with a break.  Shortly after the
             second request FvC. Bichard who is the Video Operator said
             something to the effect of "The gate has gone" or "The gate
             has burst" and as I looked up at the video screen I could
             see that people were coming through ’C' gate.   Then the
             situation was recovered and the gate was closed.   After
             that there were two more requests from Mr. Marshall.

          Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Those Officers that have been
               despatched from the gymnasium, how would they have gone to
               Leppings Lane end, from the inside or round the outside?
               - a . From the inside, my Lord.

          Q.    So when they got there they would have remained on the   inside
               of the turnstiles? - A. Yes, they would.

          Q.         MR. PHILLIPS:  Would they in fact have been in that
               area between the fence and the outer wall that leads to
               the North Stand.  The gymnasium is at the back of the North
               Stand, isn't it? - A. That is the area they would approach.
               They would approach along the North Stand concourse and
               they would come out this side.

          Q* On this side of the fence? - A. Yes.

          Q. Some witnesses speak of there being a line of Officers in
             that area on the approach to the North Stand when Gate A
             was opened.  This would be some of the men who had come
             from the gymnasium? - A. It is possible.  I don't know sir.
                                  B.D. MURRAY


Were they able to get across that fence into the rest of
the concourse? - A. There is a way through, I think Mr.
Marshall described this morning.

Through that gate there? - A. Through that gate there.

Was any specific instruction given to these men as to what
they should do when they get there? - A. No sir.

Was any instruction given to anybody by you or by anybody
in your presence to any of the Officers in the concourse?
- A. No sir.

I am thinking particularly about closing off the tunnel.
Do you follow? - A. Yes sir.

Was any attempt made to pass such instructions on to the
Stewards? - A. No, not that I know of.  Certainly not from
the Police Control Room.

The instruction of course was given to open the gates, wasn't
it? - A. Yes sir, it was.

Was it in that form:  "Open the gates" in the plural? -
A. Definitely.  Sergeant Goddard, I think he said:
"Officers at Leppings Lane open the gates.  Open the gates."

Do you know of any instruction that was given to concentrate
on Gate C to open that one first? - A. No sir, there was no
instruction.  I think the camera probably fixed on that
gate because you cannot see the other ones from the camera
position.

You can't really see Gate B at all, can you? - A. No sir.

And Gate A of course we know also was subsequently opened?
- a . Yes, but it obviously was not open at that time.

Can you describe to us how that came to be opened? - A.
There was a call from, I recognised it as Sergeant Higgins
from his voice, who was the spare Serial that we deployed
at 20-to-3.  I can't remember whether he said he wanted
Gate A or the gate to the North Stand opening and within
seconds he followed it up with:  "If you don't open it
it is going to go and someone will be killed."

When he made that request had Gate 'C' already been opened?
- A. Yes, Gate C was open.

Opened I mean for the second time? - A. Yes sir, because
I was a bit surprised that Gate A was still closed.
Mr. Duckenfield immediately said:  "Open Gate A."

Of course the previous instruction had already gone through,
had it not, to open all the gates? - A. To open the gates.

                                            B.D. MURRAY


    Q. And at that time the radio was on talk-through, was it not?
    - A. Yes, it was sir.

    Q. So all the Officers could hear what was said? - A. The radio
       was on talk-through for the whole of the day from start to
       finish.

    Q. So an Officer behind Gate A could have heard the earlier
       instruction to open Gate A? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. You then concentrated I think on looking at what was happening
       in the ground from that point onwards.  Is that right? -
       A. Yes sir.

    Q. What did you see in the West Stand and terraces? - A. Well
       just before the kick-off, I think it was just before the
       kick-off, again I am guessing at the time, I saw something
       happening behind the goal.  One of the P.C.s was opening
       the gate and was obviously helping someone out.

    Q. That was just before the kick-off? - A. I think it was just
       before the kick-off.

    Q. What would that put it, 2-minutes-to-3? - A. About 2-minutes
       to l-minute-to-3. I cannot recall the game starting and
       I can't recall anything about players being on the field.

    Q. Can you help us with this: when the gates were opened
       did you see an influx of spectators into Pens 3 and 4?
       - A. No sir.

    Q. Were you looking towards Pens 3 and 4 after the gates were
       opened? - A. When I saw the gates opened I was obviously
       looking in that direction.

    Q. But it would take half-a-minute or so I suppose for people
       to walk from those gates through the tunnel to Pens 3 and 4?
       - A. I never saw any particular movement or anything that
       gave me any concern at all.

    Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Where did you think they were
          all going these people? - A. Well, my Lord, my first
          impression was that we should open the gates and we should
          open the gates to prevent people being crushed and suffering
          outside and once the gates were open into the concourse
          where they would disperse throughout the ground.  I never
          saw them going in any particular direction.  I never considered
          where they were all going to go.

    Q.           MR. PHILLIPS:   The obvious place for them to go was
         fdown the tunnel, wasn't it? - A. It is now that I know.
           I know the ground.   I know where the tunnel is.  I know
          where C gate is.    I had never drawn any sort of realisation
           that people coming through C gate would go towards the tunnel
          or whatever, I have never envisaged C gate as an entry gate
          of course, but the two things just did not register, did
           not tie up.   It seemed so obvi&oguafter the event but
          certainly I gave it no thought and no realisation before.

Q.   B e h i n d the goal at the West S t a n d end, yes.              What do you
     s a y y ou s a w ? - A. I saw the P o l i c e m a n at the gate open the

     aimlessly.

Q.   But did the P o l i c e m a n who h ad o p e n e d the gate s e n d them

     I c a n n o t recall, sir.     I w o u l d t hi nk it must be 3, but
     t hat w o u l d o n l y be guessing.

Q.   Was the gate then c l o s e d         or d i d it s t a y o p e n ? - A. As far
     as I recall, it s t a y e d open, but a ga in I c a nn o t recall.
     My a t t e n t i o n was then d i v e r t e d d ow n to the P o l i c e w o m a n and
     I was imp at ie nt that she s h o u l d take t hese p e op l e off the

     Well, I k no w that PC S mi th was on Gate 3, but I d id not

As far as      I can recall,        sir.

Were t h er e any o t he r p e op l e by n ow g e t t i n g out on to the

D id a n y P o l i c e m a n do a n y t h i n g a bo ut t h e m ? - A. The
P o l i c e m a n that was there - t h e re were o nl y a c o up l e
i n i t i al ly on the track.           I h av e seen s i mi l a r s i t u a t i o n s
where, if you t ry a n d h e l p s o m e o n e a nd you open the gate,
p e o p l e will t en d to jump out a nd come out a n d s t a n d about
a nd w a tc h the game, a nd this is what a p p e a r e d to be
h a p p e n i n g to me.     T h e y were not g o i n g anywhere.          T he y
c e r t a i n l y were not g o i n g to sort of run on the f ie ld and
s t o p the play, but t hey were s t a n d i n g a r o u n d w a t c h i n g the

As far as I know, he was.

And was this still b ef or e k i c k - o f f ? - A. Oh, no.        I c an no t
recall the kick-off.            It must have been t a k i n g p lace
f ai rl y quickly.      My i mp re s s i o n was t ha t the game s t op p e d

it h a d o n l y been p l a y i n g for a minute.       I h ad no idea
t here h a d been five m i n u t e s ’ play.

All right.        D id you look at the pens 3 a nd 4 when you saw
t hese p e o p l e c o m i n g out? - A. Yes, I did.

D id you see the s t at e of t h e m ? - A. T h er e was n o t h i n g

Did t he y    not s e e m to you to be o v e r c r o w d e d ? - A.      They    did
not s e e m   to be overc ro wd ed , sir.

When was the first time, if at all, y ou b e c a m e c o n c e r n e d
a bo ut the p eo pl e in pens 3 a n d 4? - A. When I got down to
the pitch.

And when was t h a t ? - A.         Well,    I init ia ll y went d ow n to try
and s t o p the game.

Yes, but S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d beat you to it, d i d not
he? - A. He did, indeed.                 As soon as I saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t
G r e e n w o o d s t o p the game, I w en t b ac k up to the Cont ro l

to go d own a n d c lear the p e op l e off the p it ch a n d move
t he m t o w a r d s the wings.        I went down, went on to the
pitch, looked for some O f f i c e r s who I c o u l d use for this
task a n d then, as I was l oo ki ng around, I c o u l d see that
p e o p l e were dazed, p eo pl e were injured, p e o p l e were
s i t t i n g around, o b v i o u s l y in some sort of d istress.        As I
a p p r o a c h e d the goals, I c o u l d see t ha t t here were lots of
P o li ce O f f i c e r s by then a r o u n d the gates.    I c o u l d not see

a g a i n s t the fence.

Well, when y ou h a d been up in the C on tr ol Room, both
b e f o r e y ou went down to t ry to s t o p the game a n d when you
r e t u r n e d for a b rief time, h a d y ou at that point, or
e i t h e r of t hose points, look ed over to pens 3 a n d 4? - A.
I h a d not n o t i c e d anything, sir.         I went down.     My
i n t e nt io n was to s to p the game, to c at ch the l i n e s m a n ’s

you w o u l d not see heads so much as a flatter a r e a ? - A. I
c o u l d not see the pens from w he re I was on the pitch.

No,    no,   but when you are           in the C on t ro l     B o x ? - A.    No,   sir.

lo ok in g on to the pens from the C on tr ol Box, it is very,
v er y d i f f i c u l t to see a c r o s s the front b e c a u s e of the

Q.   All the O f f i c e r s on the p e r i m e t e r t rack were i ssued with

                                                                B.D. MURRAY


             Q. Again, I am not trying to trap you, Mr. Murray, but I want to
                get this right.  I d o n ’t want to get an answer from you that
                you then resile from later.     Each of the Police bodies that I
                have set out you agree have an individual responsibility to
                monitor the numbers going into any particular section of the
                ground for overcrowding? - A. Yes, sir, by their visual
                awareness.

             Q. And I think you also said in fairness to yourself, you also
                say that the stewards have the same responsibility? - A. Yes,
                I think so, sir.

             Q. Can I now come to the position as you saw it at 2.17.  Again,
                please understand I am not trying to trick you with specific
                numbers, because the numbers may well be inaccurate, but if it
                is right that at 2.17 the North Stand and the terraces were
                about a quarter full, that would actually leave round about
                18.000 people still to come into the ground? - A. Yes, sir.

             Q. Now, again, the figure may not be totally accurate because
                your estimation of a quarter may not be totally accurate.  It
                may be a little less than 18,000. - A. I think I estimated at
                half-past-2 there was a half.

             Q. Yes, I know, but for the moment let us deal with 2.15.   Now,
                with something like 18,000 people still to enter the ground
                you receive a message some 2 minutes later from Mr. Marshall
                asking for Leppings Lane to be closed because of the situation
                in the Lane itself? - A. That is correct, yes.

             Q. There could not at that stage have been more than say 6,000 to
                8.000 as estimated by Mr. Marshall in the Lane itself? - A.
                Yes, that is correct.

             Q. I d o n ’t suppose for one moment you have thought about it in
                this way, but now one can examine the actual figures, if there
                were something like 6,000 to 8,000 people in Leppings Lane
                including the concourse and the turnstile area, and in
                addition to that there was another 10,000 still to come behind
                them, there was potentially a very dangerous situation
                building up.     Is not that right? - A. If your figures are
                right, yes, sir.

             Q. You see, I am only giving figures which I hope are
                mathematically accurate based on your own observations.

                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR;     And Mr. Marshall’s.

                     MR. HYTNER:   And Mr. Marshall’s, of   course:

             Q. Again, there may have been few than 6,000 to 8,000. There may
                have only been 4,000 to 5,000, but the position is that
                however many there were in Leppings Lane there was the balance
                of the 18,000 still to come? - A. If that 18,000 is correct,
                sir.

             Q. Or it may be 15,000 or 16,000.    You follow?    It is a lot of

             people even if the figure is not exactly accurate.  Looking
             back on it, bearing in mind that the request from Mr. Marshall
             was a very unusual one, it would have been much better, would
             not it, indeed it would have been crucial, for either Mr.
             Marshall to have asked for you to have volunteered the state
             of play within the ground itself, because he would not know
             how many people were already in the ground? - A. Yes, that is
             correct, sir.

        Q.   And that was not done by either of you? - A. No, sir.

        Q.   It was necessary in order for him to make his own appraisal of
             the situation in a policing sense, to know how many people
             were already in the Leppings Lane and North Stand end? - A. It
             would have been useful to him, yes, sir.

        Q. It was clearly necessary in policing terms for Mr. Marshall to
           respond to a situation which was apparently unique, that is,
           people coming in at such a rate at 2.17 or 2.20 or even 2.25,
           as to cause the closure of Leppings Lane.  That is correct, is
           not it? - A. Yes, sir.

        Q.   There was nothing in the plan devised by yourself and Mr.
             Mole, and which had been taken over from the previous year, to
             deal with that unprecedented situation, was there? - A. No,
             sir.

        Q. And although I am sorry to have to ask you this, because you
           may feel it unpleasant to be put in a position of criticising
           a fellow Officer, plainly if there was nothing in the plan to
           envisage this situation and it had now arisen, something ought
           to have been done by Mr. Marshall other than simply leave
           Officers to deal with the situation on the ground on the basis
           of the orders they had been given or the briefing they had
           been given prior to the game at all?   Do you follow? - A. I
           understand Mr. Marshall to say he could have dealt with a
           crowd that was co-operative, but unfortunately he was faced
           with a crowd that was unco-operative.

        Q.   No, we have not come to that yet.  Let me start again.  The
             plan that had been taken over from the previous year did not
             envisage this situation arising? - A. That is correct.

        Q. We are dealing now with 2.17.  The situation had arisen.  In
           responding to a novel situation which the men under him had
           not been briefed about, it was necessary for Mr. Marshall to
           respond by giving specific instructions in order to contain
           the new situation? - A. Yes.

        Q.   You see at this stage, Mr. Murray, Mr. Marshall accepts that
             the crowd were good humoured and well behaved.  The essential
             thing to be done was to prevent crowd pressure building up in
             the area of the perimeter gates and the turnstiles.   Is that
             right? - A. I d o n ’t know, sir.

        Q. Well, just think.   The greatest danger of crushing, a crowd,
           is if there is forward movement which comes up against an

          immovable object? - A. Yes, sir.

       Q. Like a wall or a fence.   - A. Yes.

       Q. The two potentials for crushing were the perimeter gates, the
          perimeter fence, and the wall by the turnstiles? - A. Yes,
          sir.

       Q. Therefore in policing terms once the situation had arisen at
          2.17 where these hordes were coming down Leppings Lane, the
          important thing in policing terms was to prevent a build up of
          crowd pressure either close to the perimeter fence or close to
          the turnstiles? - A. I understand that is what Mr. Marshall
          was trying to do.

       Q. That is what should have been done. - A. I understand that is
          what he was trying to do.

       Q. The way in which you do that is not to put your Officers and
          your horses within the danger areas where the crowd pressure
          may build up, because that is simply going to trap the
          Officers in the same crush as the crowd? - A. I d o n ’t know
          what the intentions of those particular Officers were or what
          their brief was from Mr. Marshall, but surely they were sent
          in there for a purpose.  They were operating in there for a
          purpose.

       Q. It may be you think you are the wrong person to answer this
          because you are not as it were a mounted Policeman man.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Mr. Hytner, I was going to
          suggest, not I hope being offensive in any way, perhaps it is
          not profitable to explore every aspect of the matter with
          every Officer.  I d o n ’t think this Officer really was in a
          position to know what the orders were that were given down on
          the concourse.

               MR. HYTNER:  No, but he was, as it were, in overall
          control. I am certainly not going to investigate this with
          every Officer.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       We will be having,   I know, mounted
          Officers.

               MR. HYTNER:   Some of these questions ought properly to
          be put to Mr. Hand-Davis:

       Q. Can I now come to 2.30.  Again these figures may be very
          difficult to get accurately, but at 2.30 you thought the North
          Stand was about half full? - A. Yes.

       Q. That would leave about another 5,000 to come into the ground,
          would not it? - A. It depends which side of the half you are
          looking at.  You are looking at the low side and I might have
          been looking at the high side.

       Q. Yes, I agree.   These figures are very, very approximate. - A.
                             Ill


                                                  B.D. MURRAY


     Yes.   Well, it could be 4,000, not 5,000.

Q.   Yes.   As far as the West Stand was concerned and the standing
     terraces, about how many do you reckon still had to come in
     there at 2.30? - A. The West Stand was filling.    It was what I
     would call filling.   That is over half-full and on its way to
     filling.   Not full, but doing well.  The terraces, it is very
     difficult to establish, but certainly there were plenty in the
     centre two pens and plenty in the raised area, and there were
     quite a lot in the rest of the terrace.

Q. The situation was this, was not it, at 2.30, that the two
   centre pens were not filling;  they were full;  but the two
   wing pens had thousands to come? - A. That was usually the
   state of affairs on a match like this.

Q.   So again we have got a situation at 2.30 where there are very
     many thousands of people still to come into the ground? - A.
     No, you said that, sir.   I said there were probably 4,000 to
     5.000 to go into the North Stand at the extreme  and probably
     4.000 to go into the West Stand terrace.

Q . Y e s , very many thousands.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   How many to go into the West
     Stand? - A. I would think, my Lord, probably if I had to put a
     figure on it I would think there was probably about 4,000
     spaces on the terrace at half-past-2.

Q. On the terrace or the  terrace and the West Stand? - A.
   Probably up to 4,000 spaces on the terrace, my Lord.

Q.       MR. HYTNER:    Again, these figures may well be
     approximate, but we are getting to something like 8,000 in all
     to come? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you think you would get all those in by 3 o ’clock? - A.
   Yes, I thought half-an-hour was sufficient.

Q. Again this has been explored with Mr. Duckenfield, but I have
   to ask it you because   it is certainly plain on your statement,
   one of the considerations which weighed with you as to whether
   the kick-off was to be delayed was whether it was the fault of
   the fans or whether it was not the fault of the fans? - A. I
   think "fault” is not the word I would use, sir.    I think what
   was said was if it was purely a case of people not turning up
   at the right time for the kick-off then it would not normally
   be delaye d.

Q. Yes, because it is their own fault?     It is their own look out.
   Was that the attitude? - A. I d o n ’t think it was ever meant to
   be as dogmatic as that.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    What is the distinction between
     having a large crowd outside who are not going to be able to
     get in by 3 o ’clock because there has been fog on the Pennines
     or having the same crowd similarly unable to get in because
                             112


                                                   B.D. MURRAY


     they have chosen to come late? - A. I d o n ’t there was ever an
     intention that because people came late deliberately en masse
     that we would not delay the kick-off.   It could have been
     24,000 people that came late, and obviously the situation
     would have been completely different.   I think everything we
     set has to have an alternative option.   The option is always
     the re.

Q.        MR. HYTNER:   One of the reasons for delaying the kick-
     off is to avoid the impatience that arises outside the ground
     of fans who think they are going to miss the kick-off and who
     may indulge in some pushing or shoving in order to get into
     the ground early?  Is not that one of the reasons why you do
     delay a kick-off? - A. That would be a consideration.

Q. It is not just a reward for those who have not done anything
   wrong or a punishment for those who have come late
   deliberately.     It is a matter of crowd safety, is not it? - A.
   I d o n ’t see it as a reward or a punishment.  I see it as quite
   an important decision to make.     There are other
   considerations;     the behaviour of the people inside;  what
   will happen after the event;     the arrangements that have been
   made after the event.     I think it is something that has to be
   given a lot of thought.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose if you do it too lightly
     then people just get to rely on the fact that kick-off will be
     delayed? - A. This is one of the main problems, my Lord.

Q.        MR. HYTNER:   And you may get impatience inside the
     ground.  Nobody is suggesting it is an easy question to solve.
     What I have to put to you, however, is that the one
     consideration you should never take into account is that
     people have turned up who turned up late who might have turned
     up earlier.  That simply should never be part of the equation,
     should it? - A. I thought that was what I was just saying,
     sir.

Q. It is not apparently what you said in your statement.         Do you
   follow? - A. No, sir.  I d o n ’t.

Q. Perhaps I had better read it to you, because it may be a total
   confusion and it may be you said something you did not mean to
   say.  Have you got your statement in front of you? - A. Yes, I
   have.

Q. I think it is page 9.     The middle of the page:

          ’’About this time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield asked
          me to remind him of what we had decided about delaying
          the kick off.   I informed him that we had agreed that if
          there was an identifiable problem, such as a serious
          accident on the motorway, or bad weather over the
          Pennines, which prevent people arriving on t i m e , that we
          would delay - but if it was merely that people had
          arrived in time, but decided to go elsewhere, rather
          than the ground and arrived at the last minute, then we
                             113

                                                    B.D. MURRAY


          would not normally delay i t " .

     - A. Yes, sir.   "Normally".     "Not normally delay".

Q. When you think about it that should not be a consideration at
   all, should it? - A. What, that people come when they want and
   we have the match when they arrive?

Q. If there is a press of people outside the ground and they are
   impatient to get in there may be a danger of crushing and
   disorder.  It does not matter why that is, does it? - A.
   No. If we are talking about the circumstances you are
   talking about, no.

Q. Was it a consideration on this particular day that it passed
   through your mind and was perhaps discussed with Mr.
   Duckenfield that these were latecomers who had been drinking
   around the town? - A. No, sir, not at all.

Q. Can I just go on.

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose the thinking behind it
     is this, that people who are held up by fog or an accident
     w o n ’t take the delay of kick-off to be held up by fog or an
     accident next time, because that is just something that
     happened to them, but if people stay in the public houses
     until the last minute and roll up then and know that last time
     it happened the kick-off was delayed, then they would
     be encouraged to do it more? Have I got it right or not? - A.
     Yes, my Lord, exactly.

Q. It is a difficult equation.




                                    /Q.   MR. HYTNER:   There were
                            114

                                       B.D. MURRAY


Q.         MR. HYTNER:  There were four requests in all by
     Mr. Marshall for the gates to be opened? -A. Yes sir, I
     would say there were four.

Q. And quite a bit of time elapsed between the first and the
   last? - A. Yes sir.

Q. I am not sure whether we can work it out exactly.  It was
   well over five minutes, wasn't it? - A. No sir, I would
   say under five minutes, probably about 3, 3%.

Q. What was happening in that 3% to 4 minutes.    Was the
   matter discussed between you and Mr. Duckenfield? - A. The
   first thing that happened was the request came in to open
   the gates.   Mr. Marshall was told to stand by presumably
   while the situation was assessed as to what would be the
   effect of it and see if it could be recovered.    At the
   same time the request was coming in for other Serials to
   be despatched.   Serials were despatched from the gymnasium.
   P.C. Ryan was possibly still passing his Tannoy messages
   over the Tannoy.   In between the first and the last request
   the gates were either opened or burst open or forced open
   or whatever.   That is what was happening sir.

Q. I will come to the burst gate in a moment.   We weren't
   there, you were.   It is difficult to get the flavour and
   the atmosphere, but the words you; actually spoke after
   the fourth request:   "Mr. Duckenfield, are you going to
   open the gates".   On one reading of them have a flavour
   of you being concerned that Mr. Duckenfield was dithering,
   that he had not made up his mind, and you were rather
   urgently trying to get him to do so.   Is that a fair
   interpretation? - A . I don't think Mr. Duckenfield was
   dithering.  I think Mr. Duckenfield was weighing all the
   considerations and I turned round to him and said:    "You
   have got to make the decision now" virtually.   I used
   the words you use but what it meant was "We have got to
   make that decision no w " .

Q. Again 1 don't want to put words in your mouth in this way
   but that is not far from what I was putting to you, that
   you were concerned that he had not made the decision
   after four requests for the same thing to happen? - A.
   I was not concerned sir and he was not dithering.  He
   was obviously still considering whether we could retrieve
   the situation or not and it was my opinion then that we
   had to open the gates with the final request of Mr. Marshall.

Q. At that particular time everybody's minds were really
   adverted to the fans causing trouble, weren't they? A
   gate opened and it was immediately assumed that the gate
   had been broken open? - A. No.  The words that were given
   to me was "The gate has gone" or "The gate has burst"
   and they were given by the Video Operator*
                              115

                                         B.D.MURRAY


Q.   The impression being that they had gone     through crowd
     pressure? - A. That is what it conveyed     to me, yes.

Q. And similarly when you saw for the first time the fans
   climbing over the gates, the fence, the perimeter fence,
   it conveyed to you the impression, did it, that there had
   been some sort of pitch invasion? - A. No, not pitch
   invasion.  When I saw people climbing over the fence, are
   we talking over on to the perimeter track?

Q.   Yes? - A. They were getting on to the pitch.  They probably
     wanted to see, probably wanted a better view.   There was
     something happening, I don't know what it was.

Q • It was pretty obvious, wasn't it, in the way in which they
    were climbing over and standing aimlessly around on the
    track that they were out through pressure, not because
    they wanted to spoil the game or anything of that sort?
    - a . It was not obvious to me and I never considered they
    wanted to spoil the game.   I thought they wanted to get
    on to the track to get a better view.


                    Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON;

Q. Mr. Murray, may I take up the very last matter.  In the
   briefing you gave before the game was there any particular
   attention paid to crushing? - A. No sir.

Q. Am I right that in every case when we check the briefings,
   we check the notes, we check everything that was said,
   nothing was ever said to any of the Officers on the ground
   about crushing? - A. I don't know sir, but it was not
   mentioned in my brief.

Q. Because at the end of the day there was a great deal of
   distress, was there not, shown by the Officers and anger
   by the fans on the pitch? - A. Yes, there was.

Q. And if we look at the video we will see, will we not, at
   well after 10-past-3, many many Police Officers standing
   apparently doing nothing? - A. That is what it appears,
   yes sir.

<§!» And is that   because no one ever briefed   them as to what they
     ought to do   if there was a crush at the   front of any one of
     these pens?   - A. I think it is possibly   because they did
     not realise   the full extent of what was   happening.

Q. Is it correct that no one was ever briefed as to the method
   of extracting people from inside these pens if there was a
   crush? - A. No one was briefed on that subject, no.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Is there some specific way of
     doing it?
                                       B.D. MURRAY


      MR. JACKSON: My Lord, it would have been, or will
be my submission that anyone who had considered the
possibility of crushing at the Leppings Lane end would have
instantly realised that the gate at the front was pathetically
inadequate.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I follow that point.  As I think
I have said earlier in this Inquiry, I don't think I am
going to require alot of persuasion  about that.

         MR. JACKSON:    I am obliged, my Lord.

      MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, I do apologise for interrupting,
but if the Officer   is being asked that men on thefield
should have done something and it is being put that things
could have been done, sir in fairness to the Officer perhaps
Mr. Jackson would put what it is precisely suggested those
Officers should do.   He has not answered that point.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I was raising that point and
then I rather think Mr. Jackson shifted his ground on to
saying that the gate was inadequate.

      MR. JACKSON:  My Lord, may I make it very clear.
My point is exactly the opposite of that which apparently
I have given the impression.

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Oh by all means let's see what
it is.

      MR. JACKSON:  The Officers were distressed; they were
standing apparently doing nothing; there was nothing they
could do in the circumstances, but the picture that would
be presented to the fans would be a large number of Officers
doing nothing at a time of emergency.  That would be why
the Officer would receive and his colleagues would receive
abuse from fans thinking they were doing nothing.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Again I am not wanting to stop
you but I think that is    pretty clear, isn't it?

      MR. JACKSON:  That is what I thought.          That iswhy
I am rather surprised at the intervention.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  With Mr. Woodward I thought
you were suggesting there was some special technique for
getting people out of a   tennis court gate if they all got
crushed inside, but you are not saying that.

         MR. JACKSON:> I am obliged.

Mr. Murray, may I take just one aspect of the evidence that
you have given and extend it a little.

      We have heard throughout the Police evidence that
this was unprecedented the crush at the Leppings Lane
                                   B.D. MURRAY


turnstile.  May we take it in the order that my learned
friend Mr. Hytner did.  At 2.17 or thereabouts there came
the first sign from an Officer on the ground that some?
thing unusual was happening, the request to close Leppings
Lane? - A. Yes sir.

At 2.30 there was a discussion between you and Mr. Duckenfield
as to in what circumstances the game may be delayed? - A.
Yes sir.

Thereafter you sent extra horses, an extra Serial, and
Tannoy messages all about the crush at the Leppings Lane
turnstiles? - A. Yes sir.

Are you aware   of the instructions that we would find if
we needed to turn to them, that the Police ought to monitor
the income of the particular gates.    I will remind you if
necessary.  It is at Tab 12, 144.     It is quite clear, is
it not, that that discussion between you and        the Senior
Officer, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, was about the
critical state of the crowd outside.    All the things we
have mentioned, the extra horses, the extra Serial, the
Tannoys, attempting to speak to Mr. Locke about the people
not getting through the turnstiles.    We find at Tab 12,
144:

      "Where limits are critical. Police should make
      arrangements to monitor turnstile counts".

You had that ability; you had used   it in the     past.  Can you
explain why no attempt was made to   check the     number of
people then we would not have to be guessing and estimating
and subtracting and dividing? - A. Yes sir, the facility
was not used.   The estimates that I gave to you for 2.30
were purely my estimates on the space in the ground.

I accept that estimates were used.   I merely want to ask
why were they necessary.  You had the ability and had used
in the past this facility? - A. Yes.

If it was worth discussing putting off the game, surely it
was worth using the facility available? - A. I don't think
there was a discussion about putting off the game, sir.
There was a discussion about delaying kick-off and under
what criteria kick-off would be delayed.

Finally, Mr. Murray, you used the expression and I hope
I made an accurate note of it, when asked about the central
pens being fuller etc. you said this was "usually the
state of affairs".  In other words it was common knowledge
that the central pens filled up first? - A. Yes sir.

Again we have no need to turn to it, but wasn't it quite
apparent at 2.47 that the number of people outside whenever
and however they entered, would cause a problem of over­
crowding in the central pens unless checked? - A. It was
not obvious to me sir.

                                                  B.D. MURRAY


         Q. Would you say as you have so fairly done, with hindsight
            it is obvious? - A. With hindsight everything would be done
            differently.

         Q. Is it fair to say that many of the questions that can be
            answered so simply were not answered on that day because
            your attention was not drawn to them? - A. The majority
            of our plans and operation of those plans is down to
            experience and the experience that we have had in the
            past, the information, the intelligence that we get, and
            based on the information and intelligence on this occasion
            and my experiences and the experiences of other Officers
            involved in the plans, they were made to the best of our
            ability.  We have never had problems in the past, to my
            knowledge, with those two central pens and we did not
            foresee any problems on this occasion.

                  MR. JACKSON:   Thank you, Mr. Murray.


                          Cross-Examined by MR. MULLER:

         Q. Mr. Murray, in relation to those two central pens 3 and 4
            where you say it is quite natural for those to fill up
            first because it is an obvious vantage point? - A. It is
            a popular part of the ground, yes sir.

         Q. Is it your experience that they will fill up right to the
            back? - A. Generally they fill up, there are gaps at the
            front.

         Q. So the implication behind that is they tend to fill up to
            the back.  Is that right? - A. Yes, they do.

         Q. If they fill up to the back that means, doesn't it, that
            the natural gangway into the adjoining pens is blocked?
            - A. Yes.

         Q. In those circumstances if that is what you would naturally
            expect to happen, can you tell us why it is you say that
            you would not think it would be necessary to direct people
            out of those central pens into the adjoining pens because
            they would do it naturally? - A. It is just that they do
            tend to find their way through the gates and overspill
            into the other areas.

         Q. Is that likely to be so even with people who are strangers
            to that particular ground? - A. Well with respect sir I
            don't think these Liverpool fans very many of them were
            strangers.  It is only a year that they had been there before.

         Q. But the position is this, isn't it, that if you are going
            to encourage people to move into the adjoining pens at
            an appropriate time, the sensible thing is to keep those
            gangways clear, isn't it? - A. If we were going to encourage
            people, yes.

    Q.   What I am s u g g e s t i n g to you is that those gates sh o ul d
         have been m a n n e d in order to e n c o ur ag e peop le to do
         p r e c i s e l y th at ? - A. Well, I cann ot see, if you are going
         to lock the gate back, there does not seem to be any point
         in m a n n i n g it, sir.

    Q.   P r e c i s e l y the reas on I am p u t t i n g it to you. In order
         that the O ff ic er s who are there will kee p the ga ng way s
         cl ear to make sure that peo pl e do not pack up right to the
         back, but go throug h into the next pen?

                   LO RD J U S T I C E TAYLOR: Hr. Huller, do you mind my
         a s k i n g how this mat te r is r e l a t e d to the Fire Se rv i c e ?

                   HR. HULLER:           It re la te s to the s i t ua ti on that the
         Fire Se rv ic e was c o n c e r n e d with ma tt er s of egress from the
         pen and, of course, the y were responsible, with ot h er s on
         the W o r k i n g O f f i c e r s Committee, for a l l o w i n g that po si ti on
         to ar ise which did arise, n a m e l y that there was the gate
         at the back an d it was part, as the Fire S e rv ic e
         u n d e r s t o o d it a n d said to the W o r k i n g Party, that it was
         to be a c o n d i t i o n of those gates b e i n g there, and on l y
         t hos e gates b e i n g there, that w o u l d be under the ma nn i n g
         of the Police:

    Q.   Can I now ask you about an oth er matter.                Can you h e l p me,
         please, am I right in u n d e r s t a n d i n g that it wo ul d be no
         later than ab out seven mi nu t e s past three when you were on
         the pitch itself or the p e r i me te r of the pitch and then
         r e a l i s e d that peop le were b e i n g cr us h e d up ag ain st the
         p e r i m e t e r fence? - A. Seven or eight minut es past three,
         yes.

    Q.   And at that time you say, "I think                I asked     for c u t t i n g
         e q u i p m e n t " ? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. Am I right in u n d e r s t a n d i n g that, alt ho ug h you do not
       s p e c i f i c a l l y rem em be r it, you w ou ld not at all be
       s u r p r i s e d if, in those cir cu mst anc es , you w o ul d be ask in g
       u r g e n t l y for just such e q u i p m e n t ? - A. I think I did.   If
       I did not, so meo ne else ve ry close to me did.

    Q.   But was it s o m e t h i n g that struck you as b e i n g o b v i o u s that
         was r e q u i r e d at that t im e? - A. To get the fences down.

    Q.   And can you he l p us at all, from a n y t h i n g yo u may have
         d i s c o v e r e d since or otherwise, if that h a p p e n e d about
         seven mi nu te s past three, how it cane about that it was
         not until 14 mi nut es past three - some seven m i nu te s later
         - that s om e b o d y was a s k i n g the Fire Briga de to provi de
         c u t t i n g e q u i p m e n t ? - A. Well, my e n q ui ri es revealed, sir,
         that the first reques t was made to our C l a y w h e e l s Lane
         Depot and an Acc id en t Unit was directed, but I think that
         w ou ld have been t r a v e l l i n g from some distance.          Pr es um a b l y
                                                                    B. D. HURRAY



at C l a y w h e e l s Lane there was no c u t t i n g e q u ip me nt
available.

Was it with in your knowledge, as a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t of
Police, that the Fire B ri ga de ha d all manner of cu tt in g
e q u i pm e nt which could, if required, have cut down that
fence very quickly, w i tho ut c a u s i n g direct injury from the
c u t t i n g to peop le in the pen? - A. I wo ul d c e r t a i n l y hope
so, sir.

But did the Po l i c e have s i mil ar c u tt i n g e q u i p m e n t ? - A.
It is to my k n o w l e d g e that we do have power tools in
A c c i d e n t Un it s and, if there ha d been an Ac ci den t Unit on
s t a n d b y at C l a y w h e e l s Lane, as there c o u l d well have been,
he c o u l d have been there very, ve r y q u i c k l y indeed.

It depended, therefore, on there b e i n g such a unit
a v a i l a b l e at the t i m e ? - A. It did, indeed, sir, yes.

                 C r o s s - e x a m i n e d by HR.   HAXWELL:

       HR. HAXWELL:     Hr. Hurray, your u n d e r s t a n d i n g was
that it was the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of the Police and the Club,
by its stewards, to m o ni to r the fans that went into pens 3
a n d 4? - A. I think it is a gener al respo ns ib il it y, sir.

And that was done for the p u r p o s e s of se ei n g wheth er there
was o v e r c ro wd in g, not by c o u n t i n g heads, but by a visual
c h e c k ? - A. Yes, sir.

And that w o u l d be g e n e r a l l y true in the event of any kind
of p r o b l e m a r i s i n g on the terraces, that you w o u l d ca rr y
out that visual c h e c k ? - A. Yes, sir.

H a v i n g in mi n d they are fi gh t i n g or d r i n k i n g or any sort
of d i s o r d e r l y b e h a v i o u r ? - A. If there is s o m e t h i n g wrong,
I w o u l d exp ec t a Pol ic e O f fi ce r to b r i n g it to our
a t t e n t i o n or a s t e w a r d to b r i n g it to a Poli ce O f f i c e r ’s
attention.

Thank you.          Now, in the c o nt ex t of your understa nd in g, I
want to dr a w your a t t e n t i o n to this, that it was ev i d e n t l y
part of the s t a n d i n g i n st ru ct io ns that there was to be
a p r e - m a t c h b r i e f i n g of s t e w a r d s ? - A. Yes, sir.

Hr. D u c k e n f i e l d t h ou gh t that you might be able to assist
the Inqui ry about that.                  Was there on this o c c a s i o n a
p r e - m a t ch b r i e f i n g of s t e w a r d s ? - A. The Inspector in
charge of the four stands briefed the stewards working in
those p a r t i c u l a r areas.

So my e n q u i r i e s sh o ul d be put bette r to an Inspector
rath er than to y o u r s e l f ? - A. Well, the Inspector of the
st an d that you are in te re st ed in, yes, sir.

Q.   In spector White is th at ? - A. Inspector White w o u l d have
     b r i e f e d the st ew a r d s in the West Stand.

Q.   In the same vein, can I ask you this about the
     a r r a n g e m e n t s made for this semi-final.          Was any
     a r r a n g e m e n t made b e tw ee n the Cl u b and the Police about
     d i s t r i b u t i o n of s t e w a r d s ? - A. Not that I kn o w of, sir,
     no.

Q.   No a r r a n g e m e n t ab ou t the location an d the nu mbe rs of
     stewards, as far as you k n o w ? -          A. No, sir.

Q.   Was it a s i t u a t i o n where, in your mind, the Clu b and the
     Pol ice were m a k i n g se pa ra te and in de pendent a r r a n g e m e n t s
     for m a n a g i n g the c r o w d that c am e? - A. The senior Police
     Officer, like I say, in re sp ec t of each s ta nd b r i e f e d the
     st ew a rd s w o r k i n g in that area.

                   C r o s s - e x a m i n e d by HR.    GIBSON-WATT:

Q.             HR. GIBSO N-W ATT :  Just what I hope are a cou pl e of
     short points, Hr. Hurray.          You were, first of all,
     c a r r y i n g out the same duti es last year as this year at the
     semi-final?         - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   And I think you have r e a l l y al r e a d y ind ic ate d you r e ga rd ed
     the fact that this year was a rep ea t of last year as
     p o s i t i v e l y helpf ul in m a k i n g your p r e p a r a t i o n s and plan?
     - A. Yes.

Q.   The s e c o n d point is this:           do you recall w h et he r you were
     presen t in the Control Ro o m when Hr. Kelly, the Chief
     E x e c u t i v e of the FA, v i s i t e d the Control Room s h or tl y
     after?          - A. No, sir, I never saw Hr. Kelly.

Q.   You were down on the p e r im et er track from the s ou nd of
     things.  I will not t r ou bl e you further.

                    C r o s s - e x a m i n e d by HR.   KALLIPETIS:

Q.        HR. KAL LI PE TI S:   Hr. Hurray, yo u are familiar with
     this ground, as you to l d us, and you had taken part in the
     1988 Cu p Final.     Is that r i g h t ? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   Is it right there was a m e e t i n g with the Am b u l an ce Service
     befo re the 1988 Cup Final, I think on the W e d n e s d a y before
     the m a t c h ? - A. Before the 1988 FA s e m i - f i n a l ?

Q.   Ye s ? - A.   I do not know,            sir.

Q.   I think Hr. Sewell was the liaison O ff ic er b e t w e e n the
     Poli ce a n d the Am u b l a n c e Service, was not he? - A. Yes,              he
     u s u a l l y is.

Q.   And you had m ee ti ng s be twe en the 22 n d Harch and 14th April
     of this year befo re this y e a r ’s semi- fi nal - I make it
     seven altogether.             M o ul d that be about right - to discuss
     a r r a n g e m e n t s for the m a tc h? - A. If it is seven, yes, sir,
     I will take your word.

Q.   And at least three of those were with Hr.                         Sewell      in
     a t t e n d a n c e ? - A. Yes.

Q.   But to none was an y r e p r e s e n t a t i v e from the A m bu la nce
     Se rv ic e invited.             By that I mean South York sh ire
     H e t r o p o l i t a n Am bu l an ce S e r v i c e ? - A. Did a r e pr es e n t a t i v e
     not a t t e n d the me et i n g on the 22 nd?

Q.   No, I do not think we were invite d to, Hr. Hurray.                     Now,
     no c r i t i c i s m be cau se it may well be,be cau se Hr. Sewell
     was there, you were re ly i n g upon him.            That  is what I
     w a n t e d to ask you? - A. Well, I was under the impression
     that an A m b u la nc e Of fic er had a t t e n d e d that me e t i n g on the
     22nd.       Unfortuna tel y, I have not got a r e co r d of that
     meeting, so I cann ot c o n f i r m it.

Q.   If that is your impression, can you rem em be r who                           it was? -
     A. I co ul d say it was a tall ch a p with glasses.

Q.   That is ab out six of them, as far as I r e m e m b e r ? - A. Yes,
     but I w ou ld on ly be guessing.         I do not r e a l l y know, but,
     from d i s c u s s i o n s afterwards, someo ne has told me there was
     an Am b u l a n c e O ff ic er at that meeting, but I can no t co nf ir m
     it .

Q.   It c o u l d be Hr. lason be ca us e he was                one of the liaison
     O f fi ce rs for the ground, was not he?                   - A. I think Hr.
     lason is the name.

Q.   But am I right, Hr. Hurray, that e v e r y b o d y in control -
     an d you are one of those, of cour se - wo uld know where the
     A m b u l a n c e S e rv ic e was locat ed at the time of the ma t ch ? -
     A.      Hy impression         - I he ar d what Hr. Har shall said, but my
     impress ion was that the A m b ul an ce Of fic er wo ul d be in the
     South Stand.

Q.   In the South S t an d? - A.              Yes.

Q.   And Hr. S e w e l l ’s duty, a c c o r d i n g to the or de r s drawn up
     for this match, was to act as liaison to Hr. Duckenfield.
     is that r i g h t ? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q.   And if Hr. D u c k e n f i e l d w a nt ed to co nta ct Am bu la nc e
     Services, for example, he w o u l d use Hr. Sewell for that
     p u r p o s e ? - A. Possibly.

       LO R D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:            Yes,       I know the document.

         HR. KAL LIP ET IS: One last point, please, Hr. Hurray,
if yo u can h e l p me about this.   Yo u say that when the
o r d e r to open the gate was given, you were unable to see A
or B G a t e ? - A. Yes, sir.

Is there a fa ci li ty in the Contro l              Room wh er e b y you can
see the p i c t u r e that is a v a i l a b l e to the Club video
ca m e r a s t hr ou g h o u t the g r o u n d ? In other words, can you
switch t o . . . . ? - A. No.

You c a n n o t ? - A.       No,   we can no t m o ni to r      the fieldside
c a m e r a s at all.

T he re is no fa cil ity at all w h e r e b y you can see the
p i ct ur e that the Cl u b may have on its video m o n i t o r s ? - A.
The on l y f a c i l i t y is that there is an Offic er in the
Contro l Room.         A PC with a radio.

S o r r y ? - A.   T he re    is a PC       in the Control        Room with a
radio.

I see? - A. But there                is no way we c o u l d see       it    in the
G r o u n d Control.

                   C r o s s - e x a m i n e d by   HR.    GLASGOW:

          HR. GL ASGOW:               Likewise, there is not any way in
which the Cl u b s cr een s in their room can see what you are
looking at, is th e r e ? - A. Well, my information is that
one of the m o n i t o r s in the C l u b ’s Control Room is
c o n t i n u o u s l y m o n i t o r i n g our r e c o r d i n g camera.

Yes, a b s o l u t e l y right, Hr. Hurray. In other words, they
can look at wh at e v e r it is that yo u hap pe n to be r e c or di ng
at that t i m e ? - A. That is correct, sir, yesZ                  *

So if the Po l i c e r e c o r d i n g e q u i p m e n t h a pp en s to be
s w i t c h e d on to one of the gate cameras, for example, that
is the p i c t u r e that will show also in the Cl ub r o o m ? - A.
Yes.

But they do not have any a b i l i t y t h e m s e l v e s to contr ol the
pi ct ur e that is be in g m o n i t o r e d by you ? - A. There is no
f a c i l i t y w h e r e b y they can swi tc h from c a m e r a to camera.

And so, b r o a d l y speaking, a ga in r i g h t l y or w r o n g l y and
wh et he r or not this is a go o d idea for the future - let us
just talk a bo ut the facts that exist up to t o d a y - the

     ot he r words,    m o n i t o r i n g what you are m o n i t o r i n g ? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   With that exception, the C l u b ’s ca mer as are t r a i n e d on
     their t u r n s t i l e staff w a t c h i n g the flow into the gr o un d
     and the Police c am era s are t r a i n e d all ro un d the ground,
     i n c lu din g the inside as w e l l ? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q.   S p e c i f i c a l l y I w o n d e r e d if you kn e w this, Hr. Hurray, but
     d o w n s t a i r s in the Club ro o m under the st an d they do not
     have c a me ras vi e w i n g the inside of the ground, on the
     st an ds or the terraces, unless one of yours h a pp en s to be
     s h o w i n g on the m on i t o r ? - A. Yes.

Q.    That is right.         Thank you.      Hr. Hurray, w o u l d it be fair
      to say that y o u must have very c o n s i d e r a b l e d i f f i c u l t y in
     remembering e v e r y t h i n g that yo u t r ie d to do in that Control
      Ro om that a f t e r n o o n ? - A. I think that is fair, yes.

Q.   I am just a little c o n c e r n e d that you may not have done
     justice to y o u r s el f on one matter.    Were you, in fact,
     aware that r eg ul a r calls were b e i n g made down to the Club
     Control Room in order to find out what the tu r n s t i l e entry
     figures were or has that gone c o m p l e t e l y from your mind?
     - A. By whom, sir?

Q.   I ca n n ot tell you who was m a k i n g the calls, on ly that they
     were u s u a l l y made to Police C o n s t a b l e Guest, who is your
     liaison O f f ic e r within the C l u b ’s r o o m ? - A. Yes.

Q.   Let us take it in stages, Su pe ri ntendent. First of all,
     that is what o ug ht to be done, is not it? - A. Yes.

                                               B.D. MURRAY


Q. All right.  And we know that gate C was opened officially by
   order at 2.52? - A. yes.

Q. We can see that. - A. Yes.

Q. It would appear to be a 5 minute lapse then between the
   request and the opening? - A. If the request was at 2.47, the
   gates would not be opened immediately the order was given.
   There was a little delay after.

Q. There would be some pause? - A. Yes.

Q. What concerns me more, Mr. Murray, is the next pause, because
   we also know that gate A is opened at 2.58.  So in other
   words, another 6 minutes later than that? - A. I will accept
   that.  My impression....

Q. I think you can safely accept that. - A. My impression was
   that gate A followed very quickly after the rest of the gates.

Q. That is what I wanted to draw your attention to if I may to
   the second of the paragraphs on your statement where you say
   that the request came at about 14.50.  This is the urgent
   request from the unit behind gate A? - A. Yes.

Q. And that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield immediately
   authorised the gate to be opened.  Assume, please, Mr. Murray,
   that the figures I have given you are correct and the times
   are correct, and that that gate A was in fact opened at 2.58.
   - A. Yes.

Q. Therefore a full 11 minutes after the first request was made.
   Why on earth did not somebody say at that stage, "All gates
   were ordered to be open 5 minutes ago.  What on earth are they
   still doing with two shut and only one open?".  Why didn't
   somebody say that? - A. I don't think we knew at that stage
   there were two shut and only one open.

Q. But, Mr. Murray, somebody in the Police control room as we saw
   on the film which I think you have seen, zoomed in on gate A
   and so somebody in your room's attention was specifically
   being focused in every sense of the word on gate A? - A. I can
   only assume the Officer did that when the request came in.

Q. And gate B, that was never opened? - A. No, I appreciate that,
   sir.  I did not know.

Q. And truly, the position in the control room was - let's talk
   in round figures - a full 10 minutes after the first request
   for all gates to be opened, nobody even spotted the fact that
   only one had been opened in response to a direct order in the
   plural? - A. The request was not for all gates to be opened.
   The request was for the gates to be opened at Leppings Lane,
   and the order that went out was for the gates to be opened at
   Leppings.  There was never an "all", and that is may be a
   mistake, but there was never a request went out for ail gates
   to be opened.  But it was our perception or my perception that
                             131

                                                     B.D. MURRAY


     the gates, all the gates at Leppings Lane would be opened when
     Mr. Duckenfield gave the authority.

Q. I am sorry.  It was your perception that they would? - A. My
   perception that they would be.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    You expected they would? - A. I
     expected them all to be opened.

          MR. GLASGOW:    I won't push it further.     Thank you.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Woodward, I want to be as
     helpful as possible.  I had rather assumed this Officer might
     wish to complete his evidence today if that is possible rather
     than come back.  Is that going to put you in difficulties?

          MR. WOODWARD:   It won't put me in difficulty.      I don't
     know about everybody else.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     How long do you expect to be?

          MR. WOODWARD:   About quarter-of-an-hour, sir, if that.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Am I right in thinking you would
     rather finish today and come back? - A. I don't mind coming
     back tomorrow, my Lord.

Q. It is entirely up to you.   I would have thought it would be
   better to finish it.  The other possibility is you have been
   in there a long time.  Would you rather stop now?       - A. Yes,my
   Lord.  I would rather stop.   Thank you.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Very well, we will do that.    So be
     it.  Tomorrow morning there will be a different arrangement.
     The members of the Inquiry are going to see the Police box and
     have a look at the communications.   I have had a look at them
     some time ago but not since   the evidence has been     given.
     Because the control room as   has been said in evidence isvery
     small it is not possible to do what I have been trying to do
     all the time which is that if we see everything everybody sees
     it together.  So only the members of the Inquiry will go
     tomorrow morning.  We are going at quarter-to-9 and we will
     sit at 10.30 tomorrow rather than 10.   But if any other
     counsel want to see the box it will be available at the same
     time or even earlier at 8.30 on Friday morning if they would
     like to go and have a look then, and the same facilities will
     be offered.

          So it is 10.30 tomorrow.

             (The Inquiry was adjourned until 10.30 a . m .
                       the following morning)

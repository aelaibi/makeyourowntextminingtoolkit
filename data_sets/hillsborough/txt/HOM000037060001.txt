DRAFT LETTER FOR PS SIGNATURE


Thank you for your letter of 16 January to the Prime Minister. The Home Secretary has undertaken to
consider carefully the points which were made in the programme “Hillsborough”, and the representations
which have been made to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has emphasised that he would not
take any decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be in the public
interest to do so and that it would stand a chance of providing a better understanding than there is at present of
what happened on that terrible day.


 In coming to his decision, the Home Secretary will consider whether there is any new evidence; he will also
 consider whether that evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been put before Lord Taylor or
 before the coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been
 different.


 The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide the Home Secretary with a detailed report
 of all the points raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that he will reach a decision on
 any further action to be taken as soon as he has been able to consider all the issues.

            Dear Sir

            HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY 1989

            UNISON'S National Executive Council recently considered the
            Hillsborough tragedy in the wake of the TV documentary and
            subsequent reporting of the matter.

            Many UNISON members have been involved in the events surrounding
            this tragedy and the National Executive Council felt that the events
            raised issues which would best be dealt with by a full public enquiry into
            the tragedy and the events leading    to, during, and since.

            Will you give consideration to this matter, and let me know whether the
            Government is willing to establish such an enquiry.

            Your




            Rodney Bickerstaffe
            General Secretary




                                                                                         Associate General Secretary

Thank you for your letter of 16 January to the Prime Minister about the tragic events at Hillsborough.


The Home Secretary has undertaken to consider carefully the points which were made in the
         {l           u

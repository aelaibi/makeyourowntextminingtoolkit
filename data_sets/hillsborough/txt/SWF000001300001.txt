   his meeting with the Bank Manager and their agreement to loan us
   £35,000 for floodlights on a separate Loan Account at 3% plus base

    1. INTRODUCTION
    1.1 This booklet is a guide to measures for improving spectator
    safety at football grounds ie at Rugby Union and Rugby League
    grounds as well as at soccer grounds. It is a voluntary code and has
    no legal force.

    1.2 Guidelines on measures for improving the safety of spectators
    at sports grounds first became available on a more or less com­
    prehensive scale when the Wheatley Report on Crowd Safety at
    Sports Grounds was published in 1972. The recommendations in
    the appendix to that Report were extended to include fire pre­
    cautions and means of escape from an emergency situation such
    as a fire, and then formed the basis of the Guide to Safety at Sports
    Grounds (which became known as ‘the green code’). The application
    of those guidelines to football grounds during the next few years
    brought to light a need for the advice to be amended in certain
    respects. Furthermore, since the safety of spectators can be affected
    when crowds are disturbed by hooliganism, it was felt that the
    recommendations of the Working Party on Crowd Behaviour,
    which were made known to the Football League clubs in 1975,
    should be incorporated in any comprehensive guide to safety at
    football grounds. This booklet is the outcome. Since this new guide
    is aimed at football grounds, as distinct from sports grounds in
    general, it has been named accordingly.

    1.3 The problem of crowd safety at football grounds is complex
    and cannot be solved simply by ensuring that each component of
    a ground, such as stairways, passages or sections of terracing, is
    satisfactory in itself. The inter-relation of components is essential:
    they should be compatible and combine to form a balanced unit.

    1.4 Deviations from individual guidelines are possible without
    necessarily detracting from the overall safety of the ground. A

                                                                        1
flexible approach should be maintained to take account of the par­
ticular circumstances at individual grounds.

1.5 Although new work or reconstruction at football grounds
should not be to a standard lower than that set out in the guidelines,
it should be borne in mind when using the guide to assess whether
existing situations provide adequately for the safety of spectators
that the criterion is that of a reasonable degree of safety. It would
be unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute
safety of everyone attending a ground.

1.6 The advice given in this guide is without prejudice to the operation
of the Building Regulations 1972 for England and Wales (in Inner
London the London Building Acts and Constructional Bye-Laws),
the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1971-73 and any
other relevant legislation.


2. THE PROBLEM
2.1 There are essentially three types of safety problem to be con­
sidered within a football ground and in its immediate surroundings.

2.2 The first concerns hazards affecting individuals which cause
tripping, slipping and falling. The guidelines for general construc­
tional features of a ground are intended to deal with this type of
problem.

2.3 The second type is far more important. When large crowds are
present and densities are high, pressures build up within the crowd
either through motion or swaying which make it difficult, or even
impossible, for individuals to control their own movements. Under
these conditions crowd pressures can escalate to a dangerous state
and if a person stumbles or falls the crowd cannot adapt to avoid
him or stop to help. Since this type of danger arises from crowd
pressures its remedy lies in their removal or restraint within safe
limits. These dangers arise in particular on terraces and in exit
routes, and so careful attention must be paid to restraining surges
and similar pressures on the terraces and to ensuring free movement
throughout the exit systems. Such free movement is dependent
upon the capacity of all the various sections of the exit systems
and interactions between them.
2.4 The third type of safety problem cannot be divorced from the
second and in some ways is an extreme version of it. The danger
arises from emergency situations which can develop following, for
example, an outbreak of fire or hooliganism. The orderly evacua­
tion of large crowds may under emergency conditions become a very
serious problem, particularly in respect of stands where spectators
are in effect on the roof of a building, the materials and construction
of which might themselves constitute a fire risk.


3. GENERAL CONSTRUCTION
3.1 To meet the requirements of safety in a ground, all components
and installations, e.g. terraces, stands, stairs, barriers and pylons,
should have the strength and durability, and be maintained in such
condition and arranged in such a manner as to perform safely their
required functions. The design and construction of these com­
ponents and installations should be in accordance with good
engineering and building practice, especially as set .out in all relevant
British Standard specifications and codes of practice.

3.2 All electrical installations should comply with the current
edition of the Regulations of the Institution of Electrical Engineers.

3.3 When walls and fences are to withstand crowd pressures they
should be designed to withstand such pressures safely and allowance
should be made for forces simultaneously and independently
induced by other factors, e.g. wind forces or attached installations.

3.4 Precautions should be taken to prevent people from climbing on
roofs, pylons, hoardings and the like. Where possible such struc­
tures should be provided with unclimbable devices, e.g. stout
barriers or close boarded enclosures. Spikes and barbed wire
should be installed only above a minimum height of 2*4 metres from
the base.

3.5 All parts of the ground used by the general public, and especially
the exit routes, should have a minimum headroom of 2*4 metres or
such height as required by the appropriate Building Regulations.

3.6 Where the natural lighting in any section of the ground accessible
to the public is deficient, adequate artificial lighting should be

                                                                       3
provided. If the ground is intended for use during the hours of
darkness, all parts accessible to the public should be provided with
means of lighting adequate to enable them to see their way into,
within and out of the ground. These provisions are particularly
important in relation to exit routes and stairways used by the public.

4. INSPECTIONS AND TESTS
4.1 A detailed inspection of the ground, including all components
and installations, should be carried out annually to ensure compliance
with the guidelines in this code.

4.2 Following each event, a general visual inspection of the ground
should be made for signs of damage which might create a potential
danger to the public. Particular attention should be paid to the
condition of terraces, viewing slopes and stairways. Crush barriers
and balustrades should be examined for deformation or any other
overt signs of weakness.

4.3 Testing of crush barriers should be carried out in accordance
with Appendix C of this code. When the guidelines are first
applied to a particular ground, a representative sample of barriers
of all types from all areas of the ground should be selected for
testing. Further testing of barriers should be necessary only at
intervals of several years unless circumstances arise which raise
doubts as to their strength.

5. INGRESS TO THE GROUND
5.1 Where admission to a football ground or parts of it is controlled
by turnstiles, these, by their number and location, control not only \
the rate of admission but, to a large extent, the dispersal of \
spectators within a ground to their chosen sections. Turnstiles
should be of such numbers as to admit at a rate whereby no unduly J
large crowds are waiting for admission and yet at no faster rate
than the arrangements for distributing spectators within the ground
permit.

5.2 Dangerous overcrowding can be caused if spectators are able
to force their way into a ground already full to capacity by scaling
or breaking through boundary fences. To avoid this danger such
fences should be of appropriate height and strength.
6. EGRESS FROM THE GROUND
6.1 Recommendations relating particularly to egress from stands
are given in paragraph 8. Advice on the calculation of the capacity
of exit systems is contained in paragraph 15.5

6.2 It is generally recognised that the period of greatest risk to
crowd safety at football grounds is at the time of leaving. Pressures
can be set up within a departing crowd by impatient people and
these incipient pressures can and must be contained by careful
attention to the detailed design of barriers, stairways, gangways
and exits.

6.3 The aim should be to provide a smooth and unimpeded passage
through an exit route to the outside. This may be achieved by
controlling the crowd flow at the entrance to the exit route so that
the departing spectators are held back in a relatively safe place
e.g. on the terrace.

6.4 There should be no ‘funnelling’ effect causing people to converge
on a narrow means of access or egress. A narrowing in the exit
route is acceptable, however, when it is preceded by an open space
or reservoir area where the holding capacity is sufficient to contain
safely the spectators held up because of the difference in the flow
rate into and out of the reservoir area. This situation should not,
however, be permitted within 45 metres of any building within the
ground having a combustible structure, e.g. a timber stand, or
within 15 metres of any building within the ground having a non­
combustible structure. The capacity of reservoir areas should be
calculated using the appropriate flow rate given in paragraph 16
and the recommended exit time given in paragraph 6.5, a packing
density of 54 persons per 10 square metres of the area available
for standing within the reservoir area being the maximum allowable
for safety.

6.5 Recent research has indicated that when it takes more than
7 minutes to vacate an area of spectator accommodation the
crowd flow tends to become turbulent. In these conditions in­
dividuals can lose control over their own movement and the rate
of flow may be reduced. It is therefore suggested that the exits
from each area of spectator accommodation should be so designed
that the spectators can, if desired or required, leave that area in
8 minutes or less.
6.6 A comprehensive system of signposting which clearly indicates
routes to various parts of the ground should be provided. Directional
signs should be placed to encourage crowds in any particular
section to flow in one direction when leaving the ground.

6.7 So far as possible, exit routes should be free from obstructions.
In particular, no kiosk or lavatory should be situated in such a way
that it or any associated queue obstructs an exit route.

6.8 Although the minimum width for any section of an exit route
should be 1.1 metres the required width for any particular section
is dependent on the crowd flow it will be required to carry.

6.9 Where there is a simple exit route every part of that route should
be able to accommodate the flow from the terrace or stand exit.

6.10 For a more complex exit system combining a number of
exit routes and/or offering a choice of alternative routes to exits,
however, the system should be analysed in the form of a network
in order to check that the capacity of the exit from the terrace or
stand is such as to ensure a free flow of spectators to the various
exits from the ground. Where branching of routes gives departing
spectators a choice of paths, the proportion of the crowd likely to
use each path should be derived from local knowledge.

6.11 Where there is not a free flowing system, the width of the
restricting element should be increased and/or the width of the exit
from the stand or the terrace reduced.

6.12 Where there are gross deviations in design or construction
from the recommended guidelines so as to create a manifest danger,
that section of the exit system should be closed (and a reduction in
the capacity of the section of the ground which it serves should be
made) until remedial action has been taken.

6.13 Care should be taken in the planning of exit systems to ensure
that crowds have access in an emergency to alternative exit routes
in the event of their normal exit route being obstructed.

6.14 Exit doors
6.14.1 All doors on an exit route should be capable of opening
outwards in order that crowds can escape in an emergency. This
point is of particular importance in the case of doors within stands
and at the foot of stairways. Where exit doors have to be secured
against outside intruders they should be fitted with panic-type
bolts.

6.14.2 Where it is impracticable for exit gates from a ground
to open outwards for normal use since to do so would cause, for
example, an obstruction on a public highway, the gates should
be resited within the exit route they serve, or provision made
for two-way opening. Sliding or roller-shutter gates are not
recommended because they are incapable of being opened when
pressure is exerted in the direction of crowd flow and have mecha­
nism or runways which are vulnerable to jamming.

6.14.3 All doors on an exit route should be secured in the fully open
position before the end of play.

6.14.4 When open, no door should obstruct any gangway, passage,
stairway or landing.

6.14.5 There should be no obstruction in an exit e.g. no change
in level at exit doors.

6.14.6 All exit gates should be manned at all times while the ground
is used by the public so that they can be opened immediately in an
emergency.

6.14.7 Facilities should be provided to enable people to leave the
ground at any time. For this purpose a number of reversible
turnstiles or doors so operated as to limit the openings to the passage
of one person at a time might be considered.


7 TERRACES
7.1 Terraces are recognised as presenting a special safety problem.
In addition to the incidental dangers of standing for long periods
on steep terraced slopes, crowds are subject to excessive pressures
generated by spectators straining to see the event, by excitement, or
by surging deliberately induced by a certain type of spectator.
7.2 Failure to provide spectators with an unobstructed view invites
them to stretch and.strain and so generate dangerous pressures
within the crowd. For this reason it is desirable to provide a mini­
mum distance between the front of the terrace and the touch line
or goal line on the pitch (see paragraph 14).

7.3 Arrangements should also be made to encourage even distri­
bution of the crowd on the terraces to provide ease of access and
egress, to facilitate movement particularly should a local emergency
arise during the event, and to contain pressures before they reach
dangerous proportions. The following provisions will assist in
achieving these conditions.

7.4 Terrace s te p s
7.4.1 The surface of terrace steps should be of a non-slip material
with adequate drainage provided to prevent deterioration from the
action of rainwater.

7.4.2 A terrace step should be not less than 280 mm or more than
380 mm wide, with.a preferred dimension between 355 mm and
380 mm.

7.4.3 The height of risers should be within the limits of 75 mm and
180 mm, the lower limit of 75 mm being related to the minimum
width of 280 mm. If the riser height is greater than 180 mm it is
desirable that a crush barrier should be provided at the top of the
riser.

7.4.4 Excessive variations in the gradient of a terrace should be
avoided. Gradients steeper than 1 in 2 could be dangerous.

7.5 Gangways
7.5.1 The aim should be to ensure that every spectator on the terraces
is within 12 metres of a gangway or of an exit. This may be achieved
by a pattern of gangways (not less than 1-1 metres wide) linked to
the exit system, the following points being borne in mind:

7.5.2 Spectators would be discouraged from standing in lateral
gangways if these were sunk 100 mm to 200 mm and if crush barriers
were provided behind but not immediately in front of them.
7.5.3 Radial gangways which are relatively long and uncontrolled
downward paths through terraces are difficult to keep clear especially
when sited in popular viewing areas, for example behind the goal
areas. It is helpful to sink them 150 mm to 200 mm and to interrupt
an otherwise continuously descending gangway by turns along,
say, lateral gangways. As with other forms of stairways the going
should be uniform and the step dimensions as defined in paragraph
9.3.4.

7.6 Division of s p e c ta to r accom m odation
7.6.1 A ground should be divided into sections to prevent major
migrations by spectators. For example, each end or side of a ground
should be self-contained with its own entrances, exits and toilet/
refreshment facilities. There should be no access from one such
major section to another except in an emergency.

7.6.2 Railings, fences, etc. dividing sections of the ground should
be of the strength of the handrails dividing stairways into channels,
described in paragraph 13.

7.6.3 Each of these major sections should be sub-divided by such
means as gangways and crush barriers so disposed as to minimise
sway and surge of spectators. Recommendations on the siting of
gangways and the spacing of crush barriers are given in paragraphs
7.5 and 12.

7.7 Crush barriers
7.7.1 Much of the hazard on terraces can be eliminated by the
provision of well constructed, correctly positioned and properly
mounted crush barriers.

7.7.2 The maximum spacing of crush barriers will be dependent
on the gradient of the terrace or viewing slope. Paragraphs 12 and
13 give recommendations for the spacing and strength of crush
barriers.

7.7.3 Ideally, crush barriers should be provided along the full
width of a terrace with gaps only at the radial gangways.

7.7.4 Where barriers are not continuous between radial gangways,
the alignment of gaps in succesive rows of barriers on a terrace
should form an angle of less than 60° to the barriers. There should
not be more than 2 consecutive gaps in any line of gaps (see
Appendix B: Fig 1).

7.7.5 Where there are gaps in the line of crush barriers these should
be at least 1*1 metres and not more than 1*4 metres in width.

7.7.6 In order to locate the top rail against that part of the body
most able to tolerate pressure, the height of crush barriers should
be between 1*02 metres and 1-12 metres above the nosing of the
step immediately behind the barrier, with a preferred height of
1*1 metres.

7.7.7 Crush barriers should be designed so that there are no sharp
projections or edges. Although a barrier with a top rail of 50 mm
internal diameter tube has been adopted at many grounds, research
has shown there would be advantage in the use of a fiat rail of
100 mm vertical depth.

7.8 Viewing slopes
7.8.1 The surface of this form of terrace should be covered with a
non-slip material e.g. packed ash.

7.8.2 The desirable maximum gradient for a viewing slope is
1 in 6.

7.8.3 Viewing slopes with a gradient greater than 1 in 6 should have
continuous crush barriers between gangways.

7.8.4 The spacing of crush barriers should be the same as for
normal terracing (see paragraph 12).

7.9 Pitch perim eter fence/w all
7.9.1 This fence should be designed to keep spectators off the pitch
but gates or other access points should be provided for use in an
emergency and, at those grounds where a perimeter track is used
as part of the exit system, for the departure of spectators at the end
of play.

7.9.2 Access points should be controlled, so that immediate access
to the pitch or perimeter track can be ensured in the event of an
emergency.
7.9.3 If spectators can lean on the pitch perimeter fence it should be
deemed a crush barrier and fulfil the conditions of height and
strength specified in paragraphs 7.7.6 and 13, although if the fence
is of solid construction its height may be more than 1*12 metres.
This is because the pressures acting on a person forced against such
a fence are distributed over a large area of the body, unlike the
situation with a normal crush barrier, where the pressures are
localised.


8 STANDS
8.1 There is generally a less hurried departure from stands at
the end of a match and furthermore, spectators are induced by the
layout of the seats to form orderly queues. However, the general
safety considerations are similar to those for terraces and in this
regard attention should be paid to the following points:

8.2 Every stand should be provided with sufficient exits to allow
for the orderly evacuation from the stand of all spectators likely to
be accommodated.

8.3 Evacuation time, which will depend largely on the fire hazard
present in the stand, should be within the following limits:
a. 8 minutes where a stand is of non-combustible fire resisting
   construction, the interior use and contents present a low fire
   risk and the exit staircases are not vulnerable to a fire occurring
   within the stand; and
b. 2*5 minutes for stands of a lower standard.
The conditions at a particular ground may call for interpolation
between these times.

8.4 Seats and gangways should be so positioned as to provide
ready access to exits. No person in any part of a stand should have
to travel more than 30 metres to the nearest exit from the stand.

8.5 All seats should be securely fixed in position. The use of tip-up
seats allows more circulation space, the automatic type being
preferable.

8.6 The m inim um area allotted to each seated person should be
460 m m wide and 610 mm deep, but for comfort these measurements
should be 550 mm and 760 mm respectively. To enable people to
move freely between rows of seats there should be at least 305 mm
between perpendiculars from the foremost projection of one seat
and the back of the seat in front. (This minimum of 305 mm is
included in the 610 mm or 760 mm depth measurement of the
seating area).

8.7 The number of seats in a row should not exceed:
a. 14 seats where there is a gangway at one end only, and
b. 28 seats where there is a gangway at both ends.

8.8 Gangways should be of sufficient width for the seats served but
in no case of less than 1*1 metres without projections.

8.9 The seating area should be separated from the remainder of the
stand beneath it by a construction having a fire resistance of not
less than half an hour.

8.10 Walls within stands and ceiling linings beneath the stand
seats should have a flame spread classification of not less than
Class 1, when tested in accordance with British Standard No 476
Part 7.

8.11 A common feature in the construction of stands which is a fire
risk is the provision of voids under the seating. These voids become
the resting place for paper, cartons and other combustible materials
which can be ignited, unnoticed, by a carelessly discarded cigarette
end. Wherever possible such spaces should be excluded but where
they exist they should be sealed off so that paper etc cannot find its
way into them.

8.12 Balustrading
Those sections of balustrading which lie at the foot of stairways or
gangways within stands should have an equivalent strength to that
of crush barriers of the stronger type (see paragraph 13).


9 STAIRWAYS AND RAMPS
9.1 This is an area which calls for particular attention since the
construction and disposition of stairways play a vital part in
achieving the desired aims of smooth and unimpeded egress for
spectators under all conditions set out in paragraph 6. The aim
should be to provide stairways which limit hazards to the minimum
by such features as uniform going, secure footing, not too steep a
gradient, and a width sufficient to allow free movement but narrow
enough to provide everyone with access to a handrail. The head of
the stairway should be so designed that flow is uniform across its
width and crowd pressures cannot easily be generated. In addition
flights should not provide long, unrestricted paths down which crowd
pressures and surges can be created. Adequate separation between
channels in multi-channel stairway arrangements should be provided
so that there is no overspill from one channel to another.

9.2 Stairways should be carefully positioned to take advantage of
natural lighting and ventilation. Where the natural lighting is
deficient the stairway should be adequately lit by artificial light.

9.3 Construction of stairw ay s
9.3.1 The width, rise and ‘going’ of the steps should be uniform on
any stairway.

9.3.2 Stair treads should be provided with non-slip surfaces and
durable edgings. Adequate drainage should be provided.

9.3.3 Open risers should not be used.

9.3.4 On any stairway the preferred going of treads should be
305 mm but not less than 280 mm and the preferred height of risers
should be 150 mm but not more than 190 mm.

9.3.5 Stairways should be without winders, should be in flights of
not more than 16 or fewer than 3 steps, should have not more than
two successive flights without a turn, and, if there are more than
12 steps in a flight, should have not more than one flight without
a turn. The going of the landing between flights should be not less
than the width of the section or channel of the flight.

9.3.6 Every person on a stairway should have access to a handrail.
Accordingly the minimum width of a stairway should be 1*1 metres,
stairways wider than 1*8 metres being divided as far as possible
into channels having a width of between 1*1 metres and 1-8 metres.
The strength of the handrails (including supports) used to divide
a stairway into channels should be as described in paragraph 13.
9.3.7 Handrails projecting not more than 100 mm should be
provided on both sides of all stairways, steps and landings at a height
of not less than 840 mm, measured vertically from the centre of
the step, or the surface of the landing.

9.3.8 Protection should be provided on both sides of all stairs
and landings. Where next to open wells, or spaces, such protection
should be enclosed and should be not less than 1*1 metres in height
measured vertically from the centre of the step, or the surface of
the landing. The protection should have a strength equivalent to
that of the crush barriers of the weaker type, described in para­
graph 13.

9.4 A ccess to stairw ay s
9.4.1 To ensure a free flow of spectators the access to the head of
stairways should be controlled along the following lines:

9.4.2 Where a stairway is divided into channels the access should be
designed to secure a uniform flow down each channel.

9.4.3 The approach to the head of the stairs should be level, and
should be so arranged that the spectators converge on the stairway
from the front and/or the sides only. There should be no approach
from behind, involving movement around the ends of the balustrades
or side walls of the stairway, except where this approach is already
controlled by physical means such as by the gangways in the seated
areas of stands.

9.4.4 The extent of the approach in the direction of the stairway
should not be less than 1*1 metres and preferably not more than
3 metres.

9.4.5 Where restrictive elements such as barriers or gateways are
installed in the approach to a stairway in order to meet the fore­
going provisions, the total width of the passage formed by these
elements should be not more than two-thirds the minimum width of
the stairway.

9.4.6 For an application of these principles to a multiple stairway
leading direct from a terrace, see Appendix B Figure 2.
9.5 Discharge from stairw ay s
All exit stairways should discharge either:
a. at ground level and lead directly to a place of safety in the open
   air; or
b. on to walk ways or concourses of adequate dimensions at any
   level provided these also lead directly to a place of safety in the
   open air.

9.6 Fire protection fo r stairw ay s
9.6.1 The surface finish of walls and ceilings of all escape stairways
should be of a standard corresponding to Class “O” (as defined in
Regulation E.15 of the Building Regulations for England and
Wales 1972, as amended by the Building (First Amendment)
Regulations 1973, and of the Building Standards (Scotland) Regu­
lations 1971-73).

9.6.2 Where a stairway passes through a stand it should be in a
fire-resisting enclosure separated from the remainder of the stand
by a structure having afire resistance of not less than one hour. Such
stairways should discharge via a protected route of the same
standard to a place of safety in the open air.

9.6.3 Any door forming part of the enclosure to a stairway should
be self-closing on to 25 mm rebates and have a fire resistance
of not less than half an hour.

9.7 Ramps
9.7.1 The gradient should preferably be constant and not broken by
steps.

9.7.2 The shallower the gradient the better. The maximum gradient
acceptable will depend on the particular ramp’s length purpose
and usage but a ramp subject to heavy crowd flow should preferably
not exceed a gradient of 1 in 10.


10 FIRE PRECAUTIONS
10.1 New structures will conform to current Building Regulations
and therefore have a reasonable degree of structural fire protection.
10.2 Existing structures vary considerably in age and the materials
used in construction. The qualities of combustibility and fire
resistance have an important effect on the standard of fire precau­
tions required to ensure reasonable safety. It may be difficult
in many cases to improve the fire resistance of a structure to any
significant extent but this should be done wherever practicable.
Where it is not possible to bring about such improvements, it may
be possible to achieve an acceptable solution by the provision
of other safeguards such as sprinklers and/or automatic detection.


10.3 Fire w arning sy stem
10.3.1 All buildings in the ground to which public or staff have
access should be provided with a fire warning system to alert the
staff in case of fire. In major grounds it would be an advantage
if an indication of the warning and preferably its location could be
given in the central control point, (see paragraph 17.2).

10.3.2 The central control and other selected positions where
necessary should be provided with suitable facilities for calling the
fire brigade and other emergency services.


10.4 Emergency lighting
10.4.1 For use in the event of failure of the general lighting,
emergency lighting should be provided in all parts of the premises
accessible to the public and along all exit routes, with the exit signs
clearly illuminated. Preferably, this system should be completely
separate from the general lighting system, although a one-circuit
system incorporating staggered sub-circuits would be an acceptable
alternative. Otherwise than in the exceptional case where two
entirely independent supplies can be obtained from outside sources,
the emergency circuit should be connected to a source of power
located on the premises, e.g. storage batteries or a diesel generator,
with a delay of not more than 10 seconds.

10.4.2 The system should be capable of maintaining the necessary
level of illumination for a period of 3 hours from the time of
failure of the normal supply.

10.4.3 The emergency lighting should operate automatically on the
failure of the main lighting.
10.5 Fire fighting equipm ent
10.5.1 In major grounds it may be necessary to provide a suitable
water supply for fire fighting in the form of statutory or private
fire hydrants.

10.5.2 For first aid fire fighting by members of the staff hydraulic
hose reels should preferably be provided. These should be sufficient
to provide adequate protection to the whole floor area, and should
be installed in suitable positions by entrances, exits and stairways.

10.5.3 Where hose reels are not provided portable fire extinguishers
should be installed in sufficient numbers to give adequate cover.
The number and type will depend upon the size, layout, fire separation
and risk in each building. Fire extinguishers should conform to
the appropriate British Standard specification and be maintained
in good working order.

10.5.4 Where high fire risk areas such as large storerooms and
enclosed or underground car parks are situated under stands
consideration should be given to the installation of an automatic
fire extinguishing system such as sprinklers, or, alternatively, an
automatic detection system.

10.5.5 Advice should be sought from the local fire authority on
the type, ampunt and siting of fire fighting equipment required.

10.6 Housekeeping
One of the potential causes of fire in football grounds arises from
the accumulation of waste paper, programmes, packets and other
combustible materials which are dropped by spectators. As stated
in paragraph 8.11 this can present a particular problem in stands.
Every effort should be made to reduce this hazard. All parts of
buildings should be inspected before and after every event and
accumulations of combustible waste cleared as quickly as practicable
or stored in a safe place pending clearance.

10.7 Emergency procedure and s ta f f training
10.7.1 It is essential that plans should be made for dealing with
emergency situations. Joint consultation between the management
of the ground, police, fire, ambulance and other emergency services
should be held in order to produce agreed plans of action.
10.7.2 While the public are in the ground an adequate number of
staff should be maintained to cover entrances, exits and other
strategic points.
10.7.3 All such staff should be trained in the use of the fire fighting
equipment provided and in the action to be taken in the event of
a fire.

11 ACCESS FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES
11.1 Adequate roads for emergency vehicles such as fire appliances
and ambulances should be provided so that speedy and direct access
can be obtained to all buildings within the ground. Wherever
possible, these access routes should be separate from those used by
spectators entering and leaving the ground.
11.2 The local fire authority should be consulted about the width,
clearance height and supporting strength required of access roads.
11.3 Wherever possible access roads should provide for the parking
of emergency vehicles so that exit routes used by crowds are not
seriously obstructed.

12 SPACING OF CRUSH BARRIERS
12.1 The location and spacing of crush barriers will be major
factors in the safety of spectators on a terrace. Column A in the
following tables provides the maximum distances between barriers
conforming to the greater strength requirements of crush barriers
in paragraph 13. Column B provides the maximum distances
between barriers conforming to the lesser strength requirements
of crush barriers in paragraph 13. Interpolation may be made
between these figures.
12.2 A distinction is made between barrier intervals required in
(i) ‘peak viewing areas’; and
(ii) ‘other viewing areas’.
The term ‘peak viewing areas’ describes the most popular parts of
the terraces where there is a tendency for spectators to crowd
together and become so emotionally involved in the occasion that
their reactions can cause additional pressures to be set up in those
sections of the ground. The peak viewing areas are typically behind
the goal areas, although other parts of the terraces known locally
may come within this category.

13 STRENGTH OF CRUSH BARRIERS AND HANDRAILS


13.1 Existing barriers and handrails
Existing crush barriers and handrails should be capable of resisting
the forces indicated in the ‘existing test load’ column below when
applied in a test as described in Appendix C. Where existing crush
barriers and handrails fail to meet these test conditions, they should
be replaced or strengthened in such a way as to do so. Barriers
and handrails so strengthened should be retested in accordance with
Appendix C.


13.2 New barriers and handrails
All new crush barriers or handrails should be designed to resist
safely a horizontal force as indicated in the ‘new design force’
column below, applied as a static load acting on the top rail of the
barrier or handrail at right angles to the longitudinal axis. The
foundations of new barriers or handrails should be designed to
resist the overturning moments and sliding forces, induced by the
forces described in the ‘new design force’ column below, with a
factor of safety of 2.

                                                                             19

14 TERRACE TO TOUCH-LINE DISTANCES
The minimum recommended distance from terrace to touchline
or goal line is 3 metres where the terrace gradient is 30° or steeper.
Where the gradient is shallower it may be advisable to increase
this distance so as to enable spectators to obtain a clear view.


15 ESTIMATION OF SAFE GROUND CAPACITY
15.1 The foregoing sections of the code recommend guidelines for
individual features of a ground in isolation. This section suggests
a method of calculating the number of people that can be safely
accomodated when taking into account interactions between these
individual features and when there are deviations from the guide­
lines. To facilitate the calculations, a plan of the ground should
be available with such details as exits, stands, terraces, stairways,
passages, kiosks, seats and barriers. A scale of 1:200 would be
convenient for this purpose.

15.2 The method assesses:
a. the holding capacity of a terrace (that of a stand being determined
   by the number of seats when the stand conforms to the guide­
   lines) ; and
b. the capacity of a given exit route from a terrace or stand.
15.3 The number of people that can be safely accommodated on a
terrace, however, is either its holding capacity or the capacity of
the exit system from it (assessed in accordance with paragraph 15.5)
whichever is the smaller.

15.4 Terraces and viewing slopes
15.4.1 The capacity of a terrace or viewing slope should be assessed
from the area available for standing (that area of the terrace or
viewing slope from which the whole of the playing area can be seen,
excluding gangways) by allowing a packing density of between
54 and 27 persons per 10 square metres, depending on the condition
of the terrace or slope. For this purpose the extreme allowances
are:
a. 54 persons per 10 square metres when the terrace or viewing
   slope is in good condition (as defined in paragraph 7); and
b. 27 persons per 10 square metres when it materially deviates from
   the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible
   hazard to individuals closely packed.
It may be necessary to interpolate between these figures where
conditions fall between the two extremes.
When the positioning and width of gangways do not meet with the
recommendations of paragraph 7.5.1, an appropriate reduction
should be made in the area available for standing.

15.4.2 When crush barriers conform to the recommended guidelines
on spacing (see paragraph 12) the capacity of the terrace is calculated
by multiplying the area available for standing by the appropriate
packing density. The following formula may be used:
                                            A
           Capacity (number of persons)=—X27 or 54

Where A is the area available for standing in square metres.

15.4.3 When the spacing of crush barriers does not conform to the
guidelines, the capacity is calculated from the provision of crush
barriers in the area available for standing (as defined in paragraph
15.4.1) as follows:
a. Where a terrace contains either ‘peak viewing areas’ (*) only or
   ‘other viewing areas’ (*) only -j- by multiplying the total length
   of crush barriers by the appropriate distance between barriers
* See paragraph 12.
   (as given in paragraph 12) or the existing distance, whichever is
   less, and multiplying by the appropriate packing density,
b. Where a terrace contains both ‘peak viewing areas’ and ‘other
   viewing areas’ — by multiplying the total length of barriers by
   the appropriate distance between barriers in a ‘peak viewing area’
   or the existing distance, whichever is less, and multiplying by the
   appropriate packing density.
15.4.4 Crush barriers which do not meet the guidelines on strength
set out in paragraph 13, should be ignored for the purpose of these
calculations.

15.5 Exit sy stem s
15.5.1 General considerations to be taken into account when
assessing the adequacy of exit systems are set out in paragraph 6.
15.5.2 The capacity of an exit system can be obtained by assessing
for each element in the system (ie each gangway, doorway, stairway
etc) the number of persons that can pass in 8 minutes or, in the
circumstances indicated in paragraph 8.3(b), in 2-5 minutes. This
calculation is made by multiplying the width of the element by the
appropriate flow rate in paragraph 16.
15.5.3 Where an element in an exit system is less than 1*1 metres
wide, that element should be omitted from the calculation.
15.5.4 Flow-restricting elements of the kind described in paragraph
9.4.5 should be ignored for the purposes of these calculations
(see Appendix B Figure 2).


16 RECOMMENDED FLOW RATES
16.1 From the stands a flow rate of 40 persons per minute per unit
of exit width, ie 550 mm, should be used.
16.2 From the terraces and the ground generally a flow rate of
60 persons per minute per unit of exit width, ie 550 mm, should
be used.

17 COMMUNICATIONS
17.1 Precise requirements for communications within a particular
ground should be determined after consulations with the police.
The following are examples of the arrangements likely to be needed
at large grounds.

17.2 A central control point, preferably a room, should be set
aside for the use of the supervising police officer and the club
safety officer.

17.3 There should be intercommunication between the central
control and all turnstiles or banks of turnstiles, and all entry and
exit gates used by the public.

17.4 Metering systems to record all admissions should be installed
at turnstiles and, so as to ensure that ground capacities are not
exceeded in any section, arrangements should be made for central
control to be informed immediately a predetermined number of
spectators has been admitted through each turnstile.

17.5 Public address equipment should be installed so that broad­
cast messages can be heard under reasonable conditions by all
persons of normal hearing in any part of the ground to which the
public has access. Preferably, the system should be capable of
being controlled from the central control point. The power supply
to the system should be such as to enable it to continue to operate
in an emergency such as a fire, or a failure of the mains supply.

17.6 Loud hailers should be available for the use of stewards
and police in directing or instructing spectators.

17.7 Any police radio facilities available for the maintenance
of law and order should augment and not supersede the club
communications system.

17.8 Consideration should be given to the need for a special room
where persons detained by the police may be taken to have their
particulars recorded.


18 RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKING
   PARTY ON CROWD BEHAVIOUR
18.1 Crowd movement on terraces should be severely limited in
order to give the police the fullest opportunity for crowd control.
Less problems occur where the terraces are divided as far as possible
into sections by the use of railings or barriers, both radial and
lateral. Ideally, each section should be self-contained and should
be serviced by its own entrance/exits, refreshment facilities and
toilets, (see paragraph 7.6).

18.2 ‘Home’ and visiting supporters should be segregated. It
should not be possible for spectators to transfer from one end of the
ground to tbe other.

 18.3 Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as possible
in normal circumstances while, at the same time, providing the
police with proper access to the terraces for the purposes of crowd
control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event of serious
emergency. One alternative to fencing is the construction around
the pitch of a wall with a smooth surface which should be not less
than 4 feet in height on the terrace side. This boundary wall should
have gates or access points to the pitch which could be manned
by the police or stewards. A walkway between the boundary wall
and the terraces, which would be solely occupied by police, first
aid and official club personnel, has been found to be effective as
regards safety and security. In order to achieve this, it might be
necessary to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect
the walkway from the terrace by a continuous line of barriers, so
designed as to discourage access to the walkway except at authorised
points. The access points from terrace to walkway should be
reasonably near the access points from walkway to the pitch, (see
paragraph 7.9). Where a walkway system is in use, sliding gates
may be installed at the access points from the walkway to the pitch,
ie where there can be no crowd pressure against them, (see paragraph
6.14.2 regarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the
pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level of the playing
area.

18.4 Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be served in
plastic containers.

18.5 Home clubs should consider, in conjunction with the police,
each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club. So far as the
terraces are concerned, any allocation should have regard to the
manner in which the terraces are divided so that policing arrange­
ments can be effective.

18.6 The home club should, as a general rule, make it their policy
not to issue tickets for announced all-ticket matches to away
supporters on the day of the game. However, the local police
will be best able to assess the situation and their advice should be
followed, but it is important wherever possible to discourage
supporters from travelling to all-ticket matches without tickets.

Appendix C



TESTING OF CRUSH BARRIERS AND HANDRAILS
1. For crush barriers the test is to consist of the application of an
   evenly distributed force of either 6-0 KN/metre width (400 lbs
   f/foot width) or 4*3 KN/metre width (290 lbs f/foot width) of
   barrier as mentioned in paragraph 13.

2. For handrails the test is to consist of the application of an evenly
   distributed force of either 4-3 KN/metre width (290 lbs f/foot
   width) or 2*74 KN/metre width (188 lbs f/foot width) of handrail
   as mentioned in paragraph 13.

3. The force is to be in the form of a static load acting on the top
   rail of the barrier or handrail at right angles to the longitudinal
   axis and applied in about ten equal increments.

4. The force to be applied for three consecutive periods, the full
   force being maintained for 5 minutes each period. The interval
   between applications to be as short as possible, ie to enable
   complete unloading and reloading only. A record should be
   kept of any deformation during the loading periods, during the
   periods of maintained loading, or during the recovery period.

5. If on the removal of the force for the third time the recovery of
   deformation is at least 75 % the barrier or handrail may be deemed
   to have satisfied the loading requirements.
   If this requirement is not met but the recovery is more than 50 %
   then the test should be repeated and if on retest the recovery is
   at least 75% the barrier or handrail may be deemed to have
   satisfied the loading requirements.
   If the recovery is less than 50 % on the first test or less than 75 %
   on the retest, the barrier or handrail shall be deemed to have
   failed to meet the loading requirements.
6. If during any test, even though the barrier or handrail satisfies
   the above loading requirements, doubt should arise for any
   reason (including such matters as cracking of the terracing or
   distortion of connections) as to the safety of the barrier or
   handrail, a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless
   the results of this investigation remove the doubt as to the safety
   of the barrier or handrail, the barrier or handrail, as the case
   may be, should be deemed to have failed the test.

7. A record should be kept of all the barriers and handrails tested
   and of their performances during the tests.

18 .    Recorr.r.on^.r-tions of tho 'orldnr Pnrtv on Cror:d Pnl'.nvi.o^r

18.1    Crowd ir.overscnt on terraces should be severely limited in
        order to give the Police the fullest opportunity for crowd
        control. Less pro'llc^r occur whore the tcrracss arc
        divided as f.*>r as possible into sections by the use of*
        railings or bnrriers, :oth radial and lateral. Ideally,
        each section should be self-contained and should be
        serviced by its own er.rrance/cxits, refreshment facilities
        and toilets, (see para. 7*7*)

18.2    "Home" and visiting supporters should be segregated. It
        should not be possible for spectators to transfer froa one
        end of the ground to the other*

18.3    Access to playing pitches jrnst be cade as‘difficult as
        possible in normal cim^stances while,- at the same ti:ae,
        providing the Police with proper access to the terraces for
        the purposes of crowd control and enabling the pitch to be
        used in the event of serious emergency. One alternative
        to fencing ia the construction around the pitch of a wall
        with a smooth surface vhich should be not less than 4 fsst
        in height on the terrace sido. Thi3 boundary wall should
        have gates or access pcir.tc to the pitch which could be
        manned by the Police cr stewards. A walkway between the
        boundary wall and the tsrraces, which would be solely
        occupied by Police, First Aid and official club personnel,
        lias bean foimd to be effective as regards safety and
        security. In order to achieve this, it Might be necessary
        to remove one or i'.vo r:?:s of terracing and to protest the
        walkway frosj the torrr:2 by c. continuous lino of barriers,
        g o designed as to disc:urago access to the walkway excopt
        at authorised points. Tr.o access points froa terrace to
        walkway should bo reas-tnably near the access points fron
        walkway to the pitch, (see para 7*10). iYhcre a walkway
        system is in use, slidir.f gati-s tf.?y be installed at tho
        access pointa froa ths walkway to the pitch, ie where there
        coil be no crowd press*— 2 arrainst then. («ee para 6.14 *2
        regarding use of slidiag cater, elsewhere). A barrier to
        the .pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level
        of tho playing aroa.

     North Stand Roof - The Secretary reported the seepage of water on to
     the seats in the Stand, and thereby making 200/300 seats unusable on
     a wet day. Our own staff were trying to effect some repairs, but it
     was essential that top priority be given to making a one-hundred
     per cent repair.

     Fencing - The Secretary reported various firms were quoting for

*    fencing in front of Spion Kop and Leppings Lane end.

     Spion Kop Wall - This had now been repaired, thanks to Mr. K.T. Addy.

     Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 - Mr. C. Woodward reported on the
     Act in relation to perimeter fencing and the necessity of having a
     fence if we wanted to be considered for Semi-Finals etc. The
     Secretary then reported on an informal meeting he had with Mr. Fox
     of the South Yorkshire County Council. At the present time we
     are not a designated club, and therefore do not have to apply for
     a Safety Certificate. However, if we thought anything could be
     gained by calling on the Council to advise on'what might be under­
     taken at the moment in readiness for application for a Safety
     Certificate, they would be happy,to help if requested.
     When a certificate is applied for, plans of seating areas apH
     standing areas will be required and costs could be £7,000/£8,000,
     and the Safety Certificate *could cost £1,000.

    of                         Sheffield                      will say as follows:-




    INTRODUCTION



    1.    I am 65 years old.          I am Chairman of Eastwood & Partners

    (Consulting Engineers)       which I founded in 1972.                The firm has

    offices in Sheffield and London.               I taught at the University of

    Sheffield    from 1954-1970 as a Senior Lecturer and then became

    Professor and Head of the Department of Civil                      and Structural

    Engineering.        I worked as Managing Partner for Husband & Co,

    Consulting Engineers,      from 1970 to 1972.             I am a past President

    of   the   Chartered Institution of Structural                Engineers,         a past
J
    Chairman of the Council          of Engineering Institutions,                and past

    Chairman    of   the   Commonwealth       Engineers'        Council.         I   am    an

    Honorary Doctor of Engineering in the University of Sheffield.

     Eastwood & Partners       is    an unlimited Company which has                   about

    ninety     technical    staff,    including         seven    Directors       and      six

    Associates with a total staff of just over 100.

3.      This statement is intended to be read in conjunction with

a    bundle      of    copy     documents         extracted       from the          Firm' s     files

which         accompanies this             statement.            When     referring            to    an

individual        document,          I shall      add the relevant page number in

the bundle.



4.      I       have     been involved         with         football      stadia          including

Hillsborough             for        many    years.          My        first       contact       with

Hillsborough           was     in    the   late     1950's       whilst       I    was    a    Senior

Lecturer        at     Sheffield       University.          I    advised          them    on    minor

matters.         My major involvement with football stadia came when I

joined          Husband       & Co    as    Managing        Partner.          That       firm       were

Consulting            Engineers       to    the     Club,       Sheffield          United       F. C. ,

Southampton F.C., Nottingham Forest F.C. , Swindon Town F. C. and
Rotherham United F. C.                   Whilst at Husband & Co I took particular

responsibility               for   their      work    at     these     grounds     and    I   was

involved in the construction of new stands at both Nottingham

Forest F.C.           and Swindon Town F. C.            During this period there was

the disaster at Ibrox Park.                    In the aftermath of this disaster,

I was    involved in liaison with the Police concerning capacity

of    football         stadia.           Handrails     and    crush     barriers     were     the

subject          of   much    discussion and I designed                 equipment to test

crush barriers which was used at the stadia of the six football

clubs mentioned above.



5.      It must be remembered that all this took place before the

1975 Act and the               1976 Guide.           Both the    1975 Act and the 1976

Guide were a product of the "Wheatley Commission" of 1972 which

was    set       up to examine the safety of sports                      grounds    following

the Ibrox disaster.                 Sir Walter Winterbottom,             former Manager of

the    England        Football       Team,     chaired a working party to advise

the Wheatley Commission.                      That working party spent a day with

me discussing safety at football stadia.



6.      Eastwood & Partners                 are retained as Consulting Engineers

to     the        Club,       S h eff iel d     United       F. C. ,    Sunderland         F. C. ,
             <



Chesterfield           F. C.,      and    Rotherham United F. C.            The     firm also

does    occasional work for Hull Rugby League F. C. , the Sheffield

Sports       Stadium which           has      Greyhound      Racing,     Rugby     League     and

until    this         season       had    Speedway     and    also the     County        Cricket

Ground at Scarborough.
7.      I     am    a       very interested football                supporter        and have        two

seats in the south stand at Hillsborough very close to the West

Terrace.                I    attend ' matches            frequently,        usually          with     my

grandson, who is now aged 12.                           He has been attending matches at

Hillsborough with either me or his father since he was aged 8

and     I    have       never       had    occasion      to   feel       that   we    were    in the

slightest           physical         danger,       or    that      the    Police      were    in     any

difficulty.                 The most recent fairly large crowd prior to the

F. A.       Cup Semi-Final            on 15th April           1989 was the match between

the     Club       and Liverpool on 14th January 1989.                            I attended the

match that day and the Liverpool fans were in the West Terrace.

I pass the Leppings Lane end turnstiles every time I enter the

ground.

it appears likely that testing of crush barriers will of necessity take place on a
separate occasion.

 HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 7/1986

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT 1985

 Introduction

 1. HOC 5^/85 a n d -5/1986 were copied to Chief Executives of
 Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs in view of the
 forthcoming transfer to them of responsibility in the Metropolitan
 counties and Greater London for the administration of the Safety of
 Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA). The purpose of this circular is tc
 advise successor authorities of the changes to the SSGA brought
 about by the Local Government Act 1985 (LGA) and to give guidance
 on discharging these responsibilities. It is not intended to affee
 any internal or locally agreed arrangements which may be in train t
 ensure that all those who have an interest in securing safety at
 sports grounds are fully consulted.

 SSGA 1975

 2. The SSGA gave effect to the main recommendations contained in
 the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds whicr
 was prepared by Lord Wheatley following the serious accident a z
 Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971.

  3.         The main provisions of the Act are:

             a. A power, exercisable by the Secretary of State, to
             designate sports stadia with a capacity for more than
             10,000 spectators. Once designated, a stadium will require
             a safety certificate from the local authority.

             b. An obligation on the local authority to issue such
             certificates.
         c. A discretion for the local authority to set terms
         and conditions under the certificate with the object
         of securing a reasonable degree of safety for spectators.
         Safety certificates are of 2 kinds -firstly, the general
         safety certificate (the main form of control) and,
         secondly, the special safety certificate (for occasions
         or activities not covered by the general certificate).

         d. A right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in
         relation to the issue of safety certificates and their
         contents, the procedure for which is set out in
         regulations made under s.6(1) of the Act.

         e. Rights of various interested bodies (police, building
         authorities or, in the Metropolitan county areas after
         "abolition", fire authorities) to consultation, access to
         grounds and information and to the appeals procedure.

         f. An emergency procedure for                  restricting the admission
         of spectators to a wider range                 of sports grounds than
         those to which the designation                 provisions apply, if the
         risk to spectators is seen (by                 the courts) as justifying
         this.

         g. Powers of entry and inspection to sports grounds;
         and prescribed penalties for offences under the Act.

A sports ground is, broadly -speaking, any place where sports or
other competitive activities take'place in the open air and where
accommodation has been provided for spectators. A sports stadium is
a sports ground where   accommodation forspectators wholly or
substantially surrounds the area used for the activities taking
place therein.

LGA   1985
4. The combined effect of s. 16 and Schedule 8 paragraph 7 of the
LGA is to transfer to Metropolitan District Councils and London
Boroughs the functions, duties and powers as the local authority
responsible for administering the SSGA in place of the Metropolitan
County Councils and Greater London Council. A summary check list of
these responsibilities is contained at Annex A for ease of reference

5. Paragraph 7(3) of               Schedule 8 of the LGA redefines "local
authority" in England              and Wales for the purposes of the SSGA as
meaning:

          a. in Greater London, the London Borough Council or
          the Common Council of the City of London;

          b.      in England, in the Metropolitan counties,                     the
          d i s t r i c t council;

          c.      in England outside Greater London and the
          M e t r o p o l i t a n counties, or in Wales, the county council

6.      In order to avoid any anomaly or duplication a r i s i n g out of the
M e t r o p o l i t a n D i s t r i c t C o u n c i l s ’ and London B o r o u g h s ’ responsibilitie
as "Building Authority”, paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 8 of the LGA
redefines, for the purposes of the SSGA, "building authority" in
England and Wales as meaning:

       a.    in England, outside Greater London, and the
       M e t r o p o l i t a n counties,   or in Wales, the district
       council.

The «ffect of this, together with amendments to Sections 3(3), ^(7)
and (8), 5(5), 10(4) and 11 of the SSGA resulting from paragraph 7(1)
of Schedule 8 of the LGA, is that in Metropolitan counties and
Greater London, where the "building authority" and "local authority"
are synonymous, the local authority is not required to refer safety
certificate applications to the building authority or consult it
about the terms and conditions of a certificate. Similarly the
building authority in these areas does not have the status of
"interested party" and has no need of the right to authorise entry
and inspection of a sports ground because these powers are vested in
it as the local authority.

7. An additional change brought about by paragraph 7(1) affects the
role and status of the Fire Authority in Greater London and the    ’
Metropolitan counties. The converse of paragraph 6 applies in
respect of the Fire Authority which, from 1 April 1986, has the status
of "interested party" in Metropolitan counties and Greater London.
In these areas the local authority is required to refer safety
certificate applications to the Fire Authority and consult it about
the terms and conditions of a safety certificate; and the Fire
Authority will have the right to authorise entry and inspection of
a sports ground.  The reason for these changes is that the newly
constituted fire authorities will not (as in the past) be the same
as the local authority.

Transitional     Arrangements

8. Under article 2 of the Local Government Reorganisation (Transitior
Provisions) Order 1985 (SI 1985 No 1781), London Borough Councils and
Metropolitan District Councils will acquire certain anticipatory powei
including powers in respect of safety certificates for sports grounds
The provisions of SI 1985/1781 were explained in DOE circular LGA(L)
(DOE) 13/LGA(MC)(D0E)16 of 26 November 1985. The Secretary of'State
takes the view that Metropolitan County Councils and the GLC are not
empowered to issue new safety certificates or amend existing safety
certificates to take effect on or after 1 April 1986: SI 1985/1781*
therefore allows successor authorities to consider, before 1 April,
applications for certificates to come into effect on or after 1 April.
Successor authorities will therefore wish-to ensure that they are kept
informed of the progress of safety certificate applications or amend­
ments to existing certificates now under consideration by the Metro­
politan County Councils or GLC. Much of this information will auto­
matically have come to successor authorities in their present role as
building authorities but they may nonetheless wish to establish
early contact with the current 'certificating* authority to ensure a
smooth transfer of responsibility from 1 April 1986 without impairing
the safety cover afforded by the certification process. In this
context successor authorities will no doubt wish to bear in mind
that applications for special safety certificates for events on or
after 1 April 1986 may require advance consideration if a certificate
is to be issued in time. Similarly, successor authorities will doubtle
wish to be acquainted with any other action or initiatives currently
in hand by the present certificating authority in respect of scorts
grounds in their area.
Guidance to the SSGA procedures

9. A copy of the SSGA and the Regulations (Statutory Instrument
1263 1976) are enclosed with this circular. A detailed description
of the Act and its provisions is contained at Annex B. The Regu­
lations set out the procedures and time limits associated with
safety certificate applications and appeals. These same regulations
also empower local authorities to determine fees in respect of
applications for the issue or amendment of safety certificates. A
guide to the procedure for the issue of a general safety certificate
is at Annex C. Similarly, the procedure for the issue of a special
safety certificate is at Annex D.

10. The following points are highlighted as being of particular
potential interest to local authorities:

     a. Procedure under s. 10. Paragraph 21 of Annex B refers.
     Authorities may wish to note that this procedure can be
     applied to all sports grounds within the meaning of the Act,
     not just to stadia. It is hoped that authorities will not
     feel inhibited from invoking the procedure, as necessary,
     where they perceive the risks to be such that urgent action
     is required to provide reasonable safety for spectators.

     b. The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) (The
     Green Guide). Attention is drawn to paragraphs 5 and 6 of
     Annex B and paragraph 3 of Annex C. Authorities will no
     doubt bear in mind the contents of paragraph 4 of HOC 5*1/1985
     dealing with action on the Interim Report of the Inquiry
     contains additional recommendations on the content and
     structuring of the Green Guide which will be revised as soon
     as possible. In the meantime the existing guide, a copy of
     which is enclosed, may be used until such time as the revised
     version is available.

Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds

11. The Final Report of Mr Justice Popplewell’s Committee of Inquiry
into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds was published on
16 January 1986 (Command 9710). A separate Home Office circular,
number 5/1986, was sent to local authorities - including Metropolitan
District Councils and London Borough Councils - on 20 January-1986,
giving details of the Government’s response to the safety recommend­
ations contained in the Report, and next steps.

Other

12. A list of designated stadia for England and Wales is attached at
Annex E. Management of those stadia in Metropolitan counties and
Greater London have been informed of the change in responsibility fo:
administration of the SSGA and have been advised to copy application
for special safety certificates or amendments to existing general
certificates to successor authorities (see Annex F).

 13.      T h i s c i r c u l a r is copied to Chief Executives of County Councils,
  S e c r e t a r i e s of t'he s uc c e s s o r authority c o o r d inating committees, and

  particular relevance.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Background

Wheatley Report

1.   The terms of the Inquiry extended to sports grounds generally but because the
imoediate concern at the time related to soccer grounds, its Report concentrated
on crowd safety in such grounds, and included Rugby Union and Rugby League grounds.
Lord Wheatley had no doubt, that the then existing controls over safety at
football grounds were inadequate.   He found that the voluntary system of certifi­
cation of grounds introduced by the Football Association some years previously laid
down no requirements as to the competence of persons who carried out the annual
inspections of grounds and there were no guidelines to assist those persons in
their assessment .of safety standards.   Moreover, a review of the statutory provisioi
relevant to the safety of spectators at football grounds convinced Lord Wheatley
that the law also fell short of providing proper and effective control over
football grounds as a whole.    The building regulations, for example, provide for
the basic structural safety of new buildings within a football ground but they do
                                                               not apply to existing
buildings, except where alterations are to be carried out, nor do they apply to a
ground as a whole.   In any case, most football grounds were built before national
building regulations were introduced.


2.   Lord Wheatley concluded that only a specially devised statutory scheme could
ensure comprehensive controls at football grounds in the interests of safety and he
recommended a statutory licensing system.    He proposed that these controls should
be introduced by stages, the larger or more important grounds, broadly speaking,
being dealt with first.   Lord Wheatley also recommended that there should be a
right of appeal for the clubs concerned against any decision of the licensing
authority.   The Report showed Lord Wheatley's awareness of the need to reconcile
the paramount aim of ensuring the safety of spectators with what would be reasonablt
and practicable for the clubs.


3.   Lord Wheatley also provided, as a technical appendix to his report, guidelines
to safety standards at football grounds designed to assist the local authorities
in their task of enforcement.
C o n s u l t a t i o n s on t h e R e p o r t

H.      When the Report was published, those bodies mainly concerned, including the
local authority associations and the football authorities, were consulted about
Lord Wheatley's proposals.                       The football authorities made it clear that they were
apprehensive at the financial implications for the clubs, but there was general
agreement with the proposals themselves.                       Detailed consultations were held on the
guidelines contained in the technical appendix to the Report and these, duly
amended, were finally published by the Home Departments in November 1973 as a
special booklet, "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds".                       It was revised in 1975
in the light of practical experience of its application and specifically targeted
on football grounds.


Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)

5.      The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force.                    Its primary
purpose is to set out principles or guidelines which the local authorities will
no doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.                       The Guide therefore deals
with matters such as the provision of adequate entrances and exits, means of
escape, the slope of terracing, the strength and siting of crush barriers, the
construction of staircases, and measures to ensure the safe movement of spectators
both under normal and emergency conditions.                       The Guide is not a set of requirements
to be rigidly applied, regardless of individual circumstances.                       As Lord Wheatley
recognised, it is important to maintain the maximum flexibility in any system of
control so as to take account of the differing circumstances at individual grounds:
factors such as age, size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to
ground.


6.      While the basic principles set out in the Guide are relevant to all sports
stadia, modifications may well be necessary where sports other than football are
involved.


General Approach to the Act

7.       The main instrument of control under the Act is the safety certificate issued by
the local authority.                  A safety certificate is needed in respect of every stadium
which is the subject of a designation order, made by the Secretary of State.                          The
certificate enables the local authority to impose such terms and conditions as
are necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the stadium in question.
8.    The approach to designation was based on a phased programme so that the more
important grounds regularly attracting the largest attendances were dealt with- ~
first.     The international stadia at which soccer and Rugby Union were played plus
stadia used by soccer clubs in Division 1 of the Football League were designated
in 1976.     This was followed in 1979 by designation of stadia of clubs in
Division 2 of the League and thereafter on promotion of a club to Division 2.
Following the     fire   at Bradford City FC in May 1985 all the remaining stadia
liable to designation used by clubs in Divisions 3 and 4 of the Football League,
and qualifying stadia of clubs in Division 1 and 2 of the Rugby League were
designated.


Substance of the Act

9.    The first 5 sections establish the main system of control under the Act, that
is to say, the safety certificate, issued by the local authority for the area in
which the stadium is situated, which is required for every sports stadium desig­
nated for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.


10.   Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate any sports
stadium having accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators as requiring a
safety certificate.      Safety certificates are of two kinds, general and special.
A general safety certificate is the main continuing form of control and is issued
for an indefinite period in respect of a specified activity or activities
regularly taking place at the stadium.       A special safety certificate may be issued
at the discretion of the local authority for a special event or other circumstances
not covered by the general safety certificate.        Such an event might be an evangel­
istic rally which might call for special arrangements if, for example, seating were
provided for the congregation on the playing area.        A special safety certificate
can be issued only in respect of a sports stadium for which a general safety
certificate is already in force.


11.   The contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section 2 .         The local
authority is empowered to include in the certificate such terms and conditions as
are necessary to secure, at the stadium in question, a reasonable degree of safety.
Without prejudice to this general power, the section requires certificates to conta
terms and conditions relating to major matters such as entrances and exits, means c
escape in emergency, the number, strength and situation of crush barriers, and the
maximum number of spectators who may be admitted to the stadium or any part of it.
To remove any possibility of doubt, sub-section ( 3 ) makes it clear that a c e r t i f i e s
may include a condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance a
 the maintenance of safety.
12.   An earlier Bill, introduced in 1973. limited the terms and conditions
imposed under a safety certificate to what was necessary to secure a reasonable
degree for Members of the public." There was some difficulty over this tern
because it might have excluded, for example, members of supporters' clubs.    This
particular problem was by the definition of "spectator" in section 17, that is,
any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.    On the other hand,
itseemed    right that all the peole present on the occasion of a match or other
activity for which a ground has a certificate should be taken into account for the
purpose of the safety certificate, for example, people using a squash court or
other facilities at the ground.    Accordingly, the general power of the local
authority under section 2(1) to include in a safety certificate such terms or
conditions as are necessary omits any reference to people and speaks only of
securing "reasonable safety at the stadium", (although the terms "safety", as
defined in section 17» does not include danger arising from participation in a
sport).    Certain provisions must, however, be specifically linked with spectators
(who are, after all, the people the Act is mainly designed to protect and who will
be greatly in the majority).    Thus section 2(2) requires the certificate to state
the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted.




13. ' Section 3 sets out the broad procedure to be followed when a local authority
receives an application for a safety certificate. , It requires them to determine
whether an applicant is, in their opinion, a qualified person, ie a person likely
to be In a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions imposed
in the certificate.     If so, they are then under a duty to issue a general safety
certificate to him.     In this respect, the general safety certificate is different
from the fire certificate issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971:     the latter
is issued only after necessary safety works have been completed, whilst the
safety certificate under this Act can be issued almost from the outset, and is an
instrument of continuing control.     The issue of a special safety certificate,
however, is left to the discretion of the local authority, as already explained,
because only they can judge whether it is appropriate to issue it for the special
occasion in question.


14.   In Metropolitan Counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
authority is required to send a copy of any application for a certificate to the
police and the Fire Authority, and must consult them about the terms and conditions
                                                                                    <3
to be included in the certificate.      Elsewhere a copy must be sent to, and
consultation take’place with, the police and the Building Authority.         The need
for such consultation is self-evident:        there must be close co-ordination of the
interests of the different authorities directly concerned with different aspects
of safety at football grounds.


15.      Section 4 provides for the amendment, replacement, transfer, surrender and
cancellation of safety certificates.         It is of primary importance that a local
authority should have power to amend a safety certificate where it appears
appropriate for them to do so, for example, if they find in the course of a
routine inspection that a part of a ground has become so dangerous as to demand an
immediate restriction on its use or Some other necessary safeguard.         Again, they
must have power to relax a requirement where, for example, certain improvements
have been carried out to make this possible.


16.      Section 5 provides for appeals by interested parties against decisions or
requirements of the local authority in connection with safety certificates.         Appeals
lie to.the Secretary of State, who has power to set up a formal inquiry.


17   .   Section 6(2) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to
the safety of spectators at sports grounds.         This is in the nature of a reserve
power which could be used, for example, to give backing to requirements of the
local authorities which in the light of experience had been shown to be essential.
This section also empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations for various
other purposes .connected with the Act.        To date no regulations have been cade
under this sub-section.


18.      Section 7 provides for some supplementary matters on determinations and
appeals. Sub-sections (1) and (2) provide for the deemed withdrawal of an applica­
tion for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate when a local authority
determines that a person is not, or has ceased to be, qualified to hold it.             The
section also provides for the suspension of a condition in a certificate pending
determination of an appeal against the inclusion of that condition, although a
court, on the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition
remain in force pending the determination of the appeal.




                                         v
19.    The holder of a general safety certificate is required by section 8 to
notify the local authority of any proposed alteration or extension of a stadium.
The purpose of the clause is to guard against any alterations being made, without
the local authority’s knowledge, which might affect the safety of spectators.
                                ,     t




20.    Section 9 provides for the harmonisation of the Act with other legislation
which may affect sports stadia.


21.    Section 10 is an important power which authorities should not feel inhibited
from using where the danger to spectators are such that use of the ground, or part
of it, should be prohibited or restricted.      Should a magistrates’ court, on the
application of a local authority, consider that the risk to spectators at any
sports ground is so great that their admission should be prohibited or restricted
until remedial action has been taken, the court may make an order accordingly.
This power applies to any sports stadium or ground, whether or not it is designated
as requiring a safety certificate. - Where a general or special safety certificate
is in force, local authorities may prefer to remedy an unsatisfactory situation
by amending the certificate, in cases where there is sufficient time to do so.
In respect of sports grounds and the smaller stadia, consultations between the
local authority and the club would usually be expected to secure, on a voluntary
basis, a reasonable standard of safety; however, where management appears to be
unwilling to undertake the necessary measures' or is slow to act on advice, this
additional power can be used.


22.    Section 11 confers rights of entry and inspection on persons appointed by the
local authority and others involved in the task of ensuring crowd safety at sports
grounds.    Section 12 deals with offences and penalties.


2 3*   Section 13 deals mainly with civil liability.    Its purpose is to make clear
that while nothing in the Act itself confers a right of action in respect of a
contravention of regulations or of conditions in a safety certificate, the existing
rights of a spectator injured at a football stadium to bring an action for negli­
gence against the occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.


24.    The Secretary of State is empowered by section 15 to extend to classes of
sports grounds other than sports stadia such provisions of the Act as are not
already expressed to apply to them.       For example, it enables the Secretary of
State by order to extend the safety certificate procedure to such places as
race-couraes.   Only a class of sports ground may be the subject of an extension
order under this clause:   an Individual sports ground (other than a atadiujn)
cannot be deaignated until section 1 of the Act haa been applied by an order
under section 15 to the claaa of sports ground to   whichitbelonga.    Todate,
the powera under thla section have not been used.


25.   Section 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications, to the
Crown.   Section 17 deals with interpretation.


26.   Section 18 provides that orders and regulations, exceptcommencement   orders,
made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution procedure.    It also
imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, before making any orders or regulations,
except commencement orders or orders relating to the Isles of Scilly, to consult
with such persons as appear to him requisite.
                                                                             ANNEX C


SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The-Safftty of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 provide that any application
for a safety certificate shall be made in the fora contained in the Schedule to
the Regulations or a form to the like effect.               An application should be accompanied
by detailed information as to the structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, includ­
ing plans of the stadium, certificates relating to the testing of crush barriers
and evidence of the applicant's status.               It is, however, open to a local authority,
under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice in writing, such further
information of this kind as it may consider necessary to enable it to determine
the terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.


2.    On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local
authority must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a
person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and con­
ditions to be imposed in the certificate.               If it considers him to be such a person
the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.
In the case of a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not
paramount, the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.
In any event, it seems prima facie unlikely that an application for a general
safety certificate would be made by an unqualified person.                 There is, however, a
right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is
not a qualified person (see paragraph 10).


3.    In Metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
authority is required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of any appli­
cation for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chief
Officer of Police and the fire authority, and must consult them about the terms
 and conditions to be included in the certificate.                Elsewhere in England and Wales
 the local authority must send a copy to and consult with the Chief O.fficer of
 Perilca~and-the--bui-lding >-au.th©r!iJty.       Ia^.Cracain.&-such-canditi ons, local autnorities
 will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines set out in the
 Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.               In this connection local authorities are
 reminded that, this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be
 rigidly applied regardless of individual circumstances.                The maximum flexibility
 should be maintained to take account of the different circumstances of individual
 grounds deriving from differences in such matters as age, size and mode of con­
 struction.     In this regard, it should also be noted that the Act provides that the



                                                                                               o
                                              i
terms and conditions should be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reason­
able safety" and it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek
the absolute safety of everyone attending the sports stadium.                         f


4.   It Is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the
local authority and the stadium representatives in the process of drawing up the
certificate conditions.     In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is
rarely filled to capacity, the local authority may consider it proper to base its
requirements on actual levels of attendance over a given period rather than on
maximum capacity.    On the rare occasions on which a capacity crowd could be
expected, separate provision might be made for this contingency on the lines
indicated in paragraph 7 below.     Again, if a stand were found to be structurally
weak, the local authority might, in consultation with the stadium representatives,
offer the choice of having any necessary remedial works carried out or of restrict­
ing admission to the stand until it had been strengthened.


5.   As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content of a
safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the indivi­
dual case.    Accordingly, a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate.
                                          t
It must however contain full details'of the terms and conditions imposed including,
in particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and have annexed
to it a plan of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be
framed.    The certificate when first issued may contain restrictive conditions which
can then be relaxed or deleted by amendment of the certificate.     The local
authority may find it convenient to list, in a covering letter to the certificate,
such modifications as will be subsequently permitted, eg in the.form of a state­
ment of the increased spectator capacities    to be allowed for the separate sections
of the ground when the various stages of any future .works programme
agreed with the stadium authorities are'completed.     This arrangement, by
•excluding'from "the certificate itself proposed conditions which would
aDplY. only..to .future works, should serve to obviate confusion.   At the same tine,
however, care must be taken not to exclude from the certificate any restriction
germane to current conditions, since section 5(3) of the Act provides for an
interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State against the inclusion of
anything     in, or the omission of anything from, a safety certificate, and these
rights must not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of the form of the
certificate.
6.   As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the
Act provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different
activities.    Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a foot­
ball ground, in cases where it is also used from time to time to stage other
events it would be desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special
safety certificates, if the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were
to be included in the general certificate.    It is suggested that any such events
for which it is considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided into
2 classes:-


     1.   those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
     stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;


     2.   those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
     concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being given
     over to    spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and conditions
     will have to be devised.    It is not, of course, necessary to provide for
     these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen by the stadium
     authorities.


7.   There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable
to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a
special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected u> attract signi­
ficantly more than the usual attendance.     In the case especially of cup re plays
these special events may arise with only a few days' notice, within which it wculc
not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate tc
the grant of a special safety certificate.     In order to overcome this difficulty,
it would seem desirable for the local authorities and stadium authorities to seek
to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions which
might be appropriate to such occasions,, eg the admission of increased numbers to
certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed, that
notice is given to the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their
incorporation in the general safety certificate.


8.   Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determina­
tion of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend­
ment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of
the certificate or of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the Act) and will
presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the
 original certificate,    it will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities
 and clubs/stadium authorities for a close liaison to be maintained after the
 issue of the certificate and certainly while any further works of safety measures
 are being carried out.    It is likely to be in the stadium operators' financial
 interest to get the safety certificate amended as soon as possible after work
 has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure that the local authority
 is kept informed of progress.    For    its part the local authority will no doubt
 wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion of the
 work, the certificate can be amended without delay.


~ 9.    After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the
 transfer of the certificate to another person.      Similarly, while a local
 authority is considering an application for a certificate and before the certifi­
  cate has been granted, It may be asked to substitute some person other than the
 original applicant as the person to whom the certificate should be granted.       These
 are, however, likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certifi­
 cates, where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club or a stadium
 organisation by an authorised official of the club or representative of the
 organisation.    However, if it does happen, the local authority will be required in
 both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified person.
 Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the regulations to
'giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply together with
 any necessary appeals procedure.       In the second case, there is no reason why the
  local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new applica­
  tion in the terms of the original one and process it from the point it had already
  reached.


  10.   In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety
  certificate against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see
  paragraph 2 above), which, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed
  transfer of a certificate, the Act provides a further right of appeal to any
  "interested party" (which term includes the holder of the safety certificate)
  against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
  certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.      The
  regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of
  any such appeal Bhall be given within 28 days following receipt of a notice of
  the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified,
  the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating
  in the locality.
11.    In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or
amending a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain
specified "interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press.
It is regretted that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of
advertising, but, since Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition
which it provides of "interested party", no other means could be found of ensuring
that all persons who might validly claim to be "interested parties” within the
meaning of the Act should be able to acquaint themselves with the local authority’
decision, and failure to bring the decision to their notice could result in a
denial of their rights of appeal or of a hearing by the Secretary of State.      For
the same reason a similar obligation has been imposed on an appellant (by
Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing to
appear before a person appointed by the Secretary ofState under Section 5(4)      of
the Act is required to give notice within 28 days ofsuch advertisement.

                                                 i
12.    Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
appeal.    It will then be for the local authority,   in accordance with Regulation
8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether            it
wishes to oppose the appeal.    With any such notice, the local authority is
required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state
whether it wishes a hearing under Section 5     of the Act.    (The procedure govern-
ing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in Regulation 10.)


13.    It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to
order a public inquiry under Section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in Regulation 12.

 1M.   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
practice of copying to the Home Office newly issued or amended safety certificate

             SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

             PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


             1.      The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate sha
             be made in the fora contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to
             like effect.       Part II of the form and its frontispiece should be completed in
             case of applications for special safety certificates.       In any case where an
             application for a special safety certificate is not made by the holder of the
             general safety certificate, it should be accompanied by evidence of the appli­
             cant's status.       Details of any planned changes to the normal standing and seat
             arrangements for spectators should be provided, together with such further
             information in support of the application as is considered necessary to enable
             the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act.       However, it is
             open to a local authority, under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notic
             in writing, any further information of this kind which they may think it
             necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions to be
             included in the special safety certificate. *


             2.      -A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificate
             is that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant is a quali­
             fied person, the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory,
             whereas the issue of a special safety certificate remains at its discretion.
             But an applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against a
             refusal (see following paragraphs for details).


             3   .    An application for a special safety certificate should normally be made a
             least     3   months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority ha
             discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied
             that the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
             Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser per
             eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person.        On receipt of an
             application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
             determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to b
             in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be ispos
             in the certificate.        The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make
             this determination within 14 days of receiving the application.        There is a
             right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant
             is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9), and, under regulation 5, the
             applicant must be furnished with the reasons for such a determination.

                                                                                         i&T
4.    It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused
on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person.    This
decision must, in accordance with regulation 6, be made within 28 days of the
receipt of the application, not only in cases where the local authority has
determined,that the applicant is a qualified person but also in those where
it has determined that he is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to
be considered.    There is also a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds
other than a determination that the applicant is not a qualified person (see
paragraph 9).    In the event of such a refusal, therefore, the local authority is
again required, under regulation 6, to give the applicant the reasons for its
decision.


5.    When the first 2 stages have been completed, should it have been decided
that a special safety certificate should be Issued, the local authority in
metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) is required, by
section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the Chief Officer
of Police and to the fire authority and to consult them about the terms and
conditions to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere in England and Wales
the local authority must send a copy to, and consult with, the Chief Officer of
Police and the building authority.     The special safety certificate must, in
accordance with regulation 6(2), then be issued not less than 28 days before
the   proposed event is due to take place.


6.    The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary
according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
certificate would not be appropriate.     (In suitable cases, however, regard may
be had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
 (Football) on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 of.the paper relating to the
"Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates".)     Any
special safety certificate must, however, contain full details of the terms
and conditions Imposed, including in particular the natters referred to in
section 2(2) of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where
appropriate by reference to the plan attached to the general safety cartificate


 7.   Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the deter-
 ®ination of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal
 amendment of the certificate.    This may be on the application of the holder of
 J** certifiCate or at the discretion of the local authority (see section 4(2)
         Act}-   This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
certificate, otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has
been issued well in    advance of the event to which it relates. Any such amend­
ment must, however,    be publicised as in paragraph 10 below.


8.    Considerations   of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate
to another person an equally unlikely contingency.    Any possible difficulties
in this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the
general safety certificate applies for the special certificate.     Nevertheless,
should an application for transfer be made, the local authority must decide
within 14 days if the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it
decides to.the contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating
to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will
the appropriate appeals procedure, should the need arise.    In the case of an
application for transfer before a special safety certificate has actually been
issued, there is no reason why the local authority should not treat the applica
tion in all respects as a new application in the terms of the original and pro­
cess it from the point already reached.


9.    Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against'a deter­
mination that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3) and against
the refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4).     In addition the
Act provides (in section 5(3)) a right of appeal to any "interested party"
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.
The regulations provide that, in the case of a special safety certificate, noti
of any such appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice
of the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not
notified, the publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper
circulating in the locality.


10.   As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so
to amend it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also
to advertise its action in the press.     A similar obligation falls on an appella
 (under regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wish
ing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section
5(4) of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement.
 (The reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of ths^
paper relating to the 'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety
11.   Any appellant is required (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
appeal.   It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation
8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it
wishes to oppose the appeal.   With any such notice, the local authority is
required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to
state whether it wishes a hearing under section's^) of the Act.    (The pro­
cedure governing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in regulation 10.)


12.   It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary,
to order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any
appeal.   In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in
regulation 12.


13.   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
practice of copying to the Home Office any special safety certificates issued.

Dear Sir

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION

1.   The purpose of this letter is to inform you of the effects on the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) of Local Government reorganisation in the Metropolitan
counties and Greater London brought about by the Local Government Act 1985.

2.   With effect from 1 April 1986 responsibility for administering the SSGA 1975 will
in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London, transfer to the appropriate
Metropolitan District Council (MDC) or London Borough (the "successor" authorities).
They will be responsible for, among other things, the issue of and amendments to safet;
certificates. A consequential effect of Local Government reorganisation is that the
current certificating authorities in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London are
not in the meantime empowered to issue or amend safety certificates for any period
commencing on or after 1 April 1986. Such certificates or amendments will fall to be
issued by the successor authorities. It is therefore in the interests of applicants
in these areas to ensure*that applications for special safety certificates, or ase.nds
to existing certificates, which are to come into effect on or after 1 April 1986 are
copied to the appropriate successor authority who should be kept informed of deveiopr
and progress so as to be in a position to assume responsibility for the case in quest
with the minimum of delay and inconvenience.

                                                                      Yours faithfully

    Dear Ur. England,
                   Ur. Whitehead very kindly let me have a sight of
    the prints which he had obtained from Husband & Co.                                   Even
    though these do not contain all the information we would
    require,they give sufficient to make the task relatively
    easy so far as the North stand and Vest stand are concerned.
    I have now returned the prints to Ur. Whitehead but we have
    taken photo-copies to keep on our file.
                   If you wish to go so far as making an application for
    a Certificate we shall still need to survey the South
    stand and Spion Cop.                                   But as I said in my letter last week,
    for an expenditure not exceeding €500 we would be able to
    take the survey sufficiently far to let you have a report
   on what would be involved (if anything) in bringing the
   ground up to standard, and alternatively, what would be the
   likely effect on the ground capacity in any Certificate if
   you do not carry out any improvements for the time being.


                                                                          Yours sincerely,

•    Club wished to se? the Sra>;in.'-.     ior big laatches as regularly as possible.

     For the Ccunfy              it w»* cm. rfrti/.cl that to* aim of tne meet ini; was purely
     exploratory sc; t'-ar >«.y pcsaibit. ji'.-’nts o: mis'incisrstandir.T could hopefully be
     cleared i»toro the Vvirv-^l proofs - began.

     During the cour**?       tbo ruscicsion the fell swing points were maoe:-

     (a)     the Stadium had been ased for many capacity matches over the years and
              its saf“-y rf>'*crd -v9.s the equrl of any Lr the country;

      (b)    ir tne C^de of Practice -vcre to be applied literally, then there would
              probably he minor discrepancies such as In the width of the steps on the
              Spion Kop and in tbe width of the gangways and exits in the Stands;


                                               1.




                                                                     ) PQCUMfcHTHo. I 01
(c)   in order t, • •- a base from vai<;h to work, all of the crush barriers
       would requi      be tested initially, with up to 20% tested annually
       thereafter;

(d)   it was likely that the fire risk in the North and West stands would be
       minimal, hut the main stand would probably require more detailed
       attention: however, only a detailed inspection by the Fire Service would
       reveal the true position;

(e)   the police v’^«jid be happy with the existing position of the Police Control
       Centre, but felt the present structure would not meet their requirements;

(f)   the North and West Stands were modern structures, but the main stand
       had originally been built some 50 years ago and there were now no
       records, which would mean that a complete survey of this would be
       necessary;

(g)   the only activity which normally took place at the Stadium other than
       football was the Annual Jehovah’s Witness Rally, and an endeavour would
       be mad? to make provision for this in the General Safety Certificate so as
       to obviate the -ised for the Special Safety Certificate procedure;

(h)    to avc.ua              cons plication should a change of Club Secretary ocour,
       the C*nit»cij;:e A-oulri be tn the rarre of the Club with a nominated person
       bein£ nct u i r r i in writing to the County Council:

(i)   as rtg-iids the a rift General Safety Certificate

       (a)    th*» definition of ’’Holder" would need to be amended,

       (r.)   v.:. rot’    S of Part 2 would need tfce words "of medicine'1adding
               3.ft<v u>e word ’Vioctcv*',

       (t!    paragraph 12(3) of Part 2 would need amending by deleting tfce
              first i•nr aad substituting the words "Ch the day of a Specified
              Acti’vty *ui'i not > s s than three hours prior to its commencement
              tho”,

       (d)    the fi . i ’varning system referred to in paragraph 13(1) of Part 2
               woulc! he the subject of consultation between the Chief Fire Officer
               ai:3 t*-? d a b .

(j)   the County Council would require the detailed information and plans referred
       to In tue concluding paragraph of the letter dated 13th September, 1978 from
       the Chief Executive to the Club before any formal progress could be made on
       the application.

At the invitation of the Club, the Working Party took the opportunity of carrying out
an informal inspection of the Stadium in company with the Club's representatives.

lafsty cf Sports Grounds Act 1S75   -i"



I thank you for your latter dated 22nd December, 1S73, and tha ccoy
lattar cf the Euilcing surveyor of the Sheffield Wetropelitan
District Council.

It would seem essential that tha officers.of tha County Council and
Metropolitan District Council involved in the production cf the
general-safety certificate racuirad by the Sheffield Us'ednasday
Football Club under tha above Act, undartaka a comprehensive survay
cf ths ground. I faal sura that it would ba beneficial to the Club
if, initially, each department acted in unison in this respect
rather than 3apar3taly and I would make'tha necessary arrar.gemsnts
with my officers for thi3 to be achieved.

/Tcopy of tha report of each department’should‘be provided to aach
involved daoartmant to snabla problems to ba discussed so that an
accaptad approach might be determined and consolidatad into a sincia
racort which should be forwarded to the Club.

This racort, togatnar with that of Dr< Eastwood, would form ths
basis cf a further meeting with officials cf tha Club as diffarar.rss
cf ocinion, if any, would have eaen identified.

It is my opinion that the r.scessary compranansivo survay could not
fca undertaken satisfactorily without plan drawings. In this raspact
I rsfsr to paragraph 1.3 of the 'green coda1;

"Tha problam of crowd safety at football grounds is crmplax end
ccnr.ot ba solved simply by ensuring that each component cf a ground,

  Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act. 197S

    I thank you for your letter dated 20th December, 1978.

  Whilst accepting the principle, I feel that the suggested Joint officer survey could not be
  undertaken-satisfactorily without plan drawings, and I intend to press the Club to submit then
(^ •s soon as possible (see copy letter attached).

W would agree that it is essential for all officers involved in the certification procedure to
 act in unison. Following receipt of the plan drawings, I would suggest that the officers meet
 to agree on identification procedures. In order that each officer is able to identify parts of
 the ground in a uniform manner. 1 thick it will be necessary to have stands and termers clearly
 identified, exit routes, passages, gangways, gateways, doors, e tc ., numbered in a consecuth*
 manner and stairways lettered.

    I also thirk it will be essential for a copy of the report of each service involved to be provided
    to the other services involved to enable any problems to be discussed and determined on the bas;s
    of a single report being formulated for submission to the Club. Ibis report, together with that
    of Dr. Eastwood, would then form the basis of a further meeting with officials of the Club to
    discuss any differences of opinion.

    In this v.-ay, I r.-ouJd hope that we could avoid being in a position of haring consultation.-- with the
     Club v/ith insufficient or limited information for the County Council to reach proper decisions.

    i have passed copies of this letter to the Chief Constable and to the Chief Fire Officer and trill,
    of c o u rs e keep you informed of developments as regards submission of the plan drawings by thr
    Club.

                                                                        Tours faithfully.

 Dear Sirs,
                 Certificate of Safety - Interim Report
        We have now progressed sufficiently far with our
 survey and assessment to be able to submit an interim report
 covering the probable ground capacity and the likely costs of
 improvements which will be required by the certifying authority.
        The green guide has been used as a basis for our cal­
 culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
 *111 not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
 guide.   Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of
 the fire officer and the police.

 Standing Accommodation
 (a)    Spion Kop
               The general layout of Sploa Kop is good.   It
        has a very adequate number of gangways, with spaclngs
        well below the maximum laid down in the guide.   The
        slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements for
        good viewing and the requirements of safety.
               The only questions therefore are the adequacy
        of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
        permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of


                                                         R a c istc ra d in England - N o. 113 453 1
                                                                                  IA
EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




         the exits.
                 Where the barriers are adequate in strength
         and spacing, the guide recoaaends that, the number
                                                     2
         of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10a      of plan
         area.    Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
         Kop is approximately 3120m2 which would provide
         accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                 Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
         standards.    Category A must.be able to withstand a
         test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
         and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
         In 1973 you had tests made on all the barriers by
         Toft and Brocklebank Ltd.    Of the 101 barriers on
         Spion Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb
         and a further 15 carried the load but had some actual
         or incipient defect which needed attention.      Host of
         those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
         would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
         On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of
         a long barrier which was weak.    The general situation was
         satisfactory compared with most grounds.
                 Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
         barriers up to a uniform category A standard.       It
         should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
         the tests and there will have been some deterioration
         due to rusting.    Most of the barriers are made from
         2}" diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
         inches when new:    Rusting Is now very slow in Sheffield’*
         atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers .axe -subject
         to more rusting than others and we must expect some
         increase in the number needing attention.
             ' "Provided’a baxrier can withstand 6kN/m,the
         maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
         guide, varies between 5a for slopes of only 5° to 2.9a
                                                                         sm ut

          for slopes of 30°.      These figures apply to 'peak
          viewing' areas.      Spion Kop has an average slope
          of about 17° for which the recommended spacing is
          3 •6&«
                    In calculating spectator capacity each barrier
          is assumed to cater for an area of ground immediately
         behind it which is either 3.6m vide or up to the
          next barrier, whichever is the smaller.      We have
          surveyed the Kop, and our drawing 1610/1 attached
          shows the proportion of the Kop which will be
          admissible in the spectator calculation if all the
         barriers are brought up to category A standard.            It
         will be immediately apparent that the great majority
          of the available area will qualify.      Our calculation
          shows that the permitted number of spectators should
         be about 13,900 i.e. the number of'places 'lost* will
         be almost 3,000.
                    If you wish to retain mo«t>of- these extra places
          (aiming for a ground capacity of at least 50,000
          say) then new barriers could be constructed at positions
          shown by the red lines on the second copy of drawing
          1610/1.      The capacity would then be 16,000.
                    In proposing the extra barriers we are mindful
          that in some cases they will possibly hinder the
          close packing of spectators.      Clearly, there is no
          point in spending money in order to achieve a large
          permitted.grouod capacity, if 'that~numberrcanaot
          then be packed in.      However, we think that even with
          an uneven distribution of spectators it will still be
          possible to accommodate 16,000 spectators.
                    You may wish to consider whether the cost of
          these extra barriers’w i U T b e justified by the additional
          income they might generate over the years.        It is
                                                                     SMUT


EASTWOOD » PARTNERS




         likely that new barriers, which will require fairly
         massive foundation and anchor blocks will cost between
         £50 and £60 per metre run.     Thus the extra 235 metres
         of barrier will cost about £5.00 per extra standing
         place.
                  Spion Sop is not ideally catered for by exits.
         A very adequate gangway system feeds to only three
         exit points.     The total width of these three exits
         at their narrowest points is.12.5m.    The guide assumes
         a maximum flow rate through these exits of 60 persons
         per minute for each 550ma of width.     Thus the
         theoretical time to discharge 16,000 spectators from
         Spion Kop would be 11$minutes, compared with a maximum
         of 8 minutes indicated by the guide.
                  The exits at each end of the terrace are reasonably
         free from hazards, except the one at-the North end passes
         under a bridge with a headroom veil below the recommended
         value of 8ft.     This defect could be removed by lowering
         the floor level, but I would argue strongly that it is
         far from essential to have such a large headroom, and
         the cost of modification is not justified in an existing
         structure.
                The exit at the back of Spion Kop is likely to
         raise most difficulty.     The ramp is steep and it has
         an appreciable cross-fall at the top where there is also
         a change of direction.     At one*side is a vertical drop,
         which has guard rails which appear to be reasonably
         strong^‘but thlB" can' only be established by testing.
         We shall need some indulgence by the licensing authority.,
         if no works are to be requested.      ify feeling is that
         continuous handrails will be required, splitting the
         ramp into say thi*ee separate lanes.
                There may be considerable pressure to increase
EASTWOOD !r PARTNERS




         the total exit capacity.       -We can argue that the
         eight minutes allowed for complete evacuation is only
         really valid for stands where there might be a risk
         due to fire, or explosion*, or structural failure.          in
         the case of terracing it is only the impatience of
         spectators which might create danger.        For an interim
         period, at least, this should be acceptable.
                Any changes or additions to the exit arrangements
         should take account of a possible future decision to roof
         over Spion Kop.        It would be possible to incorporate is
         such a scheme a 'squaring off' at the top which could
         increase the area available for spectators.          However,
         this would probably mean that additional entrances would
         be needed, possibly by tunnelling through the bank at
         lower level.        This would certainly make it easier to
         pack the crowd more uniformly..       However, this is a
         matter for the future and is unlikely to be part of the
         present exercise.

  (b)    The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
                The west terrace is not quite so well endowed with
         barriers as Spion Kop.       The present layout is shown on the
         attached drawing 1610/2.        Our measurements show a total
                         2
         area of 1480m       but there are no gangways.    We feel that
         some allowance should be made for circulation space as
         spectators have to move quite considerable horizontal
         distances to achieve good packing.        The full area would
         justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
         probably be appropriate to allow 10% as          the equivalent
         of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.          The
         barriers should be designed to match this figure approximately.
                The shaded area on drawing 1610/2 is that which
         may be counted if the existing barriers are of class A.
         About 15 of the. existing barriers are likely to need
                                        Ai jI
                                                                                SMcrr    6.

    EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




              strengthening to achieve this .standard.         Even with
              this strengthening only 4,300 spectators could be
             accommodated,'representing-a loss of nearly half-
             We presume this vould be unacceptable.
                        The extra barriers required to achieve

+             approximately 7200 capacity are shovn in red on the
              second copy of drawing 1610/2.           You may feel that
              some of the proposed nev barriers vhich are close
              to the entrances might restrict the passage of
              spectators undesirably.           In that case they could
              be omitted.
                        The three exits have a total vidth of about
              11.5a which vould permit about 1250 people per minute
              to leave the ground.      Thus the stand could empty
              in about six minutes vhich is very satisfactory.
                        The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
              should be vithin 12m of a gangway or exit.          There are
              no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
              exit.      But we feel this is of no consequence as
              movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
              and quick.

      (c)     The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                        This area is also illustrated in the drawing
              1610/2.      The gross area available (there are no gangways)
                               2
              is about 565 m .      Thus if the crush barriers were
              adequate and the whole area Is included the number of                     - •- ••
              spectators could be about 3 t050.
                        Unfortunately, the crush barriers in this area
              vere shown to be very inadequate vhen tested in 1973.
              Only one vas tested .and the rail and posts vere bending

               have examined the drawings of these barriers and
               in addition to the weakness of the rails and posts,
               the holding down arrangements appear to be very
               inadequate and might be treacherous.        A sudden
               failure of a bolt, and they are very highly stressed,
               could lead to a collapse without warning.        These
               barriers need major strengthening as a matter of
               urgency.
                      Assuming that the barriers are strengthened
               it will be seen from the drawing 1610/2 that they
               also need considerable supplementation.        The scheme
               shown on the second copy of this drawing does not
               quite justify the whole area being taken in the
               calculations.      But it would be reasonable to count
               say 2900.      This would bring the total standing at
               the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.. .
                       The exits serving this part of the terrace are
               very adequate, but there may be requests for central
               handrailings to be provided.


      Seating Accommodation
       (a)   . The Worth Stand
                      The form of construction of this stand is such
               that it presents a minimum fire hazard.        The exits
               are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy the
               recommendations of the guide.
                       Two matters might cause concern.        The first,
               the fact- tha-t -the-exits are marginally below .tJie ... . .
               recommended minimum of 1.1m, is we think of verjr little
               consequence.      However, the second, the narrow gangways
               which are only about half the recommended minimum may
               cause some-^lff icul**yv-- It would be possible..to jii<ieiL.-
               the gangways by taking""one seat off the end of one of
               the rows meeting at each gangway.        As the gangways

                                                                          w in

              are the sane in the other .stands the total number of
              seats lost vould be 1,041.      This is almost unthinkable
              and must be resisted strongly.
                      Fortunately, the timing of spectators leaving              _
              the ground on 6 January shoved that a peak of 80 per
              minute passed through one exit.        This is the figure
              quoted by the guide for a 1.1m gangvay.        With 18 exits
*             for 10,000 people the average vould be 556 per unit.
              Thus the stand vould empty in about seven minutes,
              vhich is vithin the recommended limit of eight minutes.
                      Our observations on 6 January shoved that           everyone
              had left this stand, apart from a fev people vho vere
              in no hurry, in about six minutes, although ve also counted
              about 40 per exit vho left before the final vhistle.
              The overall picture appears very satisfactory and
              encourages the hope that this stand vill be accepted
              as not needing any significant modification.
                                                 /

       (b)    The West Stand
                     This stand is very similar to the north stand
              in its construction.    We vere not able to accurately
              assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
              January because there vere many seats vhich vere unsold.
              Hovever, there is every reason to believe that there
              vill be no difficulty in vacating this stand vithin
               eight minutes also.   There should be no need for
               significant modifications.

       (c)    The South Stand                      *-•            -
                     The structure has been surveyed and appended .
               are prints of our dravings 1610/3, 4 and 5, vhich
               shov the plans and cross-section.       Also attached is
               a settling pl'au;- -draving No. 1610/6.      - ---------
                       The upper part of"the stand (the covered area)
               has 5710 seats.   These are served by 10 exits (excluding
EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




          those serving the directors box) so that an average
          of 570 people need to pass through each exit.      The
          count on 6 January shoved an average of just over 70
          per ninute passing through one exit vhich corresponds
          to an emptying tine of about eight minutes.      Indeed
          there vere very fev people still trying to get out six
          minutes after the final vhistle.      A fev had no doubt
          left early and a fev vere still standing around, but
          the stand had substantially emptied in about six minuter
                    Having left the top of the stand the spectators
          have to make their vay from the first floor landing via
          one of three staircases.      Two of these are 3.6m vide
          and the other 2.4.      This is equivalent to 17$ 'lanes'
          of 550oa.     At 40 people per lane, 700 people pass per
          minute.      To discharge 5710 people (less those in the
          directors box) vill therefore take almost exactly 8
          minutes as permitted by the guide.
                    The fire officers vere clearly very interested
          in the first floor.      There is very little 'fire load'
          on this floor - the snack bars and the office/lounge.
          But quite a small fire might fill this area vith smoke.
          We suspect that there might be a request for it to be compart­
          mentalised by fire doors.
                 At ground floor level tvo of the staircases lead
          almost straight to the open air,, through a compartment
          vhich is separated from the main part of the building.
          The third staircase .is not so veil separated and some
          structural vork may be needed.      Apparently the paint
          store is beside this staircase.       This may not be vise.
                    There may veil be requests from the fire officer
          for considerable extra precautions and structural...
          alterations in this building.

          If it is required to increase this capacity at some
   time in the future Spion Kop could be 'squared off' at the
   back using a steel framed structure and perhaps a further
   4000 places could be provided.    The Kop could also be
   roofed over, of course.

              ■This total should not at this stage be taken as
    more than a broad guess.       We may have pleasant surprises
    but there could be shocks.        The total does not contain
    any allowance for the local authority's charges in
    connection with the issuing of the licence or for our
    professional fees.


    Future Action
              Subject to your approval we suggest that the next
    steps might be as follows :-

    1.        We should pass copies of all drawings to the police,
              the fire brigade, the d t y Building Surveyor and the
              County Council.     In addition to drawings showing
              the results of our surveys of the Kop, the Lepplngs
              Lane terrace and the south stand, we are preparing
              suitable drawings of the north and west stands,
              measuring from the photo-copies of Husbands drawings.

    2.        We should make firm proposals to the police and the
              fire brigade for the new crush barriers, together
              with our computation of the number of spectators, and
              invite comments including any suggestions of further
              measures which may be needed.

    3.        At the same time we should make detailed drawings and
              specifications for the strengthening work on the
              barriers which are known to be weak, andfor the con­
              struction of the new barriers, and obtain tenders.

     6.     We should discuss with the police and fire officer
            what other services such as alarms, communications

            obtain tenders.    _


     A Meeting with The Club
            You may feel that another meeting to discuss this
     report and the suggestions for further action, should be
     held shortly.     Dr. Eastwood will be out of the country
     for three weeks from 22 January so that the week beginning
     15 January would be appropriate.

                                             REPORT ON GROUND CAPACITY


                    This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
      which is attainable.
                    It deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening
      and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
      calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.                                          .
                    Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
      the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
      made at the end■of the third round'cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
                    The green guide has been used as a basis fot our cal­
      culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
      vill not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
      guide.            Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
      fire officer and the police.

     Dear Sir,

     Safety of Soorts Grounds Act. 1975

     I (hack you for your letter dated 20th December, 1978.

  Whilst accepting the principle, I feel that the suggested joint officer survey could not be
  undertakeii-satisfactorily without plan drawings, and I Intend to press the Club to submit them
C ?« soon as possible (see copy letter attached).

     1 would agree that it is essential for all officers involved in the certification procedure to
     act in unison. Follow!*^ receipt of the plan drawings, I would suggest that the officers meet
     to agree on identification procedures. In order that each officer is able to identify parts ot
     the ground in a uniform manner, I thick it will be necessary to have stands and termers clearly
     identified, exit routes, passages, gangways, gateways, doors, e tc ., numbered in a conseeuthr

     I also thirk it will be essential for a copy of the report of each service involved to be provided
     to the other services involved to enable any problems to be discussed and determined on the ha?
     of a single report being formulated for submission to the Club. This report, together with that
     of Dr. Eastwood, would then form the basis of a further meeting with officials of the Club to
     discuss any differences of opinion.

   In this ra y , I would hope that we could avoid being in a position of having consultntion.- with tbc
^ C lu b with insufficient or limited information for the County Council to reach proper decisions.

     I have passed copies of this letter to the Chief Constable and to the Chief Fire Officer and will,
     of course^keep you informed of developments as regards submission of the plan dr;;v\-i>igs by the

 Dear Sirs,
                                    Certificate of Safety - Interim Report
                We have nov progressed sufficiently far vith our
 survey and assessment to be able to subnit as interim report
 covering the probable ground capacity and the likely costs of
  improvements vhich vill be required by the certifying authority.
                The green guide has been used as a basis for our cal­
 culations, although as vith probably all existing grounds, it
 vill not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
  guide.           Reasonable compromise vill be needed on the part of
 the fire officer and the police.


 Standing Accommodation
  (a)           Spion Kop
                       The general layout of Spion Kop is good.                                        It
                has a very adequate number of gangvays, vith spacings
                veil belov the maximum laid dovn in the guide.                                        The
                slope strikes a happy balance betveen the requirements for
                good vievlng and the requirements of safety.
                                The only questions therefore are the adequacy
                of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
                permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of

         the exits.
                 Where the barriers are adequate in strength
         and spacing, the guide recoaaends that, the nuaber
                                                     2
         of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10a      of plan
         area.    Disregarding the gangvays the area of Spion
         Kop is approxinately 3120a2 vhich vould provide
         accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                 Crush barriers can satisfy either of tvo
         standards.    Category A must.be able to vithstand a
         test load of 6kN/metre vldth (400 lb/foot approximately)
         and Category B must vithstand 4.3 kN/aetre (290 lb/foot).
         In 1973 you had tests aade on all the barriers by
         Toft and Brocklebank Ltd.    Of the 101 barriers on
         Spion Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb
         and a further 15 carried the load but had some actual
         or incipient defect vhich needed attention.      Most of
         those vhich failed the test, failed so badly that they
         vould probably not satisfy category B standard either.
         On the other hand, it vas sometimes only one part of
         a long barrier vhich vas veak.    The general situation vas
         satisfactory coapared vith aost grounds.
                 Clearly it vould be advisable to bring all the
         barriers up to a unifora category A standard.      It
         should be kept in alnd that it is nov five years since
         the tests and there vill have been soae deterioration
         due to rusting.    Most of the barriers are Bade from
         21" diameter tube vhich only has a thickness of 0.192
         inches vhen nev:    Rusting is nov very slov in Sheffield's
         atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers -axe subject
         to more rusting than others and ve must expect some
         increase in the number needing attention.
             ' "Prbvldetf'a barrier can vithstand 6kN/m,the
         maximum distance betveen barriers recommended in the
         guide varies betveen 5a for slopes of only 5° to 2.9a
                                                                       SMUT   3.

          for slopes of 30°.      These figures apply to 'peak
          viewing' areas.      Spion Kop has an average slope
          of about 17° for vhich the recommended spacing is
          3 •6m.
                    In calculating spectator capacity each barrier
          is assumed to cater for an area of ground Immediately
          behind it vhich is either 3.6m vide or up to the
          next barrier, vhichever is the smaller.       We have
          surveyed the Kop, and our draving 1610/1 attached
          shovs the proportion of the Kop vhich vill be
          admissible in the spectator calculation if all the
          barriers are brought up to category A standard.         It
          vill be immediately apparent that the great majority
          of the available area vill qualify.       Our calculation
          shovs that the permitted number of spectators should
          be about 13,900 i.e. the number of'places 'lost' vill
          be almost 3,000.
                    If you vish to retain moet:-of. these extra places
          (aiming for a ground capacity of at least 50,000
          say) then nev barriers could be constructed at positions
          shovn by the red lines on the second copy of draving
          1610/1.      The capacity vould then be 16,000.
                    In proposing the extra barriers ve are mindful
          that in some cases they vill possibly hinder the
          close packing of spectators.       Clearly, there is no
          point in spending money in order to achieve a large
          permitted.ground capacity, if that'numberrcannot
          then be packed in.      Hovever, ve think that even vith
          an uneven distribution of spectators it vill still be
          possible to accommodate 16,000 spectators.
                    You may vish to consider vhether the cost of
          these extra barriers vilT"be justified by the additional
          income they might generate over the years.        It Is

          likely that new barriers, which will require fairly
          massive foundation and anchor blocks will cost between
          £50 and £60 per metre run.          Thus the extra 235 aetres
          of barrier will cost about £-&00 per extra standing
          place.
                   Spion Kop is not ideally catered for by exits.
          A very adequate gangway systea feeds to only three
          exit points.     The total width of these three exits
          at their narrowest points is.12.5a.         The guide assuaes
          a maximum flow rate through these exits of 60 persons
          per ainute for each 550ma of width.          Thus the
          theoretical time to discharge 16,000 spectators froa
          Spion Kop would be ll^ainutes, compared with a maximum
          of 8 minutes indicated by the guide.
                   The exits at each end of the terrace are reasonably
          free froa hazards, except the’one at-the North end passes
          under a bridge with a headroom veil below the recommended
          value of 8ft.     This defect could be reaoved by lowering
          the floor level, but I vould argue strongly that it is
          far froa essential to have such a large headrooa, and
          the cost of aodification is not justified in an existing
          structure.
                 The exit at the back of Spion Kop is likely to
          raise aost difficulty.     The raap is steep and it has
          an appreciable cross-fall at the top where there is also
          a change of direction.     At one* side is a vertical drop,
          which has guard rails which appear to be reasonably
          strohgci but this” can only be established by testing.
          We shall heed some indulgence by the licensing authority.,
          if no works are to be requested.          My feeling is that
          continuous handrails vill be required, splitting the
          ramp into say three separate lanes.
                 There may be considerable pressure to increase
                                                                           **tir   3.

         the total exit capacity.        -We can argue that the
         eight minutes allowed for complete evacuation is only
         really valid for stands where there might be a risk
         due to fire, or explosion*, or structural failure.             In
         the case of terracing it is only the impatience of
         spectators which might create danger.            For an interim
         period, at least, this should be acceptable.
                Any changes or additions to the exit arrangements
         should take account of a possible future decision to roof
         over Spion Kop.        It would be possible to Incorporate lit
         such a scheme a 'squaring off' at the top which could
         increase the area available for spectators.            However,
         this would probably mean that additional entrances would
         be needed, possibly by tunnelling through the bank at
         lower level.        This would certainly make it easier to
         pack the crowd sore uniformly..           However, this is a
         matter for the future and is unlikely to be part of the
         present exercise.

  (b)    The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
                The west terrace is not quite so well endowed with
         barriers as Spion Kop.       The present layout is shown on the
         attached drawing 1610/2.        Our measurements show a total
                         2
         area of 1480m       but there are no gangways.      We feel that
         some allowance should be made for circulation space as
         spectators bave to move quite considerable horizontal
         distances to achieve good packing.            The full area would
         justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would               .
         probably be appropriate to allow 10% as           the equivalent
         of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.              The
         barriers should be designed to match this figure approximately.
                The shaded area on drawing 1610/2 is that which
         may be counted if the existing barriers are of class A.
         About 15 of the. existing barriers are likely to need

              strengthening to achieve this .standard.    Even vith
              this strengthening only 4,300 spectators could be
              accommodated, representing -a loss of nearly half.
              We presume this vould be unacceptable.
                        The extra barriers required to achieve
              approximately 7200 capacity are shovn in red on the
              second copy of draving 1610/2.      you may feel that
              some of the proposed nev barriers vhich are close
              to the entrances might restrict the passage of
              spectators undesirably.      In that case they could
              be omitted.
                     The three exits have a total vidth of about
             . 11.5m vhich vould permit about 1250 people per minute
      y -J    to leave the ground.      Thus the stand could empty
-             in about six minutes vhich is very satisfactory.
      /,                The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
' V           should be vithin 32m of a gangvay or exit.         There are
              no gangways and some spectators vill be 25m from an
              exit.      But ve feel this is of no consequence as
              movement horizontally along this terrace vill be easy
              and quick.
      (c)     The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                        This area is also illustrated in the draving
              1610/2.      The gross area available (there are no gangways)
              is about 565 m2 .     Thus if the crush barriers vere
              adequate and the whole area is included the nuaber of
              spectators could be about 3,050.
                     Unfortunately, the crush barriers in this area
              were shown to be very Inadequate when tested in 1973.
              Only one was tested .and the rail and posts were bending^
              at a load of only 270 lb7?t.      Because of this result
              none of the others was subjected to a test lead.         We
                                                                          wirr     7

              have examined the drawings of these barriers and
              in addition to the weakness of the rails and posts,
              the holding down arrangeaents appear to be very
              inadequate and might be treacherous.          A sudden
              failure of a bolt, and they are very highly stressed,
              could lead to a collapse without warning.           These
              barriers need major strengthening as a matter of
              urgency.
                      Assuming that the barriers are strengthened
              it will be seen from the drawing 1610/2 that they
              also need considerable supplementation.           The scheme
              shown on the second copy of this drawing does not
              quite justify the whole area being taken in the
              calculations.      But it would be reasonable to count
              say 2900.      This would bring the total standing at
              the Leppings Lane end to 10,100..
                      The exits serving this part of the terrace are
              very adequate, but there may be requests for central
              handrailings to be provided.


      Seating Accommodation

              are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy the

           are the same in the other .stands the total number of
           seats lost vould be l y041.    This is almost unthinkable
           and must be resisted strongly.
                  Fortunately, the timing of spectators leaving          _
           the ground on 6 January shoved that a peak of 80 per
           minute passed through one exit.     This is the figure
           quoted by the guide for a 1.1m gangvay.     Vith 18 exits
           for 10,000 people the average vould be 556 per unit.
           Thus the stand vould empty in about seven minutes,
           vhich is vithin the recommended
                                    *      limit of eight minutes.
                  Our observations on 6 January shoved that everyone
           had left this stand, apart from a fev people vho vere
           in no hurry,in about six minutes, although ve also counted
           about 40 per exit vho left before the final vhistle.
           The overall picture appears very satisfactory and
           encourages the hope that this stand vill be accepted
           as not needing any significant modification.

   (b)     The West Stand
                  This stand is very similar to the north stand
           in its construction.    We vere not able to accurately
           assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
           January because there vere many seats vhich vere unsold.
           Hovever, there is every reason to believe that there
           vill be no difficulty in vacating this stand vithin
           eight minutes also.    There should be no need for
           significant modifications.

          those serving the directors box) so that an average
          of 570 people need to pass through each exit.      The
          count on 6 January shoved an average of just over 70
          per minute passing through one exit vhich corresponds
          to an emptying time of about eight minutes.      Indeed
          there vere very fev people still trying to get out six
          minutes after the final vhistle.      A fev had no doubt
          left early and a fev vere still standing around, but
          the stand had substantially emptied in about six minutes-.
                    Having left the top of the stand the spectators
          have to make their vay from the first floor landing via
          one of three staircases.      Tvo of these are 3.6m vide
          and the other 2.4.      This is equivalent to 17} 'lanes'
          of 550mm.     At 40 people per lane, 700 people pass per
          minute.      To discharge 5710 people (less those in the
          directors box) vill therefore take almost exactly 8
          minutes as permitted by the guide.
                    The fire officers vere clearly very interested
          in the first floor.      There is very little 'fire load'
          on this floor - the snack bars and the office/lounge.
          But quite a small fire might fill this area vith smoke.
          We suspect that there might be a request for it to be compart­
          mentalised by fire doors.
                    At ground floor level tvo of the staircases lead
          almost straight to the open air,, through a compartment
          vhich is separated from the main part of the building.
          The third staircase .is not so veil separated and some
          structural vork may be needed.      Apparently the paint
          store is beside this staircase.      This may not be vise.
                    There may veil be requests from the fire officer
          for CQnsiderable extra precautions and structural...
          alterations in this buildi’Sg.

          If it is required to increase this capacity at some
   time in the future Spion Kop could be 'squared off' at the
   back using a steel framed structure and perhaps a further

              ■This total should not at this stage be taken as
    more than a broad guess.      We may have pleasant surprises
    but there could be shocks.       The total does not contain
    any allowance for the local authority's charges In
    connection vith the issuing of the licence or for our
    professional fees.


    Future Action
           Subject to your approval ve suggest that the next
    steps might be as follovs

    1.        We should pass copies of all dravlngs to the police,
              the fire brigade, the d t y Building Surveyor and the
              County Council.    In addition to dravings shoving
              the results of our surveys of the Kop, the Leppings
              Lane terrace and the south stand, ve are preparing
              suitable dravings of the north and vest stands,
              measuring from the photo-copies of Husbands dravings.

    2.        We should make firm proposals to the police and the
              fire brigade for the nev crush barriers, together
              vith our computation of the number of spectators, and
              invite comments including a ny suggestions of further
              measures vhich may be needed.

    3.        At the same time ve should make detailed dravings and
              specifications for the strengthening vork on the
              barriers vhich are knovn to be veak, andfor the con­
               struction of the nev barriers, and obtain tenders.

     6.     Ve should discuss vith the police and fire officer
            vhat other services such as alarms, communications
             etc. are needed, prepare an agreed scheme and
            obtain tenders.   _


     A Meeting vith The Club
            You may feel that another meeting to discuss this
     report and the suggestions for further action, should be
     held shortly.     Dr. Eastvood vill be out of the country
     for three veeks from 22 January so that the veek beginning

                                                    REPORT ON GROUND CAPACITY


                      This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
      which is attainable.
                      It deals in broad terms -with the necessary strengthening
      and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
       calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
                      Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
       the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
      made at the end of the third round’cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
                      The green guide has been used as a basis fot our cal­
       culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
      will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
       guide.             Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
       fire officer and the police.

        Standing Accommodation
        (a)         Splon Kop
                               The general layout of Spion Kop is good.               It
                    has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
                   well below the maximum laid down in the guide.                 The
                    slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
                    for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                               The only questions therefore are the adequacy
                   of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
                   permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
                    the exits.
                               Where the barriers are adequate in strength
                   and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                                        2
                   of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m                of plan
                   area.            Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                                      2
                   Sop is approximately 3120m             which would provide
                   accommodation for 16,85Q spectators.
                               Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
                   standards.            Category A must be able to withstand a
                   test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
                   and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/aetre (290 lb/foot)
                   In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
                   and Brocklebank Ltd.            Of the 101 barriers on Spion
                   Sop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
                   a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
                    incipient defect which needed attention.                Most of
                   those which failed the test, failed so badly -tha* they
                   would-probably, not .satisfy, category B standard .either-...
                   On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
                   long barrier which was weak.             It should be emphasised
                   that the general-situation was satisfactory comp&red^
                   with most grounds.
                          Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the

              barriers up to a uniform category A standard.             It
              should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
              the tests and there may have been some deterioration
              due to rusting.         Most of the barriers are made from
              2 $" diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
              inches when new.           Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s
              atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
              to more rusting than others and it is possible that
              there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
                        Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m, the
              maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
              guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5° to 2.9m
              for slopes of 30°.           These figures apply to 'peak viewing*

              for which the recommended spacing is 3. 6m.            The slope of the
              upper part        changes to 25° for which the spacing is
              3.1m.
                        Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
              Spion Kop could be considered as not being 'peak
              viewing areas' we are prepared to accede to the police
              view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
              This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
              ground.
                        We propose that the existing barriers should be
              supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
              drawing-1610/1X.   The green shaded area behind   each

              available for spectators.   This area is 29 58m which
                                     2
              at 54 persons/lOm          gives a capacity of 15,973.     It
              should-be kept- in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators
              have been admitted to the Kop In the past.

        Spion Kop has three exits, one near each
  end and one at the top.       The total width of
  these three exits at their narrowest points is 12 .5m.
  The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
  exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
  width.      Thus the theoretical time to discharge
  16,000 spectators from Spion Kop would be Ilf minutes,
  compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by the
                                                ..   4

  guide.      We do not consider this to be a serious _ —             j/,o O ;
^matter.       Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) i's very
  desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
  fire, or explosion, or structural failure.         . In the
  case of terracing it is only the impatience;of. spectators
 which might create danger.      We believe that for an
  interim period at least the evacuation time of'Ilf
 minutes should be acceptable.
           The exits at each end of the terrace are
 reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North
  end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
 recommended value of 8ft.     * This defect could be
 removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
  it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
 and the cost of modification is not justified in an
 existing structure.
           The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
  from handrails dividing it into lanes.      Some remodelling
 of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
 desirable.

j                 to move     quite considerable horizontal distances
                  to achieve good packing.         ■The full area would

i                 justify about 8000 spectators, but ve suggest it would
                  probably be appropriate to allow 10ft as the equivalent
                  of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
                  The barriers should be designed to match this figure
                  approximately.        Those barriers which cannot,withstand
f f               6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened/~and extra
                  ones provided where necessary.                   _ ...
                          The extra barriers required to achieve
                  approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
                  attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.

                          The three exits have a total width, of about
                                                                   « .          *                   ,

                  to leave the ground.       Thus the terrace could be
                  emptied in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                          The guide suggests that everyone o_n a- terrace
                  should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.                   There are
                  no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
                  exit.      But we feel this is of no consequence as

           shown on our drawing 1610/2X, the area which can
           be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
                                                        2
           shown in green.    This area is about 535m       corresponding
           to about 2900 spectators.     This would bring the total
           standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                   The exits serving this part of the terraces
           are very adequate in width and there will be no
           difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.     C


    Seating Accommodation
    (a)   ' The North Stand                                  :*
                   The form of construction of this stand is
           such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.-          The
           exits are numerous and spaced so that they .satisfy
           the recommendations of the guide.
                   The exits are very marginally below the „
           recommended 1-lm width, but we do not consider this
           to be of great consequence.
                   Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
           length (they widen round the exit).     This is well
           below the green guide recommendation.      However, it
           is clearly, appropriate to take into account the
           general nature of the stand, the number as well as
           the width of the gangways, and above all the .ease and
           speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                   On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
           leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
           The figures were 71, 72, SO and 73.     Thereafter
           the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
          This established that in an emergency the green guide
           figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l*lm gangway)
          can be achieved.     With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators
                                                               SHOT   7.


      PARTNERS




      the average is 556 per exit.     Thus the stand would
      empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
      recommended limit of eight minutes.
             Our observations in company with the fire
      officer^ staff on 6 January shoved that everyone
      had left this stand, apart from some people who were
      in no hurry, in about six minutes, although we also
      counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
      whistle.    The overall picture appears very satisfactory
      and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
      as not needing any significant modification.

(b)   The West Stand
             This stand is very similar to the north stand
      in its construction.      We were not able to accurately
      assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
      January because there were many seats which were unsold.
      However, there is every reason to believe that there
      will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
      eight minutes also.     There should be no need for
      significant modifications.

<c)   The South Stand
             The structure has been surveyed and appended
      are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
      show the plans and cross-section.     Also attached is
      a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
             The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
      has. 5710 seats.    These are served by 12 exits (excluding
      those serving the directors box) so that an average
      of 476 people need to pass through each exit.      The
      count by the fire officer's staff on 6 January showed
      an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
      exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
      seven minutes.     Indeed there were very few people
                                                                     Sheet   8

           still trying to get out six minutes after the final
           whistle.    A few had no doubt left early and a few
           were still standing around, but the stand had
           substantially emptied In about six minutes.
                  Having left the top of the stand the spectators
           have to make their way from the first floor landing
           via one of three staircases.    Two of these are 3.6m
           wide and the other 2.4.    This is equivalent to 17&
           ’lanes' of 550mm.    At 40 people per lane, 700 people
           pass per minute.    To discharge 5710 people (less
           those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
           exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                  At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
           almost straight to the open air, through a compartment
           which is separated from the main part of the building.
           The third staircase passes through a vide lobby vhich
           will probably need three sets of self closing fire
           doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
           The club intends to move the paint store from the
           space behind this staircase.
                  The front, open-air part of the south stand is
           veil endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
           one passage.    This passage has a theoretical capacity
           of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
           This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.      Because
           the stand is open to the air and there is very
           rea,dy access to the pitch we do not think this ra%

           long emptying time is of any great consequence.

          will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
          further visit.         We would like to be present when any
          further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
          being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood^s absence
          which will extend to 15 February.
                     If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
          post they would like, this can be considered by the club
          and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
                     A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
          might be held around say 16 February.
                     In the meantime Eastwood & Partners will be checking
          the various electrical services so that we shall be in a
          position to discuss these at the meeting.


          Future Ground Capacity
                     Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
         out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
          ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows
                     Seating approximately                  24.000
                     Standing on Spion Kop                  16.000
                     Standing at Leppings Lane end
                     (total including N.W. corner)          10,100

                                                            50,100

                     It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
         has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
         be admitted to the ground.--        '-this -involved of-the.-order-of-
         19.000 - 20,000 spectators being .on Spion Kop.             ..Indeed, .it ... . .
          is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
         70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
         Kop probably‘approached 30,000.-                      —     .. ..... ......... .
                     It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
         excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

     L.____ Purpose of Meeting

     Following the Working Party's meeting with the representatives of the
     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December, 1978, the
     Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January, 1979) circulated a
     Report, together with Plans, drawn up by Dr. W. Eastwood of Eastwood
     and Partners. The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
     16th February, 1979, to discuss the documents.

     The purpose of today's meeting was to consider theviews which the Working
     Party should put to the Club on the 16th February.

     2.____ Plans

     (a)    Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants" stated that detailed
     plans at 1:100 scale should be supplied of all buildings and other accommodation
     for spectators, some of the plans supplied were to 1:200 scale. The Fire
     Service felt that the1'latter size were acceptable provided all of the plans were
     to the same scale, and it was AGREED that the "Notes for the Guidance of
     Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

     (b)    The site plan at 1:500 scale had not been supplied as required by the
     Notes, but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in time for
     Friday's meeting. The firm had also promised that all site fixtures would be
     Indicated on that plan.
                                              1.
(d)    Tbe County Council's hope was that, in view cf Ilraited resources in
the .Architectural t Building Services Division, the plans supplied and finally
accepted by the Working Party could form the basis of the Certificate
Drawings.

3.     Report

(a)    General

It was recognised that the criteria set out In the Home Office ’’Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)" required new work or reconstruction
to be to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
In existing situations the criterion was that of a reasonable degree of safety.
As the Guide stated, it wouid be unreasonable, even if it were practicable,
to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

With these factors in mind, both the Fire Service and the Police felt that
the flow' of spectators was the most Jmportant criteria to be adopted.
■Whilst not disagreeing with this Viewpoint, the Building Authority suggested
it would be useful to know the reasoning behind the recommendation in the
Guide that gangways should not be less than 1.1 m etres wide. The County
Council .AGREED to try to find this information out, and the Fire Service
AGREED they would contact their colleagues in other areas who had been
Involved in the Certification process to ascertain how nearly the 1.1 metre
gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations in their
respective areas.

At the request of the Fire Service, the County Council also AGREED to try
and find out if there m s any general recommendation on reduced
admission if a ground were used at.a night time instead of during the day
time.

.Whilst it was probably a typing mistake, it was AGREED that the wording
on the Front Cover should’ read "REPORT TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY
 COUNCIL" and not "REPORT OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL".
 (C)    S ^ :on


The Working party zzreed with the Club's view that, with the existing three
exits, there was no wav that the recommended discharge time of S minutes
could be met. Where they.disagreed was that an evacuation time of I l f
minutes should be regarded as acceptable. If d o more exits were to be
provided, the Work:.::? Party AGREED that a crowd limitation of 11,040
on the Spion Kop should he imposed.

The existing exit at the North end passed under a bridge with a headroom
below agreed by the Club to be less than the recommended value of Sft.
As this was in fact some 6'6", the Working Party AGREED that the Club
be informed that in their view it is essential that the fiocr be lowered to
remove this danger to spectators.

The exit at the South side would also require widening, and possibly flow
barriers would need installing.

The area at the back of the Kop would also require close attention.

If new exits were to be provided by the Club, it was AGREED that at least
TWO would be required. The most economical way of providing one would
be to use the gates in the existing barrier, provided these were lined up with
the gangways, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other uould
require to be a completely new exit.

The Building Authority felt that the majority of the crush barriers would fail
the tests, and consequently any necessary re-siting would probably not be
too much of a problem. Certainly the suggested additional barriers would
require careful consideration.

For the purposes of crowd control, the Police suggested there should be some
form of lateral separation. The Working Party AGREED, and it was suggested
that three metal fences sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
to the gangways) should be provided, with access between each limited to a
padlocked gateway under the controLof the Police.

As recent adverse weather conditions had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
could cause problems, and it was AGREED that Paragraph 11 0} of the draft
Certificate should be amended so as to require the Club to take steps to
clear the Kop of ice and snow before a game was played.

The Building Authority pointed out that information was still required from
the Club on profile and step dimensions and the slope of the Kop.

(a)     The W e s t T e r r a c e   'p.'res 4&5)

In view of the lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the
spectator limit to 7,200, and the discharge time of 6.6 minutes, the
Working Party AGREED that it would be unreasonable to insist that
gangways or additional exits must be provided.

However, even if the existing crush barriers were to pass the tests, the
Working Party AGE ZED that the barriers would require special attention
in view of the apparant sharp edges, corrosion, etc.

(e)     The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

The Working Party AGREED there were no real problems here, but the
Building Authority pointed out that as well as the crush barriers, the
existing corrugated sheeting would require to pass the appropriate tests.

(f)     The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

Whilst the flow’ rates and discharge times were probably satisfactory (the
construction and width of the ramps being such that they could quite properly
be regarded as elevated roadways'), the fact remained that the gangways
the North Stand were only 640mm wide for much of their length, compared
with the recommended width^f 1.1 metres.

Additionally, observations had sho'.vn that two-thirds of the spectators used
the upper exit, whilst the remainder used the lower exit. An ideal would be
to provide additional exits at the top of the stand but, in view of its cantilever
construction, the cost would be prohibitive.

As an alternative, the Working Party AGREED that consideration might be
given to removing a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
to the upper exits, with a physical barrier a cro ss the stand below the upper
exits to ensure more equal use of both upper and lower exits by spectators.
If this would cause difficulties, a barrier in the gangways only below the upper     c
exits might be considered.

So far a s the Wire Mesh barriers under the stand were concerned, the
Working Party AGREED that these must either be removed or made of a
permanent construction.

(§)     The West Stand

Whilst the exits were adequate and well spaced and the discharge times
were acceptable in view of the type of stand, the Fire Service felt that
                                         _4-




                                                                       ©

 by way of two srnircsscs. The V,'or'-'!ng Party A CTi HL'I> thru it was es^crsiis:
 that another staircase be provided, 2nd one on the south--,vest corner waj foit
 to be the most acceptable.

 (h)    The South Stand (pages 7 L 5)

So far as the seating arrangements were concerned, the Working Party-
felt that it was the front, open air part which caused the concern. Because
of the bad ingress/egress, the Vvorking party AGBZZD that two additional
exits would be required. It was suggested that the most economical way of
doing this was by means of one discharging at the Spion Kop end and the
other by breaking through the wall by the Tea Bar.

Additionally, the penning arrangements of the seating would need to be
looked at closely.

As the balustrades and handrails were constructed of timber, the Building
Authority considered they would be likely to fail the appropriate tests.
Also, as the staircase was a 24 instead of the maximum 12 riser recommended
in the Guide it was probable that this would have to be reconstructed.

Contrary to their initial reaction, the Fire Service felt that, provided that the
necessary increased fire resistance measures were carried out, the stand
would not be the problem from a combustability point of view that they had
anticipated.

The Building Authority expressed concern as to the corrosion of the steel
work of the stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

The Police expressed concern about the use of the car park behind the
Stand. Persons entitled to use this car park frequently arrived just before
the start of a match and drove through the spectators attempting to gain
access to the ground. As they left immediately afterwards, the same thing
occurred at the end of a m atch.. This practice had to be stopped, either by
banning the use of the car park entirely on match days or imposing some sort
of time restriction on its use before and after a match.

 (h)    General Requirements

■ These were not discussed by the Working Party at this stage.

I refer to my minute of 5th March, 1979, and to the reoenft telephone
conversation* between Mr. O. Vaughan of my staff and Divisional Officer
K. Jones of your Fire Prevention Secfltm.

Following the return from holiday of the Chairman of the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Dub Ltd., the Club Secretary Informed me that the 30th March,
1979 was not convenient. That meeting has, therefore, now been arranged
for 2.30 p.m. on Monday, 2nd April, 1979, after conferring with the members
of the Working Party.

However, because of evident differences of opinion on means of escape,
the original time and date of 10.00 a.m. on 30th March, 1979 (but at
your Headquarters) Is being retained to discuss these differences, prior
to meeting the Club.                                             *     11

Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
weather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
date, the purpose of the meeting was to review the position since 12th February,
1979, prior to the re-arranged mseting with the Club which was now to take
place on 2nd April, 1979.

2.       Plans

The plans at 1:500 scale and indicating all site fixtures were, it was still understood,
to be supplied by Eastwood & Partners at the meeting with the Club.

3_._____ Report
(a)      General
         t

The County”Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
information additional to that contained in their various Circulars. Basically,
they had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not
lower than that set out in the Guide. However, the maximum flexibility had
to be maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in such
matters as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

The Fire Service had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
and only in one case had the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
adhered to.

                                   1
(b)      Spion Kop (pages 2, 3 k 4)

Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
expressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
and the loose and broken concrete at the bottom In particular. If attention
was not given to this, It was AGREED that It would be necessary to restrict
admission to the Kop, additional to the .restriction to 11, C40 if the extra
exits are not provided.               '   ~*

On the question of exits, it was again-AGREED that it was essential to line
up the gates in the existing b a rrie r with the gangways. Of the existing two
exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on
the embankment at the exit at the r e a r . After discussion, it was AGREED
that the best compromise was to leave things as they existed, provided
handrails are provided on the stairways, taking into account the
desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.

The F ire Service queried the exact form of the lateral separation discussed
at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
bearing on the means of escape recommendations. After discussion, it
was AGREED that the metal fences should not be of the climb-proof type,
that it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
in consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
However, it was AGREED that it was still desirable to seek 3 x 2 central
b a rrie rs but, if the Club really resisted the suggestion, 2 x 2 could
reluctantly be conceded. The Building Authority stressed that whatever
b a rrie rs were provided would have to pass the appropriate strain tests.

The fact that the height of many of the existing crush barriers was below the
recommendation in the Guide, in some cases well below, was pointed out by the
Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the last meeting was
also reiterated. It was AGREED that these points must be drawn to the
Club's attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

(c)      The West T errace (pages 4 & 5)

As well as the condition of the crush b a rrie rs mentioned at the last meeting,
the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
terracing in small areas near to the stand. The cross-fall on the steps on
the north-west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw
people forward. The height of the crush b a rrie rs mentioned in regard to the
Spion Kop also applied. It was AGREED that all these points must be drawn
to the Club's attention.

(d)       The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete T errace (pages 5 & 6)

Having now had the opportunity of having a closer look at the existing corrugated
sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteration to
meet the requirements of the Guide.
(e)      The North Stand (pages 6 & 7) _

The removal of a row of seats from the top of the st2 sd down each gangway
to the upper exits and the removal of four seats at those exits was
confirmed as being a reasonable compromise to put to the Club.

As the asbestos sheets at the top of the^eSnd were protected, the Building
Authority felt that these could be accepted, and confirmed that the glazing
at the ends of the stands was not glass and so would not shatter.

(f)      The West Stand (page 7)

Consideration was given to the Building Authority’s suggestion of lateral
gangways and the segregation of exits but, after discussion, it was AGREED
that the additional staircase agreed at the last meeting should be coiifirmed.
So long as it was of 4-unit exit width, it was A G R E E D it was not necessary
to insist it should be on the south-west corner. Such staircases could be
bought "off the peg" and, if not installed in the close season, it was
A G R E E D that a $ reduction in capacity would be necessary.

(g)      The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

As mentioned at the last meeting, the penning arrangements of the seating
and the numbers of scats in the rows caused problems. Bearing in mind the
need for reasocaDleness and to make the situation better, it was AGREED
that, even though not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the best
compromise was to see!: the removal of the existing barriers and their
re-alignment, together with the widening of the gangways at the position
of the wings.

The Fire Service pointed out and it was A G R E E D that Fire Resisting Doors
would be required leading to the Directors’seating, and 1 hour fire
resistance would be required for all problem areas under the stand. This
could be reduced to £ hoar if automatic detection equipment were to be
Installed.

For their part, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
corrosion of the steelwork of the stand, and also pointed out the concrete
spalling which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the balustradiug,
barriers and guardrails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
It was A G R E E D all would need to be given attention by the Club.

(h)      General Requirements (pages 8 & 9)

As well as the Fire Service pointing out that the present temporary
structures used for police and first-aid purposes would neeo removal
from a means of escape point of view if the capacity of the North Stand


                                   3   .   -------
wus not to be reduced, the Police stated that they were ready to discuss
with the Club the facilities they would require. Briefly, they envisaged
a permanent structure almost twice as large as the existing temporary
structure, and expected communications, detention, toilet, parade room,
etc., facilities.

So far as First-Aid was concerned, the Sheffield Area Health Authority
had confirmed their willingness to provide advice on First-Aid and
Medical Facilities, but the person nominated (Dr.               - Specialist
in Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
2nd April, 1979. He had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd April, but it was recognised that possible practical difficulties might
prevent his doing so.

                H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions

Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best In Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewedpurely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of the Club's activities. The Club’s
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time limits for the issue of
General Safety Certificates, it was essential to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.
2.    That, as the Club wanted to attract representative games, the aim should
be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

3.    That as much work as possible should be carried out In the close season,
bearing In mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
will be more restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah's Witness Bally had
also to be borne In mind.

2.    Discussion on Standing Areas

A.    Spion Kop

IT W A S A G B E E D -

1.    That the 6ltlng and angle of the new barriers to be installed be the subject
of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

2.    That the Club consider the installation of simple lateral barriers (not of the
climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either 6ide of the
central block (but not so as to obstruct the gangways).

3.    That, In view of the clearance time of Ilf minutes compared with the
8 minutes specified in the Guide, the means of escape be discussed in detail
between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service (including the re-sitlng of the gates
in the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
an Increase in their number).

4.  That the headroom at the North end under the bric&e be Increased to the
maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

5.    That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
be tested to the appropriate standards.

6.   That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the
crush barriers and the scoreboard structure be the subject of detailed discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

7.   That the Club's longer term proposals for the improvement of the means of
egress be unanimously welcomed.

8.    That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
points have been resolved.
B.    W est T e r r a c e

IT W A S AGREED-.

1. * That the Club's proposals for the installation of additional barriers and the
reduction In capacity to 7,200 spectators without the need for additional gangways
should be Implemented.

2.    That the question of the cross-fail on the steps on the north-west corner
exit, the height of some of the existing crush barriers, as well as their corrosion
and sharp edges in places, be the subject of detailed discussion between
Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

C.    North West Corner Terrace

IT W A S A G R E E D -

1.    That the Clubs proposals to bring the crush barriers up to standard and
supplemented by new barriers with a consequent capacity of 2,900 spectators should
be Implemented.

2.    That the improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting be
the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

3.    North Stand

IT W A S A G R E E D -

1.    That, in view of the obvious difference of opinion between the Club and the
Working Party as to the appropriate steps (ifany) to be taken over the width of the
existing gangways, both sides be requested to consider all the points made, and
to re-consider the matter at the next meeting.

2.    That the question of fire protection works to the Store Room and to file Team
Room be the subject of detailed discussions between Dr.- Eastwood and the
Fire Service.

3.     That the replacement (from a fire hazard point of view) of the existing Police
and First-Aid Temporary Structures under the Stand be accepted In principle, and
that the facilities required In the new permanent structures be considered later in
the Agenda.

4.    That the existing Wire Mesh barriers under the Stand be the subject of
discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service.

5.   That the question of the provision of handrails be the subject of discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.
                                         3.




                   ■o
4.     W est Stand

 IT W A S AG B E E D -

That, whilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied in the required time,
consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur in the lower
level by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
end of the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for emergency use, rather
than for normal use).

5.     South Stand

IT W A S A G R E E D -

1.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor discuss in detail the apparent
spalling of the concrete frame at high levels, apparent corrosion of the main
steelwork columns, removal of the timber casing at base level for inspection (2
only as representative sample), and load testing of a representative sample of
single and double skin wails.

2.    That, to overcome the means of escape problems In the upper part of the
Stand (the covered area), the existing barriers be removed altogether, the Club
to deal with any problems about different admission charges by way of coloured
seats or some such alternative.

3.     That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
fire resistance in the central area, protected escape routes, and the provision of
handrails down the stairways.

4.    That the means of escape problems in the front open air part of the stand
be dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only

               South Stand

 1.                        The fire-services officer proposed a new exit from the
                   front terracing under the stand and through a new 1.2m wide
               door adjacent to the existing snack bar.                                                        Wall surrounding
                   this area to have 1 hour fire resistance.                                                    Existing doors
                   to be self closing with 1 hour fire resistance.

  2.                     The fire officers requested that all walls enclosing
               offices, lounges, bars and the press box have 1 hours fire
                   resistance.                    It was agreed by Building Surveyors representatives
               that the existing construction could be upgraded by forming
                   a sandwich using 'Supertex* or a similar product.

 3.                         Mr. Jones is to send to Eastwood and Partners a copy
               of     South Stand seating plan showing his proposals for removing
               seats to increase the capacity of gangways after dividing
                   barriers are removed.

EASTWOOD f t PARTNERS




 4.          Mr. Mills requested that the brick staircase walls be
       buttressed where crowd surge pressure could be generated.
        (At a later inspection the location of these buttresses
       was agreed).      Handrails to be added as was agreed at the
       meeting on 2 April.

 5.          Prior to the meeting the     bases of two stanchions had
       been exposed by removing floor timber.       Rusting is not
       excessive.       All bases will be exposed for inspection.    If
       necessary steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts
       before encasing in concrete for permanent protection.
             In inspecting the two bases,waste paper, and shavings
       of wood together with cigarette ends were found in considerable
       quantities beneath the floor boards.       The club to be advised
       that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.


       North Stand
 6.         It was agreed to recommend to the club that      10 seats
       would be removed from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats
       from in front of each of the 9 upper exits.       The total
       number of seats lost is therefore 126 compared with 225
       in the original proposals.


       Spion Kop
 7.         Eastwood and Partners to send revised copies     of drawing
       number 1610/1X showing the new crush barrier layout including
       two lines of radial barriers to Mr. Mills and Mr. Jones
       for their comments.

 8.         Eastwood's proposals for improving the existing upper
       Exit from Spion Kop agreed in principle as shown      on drawing
       1610/12.     The dividing handrail on the ramp will be taken
       past the whole of the first staircase.                             ^

 9.         The Building Surveyors representative asked that the
       scoreboard structure be surveyed with particular reference
       to stability under wind loading.

Apologies for absence were received from Dr.            (Sheffield Area Health
Authority) and H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).

The Note (previously circulated) of the meeting held on 2ndApril, 1979, was considered
in conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a meeting between Esstwood
and Partners, the South Yorkshire County F ire Service and the City of Sheffield
Metropolitan District Council B u ild in g Surveyor's Department held on 13th April, 1979.

The Note of the meeting held on 2nd April, 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
amendments and additions in the light of the further investigations and discussions:-

2A     Spion Kop

Paras. 1 & 2 - Revised copies of drawing no. 1610/lX were circulated at the meeting
showing the proposed new crush b arrier layout, including the two lines of radial
b a rrie rs. This was AGREED in principle.

Para. 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the Kop a s existing would mean an ur.scceptable
evacuation time of some 12^ minutes. L arger and re-aligned gates in the barrier
and improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce this time to some 10 minutes,
but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 metre overt:l width.
This could bo integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging and rrofing the
Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.
 Para. 4 - The exploratory work regarding         improvement of the headroom had
 still to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major item.

 Para. 5 - Because of the difficulty in devisir^ a suitable method of testing in places
 (such as the top of the Kop), it was A G R E E D that proposals should be formulated
 after further discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

 Para. 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
 structure should be looked at. It was AGR E E D that the question of the h-aight of some
 of the crush barriers be considered again afior it was seen which of them failed on
 testing.

para. 7 - The Club stressed that their proposals for the Improvement of the means of
egress would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

Para. 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together with
the installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates in the exist! ’.
barrier, could all be carried out in the close season. Their aim was to achieve a
16, 850 crowd capacity.

2B    • West Terrace

Para. 2 - The Club accepted that in view of the cross-fall on the north-west corner
exit, the steps should be re-built. It was A G R E E D that the other matters would be
considered again after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.

2C     North West Corner Terrace

Para. 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the improvement or replacement of the
existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
out more extensive works so as to bring the existing unused area into use for an
additional 250/300 spectators,

3.     North Stand

Para. 1 - Dr. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
agreement on a scheme which could be recommended to the Club. This would
involve the removal of 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from in
front of each of the 9 upper exits. The result would mean a loss of 126 seats
compared to the 225 in the original proposals. The Club A G R E E D to give
consideration to the proposal.

para. 2 - The word at the end of the first line should have been ,Tea* and not ’Team’.
It was A G R E E D that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service would discuss in detail any
fire protection works considered to be nccessory.
 4.      W est Stand

 The Club A G R E E D that additional exits of simple steel construction should be
 provided from each end of the upper stand.

 5.     South Stand

Para. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor timber.
Whilst rusting was not excessive, it was A G B E E D    ,th.at all bases would be expcsed for
Inspection and, if necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
encasing in concrete for permanent protection. Because of the apparent accumulation
of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
Club also A G B E E D that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

Para. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely, it was A G B E E D that
it would not be necessary to remove any seats for escape purposes in the upper part
of the stand (the covered area).

Para. 3 - It was A G B E E D that timber handrails should be provided down each of the
outer edges of the main stairca^erthat the existing ironcentre railing should remain,
and that a new handrail down thecentre of each side of thestairway should be installed.
It was also A G B E E D that the brick staircase walls should be buttressed where crowd
suige pressure could be generated.

Para. 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, it was .AGBEED
that on the west side a new exit through a new 1.2 metre wide door adjacent to the existing
snack bar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance measures in the
surrounding area. On the east side, consideration was given to an extension of the
footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
isolated from the Kop exit. It was A G R E E D that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
should consider precisely what measures could be considered satisfactory so as to
avoid any loss of seats.

6.     Ground Exits

The 1:500 site plan was in the process of being circulated.

7.     Communications

The Club stressed they were thinking in terms of an upgrading of the existing public
address system. It was A G B E E D that the Police should have an over-ride facility
from their Police Boom, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility o?
achieving this through radio, rather than wire, means.

8.     Police and First Aid Facilities

Paras. 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that it was essential that there was no gap l:i
the provision of Police Facilities when the temporary, structure was replaced by
the permanent structure. With this in mind, they were happy for the safety an:.::ts


                                      3.
 to receive first priority and to wait /or the 19S0 close season for the work to be
 carried out. It was understood that D r . h a d not yet completed his investigations
 Into the fii'st-aid and medical facilities.

 9.     Any other Topics

 The evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to test the existing
 emergency lighting equipment.

 10.*   Future Action

 Mr. McGee stressed that it was essential for decisions to be taken urgently if the
. Club were to complete their plans, both from a.financial and practical point of view.

The Club were to make application for financial assistance under the Football
Association's Ground Improvement Scheme, and had to have over 50,000 crowd
capacity if the aim of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The latest •*
proposals, If implemented, appeared to give a capacity of some 50,750.

So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working Party asked for
2 copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
Fire Service and the Building Surveyor.

Mr. McGee requested that he be advised If It appeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.                                                                    .

2.      Replace existing wire mesh barriers by suitable substantial barriers

North-West Terrace

1.      Replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear is required.               ^

2.      The removal of under-strength barriers and their replacement by new ones
         constructed to guide recommendations.

Soion    Kop


1.      Die arrangement for crush barriers'as produced by the consultant, whilst
        not complying fully with the guide recommendations, is considered adequate
        if the other requirements are fulfilled. These other requirements include
        the 2 No. radial barriers indicated on Flan 1XA and the provision of an *
        additional 3 m wide egress route to South-East area, and of gated openings
        to give access from the radial gangways to the ground perimeter area.

2.      Make good all broken and spalled concrete -terracing.

3.      Increase headroom to North-East egress route to a minimum of 2.1 m.

4.      Check and carry out any necessary work to ensure safety of   6 core-board
         building. •                                    -                             .

        replaced,-or strengthened, where necessary.

2.      Provision of handrails and suitable headroom to egress routes to be re­
        assessed after re-routing of gangways etc. has been carried out.

3   .   Fire resistance and restriction of flame spread to be improved to all areas
        as discussed; the consultant is to confirm the work proposed to be carried
        out. Arrangements to be made for-lhe clearance of all combustible material
        from under 6 tand areas.
With regard to future meetings I thinkit is essential that all matters agreed
he recorded| as we are now approaching finality is masy areas and it is necessary
that we have recorded exactly the agreed matters.

I-would also suggest that in view of the approach of certification it would,
perhaps, he advisable to hold future meetings away from the ground, and that
Mr. Vaughan, as the co-ordinator, should chair such meetings.

           Dear Sir

            I refer to your letter, reference number DV/AW/5 8 3 , dated 20 April 1979,
            concerning the above .matter.

           The requirements I wish to see imposed are ae follows:-

            1.         The existing crush barriers at the ground be tested on a load of
                       UOO lb./ft., the maximum required by the guide to the Act. (This is
                       to be done immediately and, thereafter, 2 0 per cent of the crush
                       barriers, chosen at random, to be tested each year, ensuring that
                       each crush barrier is tested at least once every five years)

           2.          Vertical barriers be placed on the Spion Kop to prevent lateral
                       movement of the crowd.                                                                •
                                                                                                             l
                                                                                                             l
           3   . Gateways in the existing perimeter fencing be realigned with the
                 gangways of the Spion Kop.

           k.          The police have the facility to override the public address system.

           5   . A suitable police room be provided.

           Representatives of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have accepted
           these proposals without demur and, with the. exception of item 5 , will be
           carried out during the close season of 1979. The police room will be
           provided during 1 9 8 Q.

           At the request of your Mr. D. J. Shirtcliffe, I cub enclosing a copy of
           a sketch of the proposed police room.

                        area.

    L.          Training of Safety Stewards and Staff

                To ensure that the Safety Stewards and Staff are conversant with the safety
                precautions they will be expected to administer, a meeting should be arranged
                with the Fire Service, suitable to all parties.

                        rectangle containing the letter 'E'.

                2.     If the proposed rewiring of the emergency lighting system Is adopted
                        as discussed by Mr. Clough and Divisional Officer Jones tfien, with the     /
                        reduced lighting output, it may be necessary to provide a number of
                        illuminated exit boxes.

N.       Emergency Procedure

         Emergency procedure notices should be placed at strategic points throughout            y   f
         the ground.

    O.   Access for Emergency Vehicles

         1.       Adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct
                  access can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of      fVv£.£ *
                  the stadium.
                                                                                          ■2 * d * •
         2.       Ensure that parked vehicles will not obstruct emergency vehicles on
                  these access roads.

                                                                                                /
A        The existing public address system to be upgraded, with the Police having aa      \r
         over-ride facility from their Police Room.

Q.       Police Facilities

         A suitable permanent Police Room (with facilities as shcrwn on the sketch plan      ✓
         marked AA )to be provided in the 1980 close season.

    R.   First Aid Facilities

         (i)      Structure

             The existing facilities are considered to be below an acceptable standard
             and it is suggested the Club consider providing a more permanent
  (Vf ^ ^    structure which is not likely to require up-grading for a very long time.


V
I■    t "L ' The internal finish, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
      fc,;t
l ia         impervious natureso that It can be easilycleaned andrendered fairly
   1/        sterile and require nodecoration. Thiscan be achieved by the use of
             tiles or formica type finish etc....

         (II)     Waiting Area '

                  The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise .
                  the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

          (III)   Treatment Area

                  The'Treatment- Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or-three..
                  patients at any one time, and consideration should be given to the needs
                  for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
                  patients may well be lying on couches.



                                            5.
(IV )    Lighting •

         Good lighting is essential and strip lighting would be satisfactory. The
         provision of a power, point would also be a basic requirement.
                                *

(v)      Water

         A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
         for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
         be provided. The Club might consider whether It would be cheaper In
         the long run to provide stainless steel basins which are not subject to
         chipping.

(vi)     Toilet Requirements

         The Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
         the use of the public, and should consider whether they should provide
         an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

(vii)    Storage

         Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets of
         wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage should
         be lockable.

(viii)   Equipment

         The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service:-

         Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three In number depending
         on space available and/or number of cuhlcles, if the accommodation Is
         cubicled.

         Six Stretchers.
         Two sets of stretcher wheels.
         20 Blankets. '
         Six Pillows.
         One Minute-Man Resuscltator.

(Ix)     Telephone Facilities

         • A telephone facility would appear to be basic In 1979. This could be___
          achieved by an extension from the main switch, or by sharing with
          police.

         (x)          Car Parking

                      The Club might also consider what facilities could be extended to the
                      St. John’s personnel for the parking of staff c a rs .

^        .      To prevent local damage to the sheeting, particularly u.t the joints and to
                 spread the anticipated load over a larger area than at present, itwas agreed
                 that a continuous horizontal timber member-should be -fixed to the front of the
                sheets at a height about one metre from terrace level.

                 It was agreed that, whilst the only positive way of proving the adequacy of the
                -joint between the new and existing construction was by means of a test load,
                 the calculations provided would be regarded as acceptable.

  K.        Emergency Lighting

  1&        It was obvious that there was a difference cf opinion as to what could be
  2         regarded as acceptable as regards the emergency lighting in the South
            Stand. It was agreed that a trial should be conducted during the hours cf
             darkness attsndad by repr^seutatives cf ifcs Club and the Fire Service so
             as to identify the danger areas. Consideration would then be given to
             possibly installing an extra battery and additional wiring to those particular
             areas not covered by the emergency lighting covering other parts of tbe
             ground.

 J\____ Firs Warning System

            The problems with the public address systems eemed to be mainly ones of
            diction and correct volume levels- It was agreed that the police wouldmonitor the
            position at the next heme match and, pending the new police control post being
            erected, would arrange for an officer to sit alongside the Disc Jockey in the
            meantime.

            It was also agreed that the monitoring point for the fire date-gtl-gn equipment
            should be in the tower between the South and West Stands, and would proceed
            once the electrical work was completed.         •

  J.____ Fi re Extinguishers

              The Club explained that it would be preferable from a building point of view
              for boththe police and first aid facilities to be ia the same overall building

              position on this point, pending the outcome of detailed discussions with the
          •   Club.

              The question of parking for both police and St. John's personael purposes
              would also need to be looked at in detail.

I .____Purpose cf Meeting

 The original Intention of the visit had been to check that the outstanding matters
 referred to in the Note of the meeting held on 12th November had been completed
-or were In the course of completion prior to the anticipated Issue of the Certificate •
 by the County Council this week.

 2.____Minor Matters .^

An inspection of the ground showed that a number of minor matters still required
attention, but the Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to in the ib xt
few days.

3.     Major Matters

A.     Emergency Lighting - South Stand

The meetings which had taken place between the County Fire Service and Messrs.
Eastwood and Partners since 12th November on the South Stand Emergency Lighting
had produced agreement on an interim arrangement which would be regarded as



                                       1   G   0   D                          ^

acceptable for the duration of the existing battery Ufe. Further modifications at
that time would remedy the shortcomings of the existing installation. Details were
contained in the letter dated 12th December which Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
had addressed to the Fire Service.

B.     South Stand Construction

The Euildlng Authority expressed concern as to what they saw as a lack of structural
Integrity In the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
progressive deterioration of the Stand which, it was felt, could only be properly
determined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded .by Messrs. Eastwood
and Partners In the last week was not considered to be sufficiently comprehensive
to provide tlB required Information, and the basis of calculation used could not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst Itwas agreed that there had not been a specific
written request for such a full structural survey cf the South Stand, the Euildlng
Authority felt that It had been Inherent In the detailed discussions which had taken
place that such a report would be forthcoming. The Building Authority were
concerned at the possibility that the requirements of the Eulldlng Regulations and
the Code of Practice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
stability of the South Stand In conditions of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
was mentioned.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
same specification or the sans construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
that, for instance, none of the buildings In Sheffield built before 1970 could meet
the latest wind pressure requirements. Even the Building Research Station was n
evidently thinking in terms that these requirements were unreallstically high. In
his professional opinion, the Stand was structurally safe and able In practice to meet
the loadings demanded. In any case, the conditions which had been described as
being possibly dangerous would mean In practice that a match could not be played
and consequently no spectators would be present.

Experience of the corrosion of Indoors steel In tlB Sheffield area showed this to be
minimal, and the Stand was regularly test loaded by spectators. Structures -such
as this would show obvious external signs, such as cracks, well before thsre was
any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
visual Inspection. Even though he did not consider It essential, pla ting of the
front steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and meet the
Building Authority's concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing
maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different matter to saying there
was a structural problem. Reference was ma'de to the Guide's advice that when
assessing whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of spectators,
the criterion to be used is that of a reasonable degree cf safety. In Dr. Eastwood's
view, it would be unreasonable and unnecessary to Insist on a full structural survey
of the South Stand or to delay the Issue of the Certificate. It was his professional
opinion (which he was most jealous of and would not put In jeopardy) that the South
Stand was structurally safe and that the basis of the calculations provided was
appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to use the appeal procedure open
to them should this be necessary.
IT W A S A G R E E D that:

(a)     as there was no obvious deterioration In the South Stand structure of such
        a-nature as to be of immediate concern, no objection would be raised to the
        continuance of the derby game with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
        provided that no extreme weather conditions occurred inthe intervening
        period, and

(b)      a fur&er meeting should be held as a matter of urgency between the Building
         Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood to discuss tie structural Integrity of the
        South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
        to be present at Dr. Eastwood's request).

N O T E As the discussions on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
        theories and practices, the Fire Service and Police representatives felt
      " there was little they could contribute and left the meeting prior to Its
        termination.

   Gratton       on the 19th December 1979, Z have had the opportunity of
 ?• Division     inspecting your proposed plans for the constraction of a
                 Police rooo at that stadiuru

                 The plans appear adequate and Z have no cement to na.ke,
                 however Z note that on the coin plan it is intended to divide
                 the sale toilets for staff and prisoners, although Z understand
                 this is not practicable so far as the fer&le toilets are
                 concerned.

                 Frca a welfare point of view, Z an sure that it vrould be core
                 acceptable if seperate toilet facilities could be nade
                 available for female officers.

  Dear Mr. England,
                  Certificate of Ground Safety, 1979
             Test on Crush Barrier*, Balustrades and Fences
        We have pleasure in presenting a formal report drawing
  together the results of all the load tests on crush barriers,
  fences etc. which were carried out between June and December
  1979.

   rush Barriers
        The first series of tests were made on all the barriers
  existing at the tine of the application for a safety certificate.
  These are shown on the attached prints of drawings Nos. 1610/61 and
  62.   The barrier numbers used in the following descriptions of
  the tests are as shown on these two drawings.

  (a)     A total of 19 barriers failed to carry the specified test
          load of 6 kN/m length when first tested.   Seven of these
          failures (Nos. 40, 41, 42, 57, 58, 62 and 68) were caused
          by defective retaining clips on the horizontal rails.
          Seven failed because the horizontal rail suffered permanent
          deformation (Nos. 34, 87, 91, 92, 93, 97 and 98) and five
          failed because of bending of vertical posts (Nos. 4, 18,

                                                                 SHEET         2.

        19, 37 and 38).
             During the course of the testing careful Inspection
        was made of each barrier and it was found that, although
        they passed the test, a number of barriers had minor
        defects mainly due to corrosion.   A total of 32 new clips,
        eight new rails and five new posts were fitted in addition
        to strengthening of those barriers which failed the test.
 ^      All protruding or sharp edges were removed.
             One further barrier was modified because it was initially
        significantly lower than the minimum height recommended in the
        green Code of Practice.
             Following construction of the new additional barriers on
        Spion Kop and the completion of repairs to the old barriers
        a second series of tests was made.   All the new barriers
        and all the repaired barriers now passed the test.

 (b)    Leppings Lane
              In the first series of tests six barriers (Nos. 104,
         105, 106, 107, 110 and 123) had failures of the tube
 t      retaining clips.    Five barriers (Nos. 107, 114, 115, 121 and 130)
 P      suffered permanent deformation of the horizontal rail.
              All these barriers were repaired.    In addition 13 new
         clips **>4 five rails which were badly corroded were replaced,
        and any protruding or sharp edges removed.
             After construction of the new barriers, they and all
        the repaired barriers were tested and all withstood the
        test load satisfactorily.

  (c)   North West Corner
                 The initial testing of the first few barriers in this
         c o m e r showed that all of them vere only capable of taking
         about half the test load.      The rails deflected excessively
         and the holding down bolts vere also inadequate.

            Major strengthening in the form of extra posts to
       shorten the span of the rail* and to share the load with
       the existing posts were installed.   A new type of holding
       down arrangement was devised.
            When re-tested all existing barriers plus all the
       new barriers successfully withstood the specified load.

  i« Safety Cage
%      When the first series of tests were made on the crush
barriers it was found that the safety cage along both ends of
the ground had defective supports.   It was found that certain
holding down bolts had not been fixed when the fence was
installed.   There was also a need for support from the
concrete perimeter wall in some places.   After appropriate
remedial work the fence was successfully test loaded in 4m sections
along both ends of the ground using the normal crush barrier
loading of 6 kN/m length.

Boundary Fences
      Concern had been felt for the boundary fence along the
£     » of the ramp from Spion Kop.   Any failure of this fence
as the crowd leaves the ground could result in people being
spilled down a steep bank.      The whole length of this fence
from the score board down to the bottom was therefore tested
using the lateral force specified in the green Code of 2.74 kN/m.
The whole length carried the load satisfactorily.
         The continuation of this fence round to the north-ea*t
c o m e r of the pitch, plus the two lines of fence which protect
the island of spectators to the west of the tunnel were also
appropriately tested (the lengths marked in red on the attached
print of drawing 1610/11).      All the sections successfully
carried the test load without signs of distress.
         It was also found to be possible to test load five sections
of the boundary fence round the top of Spion Kop as shown by the
short red lines.   The load applied was again that appropriate to

the lateral force on exit routes.       Again the load was
satisfactorily resisted.

 South Stand Balustrade
       The final testing was on the south stand balustrade.
At the foot of every gangway a length of 2m was subjected
 to the sane test load as crush barriers i.e. 6 kN/m length.
    every case this load was resisted without distress.
m      In between the gangways, the balustrade was subjected
to a test load of 3 kN/m length applied to the whole span
between successive pairs of supports.    Again the load was
everywhere satisfactorily resisted.

Future Numbering of Crush Barriers
      Many of the barriers have been lengthened and also
additional barriers have been installed.   It is obviously
inappropriate to continue with the old numbering system.
We therefore include prints of two new drawings 1610/63 and 64 which
show a new numbering system for Spion Kop and the whole of the
west end of the ground.   It is proposed that these numbers
(A   1 be used in all future reports.

              Dear Hr. Mallett,

              SAFETY-OF SPORTS GROUTTDS-ACT 1973-        “•   ' '* ’S'*

              Further to your letter of the 31st March, my Chairman
              is away for another three or four weeks; so you will
              appreciate that 1 cannot give you Board decisions or.
              opinions. My personal reaction is surprise, as under
              the above act work has been going on continuously since
              it was started last susiaer and at no tine do I feel
              that the Club have lagged behind in its actions to do
              everything that has been promised to be done.

              To take Item 4 of your letter - this is very much in
              the progress, and we are in the hands of the contractors.

              As regards the training of safety stewards, this was being
              left until the warning systea was installed. However, on
              receipt of your letter I did contact Mr. Vaughan and
              suggested that if he would like to contact the County .
              F5.re Serv5.ce, all our stewards would be at the gronnd
              for our HL3.tc'a on Easter Monday, and that might be an
              opportunity to deal with this particular item. The
              officers of the Fire Serv5.ce had in+iriuvted to jae
              previously 'that any time would be suitable to them.

            /ill your c>'(:her items rnder I’r.ra.g.vaphs 'A h 3 wi‘1.1 be
            dealt with, and in fact, a copy of your letter I have

                 Mr. England has sent me a copy of .your letter of 31
    March and of his reply dated 3 April.                                                                                                                                _
                 I am in a-little difficulty in replying to some of the
    points raised as Mr. Clough is                                                              on holiday until Tuesday, 8
    April, and Mr. Strange is away until Monday, 14 April.
   Because we are carrying out re-wiring in the South Stand
    and Mr. Clough is better equipped to deal with the comments on.
   the Exit signs I will delay replying until he returns.
                With regard to the 'comments from the Building Control
   department I may need to reply in greater detail when John
   Strange returns from holiday.-                                                               . However, my first comments
   are as follows,                                            •
       (i) The cracks between the 'door frames and supporting wall
                will be re-inspected.                                                        I can only assume 'that this, is
                ‘something which was not noticed in the inspection which
                we made and the inspections which were -made by the
                Building Control department at the end of the work.                                                                                               It
                may be that due to shrinkage of the timber a slight
         * gap has opened since that time.'                                                                         We will, of course,                           have

                                                         • Registered In E n g la n d '- No. 1134531                                           • '     *
     the cracks mortared or covered if this is needed, but
     might I suggest- that minor matters of this kind do not
     need a letter or need to be dealt with between the
     periodic inspections which you and we will be carrying
     out.       . After all the next inspection is less than three            .
     months away.


;(ii) I have not been able to discuss the paint used on the
                si:             er/S'
     closed down until 14 April.              However^ one of m y assistants
    believes that M r .. Sherriff-has recently told Mr. Strange
     that Mr. Mills saw a painter with a tin of Dulux instead
    of the Nullifire which we specified.                 It would have been
     appreciated if a telephone call had been jnade at the time
     so that we could have-checked with certainty and if
    necessary taken corrective action.              I will write to you
    again on this point.


(iii) Mr. Strange mentioned that Mr. Sherriff had queries in a
    recent telephone conversation whether wired glass has been
    used where appropriate.              Mr. Strange said that so far
    as we know wired glass had been used everywhere that the
                                •                    •                 *

    fire officer had requested it, and that the fire officer                   «.
    had .of course, made his own inspection.                The conversation
    had ended with Mr. Sherriff saying that he would check with
            •          *•
    the fire officer.


(iv) We presume that the reference to 'clearance* refers to-
    the vertical headroom.              It will be recalled that some
    ingenuity was needed to devise this particular exit, as
    we were constrained by the levels in the existing stand
    and the level of the top of the terracing and the exit
    route.            Our drawings .and calculations were submitted to            {•

   Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                     •                                                Sheffield Wednesday Football' 'Club Ltd.

                                               o f Sports Grounds' Act ~~ 1975
            I have now been able to talk with Mr. Clough regarding
 . the exit signs 'and have pleasure in replying to your points
  • ii, iii and iv.


  Para ii
           I find the exit signs were erected under the supervision
  of John Strange who is still                                                   on holiday.       I have quickly
  looked through the certificate of ground safety and have not
  been able to find any reference to lettering size.                                                                 Because
  you do not say which exit signs have not been sited in                                                                           L   q

  accordance with the plans it is'a little difficult for me to
  comment and I suggest this matter be left in abeyance until                                                                          i— r«/^"
 John Strange returns.                                     With regard to the illumination of the
 exit signs, it may be that you are unaware that ve are rewiring
 the South Stand and it may -be that the signs you have in mind
 will be appropriately illuminated by both systems when this
 work is corr.Dlete.

  •Para iii
        We have not been able to understand what it is
  which you say does not comply with the requirements
  of paragraph 12 of the certificate.     The agreement
  with the Fire Service (Mr. K. Jones) was set out in’ our
  letter of 12 December.     So far as we can see the only
  possible variation from that agreement is that because
^ o f the rewiring which is now taking place tfe did not
   implement the agreed measures in the case of the two exits


  December.                               .                    .


  Para iv
       The fire warning system is complete except for the
  supply of the trickle charger and battery equipment.      These
  items were ordered some months ago ana if the original -
  delivery dates had been adhered to would have been installed
  by now.     Unfortunately the suppliers have failed to
. deliver on time.     We have been applying appropriate pressure
  and the latest information is as set out in the attached
  copy letter from our electrical contractors which was dated
  24 March.    As you will see from this, two of the four
  outstanding items have very likely been delivered by now
 but the signal indicator panel was not expected for four
 weeks from 24 March and the industrial batteries complete
 with steel stand and ancillary equipment was due to be
 delivered by Friday, 25 April.


       I landerstend that there is to be a meeting at the ground
 on Thursday, 10 April, when these can no doubt be discussed.


                                  Yours sincerely,

            the Building Control department for comment.        They
            inspected during construction and after the work was
            completed.      I am not amused by the fact that the
            headroom is now being queried.        In any case this is
            a matter for the fire officer, not the Building Control
            department.      With recard to the sharp edges I suggest
            we leave the matter uztil the inspection in June/July
            as the season is now almost over, and there is no
            time to agree further work and have it carried out before
     .-f    tne'-seas on -erfas;


      (v)   The perimeter fencing at the north-east c o m e r of the
            Spion Kop has been appraised for condition and strength.
            Bearing in mind the likely pressures at that location,
            the tests which we carried out where possible, and that
            we are dealing with^ ar. existing ground, the fence is
            satisfactory in my opinion.       .                        *


     (vi) We will look at the step obstruction, but again unless
            this is something which is obviously dangerous (in
            which case I would have expected the matter to be raised
            last December) suggest that discussion be left until the
            June/July.inspection.


     (vii) The mesh fencing under the North stand was discussed
            with Mr. Jones of the fire service and he, like me, was
            satisfied that there is no hazard which justifies the
            making of changes.


            I will write to you arain after Mr. Clough returns from
     holiday.

         Stewards until the fire warning system bad been completely installed, but with
         agreem ent the County Fire Service had instructed some stewards yesterday. •
         A schedule specifying the duties and riesponsibilities was handed to the Club's
         representatives.

)        E xit Signs

         The Club's representatives felt that the exit signs generally had been sited where
         required and were of adequate sire and/or illuminated.

  Possible Step Obstruction on Upper Zxit Area on Scion Koo

 Whilst it was agreed that the erection of the barriers at the Upper Exit Area had left
 a small adjacent area of approximately one foot wide by four foot long at a lover level
 than the remainder of-the exit, it was felt that its position coupled with the crowd
 flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. However, the Club
 undertook to give attention to it in the longer term.

- Mesh Fencing under North Stand

 In view of the normal crowd flow rates on. the public side of the mesh fencing and the
 fact that there was no public access to its rear, it was felt that the timber framed .
 mesh fencing under the North Stand providing security to storage areas was acceptable.

Dear Sirs,
Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 -
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited
I thank you for your letter dated 15th July.
After consultations with the Building Authority and in view of the fact
that all of the barriers were tested prior to certification, the County
Council is able to agree this year with the course of action vhich you
propose. However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as
to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
25(2) of the Safety Certificate.
May I also aention the Certificates by:-
(a)        a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by
           paragraph 24 of the Safety Certificate) as to all structural
           parts of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;
(b)        an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
            26 of the Safety Certificate) as to the electrical installation
           within the Stadium; and
(c)        an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
            12(2) of the Safety Certificate) as to the condition of the
            Emergency Power Supply.
I take it that if the Club has not already done so, they will shortly be
requesting you to supply these.
                                                       Tours faithfully,

                ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED
                                  BY THE CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                On various dates in July I made inspections and had
     approximately one-fifth of the crush barriers tested by members
    of my staff under my control.   A final inspection was made on
    28 August in company with Mr. D. Sheriff C.Eng., M.I.Struct.E.
    of the City of Sheffield Building Surveyor's Department, acting
    on behalf of the licensing authority.
          In my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
     satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium to be used
     to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of Ground Safety.
           The crush barriers Nos. 1-39 (see our drawing No. 1610/63)
I    were tested in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Guide
     to Safety at Football Grounds on 21-23 July.                                                              Certain barriers
     s u ffe re d        excessive deflection, generally on the second or third
     cycle of the test load. In some other cases retaining clips had
     to be replaced.   The barriers concerned were Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15,
     17, 18, 24, 26 and 34.   After remedial work these barriers were
     successfully re-tested on 11 August.
           I       am now able to certify that all 39 barriers have a satisfactory
     strength.
           Certain items of maintenance work which it is suggested should
     be carried out at an appropriate time have been recommended to the
      club.          A list is attached.

                INSPECTION JULY/AUGUST 1980 OF HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM



                Items of maintenance which it is suggested should be carried
 out           in the reasonably near future.


 1.              Some of the fencing posts at the top of                            the Kop need paintine
                near the base.


 2.            The fencing at the rear side of                        the gangway over the lower
                exit from the Kop is becoming very corroded.


 3.            The concrete posts forming part                        of the retaining wall at the
                foot of the bank at the rear of the Kop                              (behind Penistone
                Road turnstiles) are showing signs of spalling due to
                corrosion of the reinforcement.                         The cracks should be repaii
                with either liquid epoxy or by epoxy mortar.


4.             The Denso tape wrapping on some                        of the starter bars at the
                back of the North West c o m e r is coming loose.


5.             Cracks running from the top to near the bottom of the concrei
                terrace at the North West corner have grown more pronounced
                in the past year with salts leached out of the concrete
                being deposited on the underside.                        These clacks should be
EASTW OOD £t PARTNERS




        sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.


  6.    There is a very small area of rust spalling on the
        ballustrade at the front of the West stand.


 7.     The boundary wall at the South West c o m e r needs
        pointing in places.


 8.     Certain timbers in the roof of the South stand may    be
        suffering from damp penetration.     These can be checked
        when part of the roof is examined at the end of 19 80.

    Ground Security - The Secretary reported on estimates received for the
    installation of a crowd counter at a cost of £14,500.plus the possible
_   installation of six new turnstiles at each end of the ground 4 n order
    tbat open gates can be closed, at an approximate cost of £23,000.
    Tbe Secretary suggested, other than have this heavy expenditure, he
    would like to try using existing turnstiles for admission to the
    North Stand, but by so doing this will reduce the number of turnstiles
    available for standing supporters at each end of the ground; it was
    agreed this be put into operation as soon as possible, but only after
    due warning in our programme etc. of our intentions.

of the South Yorkshire County Council, Hr             of the

South Yorkshire Fire Service, Chief Superintendent Kerold, F

Division, representatives of the Club and representatives of the

Building Authority.



A general inspection of the ground took plaoe and no sajor problems

were identified, the majority of work being in the fora of *ainten-

ance, however, discussions were undertaken concerning the Police

Room and the siting of possibly temporary ticket offices both in

Penistone Road and Leppings Lane.   Ihere were no objections to

these offices on a temporary basis in order that the situation

Bdght be assessed as to the types of queues Which Bight develop.

So far as the Police Room is concerned, the Club had received our

suggestions and the matter was to be placed before the board:

   1.      'Purpose 'cf Meeting

-•- •Bearing in mind the F-.A.* Cup-Seiai-Final which, was to take place on Saturdays1
     11th April, 1981, it vas felt it would he desirable for the Working Party to
     visit the ground, .especially as'a snail nur.ber' cf natters had arisen sir.ce the
     last visit on 10th February, 1981.

• 2.     '* Inspection of Ground

   (a)    ' 'South Stand

   The previous cor-er.ts relating to the roof structure and the exterior windows in
   the Ladies* Toilets below the stand were still applicable-

  The L.P.G. cylinders had been'removed free beneath the Stand, and the batteries
  supplying the emergency pcver supply for the police address had been enclosed ir.
  a satisfactory fire resisting cetal case. Whilst the provision of an automatic
  battery charger would be a longer tens solution, in the short tera arrar.gener.ts
  had been made for the batteries' to be charged before each gane ar.d for the public
  address systen to be checked relying only' cr. the emergency'battery supply. The
  indicator for the batteries condition was presently in the Public Address 3c:<.
  -^ V3s suggested tnat it would be less likely to be overlooked if the indicator
  was sited adjacent to the new cetal case for the catteries.

   (b)     West 'Stand

  As previously agreed, the Club would round off the steel supports to the cev
  e-ergency exit (nearest to the South Stand) as scon as a grinder was next present
  at tne ground.

 Cc)      North Uesr Terrace

 The crocking of the concreting had been attended to by injecting sa.cerial fron
 che to?. The results had bceh satisfactory, except in cvo sisall areaj vhere
 water seepage had obviously taken place tac vhich vculd receive further
 attention.

.(d)      North Stand

 The expansion cracks vhich had appeared in the vail of the North Stand (nearest
 to the Spion Kop) had been included in the maintenance schedule and voclc be
 attended to shortly.

 (e)      Soion Koo

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left cf the original
exit at the top cf the Kcp vculd be given attention in the close season.

Whilst the brick built chip shop at the bottca cf the new exit free the Kop had
been erected, it vas not yet in use. It vas noted that the siting cf the
chip shop had resulted in a possible danger to spectators in that a gap into
vhich spectators cculc be pushed,-or possibly stu-'ole because of the camber, had
been created. As regards the F.A. Cup Sard-Final,
           '          *                                                .   .   .
• IT VAS AGREED - : -•••.           .            -•    •      -•                   .j..

that a temporary barrier of■scaffolding tubes should be erected fcetvisn the end
of the new Kop exit cuter barriers ana the concrete pillar cf tr.2 Ir-esc of the
Kop original exit steps. In the longer tern, the existing barriers voulc r.aed
extending to fill the gap and ideally, the area batvean the better cr the nev jCcs
exit staircase ar.d the original Kop exit steps should be levelled cff.

3.       Grcur.d Evacuation Trocelure

Whilst the Club had been supplied vith a Schedule on "Fire Instruction ar.d Drills'
on 9.th April, 1530, consultations between.the County Fire Service and the South
Yorkshire Police had resulted in the production of an "Emergency Evacuation
Procedure". The Club undertook to circulate copies cf the procedure to all
Stevards who would be on duty for the F.A. Cuo Seni-Final.

                Dear Sir,
                                   «     *



            v   SEMI-FINAL - 11TH APRIL 1981                                ‘-          —                     *-

            - On the occasion of the above natch, there was an incident
                                                                        •




              at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
              enclosure, which resulted in injuries to spectators
            "'because of crushing. ...... .      ..........

                From our enquiries it appears the.crushing was caused
                through Tottenham supporters arriving late, due to
                problems on the Motorway, and rushing to their places
                after     game had commenced, thereby causing problems
                to spectators at the front of the 'terracing who had
                been in the ground a considerable length of time.

                According to our^turnstile readings there were 335 in
                excess of the stipulated capacity for that particular
                area; this was the result of Tottenham fans having
                purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival
                at Turnstile tN», Penistone Road, which was the
                Wolverhampton standing area* were directed by the
                police to the other end of the ground where the
                Tottenham fans were standing.

                I give below details of injuries reported to me:-
                    30 spectators treated by St. John*s Ambular.ce

making it more comfortable should be looked into.

        The Chairaan opened the seating by stating its ir.tar.ti.cn of assessing the
        planning, acticn and incidents relating to the FA Cup Seai-Final hetveen
        Tctter.has Ectspur and Wclverhaaptcn Vvar.carers held at Hillsborough on
        Saturday 11 April 1SS1.         *                                  *

       Certain prsbleas had occurred hut in his and the Chief Constable's opinion
       ve had actad ccrractly. One lettar cf ccap’laint had been received froa a aaaber
       cf the public as veil as one lettar praising the pclice action in a cancerous
       situation. Chief Superintendent Esrois aentior.ed that ether letters
       congratulating the police cn their actions had also been received.

       Mr Gcslin said that it vas his decision to reaove spectators froza the Lappings
       Lane er.d cf the ground to the other sice in-order to ease a dangerous situation
       vhsre serious injuries cr even fatalities vere a real possibility. Ee then
 .     read the lettar cf cosplaint, vhich contained an allegation that the police
       herded acre and acre people into the -Lappings Lane enclosure vhen it was’ obvious
       that it vas full.                    -c-

       The Chairaan invited views on this point. Superintendent Chapaan said that the
       entrances to Leppings Lane vere controlled to ensure an even distribution cf
       fans. However, as .the ccrund filled up the usual packing problems occurred.
       There vas space in the centra of the enclosure but fans refused to nova over
       and fill it. Police officers vere placed into the crowd to ensure i±at the
       best use vas aade cf the available rpace. The Mountad Department also assisted
       at the- raar cf the crowd to prevent sore people entering that part cf the
     . crounc.

       Chief Stiparintencant Heroic pointed out that tha prcblea vas exacerbated by a
       series cf incidents vhich culair.ated in the late arrival cf a large nuaber of
       fans. This asar.t that instead cf arriving ever a period, they all arrived
       together very close to kick-off tiae.

                a." an accident occurred on the Ml .Motorway involving 13 cars, causing
       two c£ zhc three lar.es to be cicsec few:: frr one inc a half hours. Just north
       cf this, ana at about the sane tiae, a 7£V broke co-r.. Passengers alighted fros

                                                                          Continued/....

              it and caused problems on the motorway. The pontoon bridges and extensive
              roadworks on the aotcrway ixr the Derbyshire Police Area also created delays.
              This 90 minute calay resulted in a sudden flood of vehicles, all of thea
             •
             ‘Sours supporters, into Sheffield. Acting Chief Superintendent Thcapson took
              to this point and said that he accepted that the traffic routs, designed to
              divide, the fcctiall supporters frca the city centre shoppers, was too tortuous,
              although this aay not have proved a problea had there been a steady flow cf
              spectators rather than tha sudden influx caused by the incidents described by
             Hr Eercld.

             The Chairaan then sought the views of the ceeting ever the crushing incidents
             when several spectators were injured and which necessitated the reacval of
             scne spectators frca the Leppincs Lane enclosure.
                 • *                     "*                                      •
              Hr Hero Id said that the capacity for the Lappir.cs Lane enclosure, stated in •
              the certificate issued under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, is 10,ICO.
             This cust, cf necessity, contain a safety margin. The actual turnstile
             readinc;was 10,435 to which cust be added the 70 Spurs supporters who had
             r-anaged to ebeain tickets which put thea arengst the Wolves supporters. These
             had been scved to leppir.es Lane froa the Xcp for their cvn safety. This aace
             a total cf 405 spectators ever the authorised lisit. Inspector Calvert pointed
             cut that this created a siailar situation to last year when abcut 400 forged
             tickets were printed for the Leppings Lar.e end, although the sane prcblea was
             ■net experienced then.

             Mr Eercld had already referred to the late arrival cf a large niriber cf
             spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppincs Lane enclosure when
             the satch started. The flashpoint occurred when Tottenham scored after only
             thr&s         *   The spectators just entering pushed fcrvard
             happening and caused a crush, which resulted in the injuries
             Grssr.vccd also sectioned that there had been tvo or three fii
             a nir.cr nature , at the saae tiae. This had results*£ in the t
             to ccen the gates at the front cf Leppings Lane in crcer to release scse
             spectators onto the pitch surround. This was done by opening the cates,
             releasing a few spectators and then cicsing thea to allow a steacy flew. This
             was difficult to aair.tain because' as seen as pressure vas relieved at the
             frcnt the crush frca the back- fiiled"the void.

             The lack of a reserve serial between the South Stand and the Leppings Lane
             stand (where cne has ncraally been situated) causes a few einuces delay in
             the 'csplcv— er.t cf officers to pclice this situation but this problea was soon
             evsreoae. Superintendent Chapaan stressed that there was still roca in the
             centre cf the Leppings Lane enclosure although it vas quite full. This was
             only to be expected when there vas a cacacitv crovc, but the refusal cf
             spectators to fill spaces had caused difficulties elsewhere in the enclosure.

         The discussion progressed to the construction cf the Lecpir.gs Lane enclosure.
         Xr Geslin felt that it was inadequate and required acre divisions so that
         spectators are net in such a solid aass. He also felt that the lisit cf
         10,^CO was too-hich. although Superintendent Chapaan disagreed with this.
         The Chai— an disagreed with Mr Heroic’s suggestion* cf a 6 ft to S ft'vice
         enannel c o ' - t . the centre of the enclosure to divide sceotators and segregate
         opposing far.s or. the crcuncs that such a saail segregation gap cr.ly encouraged
         °??cs:-:ir spectators to throw articles at each other and at pclice cffitsrs
         in cne aicclc. Inspector Calvert expressed concern about the central

/             entrance to the Leppincs lane area because it always causes delays and
              blockages. It woulc benefit froa reconstruction.
                                                                                                    •

             .The chaiman said that talks would take place with Sheffield Wednesday
            . Football Club on the ground capacities and for any reconstruction thought to
              be necessary.

              The discussion progressed to the fans who rar. cnto the pitch during the half
              tiae interval.

              Mr.Herold said that the trouble seamed frca zhe front central gate being
              opened frca where about 150 younc fans were led cnto the pitch surround.
              These were the ones who eventually ran cnto the pitch although at the tice
              it was necessary for the cate to be opened to relieve crowd pressure. The
              satch referee, Clive Thccas, had said that he was unable to start the satch
              when he wanted to. This vas, however, based cr. a five rir.uta half-time
              interval and not cn the nomal ten cir.ute cne. It vas unfair to suggest
              that the catch vas held up as a result cf the fans on the pitch.

             Mr Gcslin said that he cay have cade a vrcnc decision at ha If-tine to try
             and get the fans frca the pitch surround cnto the Xcp. They had not been
             causing any trouble where they were, yet the decision to cove thea cnto the
              Stop precipitated a cir.cr pitch invasicr.. The ialf-tiae interval was, cn
             reflection, insufficient to carry cut the necessary manoeuvre. Scae of the
             people who were being shepherded into the Xcp refused to go in, resulting ir*
             a cincr 'break-cut' which '-as cuickly controlled. Mr Heroic said that it vas
             apparent, for future refersr.ee, that when people have to be coved frca the
             Xcp the area behind the hear dings is an ideal position to put thea into. Chiei
             Inspector Scith also pointed cut that oC-100 fans had been successfully reacves
             froa the pitch and placed into the centre cf the Xcp. Mr Hercld said that
             this situation procpted the cnly criticise cf the police by the club in that
             we seesed t- be helping far.s to clicb ever the railings. Inspector Sykes
             replied to this criticisa by saying that c n l y the fans who had beccce stuck
             whilst attempting to clirb ever the railings to avoid the crush had been
             helped by pciice officers so they did net injure theaselves. The ether fans
             vere released, in saall croups through a police controlled gate.

             Cjie prcblea which vas totally unnecessary vas that caused by the sale of
             unwanted tickets by ’irdverhaapton Wanderers direct to Tottenham Hotspur. This
             is contrary to FA directions and neither the FA, Sheffield Wednesday FC nor
             the pclice were told cf this cecisicn. This cade a nonsense cf the
             segregation arrangacsnts and vas a contributing factor to the difficulties
             vhich occurred. Liscussicr.s vere to take place about this situation.

             The Chairr.an then asked for any ccrcer.ts or criticisas which could prove
             useful for future occasions- The following points were raised:

       Mr T h e r r ? son also, relayed criticises that officers outside the ground had
  /    mace no atteapt to direct traffic at blocked up junctions. This cricitisra
f
;
      •was not accepted because with the size of the crowd soae delay oust be
       accepted and anticipated.

       Superintendent Chaoaan

       The aJbser.ce of a reserve serial between the South Stand and West Stand caused
       a. slicht delay in the deployment cf officers to the disorder situation and
       there should be a reserve stationed there in future.

       There should be feaale officers available at the turnstiles to assist in any
       necessary searches. There was a sarked absence of feaale officers-at the
       gates.

       The back to back radios are not useful in the situation when there is
       extensive sedia coverage at the grcur.d. There is a high degree of inter­
       ference.

       Acting Superintendent Rudcy

       The ccanunicaticns had proved successful with three channels being used
        (1, 2 and 4). The splitting cf the ground contrcl and the public order control
       aeant that the caravan fcr public crier control need no longer be situated
       inside the ground ar.d could be roved about outside fcr eptisus reception.

      Mr Rucdy also pointed cut that the supervisory officers froa foreign
      forces had zada zany ccnpiiaer.tary renarks about the planning/ organisation
      and operatic.-.*! aspects cf this event. Se feit that ve vere being ever
      critical of curselves.

      Inspectcr Calvert

      Hr Calvert suggested the inclusion cf a ce-brief chart so that the cca.-e.-ts
      of any officers at the ground could be included fcr discussion.

      Inspector Sykes                                 -

      Cn this occasion cffice'rs frca foreign fcrces had been esployed or. duties
      inside the ground; Mr .Sykes felt that this should be the duty cf the regular
      officers      Divisicr.)'vho are familiar vith the territory.

      Mr Heroic pointed cut that the reverse situation had applied last year and
      there vere still d i f f i c u l t i e s . zr. fact, the local knowledge cf the visiting
      officers who vere ir.sise had helped to cverccae situations, vhich our own
      pcliceaer. say nor have been able to deal vith easily. There are also
      logistical difficulties vith the deployment cf foreign officers outside the
      ground.

      Serosar.t

      Difficulties vere experienced beos-se officers frca fcreicn forces had not
      read cr ur.csrstrcd the ccrrespcncence sent to thes. Despite having naps and
      being taxcri cn a rcur cf the ground, sere had ccr.e tc a different pirt cf

        the ground to where they had been deployed. This could have had serious
        consequences whpo. assistance was urgently needed.- .

        •The local call signs (eg Sierra S - Sergeant) should be stressed to visiting
         officers as the lack of this knowledge could lead to confusicn.

        There had been tco aar.y people inside the control room   a eaxisva of r.ir.e
        persons during the critical stages in a rcca designed fcr three, ar.d this
        had shown that the ventilation was inadequate. On this point Superintandsnz
        Chapasan said that the nuaber of senior officers in the control rcca at this
        tiae had caused confusicn because cn occasions conflicting instructions had
        bean given and the control room staff did not knew which particular
        instruction to acceot and relay.

        The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) agreed to consider all the points
        raised fcr future occasions and thanked all present for their attendance.

        The seating closed at 7.20 pa.

  In accordance wi-thvycur instructions, and due to your fully cc=sitted
  diary this weak, 1 can report, that I set vith tha Club Secretary c£
  Shaffiald tfadnasdny;-- ;jr. E2ic England, pricr tc the natch ^ith Grissby
  on Tuasday, 2S April 1031. »7a discussed our actions at the Sani-final
  and 1 j-.crned hia that tha Ciiaf Coostable wculd fce reporting
  independently cur position to the Pcotball Asseciatizn. In his report
  to tha P.A. .Kr. -England .is going to include that fact.

 I have acquainted     vith all cur efforts to rove the 'Spurs fana
 into tha less cansely packed central part cf tha terracing and of tha
 us2 of tha public addrass aysten, etc.               _                .^

  Mr. England new tails sie that daspita his earlier belief that the
 •referee, Clive Shonas,.was coinc to report adversely to the Football
- Association, in fact, he does not now know whether Thcoas will do so or
  not- Certainly, the r.A.officials were prasenz and saw what occurred
  thenselves and will, 1 think, ‘understand the pcsiticn when they rsceive.

 I have inferred Kr. England that our consensus view is that the 10,ICO                   ^
 crowd figure spacifisd in tha Safety Certificate is hoo high. Undar—
 standably, he fafutas this and defands tha position by stating that the

 fomer capacity, prior to tha isplacantation  * of the

 Grounds-Actrat Hillsborough in Decsnber 1973, was 11. ICO, and that on a          JP  I  S *’j
 nurharvsof occasions in pravious all-ticket raatches the terracing has                       |
 accoorzcdated that nunbar. Certainly, at tha 1020 Sani-final, when wa                        !
 acai_r. had a capacity crowd of 50,174, we also had sc— ~ hundreds of
 forged tickets, all for the lappings 2*ana end, and apert frcn ona vsry                      i
 ninor crushing of spectators there was no prcbl«n.

 Mr. England has bean acquainted with our view that tha leppinga Lane
 terracing should be sectioned ’virtically1 front to bark to produce
 pans to enable sore accurata crowd control end provant sideways rave- •
 rusnt and he is already actively-considaring this. lie has also con­
 sidered using turnstiles 1-4 for cna pare of the terracing and 5-5
 for anothar pare and controlling tha crowd entering through those turn­
 stiles by thsi placing cf safary harriers in thaa open area bet-asn tho
 Lappings Lana fjrr.stiles and tha back of the V;zsz Star.a/terracing. *I
 agree with hin that for osst catohas that would possibly vork but have
 grave reservations as—tc its efficacy for tha pctanuially trccblesone
 goiZes. Addiaionally, to insistent it he would have to find soca way
 for spectators to enter the 3est Stand without crossing the ether
 corridors cf supporters.

 Kr. England accepts the prcclen with the ticxens and, quite properly, •
 anya that is a natter over which he and the Hillsborough Club ..
 officials had no control vhataver. 'Spuns played Coventry cn the Saturday
 before Wolves sold their ticket allocation on 'open sals'. ,^’e do not
know if scaa stayed overnight or travelled, on the Sunday to-tha Wolves •
•Club, but cartainiy.tha 'Spurs Club knev full, v-11 free tha* tis* P*}“ . ;
varos-that-substantial nunhers or their supporters lLad purchased ticxats
 for tha Wolves end.- Thav did not tall us or SIia»ri«l5 Wa-dnesday.       i.         1
The Hisutes recorded-by Sergear.t _______are incorrect, vhsn vs state
that that sal* by Kclverhanpton Kandarsrs was Contrary to Football
Association directions ~ Thess were no such directions, but an
agreement between, tha F.A., the participating clubs and Sheffield
Wednesday, as to the ticket allocation, was quite clearly circu=vanted.
Hr. England is~rscc=snding to the F.A. that in future they should
give diracticna to participating clubs that they will not act in thi3
way asd zrost retain. or return any unsold tickets and M l put the= on
open sale as Wolves, had done cn this occasion.

No other points of. any great Inportanca were discussed but you should
be aware that *1- have* condeded to Hr. Zngland that with hindsight we
accept that our attenst to cove the *Spurs fans f r = the periseter
track to the *Kop* curing the United period at half tirse was,.perhaps,
ill advised. I have told Hr. England that no police o'fficar encouraged
fans .to ciirb tha-fence and, despits his opinion, all we dsd vas to
assist those who did so and becaae stuch or injured in the process.

I have also inforsed Mr. England of the Chief Constable’s concern at
the attitude of senior nerbers of the Hillsborough      to you and tha
Chief Constabia and of their apparent lack of co-operation and support.

I reco=end that a report, setting out the Police position in this
case, now be conpiled and forwarded under the Chief Constable's
signature for the information of the Football Association-

 Dear Sir

 FA COP SEMI-FINAL           - 11 APRIL
                                   *•   '

 I would refer to the FA Cup Semi-Final match between Wolverhampton
 Wanderers Football Club' and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
 Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
 Saturday 11 April 1981.

 As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Fined matches have been
 held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
 a certificate under the provisions o£ the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
 This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
 Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100. -

 Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
 of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
 to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
 the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
 the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
 caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
 to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
 traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
 football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
 start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
 afternoon could have been anticipated.

 I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
 and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.

 Cn the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
 the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
 in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
 Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
 which were at a premium in London. Others also made the journey from London
 to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
 policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
 groups of standing supporters at. opposite ends of the ground. Neither of
     •             *•V ,v..- JI*//TI W**IT -
                    ■•■•■•““ « T -^ * $ & & & :-• •:• • •   <-   ;...
the two. participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to infora the South
Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club or the Football
>««/^i»t»-fnn about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
was not"properiy"catered for. The result of this was that soae 400
Tottenham fans had to be removed fran the Spion Xop, in the interests
of general safety and public order, and were accomodated in the Leppings
Lane end of the ground,, which had beta .designated for use by Spurs
supporters. •          ... „
                          •   «

The capacity at the Leppings Lane_end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
a safety factor. At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
apparent difficulty. However, on this date turnstile readings showed
that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
centre of this enclosure,'- thereby creating a janming effect at the
extremeties of it. The late arrivals.caused an immediate problem upon
gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
inmediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
terrace including broken arms, legs‘and crushed ribs. In all, some 38
fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John Ambulance
representatives present at the game.

As a result of this the safety gates at the front of the Lessings Lane
enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
get in. In my view no other course of action could have been adopted in
the interest of public safety.

During the half time interval my officers attempted to move the spectators
who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
spectator areas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
by officers within the ground.

In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future similar
events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

Yours faithfully

      Note of a Visit co che Hillsborough Stadi.ua, Sheffield,
                        on 8th June, 1981

PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

           E. England (Secretary)                                                       /

            D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
            D.I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 .____ Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2 .____ Inspection of Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)    South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be g^ven.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)     West Stand

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars' supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).

Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.


                                      -1-


                                                            QQCUMEKTNo.
(c)     Norch-Vesc Terrace

The two small nrcas where wacer seepage had continued to Cake place after
treatment had now been satisfactori-l-y treated.

It was also noted that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been protectively wrapped.

(d)   ' North Stand

The expansion cracks in the wall of ieFS'lforth Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kap) had been made good.

(e)    Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
be attended to shortly.                                                       '
                                                                              •

The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected becveen the end of th*e
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

(f)    General

It was noted:-

(i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penis tone Road required attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

 1.    M I W T E S OF THE PREVIOUS MEET IMS

 1.1   The minutes of the meeting held at Il»gara Sports Club on 16 October
 1980, which had been circulated, were received and accepted.


 2.    MATTERS ARISIMG FROK THE HIWTLS

 2.1   Item 3 - Television aj>d Press

 2.1.1 The Chairman said that a meeting had finally been arranged vith
.representatives of both the national and local media, and this vould take
 place in October 1981 at the Niagara Sports Club. This vis the first
 occasion upon which such a meeting had teen possible, due to other
 coendt»ent-s of all concerned.   The suggestions made at the meeting on
 16 October 1980 will then be put forward. The Press Council had been
 approached about the difficulties encountered but had been unable to
 assist and suggested that individual approaches were necessary.
. »
 2.1.2 The recent public disorder situation throughout the country, and
 the possible implications for the forthcccing football season, were then
 discussed. Mention was also made of the situations where crowd
 disturbances are magnified by excessive oedia coverage, resulting in
 'copycat* incidents. Superintendent Lasbert suggested that it should be
 written into contracts with the television cocpanies that they should only
 photograph the actual sporting event taking place. Bcwever, Kr Bennison
 pointed out that the contracts are sgreed between the Football League and
 the television companies.    Be suggested that legislation conccrning the
 point raised by Supt Lam b ert may be the answer. Kr England reiterated the
 point made at a previous meeting thtt fcv difficulties were encountered
 vith the photographers detailed to covcr the actual rsatch - the ones

 being Monitored. Chief Superintendent Berold oertlootd briefly the feet
 that defendants *t Leeds Crown Court had recently been found 'not guilty*
 of offences arising out of disturbances durirg the Batch between Sheffield
 Wednesday and Newcastle at Billsborough at the beginning of the 1980/81
^season. They had produced television recordings as p*rt of their
 successful defence.

 2»2   Itea 8.3 - Banning of Supporters

2.2.1 Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) highlighted e problea which
occurred last season over the release of s 'conviction* of a Sheffield
Wednesday supporter Involved in disturbances at Oldhaa. Despite the fact
that the information was passed by us in good faith, it transpired that
the person had not at that tine been convicted of the offence and was
awaiting trial on a 'not guilty* plea. Kr England mentioned that of the
naaes published after the disturbances at Oldhas, only two had reacted
Adversely, and one of those was the person who*was not then convicted.

 2.2.2 In view of the difficulties caused by.thls incident, the Clubs aust
 now obtain details of any of their convicted supporters frcaj the press
 if they wished to publish those details in their natch progresses.


 3-    SAFETY OP SPORT? POUNDS (PESIGHATIOH) ORDER 1981

 3.1   Superintendent Mole told the meeting that Rotherhaa and Barnsley
 now caae within the provisions of this Order and Doncaster could well
 follow in the near future. Kr Vaughan and aeabers of the working party
 bad visited the grounds concerned.

>3.2   Kr Vaughan said that infornal liaison had been aaintained with all
 the Sooth Yorkshire football clubs for the past 12 aonths. Sheffield
 Wednesday presented no probleas; Barnsley and Rctherhaa were being
 processed; and Dsncaster and Sheffield United were being investigated on
 an informal basis. Be wished to thank ell the clubs for their excellent
 co-operation with the working party aeabers and he hoped the enquiries
 would reach a-successful-conclusion.   - -       —


 4.    DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE LAST MEETING

 4.1   Mr Chester said that the companies forced through the Sheffield
 Dnited Football Club had been brought about in an effort to recognise the
 value of supporters and supporters' clubs in their assistance to    e
 parent club. Sheffield Onited were trying to ensure that the suppor ers
 associations felt part of the club. The new ©rganisatl
 constitutions and formal cepn.it.tees and he was avare that  ey
 received a tremendous response to date. Strenuous ef orts wou         - -

of th* function* of th* man who play* th* records In th* pre-aatch period
so that bis rol* encouraged the fostering of th* spirit of good behaviour.
This man could possibly identify and welccoe the visiting supporters,
•lthough Chief Superintendent Berold felt that this could be counter­
productive And induce a disorder situation.

4.4    Hr Wright suggested that drinks consvaed before the match could
create problens and Hr Chester asked whether the police met local JPs to
discuss problems at football grounds. Ifce Ouirrum assured him that such
M e tings did take place, albeit not specifically In relation to football
Batches. Bov ever, at th* various informal meetings which did take place,
the proble&s ware aired.

4.5   Rr England cooaentad that the ground regulations at lillsborough had
recently been altered and asked whether the police would, with that backing,
refuse entry to known miscreants. Ihe Chairman assured his that they would
refuse access to the ground to known trouble causers but said that the
re-written regulation was short of the phrase "deny access to,*. On the
face of it, it merely allowed policemen to eject persons causing trouble
inside -the ground and, while the police would interpret this regulation
in the spirit in which it was meant, it could well be re-written, with the
additioa of the missing phrase, to good effect.

4.6   Hr Bennison suggested that the police should draft an appropriate
ground regulation which could then be included by the clubs, and the
Chairman said that this could and would be done as a matter of urgency.


 5.    FOTURS OPERATIONAL DITTICPLTIES

 5.1     Tbe Chairman stated that the Football Association, in their wisdaa,
 h a d ensured that on alternate Saturdays four cf our clubs were at Booe,
‘wit h only Sheffield Wednesday being Avay. Obviously the reverse applied
 on the alternate Saturdays. This created certain operational difficulties
 which would be overccoe but these were exacerbated in scxse circuestances
 such as when the Sheffield Show occurred,        four football matches
 taking piece within the county on the sase day, and similarly the St Leger
 Race Week at Doncaster coincided with the s&se four clubs being at Bose.
 This would represent a considerable drain on manpower resources.

5.2   Superintendent Mole proposed that stev&rds should liaise with the
Fire Service concerning fire precautions in view of the recent nation wide
disturbances when fire bcsbs had been thravn, but Kr Bennison, supported
by Mr Spinks, identified the current difficulty in obtaining stewards.
Kr Wright asked'whether police cadets, or a siailar body within the Fire
Service, could undertake supervision of fire points, but the difficulties
inherent in such a systea were pointed out to hia.

 5.3   Chief Superintendent Derold sa”id that he and his Sub-Divisional
 Commander, Superintendent Chapean, had spo-:en to stewards on this subject
' ftnd safety la general during ft friendly Mtcfc a t «insborough, wd they
’              to hold in exercise to te s t safety precautions In the m u

 SUBJECT:   SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY. FOOTBALL GROUND
            EDUCATION OF CLUB STEWARDS

.•You are both aware of jay feelings that Club Stewards at Hillsborough often
  do less than they should and are at times not aware of our function and
  operation and our respective roles.

 r crossed swords with them personally once or twice last season and in an
 effort to set things right for the coming season I have arranged, through
 the Club Chairman and the Secretary - Mr. England - for the stewards to
 attend in the gymnasium at 1 pm on Saturday, 22 August 1981, prior to
 starting their duty, and I should like you to address them.
 \
j-‘hey should be told very bluntly that each of them should be aware of the
 location of their respective fire points, emergency exits, the recently
 introduced evacuation procedures, how to react-to the broadcasting of the
 nursery rhyme records, etc.etc. They should also have drawn to their
 attention the Ground Rules of the Club, and in particular the recently
 introduced ( a n a even more recently revised) Rule 15 which, din effect,
 appoints police officers as agents’of the Club and allows us to deny
 admission to the ground on the Club *s behalf.

We’should stress to .the stewards that the admission of spectators and the
•packing of JioseCspectators at the "'biggerJgames. on. to the terracing is
primarily their:'function and not a police one.

 Such unruly behaviour as the throwing of cushions, etc., also falls within
 their responsibility - -        "
      «•                                                      *
 When I received critical letters from the Club Chairman^ast year after —
 several of the matches, I replied to the effect that much of the criticsm           '■'>
 he levelled at the police'should more properly have been levelled at his ^ .
 own administration and the stewards. ..

 V7e should cooperate- fully with them and they with us, and not pull in       ,-wyk.o
 opposite directions.

 I remember one particular incident (I believe during the Derby County
 game last year) when the steward cn the South St'and Terracing close to our
 new Control Box quite deliberately ignored fans climbing the railings
 between the Leppings Lane terracing and the South Stand Terracing when I
 and a number of other officers had witnessed it and drawn it to his attention.
 The steward subsequently maintained that the fans in question had occupied
 those seats for the whole of the time, obviously with a view to 'taking the
 easy way out'.

 That is not their function, and indeed it would be my intention     certain
 circumstances to call upon stewards to give statements of evidence that
 might support a prosecution. ■In the past we have never done, that but they
 would be good and relatively independent witnesses.

 I ^m-'sure vou^VLll both understand wha'fc I have in mind and get the message
 over to the st^Wrds. I have already personally told the Club Chairman and
/the Secretary of_my views and they both support them.

 Dear Mr.' Vaughan,                                                 ...                .......
                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                         Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End

      We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
 installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
 Leppings lane end of the ground.
          It is intended that these fences are so positioned
 that they divide this section of the terrace into
 •approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
 entrance.
          By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
 should result.                  A visiting team with only a few followers
 will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
 retained by the home supporters.
          Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
 accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
 dictate.
      A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
 each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
 during a game. The gate could be left open, but fastened
 back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones

                               ». i
   the height -we have considered that the views to the corner
   flags should not be restricted any further than they are at.
   present by the perimeter fence. We therefore propose that the
   top of the fence should be approximately 1680mm above the
   terrace.
         This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
   but_ should eliminate, a. mass„ invasion from one area, to the other.
   Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James's
   Park,* the home of Newcastle
                           ^    United.                                    *


         We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
   within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.
        Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
   various locations around the north stand. Now the gymnasium is
   open to the general public security to ether parts of the ground
   must be maintained. It is proposed that gates are provided at
   the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
   gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
   stand. A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Hr. Vaughan,
                      Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
    As previously intimated to you ve carried out tests
od approximately one fifth of the crush barriers in July and
also made a preliminary inspection in company with Mr. Sheriff.
    One or two of the crush barriers shoved signs of distress
under the test load and along a length of the boundary fence of
the Kop at the North East corner it was discovered that certain
of the stays were rusted through.      Remedial work has new been
carried out and the defeotive crush barriers have been successfully
subjected to the test load.      We shall be inviting Mr. Sheriff
to inspect the remedial work in the next few days following
which Z will issue a certificate on the lines of that which Z
sent to you- last year.


                                        Yours sincerely.

            Please find attached copy correspondence dated 8 September 1981
            from South Yorkshire County Council and 2 September 1981 from
            Eastwood and Partners, together with plans showing details of
            new radial fences on West Terrace and details of new security
            gates (sheets 1 and 2).

            I understand Superintendent O'Neill is representing the division
            at the meeting at 9.30 am on Friday, 11 September 1981.




                                                                  v

   Chief Superintendent Harold, 'F' Division

   I attended this meeting, together with Superintendent Chapman and
   Chief Inspector Stuart of Operations Division.

   Members of the Fire Service and Buildings Department were in
   attendance and the only reservations expressed were by the Fire
   Service, who indicated that the security gates - which will be
   open during football matches - should not in any way restrict the
   egress routes, which they feel are of minimum width as it is.

   The Buildings representative indicated he would seek further
   information regarding the construction materials to be used but
   this would pose no prob1em.

               Note of a Meeting of the Officer Working Party
               ( S h e f f i e l d District).-held at the Division Street
               Fire Station, Sheffield, on 11th September 1931

             T. W. Stuart (South Yorkshire Police)
             D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 .___ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the seating was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners on behalf of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and ‘
Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
gymnasium was open to the general public..

2.   Radial 3arriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any problems
of this nature.

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Terrace.

It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
thatthe Officer Working Party sees no objection to the proposals to instal
two 1680mm high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

      (i)-     the further calculations required by the Building
               Authority being satisfactory;

      (ii)     confirmation that adequate headroom will be
               available at the rear of the Terrace, and

      (iii)     the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
                under police control.




                                                                  OOCUMENT Ko.

3.   S e c u r i t y Gates around North Stand

Now that the gymnasium was open to .the general public, the Club wished to
erect security gates at the top of-the ramps at both ends of the North
Stand, with additional gat^s at ground floor level at the PenistoneRoad
end of the Stand. A separate gate would also be placed behind the Wesf
Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Leppings Lane.          '

These gates would.be fastened when the gymnasium only was in use so as to
provide security for the rest of the ground. However, on match days they
would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access . 1

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners'
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
gates around the North Stand, subject to' the gates and/or their supports, ‘
hinges, etc not inpinging'on the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

4 .___ Police and First Aid Facilities

It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid
facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim basis.
The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
position to the existing timbered facilities during the 1980 close
season. Whilst some progress had been made in discussing details of the
facilities, no firm indication had yet been given as to when they would
actually be provided.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr..D. Vaughan should press the Club and/or its
Consultants   for a firm indication as to when the new police and first
aid facilities are to-be provided.

5.    Lottery Ticket Boxes

Attention was drawn to the blocked egress which could result if the
timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps were, to
be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately,

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should draw the Club's attention to the
desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.

3.    Other Matters

Two other natters were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating
to the Police and First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain of the
Lottery Ticket Boxes.

(a)   Police and First Aid Facilities

      It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first
      aid facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interin
      basis on the understanding that the Club would provide purpose built
      replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

      It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are
      still continuing, but it is f£lt that the Club should be asked to give
      a fira indication when the new police and first aid facilities are't o '
      be provided.
(b)   Lottery Ticket Boxes

      Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
      the tisber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the raaps
      were to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately

      The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested to
      re-site the boxes in a less critical position.

attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

                                        Yours faithfully,

        ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED
                            BY THE CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


          On 23 September 1981, I made an inspection of the ground,
after having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
and sections of the perimeter fence on Spion Kop tested by members
of my staff under my control.
           In my opinion the various structures on the ground
are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium
to be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
Ground Safety.
           In July, crush barriers numbers.40,41,42,47,48,49,50,
 55,56,57,58,59,60,61,68,69,70,71,85,90,114,115,116 and 118 (see
our drawing 1610/63) were tested in accordance with the procedure
laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.                                                                      Certain
barriers deflected excessively and would not sustain the test load.
 In one instance a' clip retaining the horizontal tube had to be replaced.
          Remedial work was carried out on barriers 41 (one post)
and 115 (one post and one clip).                                                At the same time two corroded fence
 posts and four corroded fence post stays were replaced.
      After remedial work the sections of barriers which failed
were successfully retested on 9 September.  I am now able to certify
that all 24 barriers have a satisfactory strength.
     The step at the top of the original stair flight at the
back of Spion Kop has been filled in to give a safe landing.



                                                   R e g iste re d in E n g la n d — N o . 1 1 3 4 5 3 1

               A permanent barrier has been installed adjacent
           to the servery at the bottom of the new stair flight
           leading from Spion Kop and a new concrete landing added
           in the same area.
               Certain items of maintenance work which it is
           suggested should be carried out at an appropriate time

     You vi 11 alre&iy have received a copy of ths ainutes of the Officer Working
     Party ( S h e f f i e l d District) relating to ths S a fe ty ef Sporta Grounds Act
     1975 as it appertains to Billsborough Stc-dius, ar>3 I now attach for your
     Information and your file * copy of a note I have dictated for sty
     divisional file relating to the prorisloQ of the police roos facilities
     at the club.

      Ky position as Divisional Pomander is »os«vhat da lieita ia that following
      probleas with the evening B&tch when Ifednesday vere at hcesa to Rotherhaa,
      Z pressed the Club aanageaent into considering putting in aore turnstiles
      as there tras a vary real risk to pedestrians queueing outside the
      Penistone Road turnstiles and spilling into the dual carriageway. That
      initiative vas largely responsible for the Club's present position.

«     Z knew that we have to abide by the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
      as written - and can never knowingly consent to breaches of the rules,
      but in all the «•*»» I have been responsible for the policing of
      Billsborough there have been a mssber of occasions when I have had
      considerable probless (and resultant risk to life and lissb) getting
      people into the ground but never one occasion when ve have had
      difficulty getting thea out. Despite that, however, what has coos out
      of this current save is that the Club new knows that the County Council
      really have thea by the 'short and curly's' and unless and until they
      take action to provide the facilities required by the Act, then they are
      not likely to be granted any other for® of concession - tesporary though
      it Bay be.________'

                                          and Security Gates

                  The work on the radial fences jtfid security gates
      indicated on our drawings 3563/l~3 which we sent to you on
      2 September 1981, is now subsjantially complete.
            Three first team home games have been played since the
      fences were erected.                                  We have not heard any formal comments
      from the Working Party about the operation of the fences and
       their access gates but we understand that representatives of the
      South Yorkshire Police have inspected the work and they are
      satisfied with the new arrangements.
                  To increase security it is proposed that pairs of gates
      are installed at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of
       the West Stand.                       Two copies of our drawing 3563/4 are enclosed
      showing details of vthe gates.



                                                                                           Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT/ 1975
SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY F00T3ALL CLUB LTD

I refer to ycur letter of 23 December 1981 and to the letter from Messrs.
Eastwood & Partners - the Club’s consulting engineers - relating to their
proposals to erect a pair cf security gates at the base of the two staircases
at the rear of the West Stand at the ground. Fran a policing point of view I
see no problems whatever concerning the erection of these gates, subject of
course to then being secured in a fully, open position during the time the
public parts of the ground are occupied when matches are being played.

Dealing now with the radial fences which have recently been installed on the
Leppings Lane terracing, I can confirm that the fences are working particularly
well and proving to be most satisfactory in effecting the segregation of
opposing groups of fans. Sines the fences were put up there has been no
fixture at the ground of sufficient interest to result in that entire section
of terracing being given to one group of fans and so I as unable to comment in
that respect, but I see no problems whatever.

Eowever, there are one or teo points concerning the actual construction of the
 fencing which give cause for concern from a police point of view. In seme
places the existing barrier rails .have been extended up to and completely
through the new radial fences at a height of 4'6" or so from the ground,
^ ’iking it very easy for fans to climb from one pen to another. In other
P aces the existing barrier rails have been cut off short of the radial
fences, leaving what the police consider to be dangerous pieces protruding
into some cf the gangways. This natter has been drawn to the attention of the
Club Secretary, who has been advised of my intention to bring it to your
notice. I would point out that Hr. England totally agrees with police
observations regarding the construction of the radial fences but I understand
from him that it is being suggested that any alterations could conceivably
result in a reduction in the capacity of the Leppings Lane terracing. I am
not aware of the thinking behind that but for my part see no reason why that
 should be.

                        For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


                        Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                                                Safety of Sports Ground Act
                                       Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
                                       I believe the small number of points needing
                        clarification have already- been discussed between
                        John Strange and Mr. Sheriff.                                       One of these refer to the
                        need for a goal post type frame oyer the gates but this is
                        in fact already provided by the sheeting frame.                                                 There is
                        also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
                        of reinforcement in the 100mm thick retaining wall.                                                     There
                        is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
                        maintenance repair will be carried out.
                                       Turning now to the radial barriers on the West
                        terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
                        crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
                        it will make it easier for anyone who so wishes to climb
                        over.          Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
                        leave the crush barriers as they are.                                           If all barriers
                        were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
                        would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by.barriers.
                                                                                                                                                     c ^    c*

 There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
 capacity which is undesirable from the Club's point of
 view.     However from the point of view of safety a strip
 of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
 major hazard.
         it should be kept in mind that the introduction
 of these radial barriers has effected a very great
 improvement from the point of view of segregation of
 spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
 view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.
 I believe that what we have done is a reasonable compromise
 between the various interests.
         In the second paragraph on this subject you
 refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
 crush barriers.     I have not had an opportunity to check
 this since receiving your letter but I am informed that
 the word 'dangerous' is'a little exaggerated and they
 do not of course protrude into a gangway as there is no
 gangway at this position.
         With regard to the security gates around the North
 stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
 the gate width is "at all critical.    The remaining clear
 width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
 Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
 eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
 per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
 routes.     The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
 practice more than half the number tend to use the lower
 exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
 to the upper set of exit stairways.     The picture is that
 fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
 exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight minutes.

          There were very good structural reasons for placing
' the gates in this way.     • The theoretical exit capacity has
  not been changed since it was always a six unit gateway.
  There is no funnelling effect, and there is a good
  ’reservoir' area upstream of the gates.
          I telephoned your office yesterday but gather
  you were on leave and have again telephoned this morning ....
  with a view to agreeing a tentative date for the winter
  meeting of the working party.        I will try again in the
  next day or so.

For the attention cf Hr. E. England


Dear Eric,
                 Annual Certificate of Ground Safety
     He have completed the testing of the remainder of the
barriers at the Spion Kop end of the ground excepting
those bar#i4*s which because of their position cannot be
subjected to the test load.    Z aa pleased to say that all
the barriers withstood the load but unfortunately in a nuaber
of cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube deforced
considerably.    Zt is inevitable thatwwater gets under
these clips and they rust thus becoming weaker with the
passage of tise.    In one or two cases the clip actually
snapped as the final load vas taken off.         A total of 25 new
clips are needed oa-Spion Kop including a few on the barriers
at the top which have not actually been tested.         John also
inspected the Leppings Lane end and 10 clips are sufficiently
corroded to sake it wise to change then rather than vait until
they are tested during the n e x t y e a r s ^ jSe are using
a heavier gauge isetal for the j alngfflrocgii-^V clips 80 that -the.....
future life expectancy will be increased.             .
     The netal in the tube beneath the clips is also subject
to corrosion and 11 lengths each about *8ft. long on Spion Kop
are clearly nearinc the end of their life.         We have to^bear
in nind that the ccrrosion which can be seen on the outside may


                                                                            /
                                                      &
be matched by corrosion inside the tube which cannot
of course be painted.     Whilst all 11 lengths successfully
carried the test load you may think it prudent that they
should be replaced new because they could become dangerous
within five years.
      If all this vork is carried out (new clips on both
Spion-Kop and Lappings Lane plus 11 nev lengths of barrier
top rail on Spion Kop) the likely cost is between £1250
and £1500 exclusive of professional fees.     I should be
pleased to have ycur view as ttovhether ve should carry out
the whole of this work or Barely replace the clips on
Sp'lon Kop which csforssed under test in which case the cost
of the work would be approximately halved,
     John has already walked round the ground and he tells
me that sosie splitting and spelling of the concrete columns
is developing at rround floor level at the back of the
South stand.   I* shall be caking ay inspection in company
with the Buildinc Surveyors department representative during
this month and it is likely he will raise the matter.     In
any case it is important that splitting of this kind be dealt
with reasonably crtickly so as to ret&rd the* rate at which the
reinforcement corrodes.   I will discuss this matter with you
when X have seen the dajcagemyself.


                                      Yours sincerely.

          ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED BY THE
                                                 CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                                On 16 August 1982, I made an inspection of the ground,
          after having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
          on Spion Kop tested by members of my staff under my control.
                                At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 43, 44, 45,
          46, 51, 52, 53, 54,                              62, 63, 63A, 65, 66, 72,                           73, 74, 75, 76, 78,
          79, 80, 86, 87, 88,                              89, 91, 92, 94, 95, 97,                           98, 99, 100, 101, 103,
D         104, 105, 107, 108,                             109 and 110 were tested                            in accordance with the
^         procedures laid down in                                  the Guide to Safety                       at Football Grounds.
          All the barriers sustained the test load although in some instances
          the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed.                                                              These clips have
          been replaced.                            At the same time, other clips and horizontal rails
          showing signs of advanced corrosion were replaced.
                                I am now able to certify that all 41 barriers have a
          satisfactory strength.
                                Two radial fences have been installed on the Leppings
          Lane terrace to segregate spectators.
                                Gates have been installed at various locations around
          the ground to prevent intruders entering the stands.
                                Repairs have been carried out to six stanchions
          supporting sheeting along the boundary wall near gate 'O' on
          Penistone Road.                                           j b m b

         thS- south exit-at the.front of the West stand have been_.._.__.
         ground smooth.
                   Various minor items of remedial work to concrete
         and brickwork walls, steps, terracing and the like have
         been    c o m p le te das part of the maintenance programme.
                           Certain other items of maintenance work which it          .
    J
         is   s u g g e s te d   should be carried out at an appropriate time
         have been recommended to the Club.             A list is attached.
£                          I certify that in my opinion the various structures
         on the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate
         for the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down
         in the Certificate of Ground Safety.                        ■

                 Dear Hr. 8herriff,
                          Sheffield Wednesday Tootba11 Club Ltd.,
                                 Barrier Testing 1983
                        Over June 20 - 24, crush terriers 121, 122, 123, 124,
                 124A, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134,

                 153 and 154 (part) at the Lepping Lane ead vere tested In
                 accordance vlth the procedure laid dovn in the Guide to Safety
                 at Football Grounds. The layout of the barriers is shovn on
                 the enclosed.print of our dratlng 1610/64B.
                        Spans 3 and 4 of barrier 136 could sot be loaded because
                 of the recently Installed radial fence. So m spans of
                 barriers 144, 145, 148, 149 and 154 could not be tested because
                 being towards the back of the terrace tie absence of a suitable
                 reaction point or obstruction prevented Jacking.
                        In all but'one case the barriers sustained the teat load
             '~v although in tvo cases the clips retalnizg the horizontal tube
\
                 deforaed. These^trere on barrier 136 berreen spans 8 - 7 and

has been velded onto tbe clip to give a aore positive
fixing, but nevertheless tbs test load vas resisted.
     The only failure vas tbs centre support of barrier
141. Tbe angle leg, vhicb vas corroded round the top
rivets, parted during tbe first load application. Tbs
angle has been plated and nev bolts inserted to coaplete
tbe connection. This Is sbovn on our enclosed sketch,

        A*
A.     South Stand

The a l t e r a t i o n s and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" in sp ectio n ) were shown to the O f fic e r
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of sp a lled concrete on the v e r t i c a l columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive a t te n t io n
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

( i i ) That the unsecured wire to the illum inated "Exit" sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would r e c e iv e a t t e n t i o n by the Club.

with the appropriate Regulations.

of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of

the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
Club’s development proposals proceeding; that the loose coping stores
had been removed froea the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i) That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
continue to be monitored.

(ii) That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

      Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

3.   Public Address System

The Club pointed out that an improved public address system had been installed,
and the Police confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
better than the previous system.                                      - -     -

          Dear Mr Chester

          SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS TO LEPPINGS LANE END OF THE GROUND

          With reference to our conversation of last week regarding improvements
          required to the West End of the ground, I forward herewith our thoughts.

          You will see that we favour the erection of a stone wall on the ground side
          of the current terraces, with such wall housing a bank of turnstiles. Our
          belief is that once a spectator goes through the turnstiles he should then
          be segregated from the other fans, and this can be achieved by the erection
          of permanent high metal railings on that concrete area at present behind
          the Stand. Similarly, there should be a high metal railing down the centre
          of the West Stand. What is then created is total segregation of all three
          portions of the Terrace and the two areas of the West Stand, with each of
          these segregated areas having its own refreshment and toilet facilities.

          If you have any query on these recommendations, no doubt you will come back
          to me.

          Yours sincerely




           Chief Su

               Note of a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield
               District) held at the Police Sports & Social Club, Niagara
                             Sheffield, on 18th April 1985


PRESENT: N. Atkinson (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
         C. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
                     (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
                     (South Yorkshire Police)
                     (South Yorkshire Police)
         G. Sykes    (South Yorkshire Police)
         D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
                     (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)


1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
and plan from Messrs. Eastvood 4 Partners relating to the proposals of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

2.    Consideration of Proposals

The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
home supporters as well.

The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
Police representatives, subject to:-

(a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
      and the wall of the inner access' road;

(b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
      visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in half by a new
      central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
      pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
      to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed r.ew
      secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
      on the plan to be abandoned);

(c)   the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
      terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence
      running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
      fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
      home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

(d)   the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit sates
      installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
The County Fire Service saw no objection in principle to the proposals,
subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

3.   Action

IT WAS AGREED

(a) That              should investigate as a matter of urgency the means
of escape aspects of the proposals'and let D. I. Vaughan know the
outcome.

(b) That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
County Fire Service, the .outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions of the South
Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of tbe
necessary detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of 'Sports
Grounds -Act and Building Regulations.

      Thank you for r e t u r n i n g the marked cooiea of our drawings
 6705/2 and 3. After our telephone conversation yesterday we
 have altered the layout accordingly. Two prints of our drawing
 6705/4 are enclosed for your cconents.
      Ke have equalised each combination of turnstiles and «ate
 as requested but each gat* needs to be at least 2.75 a for exit
  mrposes..
      Zf this arrangement is satisfactory, or* even If you wish us
 to sake more alterations# ve would be available to have a sieetlng
 with you and South Yorkshire Police souetlae neat week to discuss
 the proposals In detail...           ______

              Dear Sir

               SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
               SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FC

              Further to the joint meeting on 18 April 1SS5, to discuss the proposals for
              new crowd control arrangementsthe means of escape implications have now
              been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
              certain gates have the minimum widths (in metres) as indicated on the enclosed
              plan • It is understood that these gates will be supervised by either the police
              or club officials.

               Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact
               this Department.

               Yours faithfully




               DIVISIONAL COMMANDER.

         X understand, following John Strange'a telephone conversation
 with you yesterday, that South Yorkshire County Council did not send
 you* copy of tbsir letter to us dated 2 May.          A copy is now
jsnclosed.
         A nuaber of things that they request-have already been

t        corporated sines we wrote to thea on 9 April.             However I do
         not think that it is realistic to ask for ths gates in the radial
 fences and have written to David Vaughan accordingly.

                                 Yours sincerely.

         For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

         Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                    Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
        of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
        to you on 9 April,
              . In the interim period several of the points which you
        raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
        which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.   However I
        would ask that further consideration should be given to zhe
        request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to
        be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
        barrier which you have asked for to have two gates. If these
        gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having    a
        steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
        would hardly be justified.                                 It is our view that in the event of
        emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by rhe
        gates on to'the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
        We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
        Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                             Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

 I" reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
 w   of zny earlier letter of 2nd Kay were Included primarily at the request
'   Jie South Yorkshire Police.

m  >vided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
are incorporated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radial fence
in the right hand area of the Leppings Lane End Terrace (indicated as hoae
supporters' terrace on the plan).


                                                 Yours faithfully.

Dear Dick,
                                         Alterations at Leppings Lane End
      We have pleasure in enclosing two prints of each of our drawings
6 705/5 and 6705/8 showing two possible alternative arrangements for
the turnstiles and toilets at the back of the West stand.
                   Both drawings show the following turnstile arrangements.
                              Turnstile Nos                   1-8    -   North stand

                                                             14 - 16 -   West stand, home supporters

                                      20 - 23 - South west terrace, away supporters
                   The proposals for the toilet and refreshment facilities are also
the same on eachdrawing. You will see that we propose to build a new
ladies toilet for away supporters using the end of the existing
refreshment bar. The existing ladies toilets will be refurbished for
the use of home supporters. The existing gents toilets will be
divided and refurbished.

separate the home and away supporters. However, doing the calculations
for the evacuation of the ground reveals that there is a pinch point at*

    It could take over 20 minutes to evacuate that end of the ground
    depending on how many people leave the South stand from that side.

    arrangement by demolishing the two end turnstiles (17 & 18) and
    constructing a new dividing wall angled across to enclose three
    gates on the left hand side instead of two.
         We believe that the cost of the scheme on drawing 6705/5 will
    be about £57,500 and for the one shown on drawing 6705/8 around

t   £59,500, both including professional fees. To these figures add
    say another £3000 for the maintenance work mentioned in our letter
    of 2 May.
         If a decision to proceed with one of the proposed schemes is
    given within the next few days it may be possible to have the work
    substantially complete by the start of next season. This is not
    certain but we would have a go.


                                                           Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,
                                Ground Safety Work, 1985
                      Meeting with Chief Superintendent Moseley
                             and Councillor Mike Smith
    As requested I met the police representatives on Thursday,
13 June.   I had some difficulty in persuading Mr. Moseley
that it was not appropriate to have a high segregating barrier
down the middle of the seating area .in the West stand.                                          I think
he finally accepted that it was not necessary to do any more
than have a relatively low level rail which would, be sufficient
to make the two lots of spectators go to the appropriate
refreshment bars and toilets and also make their way out through
the correct route.
    Superintendent Moseley was very concerned about the
segregation of the two lots of spectators on the West terrace
on those occasions when the centre of the terrace will be filled
by visitors.   He said that on the occasion of the Liverpool
match he had had to station policemen in pairs down the full
length of the dividing fence and this had been a very uncomfortable
situation for the officers.   Not least of his difficulties was
that it was not easy for the officers to get in

     particular area if the ground was packed with spectators.
     He felt that a higher fence than the present one or a double
     fence was necessary.     I suggested that we should have a double
     fence with a gctp between so as to keep the spectators
     and to provide a space in which his officers could stand.
     Fewer policemen would be needed if the spectators had a
     gap between them.      It so happens that right alongside the
     existing fence there is a gate on to the pitch and if the
     second fence were placed on the other side of the gate, it .
    will provide an easy access gangway for the police and they
    will be able to move in and out of the gap depending on the
    situation.   Mr. Moseley was clearly very pleased by this
    suggestion and subject to your approval, we are including
     the work in the contract for segregating the spectators at
     Leppings Lane end.
         I should point out that it will mean losing about a metre
     of advertising space because the hoardings carry straight on
     past that particular gate at present.   There will have to be
     a gap in the hoardingsto enable the police to get in and out and
     of course, to evacuate the crowd in emergency.


                              Yours sincerely.

    For the attention of Inspector C. C a l v r t .

    Dear Mr. Calvert#
                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
          Further to .'our telephone conversation on 24 June we have
    pleasure in enclosing two copies of oar drawing €705/8 showing
    the proposed arrangement of the turnstiles and fences and gates
    at the raar of the West stand*
^         It is also proposedf but not shown on the drawing to
9   xnstall a single barrier rail# just above head height down
    the centre of the seated area and also a fence approximately
    2s away froa the existing radial fenca»on the right hand side
    of the terrace (looking froa the pitch)#to separate standing
    spectators. The fence will be just like the ones almsdy installed.
          Although Dr# Eastwood has discussad the proposals in
    outline with Chief Inspector Moseley we would also appreciate
    receiving your consents.
          Perhaps the work can be completed ready fox the start
    of the season if the scheae meets with your approval.

                                      Yours sincerely#

Dear Dick,
                    Alterations at Leppings Lane End

     We have pleasure in enclosing a set of prints of our drawings
showing details ox the work at the Leppings Lane End.
     Drawing 670S/8A is worth a look at because it shows the proposed
layout of the turns tiles and fences. South Yorkshire Police have
given their approval to the scheme though we have not received
anything from thea in writing.
     Tenders are due back on 11th July, 1985.
                             Yours sincerely.

Dear Dick,
                                   Alterations at Leppings Lane End
                 As mentioned in your telephone conversation with John
Strange yesterday we have now received tenders for the work
at the back of the West stand and including other general
maintenance items.
                 Four completed documents were received together with a
completed Form of Tender from J. Lee and Sons.                                          The tender
return envelopes were opened by Richard Eastwood, witnessed by
John Strange on 11 July 1985.
      The total tender sums are as follows s-

                 Gleeson (Sheffield) Ltd.                              £73,735.00
                 J. Lee and Sons                                         74,150.00
                 J. Finnegan Ltd.                                        79,432.00
                 J. Glossop Ltd.                                         99,634.15
                 A.J. Loveland                                         106,494.08

                 Each of the tenders includes a contingency sum of 10%
which may or may not need to be expended. The arithmetic
in Gleesons document has been checked and a minor error increases
their tender sum. by £0.20, to £73,735.20.

                                An Unlimited Company. R*gi*t#r*d in England - No. 1833144   _____
                                                                                                                    Si<?
EASTW O O D £r PARTNERS




         You will recall that on 4 June we wrote to you saying
 that we expected the cost of the work to be around £62,500.
 Since then we have added the extra fence on the Leppings
 Lane terrace (£2087), the barrier down the West stand seated
 area £612) and repairs to and replacement of some crush
 barrier posts which did not pass the load tests which we
 recently carried out on Spion Kop (£1606).       The only surprise,
 as John mentioned to you, is the figure of £3000 entered
 against the item for removing and resiting the infra-red
 counters and control gear on turnstiles Nos. 17 and 18.       We
 had to ask the tenderers to go to Phillips Alarms for a quote
 this work because it is their equipment and they are still in
 the process of installing it.     They have, we suspect, taken
 advantage of the situation and' given a high price for the work
 though it may be that the exercise of moving the control box
 is more involved than we imagine.
        So, after deducting the 10% contingency in the tender
 offered by Gleesons and deducting the above extras we arrive
 at a figure just over our estimate, though we do have to add
 planning and building regulations fees and professional fees
 which will probably amount to about £6000.
       We recommend that the tender submitted by Gleeson
  (Sheffield) Ltd. is accepted but we will wait until you have
 had the opportunity to discuss the tenders with your board
 before sending Gleesons a letter of intent. Gleesons have
 told us that they can start work almost immediately.


                               Yours sincerely.

      Dear Sirs,

      Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

 0^   As requested by your letter dated 16th July, I have written a confirmatory
      letter to the dub regarding the steel sheeting and noo-slip surface of
      the timber deck to the South Stand upper seated area (copy attached for .
      your information).

      Z understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval
      have been made by the Club in respect of (i) re-organisation of fences
      and turnstiles and alterations to toilet facilities at the rear of the
      West Stand, Lappings Lane, and (11) erection of roof and enclosure to the
      Spion Kop Terrace.

      The Officer Working Party considered and gave approval In principle to the
      rear of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in Hay but, other than
      brief taentions by the Club or yourselves at routine meetings of the
      possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
      of such proposals have b*en considered to date.

      As on previous occasions, I am assuming that you vill subnit the necessary
^     detailed plans, specifications and calculations for Safety of Sports Grounds
W     Act approval (bearing ia mind the General Safety Certificate requirement
k     to give the County Council at least 21 days notice of any proposed
"     alterations or extensions at the Ground) should the dub decide to implement
      the proposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

h o lid a y s. The plans a lso included d e t a i ls o f repairs to c er ta in crush,

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                  Safety of Sportsqround Act, 1975
                          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
       Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.   We note
the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
by the Building Surveyors Department. We believe that all the
calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
checking and comment.
       With regard to your detailed observations our response
is as follows :-
(a)    We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
the proposed extra security gate. There is already a gate in
the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
police. This same gate will still be available for the spectators
in emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
which will be under the control of the police.   This point may
perhaps be clarified during the Working Partyrs visit on 7 August.
(b)              The foundations ‘for this fence are in fact already aligned in
                               An Unlimited Company, Registered in England — No. 1833144
EASTWOOD br PARTNERS




 the way you suggest.

  (c) and (d)
        We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
 single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
 walls. The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
 vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
 Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
 durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

  (e)   The refreshment area is under the most westerly
 staircase up to the north west corner terrace.   There will
 be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.

  (f)   The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4'1")
 above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
 step.

 (g)   The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
 chamfers which will not form good footholds.

 (h)    Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
 object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
 the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

 (i)    As with point (a), we are hot sure what is intended,
 and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

 (j)   Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
 taken care of by Mr. Chester.


        It will be much easier for your Working Party to
 appreciate what is intended when they see the works under
 construction. There will also be an opportunity to see
 the metal decking of the South stand.


                           Yours sincerely,



 c.c.   Mr. R.H. Chester

1.    Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "sucmer" in sp ection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.    Ground In sp ection .

A.    Leppings Lane End

The progress of the works to segregate v i s i t i n g supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular referen ce to the
p oints raised at the O fficer Working P arty's meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief E xecu tiv e's l e t t e r
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners rep ly of 1 s t August.

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that a l l the c a lc u la tio n s which
were l i k e l y to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and comment. .

On the in sp ection , the Building Authority pointed cut what they considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
dividing wall which was being b u ilt behind the Stand. The p o sitio n of the
P o lic e Personnel access gate and the stepping of the fa c e of the wall by
45 chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had a c t u a lly been
aligned so as to maintain the e x i t width betveen the outer (riv er) wall
and the T u rn stile (unlike the in d ica tio n on the plan subm itted).

As regards the sin g le block thickness of the internal w a lls of the cu b icles
in the new male and female t o i l e t f a c i l i t i e s at the rear of the stand,
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the in sid e of a t o i l e t cu b icle
was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the w alls were braced
by both the outer w alls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern.that the
                                                                                            17



dividing w alls in the new t o i l e t f a c i l i t i e s ev id en tly did not have any
foundations, apparently having been b u ilt str a ig h t onto the e x is tin g
concrete sla b s . I t was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick w alls
in the Hale T o i le t s , i t being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more l i k e l y to occur there than in the Female T o ile t s .

The Club pointed out that the new t o i l e t f a c i l i t i e s would not be completely
fin ish ed by the f i r s t match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary f a c i l i t i e s would be availab le and that no building m aterial would
be l e f t on s i t e .

The p o sitio n of the new refreshment area under the most w esterly sta ir c a s e
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been b u ilt
stra ig h t onto the e x is tin g concrete slab s.

On the Terrace i t s e l f , i t was noted that there was an e x is tin g gate in the
new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new rad ial fen ce fo r use by the P o lic e .
This gate would s t i l l be a v a ila b le for the use of spectators in an
emergency as the gates a t the top of the Terrace under the control of the
P o lic e would enable spectators to be d irected down the 2 m. wide gap.
However, i t was agreed that step s or a longer gate would be required. I t
was a lso agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by l e t t e r dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access l e v e l.

IT WAS AGREED

(a)        that the condition of the internal w a lls in the new male and female
t o i l e t f a c i l i t i e s a t the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

(b)   that the e x is tin g gate in the pitch perimeter fence should eith er be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new ra d ia l fence;

(c)   that a new gate in the p itch perimeter fence should be provided from
the new South Central Terrace Pen;

(d)   that the ad vertisin g hoardings at the fron t of the upper seated stand
area should be secu rely fixed to the concrete w all;

(e)   that the sp a llin g of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
upper seated stand area should receive a tte n tio n as a matter of maintenance;

(£)   that the corrosion o£ the s t e e l columns a t the rear of the Stand
should receiv e a tten tio n on a maintenance b a s is .

B.    South Stand

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reported that the co n d ition of the upper
concrete outer portion of the exterio r wall of the Stand had been
investigated and was considered to be s a t is f a c t o r y .

I t was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand had been la r g e ly completed, and the spraying of the n o n -slip
surface was to commence very sh o rtly (and c e r ta in ly be completed by the
sta rt of the season).
IT WAS AGREED that che metal sheeting of Che wooden upper portion, of the
Stand should largely overcame che flaamability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and Che Club stated thac they would ensure that che
wooden Internedlate seeps w«re securely replaced upon completion of che
laying of the metal sheeting.
C.    Spion Hop

Messrs. Eascwood 4 Partners recalled chac outline details of che Club's
proposal Co cover che Spion Rop had been sent for the information of Che
Officer Working Party by leccer dated 22nd July. As pare of chac scheme,
che bridge porcion of Che Kop would be renewed. Ics presenC condition
remained acceptable with concinuiog maintenance.
In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to Che South Stand to overcase the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present.
IT WAS AGREED that che Club would provide a new ^ate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrangement to assist access and egress.
i>.   Worth Stand
The temporary storage facilities created by Che erection of a timber wall
(in front of the Ladies' Changing Facilities in the Sports Ball) were
inspected.
IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
scored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.
E.    Closed CircuitTelevision Facilities
The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
the Stadivoa) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
Television System were explained Co the Officer Working Party.
IT WAS AGREED

(a)   thac a 2$ kg. C02 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
Police Control Box and'the Disc Jockey Box;
(b) thac loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
secure.

    Omar Dick,
          Many thanks for your note of 12 Anguat enclosing the
    copy of David Vaughan's note of the meeting held at the ground
    on 7 August.   A copy of my letter to David Vaughan was sent
    to you the same day so that our letters have crossed in the
f   post.
            You will see that Z have taken up very strongly the
    suggestion by Don Shertlf that the workmanship in the brickwork
    was poor and would lead to weakness. Zt is unfortunate that
    David Vaughan did not record that I had completely refuted
    what Don Sheriff said.    David now recognises that this was a
    mistake but & putting the u t t e r right by circulating a copy
    of my letter.
           Turning to the matters on the second paget-
    " It waa agreed*
    My comments on the points you have in mind are as follows *-

    (b)     This refera to the existing gate between the new 2m wide
            gap formed by the radial fence which will be used for
            police access only.    You will notice from the wording
            of David* § minute that Z persuaded them that steps eould
                                                                         »•   vy




              be used.   I have interpreted    this as being from
              the inside only which Beans that we will not lose
              any of your advertising space.   We have added the
              provision of soae timber steps on the inside to
              the work being carried by Gleeson.

        (c)   The other radial fence forcing the saall visitors
    #         pen has left a length of terrace without a direct
              access on to the pitch. There is of course a gate
              at the top of the terrace connecting into the next
              pen and we had hoped that the police irculd accept
              that as an adequate seans of exit in emergency.
              However at the seating they Bade the point very
              strongly that if soaeone had to be got out of the pen
              which has no gate or if there was aisbehaviour the
              police would only be able to get in via the neighbouring
              pen, passing up the terrace through the gate at the
              back and then down again in the isolated pen. They
              considered this unacceptable.   Z think that this

    t         particular ltea can be paid for oat of the contingency
              sua and suggest that it be added to Gleason's work.
j

        (d)   You will recall that when you and i went round with
              Superintendent John Freeaan he pointed out that the
              advertising hoardings on the parapet of the seating
              area of the Nest stand were slaply hook£d over the
              parapet wall and sooe of the hooks had been bent.
              We agreed that a fixing would be provided. Be had
              apparently reported this to David Vaughan so the
              matter vas raised again.  It is clearly a good point
              because any hooligans in the seated area could easily
              drop an advertising board on to people below.    x have
              in mind that the hoardings can be fixed by a runner
              of tiaber and again subject to your approval, this
              can be carried out as part of the present works
(e)   This is a very minor matter which can be dealt with
      next year.

(f)   You will probably know that the bases of the steel columns
      behind the West stand have bean queried year by year
      by Don Sheriff who has requested that exaavatlons be
      carried outto ensure bhat the steel is not rusting
      below ground level.    By chance Gleesons had exposed
      one of the columns and I was interested to see that it has
      not suffered badly.    However Z have pointed out that the
      columns do not carry any load.    They form part of the
      previous structure and were chopped down to that level
      when the new concrete stand was built for the World
      Cup.   They merely form a frame within which the brick
      wall is built. There is therefore no cause for concern.
      At the next meeting in February Z will try to get this
      item deleted from the list.



      Quite a number of items have now been added at Police
request. In addition there is the cost of the new gas main
and al»o unexpected costs in connection with the electricity
supply to the new refreshment area in the North West comer.
Z am asking John Strange to check on all these items to see
whether they can be accomodated within the contingency sum
which we included in Gleesons contract. X^am lan holiday but
John w l l O ^ ^ ^ g ^ ^ ^ e a ^ y next week.

                      Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                                           \

                                   Roof of North Stand
      I       spoke to you before going on holiday regardin§ the very
advanced state of corrosion which we discovered when I made an
examination of the external steelwork of the Ifgcth stand roof
at the end of the last football season.
           Attached are four photographs which are representative
of the conditions which I discovered.   Photograph 1 shows one
of the main trusses. It will be Jfeen that the vertical
member and the top boom and diagonal were fairly rusty and they
clearly needed a paint tre^phent because the paint had largely
disappeared and.corrosion can be expected to accelerate from now
on.   It has to be kept in mind that the roof was designed for
the pre-1970 wind loadings including downward suction when the
wind is blowing from the back of-the stand so that factors of

 according to the present day Building Regulations.
       At the time of my first inspection the bottom boom
 member was covered by some flashings which hid two side
 legs.   I arranged for representative lengths of these
 flashings to be removed and as you will see from photograph 1
 rusting had been taking place rapidly for many years. It seems
 that when the roof was painted last time the flashings were
 left in place so that there had only been the original paint
 treatment which had disappeared long ago.      Photograph 2
 was taken on the same day at another location. You will
 see that there is a very large rust lamination on the nearside
 leg of the bottom boom where a large piece of rust is splitting
 away from the remainder of the steel.
       In addition to the very serious rusting of the vertical
 flanges, there were many places on the web of this bottom
 boom member where rust had progressed quite considerably.
 The web had clearly been painted 18 years ago but because
 of the very shallow slope of the bottom boom (parallel to
 the roof) the rain which falls in it had been ponding thus
 keeping the steel wet for a considerable portion of the time.
 This had tended to occur locally where small dams of dust had
 built up.
       As a result of these findings I reported to the Club
 that all the steelwork needed painting as a matter of urgency
 but in addition, the bottom boom would need to be blast
 cleaned before painting and finally that a completely different
 form of flashing should be incorporated which would stop
 rain from falling into the trough and which could also be
 easily taken off when next the roof is painted.
       The Club took the decision to carry out the painting.
 Tenders were obtained and work began at the beginning of
 July.   When the flashings were taken off everywhere, we found
 even worse conditions in some places than had been discovered
 in the original inspection.   Photograph 4 shows the extent to
EASTWOOD fr FARTHERS




 which metal had been lost in soigi^-g>arts of the bottom boom.
 Photograph 3 was just as bad but the damage does not show
 up quite so well in the photograph. Incidentally, photographs
 3 and 4 show soae nice'"bright c" ^ "...j.ut pai/ii — isriiir.Jw-
 of the members. This steel had of course already been painted
 and does not represent the original condition.
       During the work on the underside of the roof which
 has also been painted but for which the Club is not intending
 to apply for a grant, we discovered that at many places
 water had been leaking between roof sheets and had caused
 some localised rusting.   The reason for this leakage is clearly
 the very shallow slope of the roof which is only about 1°
 (1 in 60).   A normal minimum roof slope is about 5°.    With the
 1° slope it seems that when the wind is blowing from the south
 rain which falls on the roof can be blown up the slope under
 the lap between sheets and small amounts leak into the stand.
       In order to give long term protection from this leakage
 which could in time cause the steelwork beneath the roof to
 become unsafe, I have recommended to the Club that they spend
 approximately £3,000 in having the lower edges of each roof
 sheet lifted and a seal placed before fastening the sheet down
  again.
        The Club will therefore be applying for a grant towards
  the cost of
  (a)   painting the external steelwork
  (b)   blast cleaning the steelwork which was worst affected
        by rust.
  (c)   completely new flashings over the bottom boom of the
        main trusses of a kind which will shed the rain and
         can be easily taken off for future painting.
  (d)   placing of the seal between all roof sheets.

        For your information the total cost of all this work
  including professional fees will_be in excess of £60,000.
  This does not include the cost of the internal painting for
  which the Club will not be applying for a grant. It is

For the attention of Mr. M.P. Robing.

Dear Mr. Robins,
               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                 Segregation work at Lepplnqs Lane
     The segregation of supporters at the Leppings Lane
end of the ground was first proposed soee tine before
September 1981, We do not know the exact date but the
original request that schemes be looked at was made by
South Yorkshire Police In the days vben Kr. England vas
the Club Secretary. Setae rough outline i U m o m s were
prepared at that time but the work did not proceed.
     In February this year the natter vas r a l M d again
and store schemes devised. Approval of a scbaeae was
given by SYCC In May. Shortly after that another# such
less expensive scheme was put forward. After agreeing
several natters of detail with SYCC and the Club,
construction work eventually started on 22 July* 1983.
The work is now almost complete.
     Enclosed are copies of the following documents
relating to the segregation workt-

     a)   Our letter dated 9 April,to SYCC*
         b)   Their reply dated 2 Kay.
         c)   Our letter dated 8 Key to SYCC.
         d)   Their reply dated 10 Kay.
         e)   Our report on the tenders received    for the work
              dated 12 July.
         f)   A filled in copy of the relevantpages ofthe
              Bill of Quantities received from Gleeson
              $Sheffield) Ltd.
    ^     The scheme involved the alteration of existing toilets,
    ^« e provision of new ladles toilets and refreshaent
     facilities because segregating walls prevented access to t
    the existing toilets and refreshment bars by either the
    home or visiting spectators.
         Also included in the Contract were various iteas of
    ground safety work. These are items 6 and 8, page 7/1 of
    the Bill of Quantities, itess 1 to 4, page 8/1 for the
    repair of barriers on Spion Top which failed the load test
    earlier this year and items 1 to 3, page 9/1.
         Enclosed are copies of the following documents
    relating to that safety work:-
^        g)   Minutes of a meeting with SYCC, held on 23
              January ,• 1985.
         h)   Letter frees Mr.            to SWFC.

      Following our recent telephone conversation, I am writing
      to confirm details of our new ’SAFEGATE* crowd control
      barrier system.

      As you will see from the enclosed description the main
      benefits of our product are as follows:

      1.       Full electrical control over opening.

               Can be opened locally                     (with a key) or remotely                           (by
               sw.i. trh).

      2.       Faj.l-safe opening.

               If electric c i r c u i t r y is broken, the gate opens
               (usually a secondary power supply is installed).

      3.       Un.ique eJectro-J.ccki.ng device.

               En.-sures gate opens on command, and stays closed,                                                 on
               command, irespectiv«? of stress factors.

        .      Careful           design and strong steel construction.

               In standard forms singj» or double units measuring
               2 and 4 nptrpp wide by 2 metres high are available,
               however gat^s can be made individually to customers
               own requirements.

      5.       Yellow flashing beacon.

              Fitted as standard above each gate,                                 which is energised
              when the gate is commanded to open.



                                                                                                   / C o n t 'd ....

                  THE   'SAFEGATE'



A new innovative safety gate called 'Safegate' is now
available fran Selflock Limited, a Firsteel Company
within the Lonrho G t o u d .


Oar engineering design and manufacturing expertise has
enabled us to produce a product that could completely
eliminate crowd-control problems. Increasingly, crowS-
control is presenting a major problem for organising
bodies, the police and safety officers; and the results
of poor control were tragically highlighted during the
recent disasters at Bradford and Brussels, but similar
problems could be averted with the use of cur new
electronic 'Safegate'.


A crucial feature of the design is the ability to open
the 'Safecate' either by remote control or manually at
tLe gate (try key) - immediately access is required.


In the event of a disturbance in the crowd, a bonk scare,
or fire, the gate can be opened instantaneously by a switch
from the controller's box, police cctrmand post or indeed
from any pre-detemined position around the stadium. In
this way emergency services can enter an otherwise fenced area
quickly for control purposes, or in the event of a fire, the
crowd will have another or several other exits to safety.
Painted bright yellow, a recognised and approved colour for
safety equipment, the visual significance of the 'Saferate'
is further emphasised by a yellow flashing beacon which
operates when the gate is opened. This feature is of vital
importance for in the event of an impending disaster the
crowd need to find the emergency exit as quickly as possible.


The 'Safecate' can incorporate a fail-safe back-up power
unit so that in the event of a power failure the gate will
still operate.


In composition, the rain frame posts together with the
bottom and top rails and also the main gate structure are
manufactured from mild steel structural hollow section.


To prevent people climbing the gate tut still allowing people
to view through the gate, 9rm dia. rods at approximately
75itto centres are welded to the inside too half of the rate with
a central bracing to prevent the bending of the bars by vandals,
whilst the bottom half of the gate has a heavy gauge diamond
pattern close set expanded metal panel welded to the inside,
with a cross bracing to stop vandals kicking the panel through
 (see attached drawing). Also to help deter climbing ever the
gate, barbed wire is installed.
2/

The gate is hinged down the one side, the type of hinae
used allows the gate to open past 90 , also when the
gate is being closed, because of the gap between the main
frame post and gates people vould not trap their hands or
clothing.


The locking systsn has a unique locking/release type of
mechanism actuated by a solenoid, controlled electrically
from either renote positions, or locally by use of a key.
When the command is given the gates open even if there is
crohd pressure against them. Subsequently, when the gates
are closed manually, the locks are re-set electrically.
The totally enclosed locking mechanisms are stainless steel.

It is recommended that the 'Safecate' has a brightly
coloured paint finish to attract the eyes of spectators in
an emergency (Paint Finish: Canary Yellow), aithouch other
coatings can be supplied on request.


The first gate to be put into use is at the International
Ground at Ninian Park for Cardiff City A.F.C. This
installation consists of a single gate which forms part
of the perimeter fencing separating the pitch from the
spectators enclosure. In this simple application alone the
advantages of 'Safecate1 are enormous. The 'Safegate'
prevents spectator access to the Ditch but in the event of
an incident the police or first aid services can gain
immediate access. If desirable the gate allows entry onto
the pitch if a spectator in the enclosure needs to be
vacated quickly in an emergency.


'Safegate' is a truly sianificant advancement towards
eliminating crowd problems. Moderately priced, the
'Safeaate' can be tailor made to suit almost any application
frcm a simple fence, or barrier, or a safety door: all
remotely controlled, easily installed and presenting a real
answer to crowd control problems.


In certain circumstances such installations can be eligible
for grant aid, through the Football Grourri Irrcrovement"Trust.


Selflock Limited provide a corrprehensive installation and
after-sales service.

Note   of a     Meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield Oistrict) held at
the    Police    Sports and Social Club, Niagara Sheffield, on 13thNovember, 1985


PRESENT:         N. Atkinson (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
                 C. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
                 R. Greenwood (South Yorkshire Police)
                             (South Yorkshire County Fire. Service)
                 A. McKenzie (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
                            (South Yorkshire Police)
                 D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
                              (South Yorkshire County Fire Servic-e-)


1.      Purpose of Meeting
 The purpose of the meeting was to consider the response to be given to the
 proposals outlined in the letter dated 25th October, 1985 and plans received
.from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
'increased capacity for the Spion Kop and consequent additional exit routes,
liltline details of the roof to be erected over the Spion Kop had also been
provided.

2.      Disabled Facilities
The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of the suggestions
proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled. If the disabled
continued to be accommodated in front of the North Stand, they would still
be in the "firing line" of mis-aimed shots and any clear sheeting over the
 top of the area they occupied could constitute an unacceptable hazard to
persons who might vacate the North Stand in an emergency situation by
climbing over the front wafci- of the stand onto the pitcH perimeter. It was
accepted that the means of escape did not provide for this to be done, but
 it had to be recognised that in practice this was a real possibility. The
structural strench of such a structure would also be something of a problem.
 The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled in front of the perimeter
 fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) was also
.unacceptable for the reasons stated by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

I ie suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
 lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
 to provide, say, a two-tier level landing on which to accommodate the disabled,
 With a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch perimeter fence in
 front of this area could be removed, and the disabled would continue to gain
 access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the North Stand as at present.
 This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
 toilets under the rebuilt terracing of the Spion Kop.

 The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.

 IT WAS AGREED that the proposals for the disabled, as now
• outlined by the Police representatives, should be supported and
 •transmitted to Messrs.■Eastwood & Partners as the views of
 the Officer Working Party, subject to there being no obstruction of exit
 routes and flows.
 3.      Enlarged Spion Kop
 The Fire Service and the Building Authority agreed that calculations showed


                                                               D G C U .V E H T N o .   5 1 1 * .
that the enlarged Spion Kop would provide for an increase of some 5,000
spectators on the present capacity of 16,850, and that the number of exit
widths required to achieve evacuation was 46. The proposals to increase the
tunnel exit on the north side of the Kop to 8 clear units and to provide a
complete new six unit staircase on the south side were regarded as acceptable.
As when the original calculations, had been made, the units of exit width
included the emergency gates in the pitch perimeter fence, but it was cons­
idered that landings in front of these gates should be constructed (as has
been done at Bramall Lane).
IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, the proposals from the
enlarged Spion Kop submitted by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners were generally
acceptable:-

     (a)    adequate headroom being provided between the nev roof and the
            upper rear and the new south side exit routes:
     (b)    to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents'
            toilets and the new ladies' toilets in the new six unit staircase
            on the south side;
     (c)    to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
            gates in the pitch perimeter fence;
     (d)    to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
            the south side and on the Penis tone Road side;
     (e)   until acceptablealternatives are available, the new exit gates to
            be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement under the control of
            stewards.

h.Roofing of Spion Kop
_




Whilst it was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals hadbeen
supplied to date, the Building Authority pointed out that the plans showed
that the gables were not lined.
IT WAS AGREED that this should be pointed out to Kessfs.'Eastwood & Partners,
as well as the fact that should any of the proposed works on enlarging or
roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season, it will be
a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to prevent
unauthorised access.
5.    Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of
spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

It was difficult to see h o w this could be overcome, as the physical restraints
to achieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present
position to continue.

6 .___ Duties of Stewards Booklet
IT WAS AGREED that the draft of a Booklet prepared by the South Yorkshire Police
outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and should be distributed
to designated grounds for the information and guidance of stewards employed at
such grounds. Factors peculiar to particular grounds could, of course, be
added if considered appropriate.

7.    Spot Checks at Designated Grounds
The Fire Service reported on the success of the recent spot check carried out
at the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club in conjunction with the
Police and the Building Authority, and reported that th<* Divisions of the
Brigade were being asked to carry out similar spot checks at designated
grounds in their areas.

IT WAS AGREED that such spot checks were essential to ensure that the required
standards were being maintained by the Clubs.

                   Thank you for your letter of 14 Nov ember s e t t i n g                                                                        out the
comments of the officer w o r k i n g party'o/j the p r o p o s a l s for the'
n ew roof over the Kop.                                     O u r r e s p o n s e is a s-follows


1. •• Disabled Facilities
        > First it should be e m p h a s i s e d tha t the d i s a b l e d will have
to be accommodated at g r o u n d level.                                                   N o other arrangement, is
possible at reasonable expense.                                                       The choice is between putting
them in front of the N o r t h st a n d or in .front of the Kop.
               Co nsidering first the Kop, y o u will k n o w t h a t the terracing
drops down below the level of the perimeter track. ‘                                                                                         It would
therefore be necessary to p l a c e the disabled slabbing." and-seating
b e hi nd the line of the p r e s e n t p er i m e t e r fence.                                                              E a c h disabled /
ch air including mano eu v r i n g space and also a r u n w a y in front
of the chairs occupies the same space as about 20 standing
spectators.                it would the r e f o r e be necessary to s a c r i f i c e 'the
     equivalent of about 1000 standing spectator places to accommod
     50 disabled people and their attendants.                   This would be
     extremely costly.         The Club has decided to increase the
     capacity of the Kop by 5000 people and the additional cost
     compared with mereIv roofin g over the present Kcp is in
     excess of £500,000.            Thus,   if 1000 standing places were
     sacrificed the cost to the Club would be £100,000 at least.
     Ancillary expenses would include moving the boundary fence
£    and reconstructing it to safety barrier standards plus the
     cost of the concrete hardstanding.                We also have to keep in
     mind that nor only wo u l d the spectators be in the firing
     line if anywhere near the goal but that in addition the new
     Kop roof only extends to the front of the t e rr aci ng so that
     the disabled would be virtua lly un protected from rain.
             The alternative propo sal of leaving the dis abled in front
     of the North stand has the advantage that the cantilevered
     roof extends some w ay in front of the seating so that there
     is some prot ection fro m rain except when the w i n d is blowing
     from the. South.           The Club would like to give complete
     protection from rain and is prepared to con side r the cost of
     the glazed roofing w h i c h we have suggested as a possible way
     of'increasing the comfort of the disabled.                   The glazing
     would of --course be of toughened glass.
             If the w o r king p a r t y has strong r e s e r v a t i o n s about the
     glazing then obvi ous ly it will            not be carr ied out.         However
     I should stress that there is no p oss ibi lity of the disabled
     being pl aced in front of the Kop because of the exorbitant
     cost.      The Clu b will continue to use the p r e s e n t location and
     the only question to be decided is whether it should be under
     cover or not.
             I should add that new toilet facilities for the disabled '
    . are an integral part of the.scheme             for the Kop and will be
     conveniently placed un d e r the North • e n d of the Ko d .

     !.     Enlarged Spicn Kcp
            Ca)T   All exit routes will have 2.4m clear head rccm
            (approximately 3 f t . ).


            (b)    We will need to discuss the pr opo sed barrier
            adjacent to the new ladies toilet.            The exit route
            widens- out very considerably from 4.1m wide at the
            location where the six unit wid th has been calculated
            and is approximately 6m wide alongside the toilet block.
            We therefore believe that there is no bottleneck effect
            and that a barrier might m ere ly provide an unseen
           obstruction which could create difficulty.              We will
            forward a larger scale drawing of the area so that
           o u r .comments can be cons ide red in m o r e detail.


            {c-\   -We-will; o f course p r o vi de the landings in front
           .of the -existing emergency gates in the pitch perimeter
           ■ f e n c e .but your wi l l know that there have been changes of
           view on th i s particular m a t t e r in the past and we would
           • not, wi s h the Club _to.be put to the expense of taking
           them out again wh e n members of the pre sen t officer working
           party-, axe. rep lace d w i t h the passag e of time.

            (e)    • Gates wi th-a t u m - b a r ar rang eme nt will be provided
           at the exits and the Club will of course provide stewards
           to control them.


    3.      Roofing of Spio'n Kop
           The gables will b e s heeted on the outside face only and
    will    not b e l i n e d .    This is normal in Kop buildings and we
    think it extremely, unli k e l y that’ there will be any difficulty
    with hooligans' climbing.-           The hor izo ntal rails are-at such
    wide spacings that it w o u l d be diffic ult for even the most
    •sgile to climb up. .            —
       vre are very mindful cf the need to complete the areas
open to spectators before the start of the new season.                           It
is conceivable that the co n t r a c t o r s will have difficulty
in completing the new terrace             steps at the rear of the Kcp
before the first game.           In that event secure fencing will
have to be provided as a t em p o r a r y measure.           However we
are r e a s o n a b l y confident th a t the whole of the terrace
area of the Kop will be c omp l e t e by the cue date.                  We
also intend to have all the n e w exit arrangements completed
but it is possible that work will still be going, on in toile
areas,   particularly the n e w t o ile t for the disabled.


4.     Cr o w d Flow at the, Lepp i n g s Lane End of the Stadium
       The Clu b is aware of the difficulties w h i c h the Police
have to contend with at the Le pp i n g s Lane end' and'has of' ''
course bee n very p l e ase d to help the problem by. the major,
works wh i c h were u n d e r tak en d u r i n g t h e ’last c l o s e season.' '"
We find it very difficulty to envisage anything, moire which
could be done at reas ona ble expense.


5.    Fire Brigate Access to the F r o n t of all Stands
      As pa r t of the w o r k s on the Kop, we are c o m p l e t e i y           " ’
r e m o d e llin g the area a r o u n d the existing, tunnel.         .The
head r o o m is being i ncr e a s e d to 2.4m and the wi d t h o f . tfte.,
tunnel is being increased also.              A considerable, a mount o f ■
e a r t h shif tin g will have to take place and this-
p r e s e n t s an opportunity to w i d e n the gangway so as to
enable say a fire engin e to pass between the No r t h stand
and the retaining wall of the Kop.                 If the Fir e Service
think this is of value,          I s hou ld be pleased to know the
w i d t h they would like .so that we can see w h e t her it can
be p r o v i d e d at reasonable c ost and without sacrificing, too
m an y standing spaces.                                                 •    •

 TO^       Secretar ies_of _Football_LeaguG_Cl)jbs


 Dear Sir,

 Following lengthy discussions between The Football Association
 and The Football League, we are now able to send you, ever our
 joint signatures, a revised Memorandum on Crowd Management.

 This document sets out to amplify and clarify the 'responsibilities
 of Clubs in relation to this most difficult problem. Both our
 bodies are fully aware of the enormous amount of time, money and
 energy expended" by our Clubs in ensuring that the public can
 attend matches in safety.    With the eyes cf the world on us,
 however," we cannot afford to relax for one moment.

 We ask you to study the Memorandum in great detail. Failure to
 act on any of the recommendations may be taken into account should
 a Club subsequently be charged with misconduct under Football
 Association Rules 23 and 24.^

                                                                 ^Yours faithfully

 •SEASON 1985/1986 AND UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE


A.        ADMISSION OF SPECTATORS

           1. Clubs must, in consultation with the Police and visiting Club, conside
              whether any match should be made "all ticket'1.
                a< If a rcatch is Jiade "all tickct" the hcrss Club ehall decide, i n -
                   consultation with the Police and visiting Club, how many tickets,
                   if any, shall be allocated to the visiting Club.
                b. Under no circumstances should tickets'be sold on the day of the
                   match. Maximum publicity should be given to this fact, in the
                   areas of both Clubs.
                c* Clubs are entirely responsible for the distribution of tickets
                   allocated to them and must take all possible steps to ensure that
                   tickets are not sold to supporters of the opposing team.

                d. Ticket sales should be restricted to two per person.

           2. Clubs must give serious consideration to restricting admission to
              part-of their ground to "members only".

          3. The Football Association may order any natch to be "all ticket" or
             "members cnly" and restrict the distribution of tickets in any way
             it deems aonrooriate.
                       * *  *

 3.       PRIOR PLANNING

          1. Clubs musti in addition to the above, undertake detailed liason with
              the Police, opposing Club, rail and coach operators and supporters5
            • Travel Clubs at least 10 days-before a match to determine the likely
             movements of spectators and any other relevent matters. In the cases
              of Cup ties, due consideration must be given, at the time of the
              Draw, to possible replay arrangements.
           2. The number of Police and Stewards to operate at each match must be
              agreed with the Police

           3. Clubs should consider, in the interests of control at particular
              matches, reducing capacity, even when agreed with the competent
              authority under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, either for the
              ground as a -whole, or for a particular section.
          A. Clubs should consider, if necessary, closing a particular section
             or sections of the ground.
          5. Clubs should consider in full consultation with Police, The Football
             Association and The Football League varying the kick-off times or
             even requesting permission to change the day of the match.
           6. The Football Association may close a section or sections of a ground
              for a particular match, or order it to be played without spectators.
SEGREGATION

1. Clubs must make adequate arrangements for the segregation of rival
   supporters.
2. To ensure segregation, it will be necessary to reserve a
   section or sections in’ the stadiun for visiting supporters.
   It is essential in this process that adequate information
   on the likely movements of visiting supporters is obtained
   by the Home Club in consultation with the visiting Club and
   the bodies listed in Bl.
3. If the match is not "all ticket", maximum publicity must
   be given to the 3ocation of the. v is ito r s * s e c tio n or sections.
   Such areas must be clearly sign-posted at the Stadium.

4. As far as possible, the arrangements for the transport of                  _
   visiting supporters should ensure that they do not come into
   contact with home supporters when making their way to and
   from the ground.
5. Contingency plans must be made to cove supporters situated
   in the wrong section to the area or areas allocated for them,
   or else to be expelled from the Stadium.
6. Wherever possible, segregation should be effected by permanent
   structures such as wall, barriers or fences. Only in
   exceptional circumstances should Police be called upon
   to form a "human" barrier.
7. Double barriers and walkway systems should be installed to
   allow the Police to reinforce segregation and to gain access
   to terracing or seating should the need arise.

8. Spectators must not be able to circulate freely between
   sections of the Stadium.

PROTECTION OF PLAYING AREA


1. An adequate number of Police and Stewards must be available
   to restrict access to the Field of Play.
2. Clubs must protect the playing field by means of a fence,
   moat, double-barrier, wall or other system capable of
   denying access to spectators. Any form of protection must
   incorporate an adequate number of exits, manned at all times,
   to allow access to the Field of Play in emergencies.
                                 I
3. The Football Association may instruct a Club to install such
   a fence, moat, or barrier, subject to any Designation order
   under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act which may be in force
   at the Club.
4. Clubs must provide adequate protection for players and officials
   entering and leaving the Field.
                                            > - w/   /
E.'"*' OTHER MEASURES AT THE GROUND

      1. A sufficient number of Police and adequately trained Stewards
         must be on duty before, during and after the game.
      2. Steps must be taken to ensure spectators do not bring objects
         into the ground that may be used in acts of violence.
      3. The ground itself must be kept clear of all objects which
         might be used as weapons or missiles.
     4. Refreshments must be sold in plastic containers or dispensed
        into plastic cups.
      5. Sufficient steps must be taken to exclude, 'in accordance
        ' with Government legislation, any spectator under the influence
          of alcohol.
                    *                  •*


     6. Clubs should also reserve the right to exclude,, and be capable
        of excluding, any person under the influence of drugs, any
        person known to them as a trouble-maker, or suspected of
        being a potential trouble-maker.

^     7. During the entire time of presence- of .spectators in the Stadium,
         all door and gates must be sufficiently staffed to control
         entry or exit.
      8. Clubs must take active steps to install electronic and other
         surveillance systems to allow Police to direct personnel

1.    Welcome and Introduction

Mr. Vaughan pointed out that the Local Government Act, 1985, would abolish
the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan County Councils)
on 31st March, 1986. From 1st April, 1986,. the Certificating Authority und*jr
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
Council. In the case of the Hillsborough Stadiua this would naturally be
the Sheffield City Council. For this reason, it bad been suggested to the
City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
Surveyors' Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr. J. Derricott were welcctaed and introduced to the
remainder of the representatives present.

Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to
the representatives for the help and assistance which they had given to him
in his role as Co-ordinator of the Officer Working Parties since 1978. There
had obviously been occasions when differences of opinion and interpretation
had occurred but, in the main, these had been resolved both amicably and
constructively.
For the Club, Dr. Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughan for his services and wished
him well for the future. Other representatives endorsed Dr. Eastwood's
remarks.

2.   Purpose of Meeting
The purpose of the meeting was two-fold; firstly to discuss the further
details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded with the letter
dated 23rd December, 1985, from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
to carry out the "winter” inspection of the Stadium.

A.   Development Proposals for the Spion Kop
The further details were in addition to the consents set out in the letter
dated 29th November, 1985, on the observations sude following the Officer
Working Party meeting held on 13th November.
       Dr. Eastwood reported that the sheeting o f the enlarged Spion Cop at
       the rear and s id e s would resu lt in the structure being virtually
       sealed. In rep ly to queries from the County Fire Service, he confirmed
       that no storage would*be allowed under the structure and that checks
       for any accumulations of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular b a sis.

        (ii)   Climbing of the-Inner Steel Frame

       As regards the p o s s i b l i t y of unruly spectators climbing the inner s te e l
       frame of the new stru ctu re, Dr. Eastwood reported that the bottoa boon jp
       member was now to be omitted. The resu ltant height of ove£ 10 feet
       would make i t very d i f f i c u l t for spectators to climb the structure.

        ( i i i ) New Step and Barrier Layout

       Drawing No. 6648/56 was circulated and considered. This related to the
       new step and barrier layout on the Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood reported
       in particular on the discussions which he* had had with the Planning
       Authority as to the height of an intermediate or a low second r a il to
       the b a r r ie rs.where the drop to the gangway below could b« over one metre
       in places. He sought the Officer Working Party's view sk and the merits
       of the options were considered.

I      IT WAS AGREED th at, in the view of the O fficer Working Party, the best
       option for a second r a i l in the areas described was a low toe r a il at
[      a height of some*200 ma.

B.     -F a c i l it i e s for the Disabled
To i l l u s t r a t e that the figu res originally quoted to provide f a c i l i t i e s for the
disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) were not
u n r e a lis t ic , Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender figures
(opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. He s t i l l considered
that any such proposals would involve the loss of up to'1,000 of the extra
5,000 spectator places which would be provided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
Other areas of the Stadium had also been considered and investigated, but
none could provide as large a f l a t , e a sily accessib le area as that in front of
the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so long without any major
problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area. The only
major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
could be blown onto the d isab led , despite the cantilever roof of the North
Stand extending v i r t u a l l y to the pitch. For t h is reason, the Club were w illing
to roof an area from approximately the le t t e r "O'* on the resu lts board to the
end o f the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) with a substantial roof, including
armoured g la ss where there might be a v i s i b i l i t y problem, provided that this
was supported by .the O fficer Working Party.
Whilst accepting much of what Dr. Eastwood sa id , the Officer Working Party
(and the Police representatives in particular) s t i l l expressed some concern as
to whether making semi-permanent f a c i l i t i e s for the disabled in front of the
North Stand was the appropriate and correct thing to do.

The Building Authority confirmed that, after further in v estig a tio n s, i t was
considered that the disabled f a c i l i t i e s requirements of the Building
Regulations 1985 did not appear to s t r i c t l y apply to the roofing of the
enlarged Spion Kop.




                                              [12.                              QW
IT WAS AGREED that, in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
plans of the. suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

C.    ground Inspection
      XU    West Terrace and Stand

The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
to the rear of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area '
of the stand could be moved within certain limits if the Police considered
that this would achieve a useful purpose.

IT WAS AGREED
(a)   that the additional advertisement hoardings at the front of the upper
seated stand area (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
fixed to concrete wall;
•



(b)   that further areas-of spalled concrete at the front of the upper
seated stand area should received'attention as matters of maintenance.
                                                             %
      (ii) North-West Terrace

IT WAS AGREED that the advertisement hoardings erected on the upper North-
West Terrace should be securely fixed.                                     X>

      (iii) North Stand

The area for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

As previously-mentioned by Dr. Eastwood',■the possibility of providing an
increased width access to the pitch area (between the North Stand and r.he
Spion Kop) for possible use by emergency vehicles, as well as far maintenance
by the Club was discussed. The facility could be incorporated into the
enlarged Spion Kop proposals relatively easily.
It WAS AGREED that, whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
was not essential for their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
vehicles in certain situations and generally should b« supported.

      (iv)   Spion Kop
Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct the enlarged,
roofed, Spion Kop, and confirmed that steps' would be taken to prevent
unauthorised access to areas where work might be in progress during the
coursVof the'season.
                    :* -•••' **              .-V « -       .
itwas*noted that the additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the
front corner.nearest to toe South Stand, with a stepped arrangement «.o
assist access and egress, had been provided.

      (v)    South Stand

It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden floor of the upper
portion of the Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
solution to the f 1 amiability problems inherent in s'-ch wooden structures.

IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to it monitored.

           The Interim Report of the Ccmittee of Incuiry into Crowd Safety
           and Control of Sports Grounds, under the Chairmanship of
           Mr Justice Popplewell, was published in July 1985 and has besn
           supplemented by Here Office Circular 54/85 which urges, amongst
           other things, chief officers of police to respond cuicklv and
           constructively to the spirit of the reccnrencations. ‘ The report
         . contained 24 recommendations including the following: -

             Recommendation 1          *

             'Evacuation procedures should be a rratter of police 'training
             and form part of the briefing by police officers before'a
             football match.'                o •

             RecorrnEndatlon 10

         v 'Stewards in ^=11 grounds should not only be trained in fire
          precautions and fire fighting but should also be trained
          in how test to help the police in evacuation.'

             As you are aware, evacuation plans and the training of stewards
             have been examined. A common fraTework makes reference to plans
             far sirpier and allows officers with lira.ted knowledge of the
             stadium to contribute mere effectively and with greater speed
             in an evacuation situation.

             In drawing up the suggested format it was acknowledged that
             ccnsicera'cle flexibility is necessary to take account of the
             many local factors that make each ground unique.

         Whilst resronsicilitv for the trair.inc of stewards lies f i r m s ! v
         with the club, the pc'lice have a vested interest in maximising
         the crcwd management potential of non police resources at sports
         grounds. To this end it is felt the police should provide a
         significant input into th-t training of stewards and that the new
         appsndix on srewarding (attached) provides a satisfactory basis
         for ensuring adequate standards are achieved and maintained.

         Appendix 'L', page 35 of the South Yorkshire.Police Standing
         Instructions for the Policing of Football Matches, should now be
         removed and replaced with the new Appendix.'L' pages 35 - 43,
         attached hereto.

         Page 2 of the Index of the Standing Instructions should also.be

 1.1             It is necessary, as far as is possible, to standardise our method
                 c  policing at ail football league grounds in South Yorkshire so
                 thit all officers of the force are c.-.=re that wherever they are
                 detailed .for duty, slight variations being accepted for each
                 ground, they will know what is expected of them. Additionally,
                 cy standardising our procedures which have been evolved through
                     •       _     _'   ^ * i    _ ..         **_    i_   _     xi        r _■ _     <•*

                  supporters into their area, provide ccoc value for money to the
                  clubs who pay for the hire of our services and display a high
               • standard of smartness and professionalise! before large gatherings
                 of the public.

1.2             It is accepted that there will be slight variations in policing
                at the five football league grounds to cater for the different
                conditions appertaining at each of them but the standard methods
                set cut in this "report will be followed throughout the police
                district.

1.3             It will be the responsibility of Superintendent (.Operations) to
                 circulate amendments to these instructions but it will be the
               ' duty of divisional commanders to bring to the notice of the Chief
      ^         Superintendent   (Operations and   Traffic) recommendations for
       '        amending this order, resulting freer, their experience in policing
                 football matches.

1.4             With a view to these standing instructions being frequently
                evaluated, they will be . discussed at a Chief Constable’s
                Conference .mid-way through the football season and also follov;ing
                the end of the season.     These discussions will coincide with the
                inspection of football grounds by the South Yorkshire County
                Council V.'orkinc Fartv involved with the Safetv of Scorts Grounds




2.1            The officer in charge of policing football league matches v.’ill be
                of not less than superintendent rah-:, with the exception of
                matches being played at Ball Vue, Doncaster, where the rank of
                the officer should net be less than chief inspector, unless the
                match is one-where, because of abr.or— al circumstances, an officer
                or net      triin s r ’—T'.-Cnic sr.CvLlc. c*s clcolovsi.

2.2            General policing outside the ground should be the responsibility
                of an officer not loss than chief inspector rank, but in the case
                of Dcncaster the rank may be that of an inspector. Tne duties of
               the officer, outside the ground will encompass the prevention of
               public disorder,   the supervision of car and coach parks, anti-
               vancelism patrols,   the supervision of licensed premises in the
               vicinity of the ground and the escorting of groups of supporters
               to and from the groan:].

    BRIEFING A^.vSEr-ST.TS

     4.1            The Officer in Command will, as far as is practicable, undertake
                     his briefing within the      close confines of the ground in
                     sufficient time to allow officers to take up their duties within
                     the ground before the cates ere open to the public, and outside
                     the ground before the main body of spectators arrive in the
                     vicinity of the stadium.

    4.2           All officers will be briefed with uniformed officers being
                   paraded in three ranks ready for inspection.-       It will be the
                   responsibility of • the briefing officer to see that each officer
                   is fully instructed in his duties       and  is smartly turned out
                   including having his hair cut to an acceptable length and his
                   beard or moustache trimmed - one        man of scruffy appearance
                   standing before a crowd of spectators discredits the force as a
                  whole. Officers not coming up to the acceptable standard will be
                  advised and returned immediately        to their sub-division or
                  station.    The officer in comrrand will subsequently report the
                • matter to that officer's divisional co-rrrrander.

     5.3         It is vital net to underestimate the colice cormritm-ent. but it is
                  impractical to lay down a basic overall police detail. This can
                 only be determined locally, through experience of the conditions
                 applying tc the area and of the staditm concerned and also of the

                than .serials to march or walk in single file especially around
                the perirri2 ter track. The order will specify individual duties

    Let ective and Plain Clothes Personnel

    .6.4        The main function of detective and plain clothes officers at
                football matches is the prevention and detection of crime outside
                the ground, particularly in relation to the theft of and from

              moderating influence on the behaviour of supporters.          The
              divisional crime and anti-vandal patrols will be considered for
              such a reserve strength.    However, it should be borne in min d
              that crime and vandal squads may be withdrawn at any tire to
              perform duties at major incidents. They should not, therefore,
              be considered when planning manpower requirements, or be included
              in Operational Orders.

7.5          The motor cycle wings      will be used for .facilitating the
             unhindered movement of traffic to and from the football grounds
              and for esccrting visiting tea.-, coaches into end cut of the force
             area when recruested to do so by Divisional Corrrnanders.

Police Horses

7.6         Police horses are invaluable in the policing of football matches.
            They should be used to escort visiting supporters to and from the
            ground in the segregation of-opposing fans, regulating queues at
  v         turnstiles and clearing the playing area in the event cf serious
            crowd invasion. A mounted officer has a greater field of vision
          • than his contemporary on foot and is of such value that police
            horses will be used at every first team football fixture in South
            Yorkshire! tvheh n e c e s s a r y , a request will be rra.de to the Chief
            Superintendent (Operations and Traffic) for the hiring of horses
            fro- other police forces.           During the care mounted horses, where
            possible, will be on view to the spectators. Their presence has
            a moderating influence upon potential hooligans.

  "i*   rv~-— ~


1.1         Cr. ? Ncverier 1975, the Hors Office Standing Advisory* Cormittee
             or. Felice Dees agreed that while ergs can be used to coal
             effectively with small grc-jps cf hooligans, they should not
             nr— ally be used wh=n large crowds ere present.     The Ccmrittee
             pointed out that the presence cf cogs ray well appear provocative
             and if surrounded by unruly crowds would be likely to becc-rre
             exrite;: and bite indiscriminately.

7.6         Whilst the Cormittes advocated the retention cf cogs in a reserve
            capacity, it could see no objection to their use as a deterent at
            railway stations, car or coach parks or along routes to footbcO.1
            crcur.dr.  It advised that cogs should not be used within the
            playing area at football ‘matches or other sporting events unless
            there were exceptional reasons.    This advice coos not preclude
            the officer'in charge from allowing them to be paraded around the
            perimeter track bsfore the kick-off and curing half-time so as to
            interest the spectators in their presence.
•T>       '                                            (G)

 7.9             Ihe Officer    in Ccxrtr.-nd will take the   above advice into
                  consideration but he has the overriding discretion tc use police
                  cogs if ho considers their use absolutely necessary to avoid a
                  dangerous public disorder situation.

 Specialist Eruicmsnt

 7.10            In cue course it is hoped to arrange v;ith football clubs for the
                  acquisition and use of closed circuit television end video
                  recording eruip~ont as at Sheffield Wednesday's crour.d. At this
                  staga the only visual aid v:hich v;ill be used at football fixtures
                  will be binoculars v:hich have bean supplied to e ach station
                  concerned with the five fcotball stadiims. • Divisional Co— .anders
                  should also consider using the facilities of Audio Visual Aids.

7.11           • The use of ’spotters' with binoculars in radio contact both with
                 the police control roan and arresting officers, is a technique
                 which has been successfully employed nationally.       They can
                 concentrate cn particular sections of the terraces renowned for
  •             disorder, where pick-pockets ere operating, from where missiles
                 are being thrown into the playing area, etc.

7.12            Cr.ce offenders have teen located by the        'spotters’, ether
                 officers can be cuided into' the crov.ds and directed by radio to
                 parsons to be arrested.        'Spotters* will subrr.it evidence
• "             accordingly.

7.13-           Consideration should ba given tc using a helicopter for traffic
                 control, and identifying public disorder situations in connection
 ..             with category    'A1 matches and possibly category     'B' games.-
                 Requests for a- helicopter     will be directed to the Chief
                 Superintendent (Operations and Traffic) for decision by Assistant
                Chief Constable (Operations).

                 The presence of spociel constables at football grounds is
                 ac/mcvledred as a valuable r-upplercr.t to the regular force. This
                 is eep-eeic.lly relevant in crcv.-d situatione where an enhanced
                 uniform presence ccnerihetes to the cbservance cf public order.

7.15            Special Constables can be use-d as a deterrent factor but whenever
                possible they should not be err.ployed in volatile situations.

 Dear Sir,                                                              ’

       I write to draw your attention to a recent innovation in the field of
 crowd/ground safety.

        This entirely new item of equipment will shortly become commercially available
 and available for demonstration at chosen venues around the country.

       The item is described below but of course it must be seen to fully appreciate its
poteztial.

      THE IDEA: to allow instant egress/access from a fenced in crowdarea of a
stadium in case of fire or disturbance-onto the playing area for safety.

       THIS MEANS; a set of fence posts which are hinged at ground level and held in
the upright position by an explosive bolt rated at 5 - 10 tons.

       These posts fit into existing fence structures or may be erected aspart ofa new
fencing system. The existing fencing is used when the new posts are installed. The posts
are installed in two’s (or more) thereby making a gate in the fence operated selectively,
by crc-d/ground section.

        Although the posts are operated by 'explosive bolts’ the bolts are absolutely safe
i.e. ther do not shatter and are contained within the hollow metal fence posts.
                                              >


       They are operated by selected ground/safety personnel when circumstances
warranting their need prevail. A low voltage visual control box is used for this purpose,
with numerous safety devices built in.

       I am sure you will agree that this idea will revolutionize crowd/safety and to that
end I ask that you consider the idea seriously and correspond showing your interest or
otherwise with a view to attending a demonstration in your part of the country.

      Tze cost of this/these item(s) is not yet available, but if sufficient interest is
shown a price would also be available shortly.

       This invention is covered by patent pending number /8602209.

Dear Dick/
                                                      Ground Safety
                Thank you for your letter of 21 April enclosing a copy
of the communication from Peter J. Kirby.                                            You will probably
know that there are several of these quick acting bolt devices
on the market.                   We have inspected some of them and have not
yet been convinced that any of them are foolproof and good
value for money.                           The South Yorkshire Fire Service have
also been keeping their ears to the ground and share our view.
                The one which is proposed by Mr. Kirby sounds to me
to be possibly dangerous.                                           Firstly, the gate is hinged about
its bottom edge and falls forward on to the pitch surround
when the explosive bolt is released.                                            It has to be kept in mind
that police walk past the gates and clearly there could be a
risk of injury.                         It is also undesirable that the crowd should
have to walk out over the top of the gate which would be lying
on the ground.
                The arrangement is also likely to be very expensive as
it would be necessary to buy completely new gates and fit them
in the safety fence.                                  There will also be the cost of wiring
all the gates back to the central control point.
                It seems the device is unlikely to be attractive but if

TO:     The Chief Superintendent - ’F' Div        DATE:        11 June IS86

        SUBJECT:   POLICING - HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL C-HOUND


        I refer to the’ memorandum dated 8 Hay 1966, requesting suggestions
        from various Officers who have been intimately concerned with the
        policing at Hillsborough.

        The policing of the ground is by and large a fairly’smooth affair
        but I believe that we coulc considerably enhance our efficiency
        with certain changes which could be made by the Club in their
        procedures.                    _             _

        Inspector Creaser has highlighted various cf these and all of them
        have been shown before when we have made approaches to the Club,
        in many cases with very little success. One of the greatest
        problems we have is access to-the ground, particularly at the

i       Lecpings Lane end.  The redesigned turn stiles do not give any­
        thing like the access to the ground, either on the Leppings Lane
        terraces or in rhe West Stand, needed by away fans.

        On occasions last season when large numbers attended, we had away
        supporters who were justifyably irate because of the inefficiency
        of the system , which was turned on the police and could have
         resulted in public disorder.

        One of the points which is not mentioned is the access fc:. home
        supporters at the Penistone Road end where ticket holders at major
        matches do not have sufficient turn stiles to allow smooth access.
        There is a gross lack of flexibility in the manner in which turn
        stiles operate at the ?=nistone Road end for the Spion Xcp and
        the North Stand, which may well be aggravated if more heme fans
        decide to use the Kcp new it is covered.

        I have in the past suggested at the Club that they look at the
        problems, both of allowing ticket holders easy access and stream­
        lining the entry for paying customers by using a number cf 'correct
        money turn stiles', as is the case at other grounds.
                                                   <

        Inspector.Creaser mentioned my interest ir. the manner in which
        packing is carried cut or. the Leppings Lane terraces.   The location
        cf the crash barriers cn rhese terraces ai the entrances caused
        considerable conges tier, and I believe that in the event of emerg­
        ency evacuation, the location of these barriers would prevent
        access to the tunnels.

        I am aware that there is a statutory recui remer.t as set out m
        the 'green bock' giving the number cf barr iers recuired in certain
        areas, but it may well be that new is the time to lock at the
        pciitic.-.s of certain cf the barriers with a visv to alleviating
        the crcbiems c_~ 1 ir.ed




                                                              _________ i
The West Stand cuV’-'cntly has c barrier giving approximately
a third to away supporters.    I was led to believe when this
was located last -year that facilities would be available at
major matches to move it to cive a greater proportion to that
Stand to away supporters but"l have heard nothing further.

Inspector Howland specifically mentions parade times and whilst
certain serials are not deployed immediately, in particular those
normally controlled by himself, they are available should they
be required.

Since the location of cameras at Hillsborough last year, it ias
been apparent that the coloured cameras, whilst being extremely
efficient in sunlight, are useless_in pocr light, ie night time
or at the end of the match through most of the season. The
location of a camera currently on the Kop will also require chang­
ing and I suggest that an approach be made to the club to have
a camera giving a view insice the newly covered Kop, and a second
black and white camera on the top rear of the new stand giving
a view of Penistone Road and Kerries Road South, which would
also be able to view the Leppings Lane island area.

I must echo the comments mace by Inspectors Creaser, White and
Sykes that the majority of problems as Hillsborough are as a result
of the clubs inability to efficiently run their own affairs on
match days.
Meeting with South Yorkshire Police 18th June 1986.

Present:   R. H. Chester, S. Iv Lane (SVFC) Chief Supt B. Mole, Supt J. Freeman,
            Chief Inspector D. Beale, (South Yorkshire Police).

                                 Representatives from South Yorkshire Police would
                                 attend the..instructional evening for- Stewards' whicn/ *
                                 will take place on 19th August.
                                 South Yorkshire Police will brief Stewards prior to
                                 every home game. This will be done by the Inspector
                                 in charge of each area of the Ground.
                                 South Yorkshire Police requestechthat all turnstiles,
                                 but particularly those at Leppings Lane, to be opened
                                 earlier. The Club agreed to do everything possible
                                 to ensure this.

Access at Leppings Lane          R. H. Chester aqreed to discuss with Dr. Eastwood and
                                 the Board the possibility of a wider door in the wall
                                 inside the Leppings Lane area, and more permenant
                                 barriers for use on limited areas.
                                 South Yorkshire Police requested more Programme Seller
                                 in the Leppings Lane area, both inside and outside t-he
                                 Ground.

             West Stand          South Yorkshire Police requested that a Steward be
                                 made available to patrol the front of the West Stand t
                                 prevent visiting fans throwing their tickets over.
                                 SWFC to sell tickets from Row 7 upwards.
                                 The possiblity of removing certain crash barriers at
                                 the Leppings Lane standing area was discussed, as this
                                 would assist the flow of fans into the Ground. This
                                 matter would .have to be taken up when the inspection
                                 of the Ground relative to the issuing of the Safety
                                 Certificate takes place.

Correct Money Turnstiles         South Yorkshire Police requested that the Club have
                       %
                                 "Correct Money Only" turnstiles for entry onto the Kop
                                 to speed up entry time. R. H. Chester agreed to look
                                 into the possibility in relation to the number of turn
                                 stiles available.

    Keys Around Ground           South Yorkshire Police requested that the keys
                                 allowing access around the Ground be standardised.
                                 R. H. Chester agreed to do this and to provide
                                 8 sets for the use of South Yorkshire Police.


           Plan of Ground         South Yorkshire Police requested that the update plans
                                  of the Ground showing positions of new turnstiles
                                  should also shew the positions of fire points.
                                  R. H. Chester confirmed that this would be dene.

     Dear Sir,
                                                     Safety of Sportsqrounds Act 1975
                         Application for Increased Crowd Capacity on the Spion Kop
                      I am grateful to M r . Bownes for sending us a copy of your
     letter to the Club dated 14 August.                                      This enabled me to see it over
     the weekend, and to do a little research into the points you have
     raised.
                      The proposed meeting at 2.00 p.m.. on 21 August is convenient
p|   for the club officers.                              It is likely that the Chairman will be present,
     but he is indisposed at the moment.                                      A director with special

f    responsibility for the ground, Mr. Keith Addy and the club secretary
     will also attend, and I will hope to deal with the technical side
     assisted by John Strange.
                     Turning now to the matters raised in your letter, I think it
     appropriate to make a preliminary response, so that the members of
     the Working Party may be informed of our thoughts.                                            No doubt there
     will be fuller discussion at the meeting on Thursday.
                     I will use the same nomenclature a to f, as is used in your
     letter.
     (a)              The statement is made that the new terrace construction does
     not comply with the plans submitted to the Council for Building
     Regulations Approval.
                     As far as I can see it is incorrect to say that our drawings


                                       An (Jnlimltad Company, AegisMred in England — No. 1833144

 do not show the steepest slopes.
            I should explain that the submission of plans was
 complicated by changes of mind which were forced on the Club
•* by cxrcamscances beyond tneir control.        The intention was to
 redevelop the Kop broadly as the present scheme.          They were
 informed at a very late stage that the level of grant which
 had been expected may not be forthcoming, because of demands
 from other clubs following the Bradford fire.          The scheme was
 therefore changed in January of this year, to roofing with no
 extra accommodation.          All our drawings had to be changed.
 The contract was let in early February and we sent a very full
 set of drawings and calculations to the         Council on 24 February
  1986.      Following a good run in the cup the Board were able
 to revert to the original scheme in March.           By that time the
 steel frame for the roof only scheme was ordered and we had
 to make use of it.          The columns and the bracing arrangement
  against wind now had to be modified to receive the new terracing.
  In effect a third scheme had to be prepared utilising steel which
 was more suitable for the roofing only version.           Thus, we had
  to do completely new calculations and-drawings in March and April.
  This necessitated a re-submission for building regulations approval.
            However, that re-submission showed the steepest slope
  which occurs on the terracing, and the drawings submitted in
  March and April show accurately what has been built.
            I enclose a photo-copy of our letter of 30 April which was
  the one which accompanied most of the drawings relating to the
  new inclined terracing.         It will be seen that it lists the drawings
  which were enclosed, five of them. Nos. 45, 47, 48, 49 and 51,
  being drawings of the Kop terracing.         Prints of these five drawings
  are enclosed.
            It will be seen that each of these drawings has a small
  triangular diagram above the steps which gives the rise and the
  tread of the steps, and hence indicates the overall slope.

  (b)     The vertical steps from terrace level to the new    gangway
  can be measured in different ways depending on which foot it is
  assumed will be used to step down.      As a result of observation


  found that the spectator generally holds the rail with one hand
  and steps down with the opposite foot.     This reduces the step to
  just over 1ft.      Even if he does not use the opposite foot he
  still steps onto the higher step which is available.
          But if it is thought to be necessary, the addition of a
  short length to the barrier running parallel to the gangway
  can direct the spectator a little further up the slope, so that
  he will automatically take a small step downward. This can be
  discussed with the Fire Service and the Building Control Department.
  Only one or two of the gangways need consideration.


  (c)     It has always been intended to sheet down to the    ground
  level at the Ozzie Owl corner, but the precise detail had to wait
  until that part of the Kop was built, and the trees cleared.         When the
  frame had been erected it was my view that it was preferable not to
  sheet to ground level for reasons which I have expressed to the
  Working Party.      As my view was not agreed the work is proceeding
  as was -intended.


   (d)    We are a little surprised that the Building Control officer
  who has spotted a pre-cast step resting on (as we understand it)            <
  a bearing of 50mm instead of the intended 75mm did not point it out
  to either my resident engineer or to the contractor so that if there
  was need to take remedial action it could have been done there and
  then.
          However, we understand that it is one of the concrete steps
  which has a short span, and it rests on steel.       In that case it is
  probably incorrect to say that the seating is sub-standard.        The
  Code of Practice to which we are working gives the Engineer
  discretion to reduce the step below 75mm.       (See attached, photocopy
  of clause 5.2.4.3).       Firstly the seating is subject to a permissible
  tolerance so this will reduce the 75mm.       Also this is a solid step
                                                                              SHEET

    with a full width of bearing to take the load.         In other buildings,
    precast units are often            w       *     " 1 ~J '   •1-^-             .
    and all the load is concentrated on the narrow beam.         A smaller
    seating can clearly be permitted where the beam is of full width.
    If as we understand it the beam in question is of short span, which
    means the load at each end is small, I think it highly likely that
    when I know which one out of the approximately 1000 new steps
    ^ias the smaller than specified seating I shall take the view that
    it is perfectly safe and no action is needed.         If I think it necessary
    we can weld a small plate to the steel on which it rests to increase
    the bearing width, but this is very unlikely to be necessary.
            I am surprised that this matter has been raised in this way.


     (e)    The reference to the provision of a toilet and kiosk underneath
     the new terrace not featuring in the application is surprising.               The
    word 'provision' makes it appear that these have been constructed
     as part of the scheme.    They were built about three years ago.             The
    work was not designed by us, but I know it was subject to building
     control from discussions I had with the Building Control Department
     at the time.
            The presence of the kiosk and the toilets was shown on various
I
     of our drawings.    For example the drawing 6648/16 (a copy is enclosed)
     shows the way in which the foundations had to be orientated to miss
     the toilets and also the kiosk.       This drawing was submitted for
     Building Regulations approval.        Drawings 7 and 9 were issued for
     distribution to the Working Party together with others to explain
     our scheme, on 23 December 1985 (see last page of attached copy
     of my letter).     These drawings each show parts of the toilets or
     of the kiosk protruding from under the stand (copies enclosed).
            The drawing No. 6648/9 showing the rear elevation of the stand,
     which was included with our planning application in July 1985 shows
     the upper part of the kiosk projecting into the sheeting.              Our
     drawing No. 6648/7 which was also distributed via the Working Party
     secretariat in December, 1985, shows the toilets and kiosk protruding
     from under the roof of the Kop                               ^     N                ^

               The Building Control department was visiting the site very
      frequently during late February and March, 1986, to watch the
      piles being Installed immediately alongside the toilets and the
      kiosk.   Visits iiave taken place frequently since May.
               I am at a loss, therefore, to understand why this matter is
      being raised now.     However, the kiosk is not used for storage.
      All saleable material is taken back to a central store after each
      game.     During a match the goods on sale consist of no more than
       ackets of crisps, and Bovril/ tea and Coke served in paper cups,
w     The number of cups and packets of crisps is not great and there
      is no significant fire hazard.
               The kiosk performs exactly the same function as the several
      kiosks inside the south and north stands.     These kiosks are also
      on exit routes, and have never been considered a hazard by the
      Fire Service.
               One matter which might cause concern is the fact that the
      roof of the kiosk is combustible.     If this matter is considered
      critical, the Club would no doubt be prepared to put a fire resistant
      inner and outer skin on the roof.


               The discussion   on evacuation times which has sarisen in the
         !t month was apparently sparked off by the Popplewe11 report
      recommendation No. 24. ' This says that the Green Guide should be
      revised to make it clear that the suggestion of an eight minute
      evacuation time is concerned with 'the effect of crowd turbulence
      on the rate of flow* which arises if there are delays in evacuating
      spectator accommodation.
               It may be that the wording of the Green Guide had not
      always been understood by other licensing authorities, but there
      was no misunderstanding on this matter in the South Yorkshire
      Working Party when the ground was granted its Safety Certificate
      in 1979.    The calculated evacuation time for the Kop with its
      pre-certificate capacity of 20,000 (23,000 until the Ibrox disaster
       in 1971) had been about 16 minutes    (or 18} minutes pre 1971).
       At that time there were far fewer crush barriers to control
       turbulence in the crowd, and the barriers were not so strong.
                                                                           SHEET 7 .

     The very experienced police officers on the South Yorkshire
     Working Party, who had been in attendance at games for many years,
     said they had never seen turbulence occur when the crowd was
     sufficient to give an evacuation time in excess of 8 minutes.
     It should be remembered that through the 19fiO's *■>«»      —   j—   ---
            u*s sucu m a t more thou 11,000 people would be on the
     Kop at almost every game (this number could just get out in
     8 minutes with the exits as they were at that time).
             The present Chief Fire Officer, Mr. Harry Wright, was
     on the Working Party at the time.     He requested an extra exit
     route from the very top of the Kop.     This was constructed by the
m
     Club at a cost of £16,000 (1979 prices).      He was prepared to
     count the exits onto the pitch as part of the evacuation system
     in an emergency (each gate is controlled by a policeman) .       With
     these measures the evacuation time in an emergency was brought
     below eight minutes, and disregarding the gates onto the pitch the
     evacuation time in normal circumstances with a full Kop (16,850)
     would be 11^/4 minutes    (see attached extract from Minutes of
     Working Party dated 2 April 1979).
             The Fire Service at that time took the view that the very
     slight risk of turbulance (if there really is such a risk) could,
     not justify greater expense to the Club. The Fire Service in
     its advisory role is always having to balance money against
     slight or very slight risk, and this was a calculated decision
€    which Mr. H.E. Wright supported.
             I am a frequent attender at the ground.    The police are
     there every week.    There has never been an occurrence to my
     knowledge of turbulance associated with this ll3/4 minute
     evacuation time in the seven years since the ground received
     its Safety Certificate.    The police c a n give their own view.
             I know that at other grounds longer evacuation times have
     applied without there being the slightest trouble.       For example,
     at Bramall Lane, the evacuation time was almost 20 minutes at:_____
     the Bramall Lane end until the new exits were constructed onto
     Bramall Lane near the centre of the stand about three years ago.
     There had never been 'turbulance' of the kind envisaged in -the
      Green Guide as f a r as I know.
             Further, in recent years various police forces have
      adopted a policy cf keeping the gates closed at one end o f the            i#

  ground for 10 minutes or so after a match to keep the ri
                        pux.s tne eigJl. minute rule in perspective.
          The words 'eight minute rule' are not really correct
  of course.   The Green Guide uses the words 'it is suggested1.
  It is not nearly so positive as it is about its other
  recommendations.
          With this as background the Club has been quite shocked
  by the suggestion that the gates onto the pitch should be ignored
  in the calculations of evacuation times, and that eight
 m i n u t e s should be achieved by means of ordinary exits.     They        ^
  feel this change of view cannot be justified.        The fact that
  Popplewell has clarified what it is the Green Guide suggests            I
  is of no relevance in Sheffield where we have always interpreted
  the Guide correctly.      The change of view is not the result of
  Popplewells clarification.
          If the City Council chose to ignore the gates onto the
  pitch   in setting the number of spectators which will be
  allowed the effect would be to limit the capacity of the enlarged
  Kop to almost the same as it has been since 1979.         The completely
  new exit which has been built at the south end of the Kop, and
  the widening of the exit at the north end, will only cancel out
  the loss of the exits onto the pitch.
          It should be emphasised that the provision of the new
  decking to accommodate almost 6000 more spectators, the new
  exit routes, extra toilets, and the part of the roof over the 6,000
  extra places, will have cost about £500,000.        It has stretched
  ingenuity to find room for the new exit routes, as the Fire
  Service will I am sure agree. I see no way in which further exits
  could be provided even if there were unlimited money available.
          However, it should be brought to the attention of t-ho <?j ty
  Council that I entered into discussion with the South Yorks
  Working Party at a very early date and kept them                  of our
  proposals regarding the exit arrangements for tJr^Kop at*’

        from S   .    ua
        will be seen that under item 2 on page 2 it is stated that the
        Working Party "agreed with your calculations and proposal to increase
^       the tunnel exit on the north side of Spion Kop to 8 clear units
         and to provide a complete new 6 unit staircase on the South side” .
IP                   The only change we have made since that submission in
         October is to improve the arrangements by widening the tunnel
         exit to 9 units instead of 8.
                In the light of that completely unequivocal acceptance of
          roposals last November the Club has proceeded with the scheme
            its entirety. The Fire Service did not voice any second thoughts
         Litil July, 1986/ by which time the structures were virtually
         complete         It is now not            feasible to construct a new exit route,

Dear Dick,
                                     General Safety Certificate
             As promised I looked through your existing safety certificate
to see whether there are any matters which we might raise before
the next             certificate is issued.
             My only suggestion is that the position of the disabled should
be regularised by including them in Schedule 3 of Part 1.                                                        The
entry might read "disabled and helpers in front of the North
stand".               If the nvmber is 74, this would bring the ground capacity,
including the extra 4150 so far agreed for Spion Kop, to 54,398.
We will of course be applying for an increase after the completion

magic figure of 55,000.                                             The 74 disabled and helpers may be
useful in attaining that number.
            We discussed the other day the requirement for policing.
This is dealt with in clause 7 which refers to "adequate
number of police officers” .                                                    It goes on to say that the number
shall be agreed between the Chief Constable and the Holder at
least 21 days before a specific activity takes place.                                                       This is
certainly a more civilised wording than that which appears to be
in use by North Yorkshire County Council but in the end, it d o e s ^ c j ^

    Dear Dick,

                                                                                  Safety Work 1986

                     During the summer inspection Inspector Calvert asked for some
    of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end of the ground to be
    removed so as the allow easier access into the various pens.
    Rather than ask Ackroyd & Abbott's sub—contractor to do the work,
    who were at that time working overtime,' we instructed George Shaw
^   Engineering Ltd.                           to have the work completed before the Everton
    game.               This they did and today we have forwarded a certificate
    for the payment of £129.92 plus V.A.T. to them.                                                               The original of
    the certificate and their invoice is enclosed.                                                               Payment should be
    received by them no later than 16 October 1986.

                                                                                         Yours sinl

«rvich «&s attended! by other »»ttb«r» of the SYCC and S ergean t    \, r$ (op>o
Division 1 £jv3 chaired by Divisional Officer 5cots of the Fire Service.

Consideration wag given to the propos&lt being put forward by the Club to
replace one of the existing Exit gate* ©a Penistane Road with six «»rc
turnstiles. Vhilst tho&e present agreed in principle with the advantages,
the Fire Brigade said that they could not in any way concede to the request
without aose alternative arrangement* being »ade to bring up the nuaibtr of
Exit units still existing to the minisua of 69 unit* width require* by the
Safety Certificate.

The Secretary, David Vaughan, of SYCC, is to convey the Meetings feelings by
letter to the Club, putting forward possible alternatives in tlvat soe»& turn­
stiles giving sccess to the Kop could be sited in the existing 13” wail in
the car park adjacent to the emergency exit gate near to the Hillsborough
Suite. Alternatively, tome fora of resovable turnstiles could Le considered
If such items are available. The only third alternative being that if the
6 turnstiles to be Installed at the Penistone Road side sserui the closure oE
the 21 ft. existing Exit gate, then the arithmetic of the Batter Beans that
the Club would have to agree to a capacity reduction of 3,840 persons on the
Kop. This, of course, reduces the total ground capacity below 50,000.

David Vaughan of SYCC is to forward oe a copy of his letter to the Club.



13.10.81   - Note for Sheffield Wednesday Football file

Attached ainutes of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) recieved
relative to the application referred to above, as a result of which I visited
Hillsborough Stadium and had a meeting with Kr. England, the secretary.

I handed hin a copy of the attached arithmetic by the Fire Service personnel,
relating to the nusbsr of unit widths required for emergency exits, and his
view i* that the various alternatives put forward in the letter he has received
frost David Vaughan are/non-starters. The Club will not agree to a reduction in
the capacity of the Spion K o p , nor-^to option (c) the construction of new turn­
stiles giving access to the Kop from the car park adjacent to the Hillsborough
Suite, and additionally he does not see sooe form of pre-fabricated and rem­
ovable turnstiles as being a practical alternative.

Mr. England is only too well aware that for as long as the Club fail to comply
with the conditions under which the Certificate was granted in relation to the
provision of a purpose-built police/ambulance roost, then any other nupl jc-*r ions
which seek to breach the official terns of the Certificate axe not likely to be
approved.

I have appraised Hr. England with the content of Iten: 3 on the attached minutes
and he has undertaken to acquaint his chairman, Mr. McGee, of this fact.
I Bade Mr. England fully aware that should the Working Party choose to be particv:
’bloody ninded' they could dramatically reduce the capacity of (or indeed close)
North Stand all the time our pre-fabricated wooden and combustible police room
remained In its present form. He knows this only too well and since th*- North
Stana is the principal money spinner for ground receipts he intends to try nrd
pressure his Board into taking some positive steps to get the police room prc-j^*:
off the ground.

        SUBJECT:         SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS - REVISED EDITION
                         OF THE GUIDE TO SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


        I have gone through the whole of this extrerely comprehensive document
        and whilst a considerable amount of the contents is applicable to management
        of the club, engineering problems and fire officers, certain paragraphs
        are worthy of mention in relation to Sheffield Wednesdays Football Ground
        at Hillsborough.

        Paragraph 16 relating to crowd pressures. As you are aware the kop has
        had a tendancy at recent matches to produce this wave effect_and it is
        necessary that when a large match is anticipated in the future, we should
        ensure that the numbers allowed onto the kop strictly adhere to the capacity
        allowed. It is imperative therefore that the automatic counting system
        is always in working order for 'A' and 'B' category matches, such as the
        visits of Manchester United, where almost capacity crowds can be expected.
■:P
        Paragraph 23 onwards lays down the management responsibility very clearly
        and is to be welcomed, since there have in the past, been grey areas as to
        who is responsible for crowd control etc.

         Paragraph 28 reconroends the appointment of a safety officer and identifies
         his duties. I can only presume that the safety officer is in fact Mr Lock,
         although I have never heard him designated as such, and this should be
         clarified with the club.    Furthermore*, in the discussion of a central
         control point being designated (other than then police control), one would
         assume that the central control point designated in respect of the Sheffield
        ‘Wednesday ground would be the video viewing room in the south stand.

        Paragraph 43 relates to records of tests kept and examination of the ground.
        I am not aware that these are kept by the club.

        Paragraph 199 relates to exercises of stewards regarding emergency procedures
        and I am not aware that the club have ever carried out exercises in this
        respect.

        In conclusion. Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have complied with the
        guide to a very large extent, more so I would suspect, than the majority
        of clubs in the country, and it is only on minor points as identified above
        where improvements could be made, so far as police procedures are concerned.

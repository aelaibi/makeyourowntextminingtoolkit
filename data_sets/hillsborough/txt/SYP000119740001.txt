                 g iv en in the N orth Stand.

                 Our      serial was        to be d ep lo y e d d i r e c t l y outside       the 7 t urnstiles A-G

                 at entrance B at the Leppings Lane                        end of the ground.

                  small n umbers          of fans entering           in l's and 2 ’s.           I turned vari ou s fans

                  away,     w ho had either no tickets or                  tickets for        the Hop.      All     fans were

                  b ei ng searched at this                time the m oo d was          f ri endly and   jovial.

PC 2980 W ri g h t     left d i r e c t l y outside    the turnstiles.        A fter     2.30 pm

the crowd ouside         the turnstiles a pp e a r e d to swell         e n o r m o u s l y w it h i n a

few m inu te s and fro m the queues being o r d er ly and well                  defined,       it

s u dd en ly became one        large mass push in g      towards    the turnstiles.            I

found myself b ei ng pus he d          into the wall      at the side of the turnstile

entrance.      A police horse came up            to the entrance        in an effort          to

regulate     the crowd but        this had v er y      little effect as the pressure

f rom the back of the crowd grew.                E v e n t u a l l y myself and PC 2980

forced our wa y        into the turnstiles and           into the ground.          We went

a round and back out of           the large Exit Gate C and c o n t in ue d            to try and

control    the crowd,        w h ic h seemed   to be trapped       into the area betw ee n

Exit Gate B and a single blue barrier w h i c h runs away fro m the

turnstiles.

From m y p os i t i o n at the side of this barrier             I could see        that     the

crowd p re ss ur e was b ec om in g severe.            People near the barrier were                 red

in the face and str ai ni ng to push back.                 Some fans were panicking.

M an y were shout in g and plead in g at us to do something.                      There were

p unches   thrown as some fans came ar ou nd              the barrier and tried             to join

the crush nearer         the turnstiles.        A small     boy was pa ss ed over           the

head of the crowd            to us.    I pu sh ed a small     space    to a l l o w a young         lad

to escape      the crush,       but he w ou l d n ' t come under      the barr ie r     shouting

at me   that he w a n t e d     to see   the match.

Behind me      there were a large number              of fans standing a way f r o m the

m ai n crush    just outside Exit Gate C.               M a n y fans were    s ho ut in g and

p le ad i n g for    the gates    to be opened to ease         the crush.         I could see

that there were n um erous            fans c li mbing on top of the outer wall and

entering the ground.             There was some        talk amongst     the Police Officers

present and Inspector            Purdy informed the officers d i r e c t l y outside

Gate C that         it was   going    to be opened.       The Gate was op en ed a short

time a fterwards        f rom inside and a large number             of fans     rushed      inside,
                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                    R33 5

someone stumb le d as                they went       through.      The gate was then closed

again.         It had b een opened for a p p r o x i m a t e l y          30-60 seconds.        It had

the effect         of c le ar in g         the area d i r e c t l y outside    the Gate but did

n o t hi n g to ease          the general          crush at the     turnstiles.      The situation

c on ti nu ed    to deteriorate,              people w ere       in distress m a n y fans c ontinued

to shout for           the gate           to be reopened.         That   they all had tickets.              It

seemed that          it was         only a matter        of time before someone was           injured,

if not already.                M an y fans were helpless            in the crush and could

h a rd l y move as           the pressure from the fans behind forced t h e m towards

the turnstiles.,                   I could see 3 or 4 police horses up near                  the    large

iron gates b o r d e r i n g on Leppings                 Lane,    the crush of fans      seemed to

s tr et ch well        into L ep pings          Lane    itself.     Most of the Police Officers

I could see were b e t w e e n the blue barrier and the tem po ra ry barrier

g u ar di ng    the sterile area at the rear of the South Stand.

W i t h the s i t u at io n getting worse                the Exit Gate C was        opened again

from the        inside.            This    time there was a m u c h       larger   influx of fans

into the ground.                   The m a j o r i t y of them w e r e n ’t running but all were

anxious        to e scape          the crush and get          into the ground.       I p os it i o n e d

m ys el f d i re c t l y outside Gate C in the f low of fans who had to pass

either     side of me.               They were       told not     to rush,    to take   their      time.

H undreds       of fans must have passed me.                      Only a few running,        the others

w ere orderly.               The    influx died d own to a small             trickle after a few

m inu te s and the Gate was n ar rowed                    to a l l o w one fan at a time,          and

this time each showing                     their    tickets    to a steward.       The area outside

the turnstiles was no w clear.                         I re gr ou pe d wit h officers    from my

serial.         A lm o s t    im me di at el y someone reported           that there was a pitch

invasion.          In c o mp an y wit h other officers               I went    in through Gate C

past    the tunnel            to the Centre section of              the terracing       into the South

stand and onto the pitch.                       There were m a n y people w a l k i n g and

sta nd in g on the pitch.                   There was a lot of con fu si on as          to what was

happening.           I could see that              there were numerous police                officers near

the perimeter            fence behind           the Leppings          Lane end goal.         I c o u l d n ’t see

the crowd beyond.                  Next    the police          officers began to pass          injured

p eople out from an open gate                      in the fencing.            A l o n g w i t h others    I

took them f ro m these officers and placed                             them in a safer p os it io n

further        on the pitch.              M a n y seemed short of breath and d i s t r e s s e d but

each p erson I hel pe d was alive and conscious.                               1 he lp ed one youth who

said to me          that people were dying                    in there p oi nting at        the terrace.

At   this time due             to the number           of people on or ar ou nd          the fence I

still couldn't see                  through to the terracing.                 I m o v e d closer and          I saw

that there was a mass                  crush of bodies             just    inside   the fence.       It was

a c onfusion of heads arms and                       legs.        I saw one ma n wh o was obv io us ly

dead but he was h eld upright by the crush and his b ody m o v e d w ith                                       the

crowd.         By this time I was d i r e c t l y outside                   the small    open gate.

Off ic er s     inside      the terracing were p a ss in g the                 injured onto the pitch

and g iving first aid                 if n e c e s s a r y     I w o r k e d my wa y across    to between

the a m bulance w h i c h had pulled onto the                         track and the per im et er          fence

w h i c h had been forced apart.                     I c o n t in ue d to assist      in c ar rying

injured onto the pitch.

A ft er a short          time       I clim be d    into the terracing            through the hole             in

the fence and a s s i s t e d             in carry in g people            to the fence.       I assis te d

w it h a p p r o x i m a t e l y    10 people all            of w h o m were a l r ea dy dead.

E v e nt ua ll y the Centre section of the terrace cleared.                                 I remember

that soon after              this an a n n ou nc em en t was b roadcast              that    the m at ch

w ou ld not be continued.                   Wh il st    I was      in the terracing and on the

p itch helping           the       injured m a n y Liverpool           fans were d i r e c t i n g   their

anger at the Police.                   Calling us m ur d e r e r s and that           it wa s our

fault.          Others       thanked me.

A fter     the ter ra ci ng had cleared I joined other officers on the

h a l f wa y   line.       E v e n t u a l l y we made our w ay back to the N o r t h Stand via

            the Leppings         Lane    terracing.

            Th ro u gh ou t    the   incident both outside and           inside the ground       there

            seemed to be c o m m u n i c a t i o n problems.        It seemed    that m a n y d i d n ’t k no w

            what was going on or what was                the best    course of action.         The crush

            outside     the ground could p os si b l y have b een better             c on tr o l l e d with

            more Police O ff ic er s and a better             r eg ul a t i o n of the flow of fans up

            to the turnstiles.            At   the time w he n the crush reached           its h eight our

            p ar ti cu lar     serial    seemed   to be down     to a quarter     s tr ength of what          it

            should have been.             I b eli ev e that open in g the outer gates was a very

            serious risk of          injury.      Know in g the H i l l s b o r o u g h Gr ou nd as I do and

            how the Leppings            Lane end fills up      it m ight p o s s i b l y have been better

            to direct         the fans coming      in through the open gates          into the flank

            areas,    w hi ch I saw w ere by no m eans           full.

               At 8.30 am on the           date shown I commenced duty at H a c k e n t h o r p e Police

               Station.         We were    then taken to H i l l s b o r o u g h by bus a r r iving at the                   y

                ground at a pp ro xi m a t e l y 9 am-         I was     detailed to work            in Serial       16

                under    Irtsp.ecti.or P urdy and PS          1288 Payne         At 9.55 am the briefing was

                given in the North Stand.

               Our     serial    was   to be d eployed directly outside                  the 7 turns t i l e s A-G

                at entrance B at the Leppings Lane                     end of the ground.

                At   11.15 am we made          our way around          to the rear        of the West S t a n d in

                preparation for the turnstiles                 being     opened about         11.45 am.

                At   11.45 am     I commenced duty d i r e c t l y        outside       turnstiles       A & B in

                company with PC 607 Taylor.                 In the early stages there were                    just

                small    numbers       of fans entering        in V s     and 2's.          I turned various fans

                away,    who had either          no tickets or         tickets     for     the Kop.     All   fans were

                being s e a rched at this time the mood was                     friendly and jovial.

                From a p p r o x i ma te ly 2 pm onwards         the number       of fans entering            the

                ground at this end steadily               increased.           During    this      build up the

                number    of officers          in our   serial    were    steadily depleted             by officers

                escorting       prisoners       through to the D e t e n t i o n Area,            so m u c h so that

                from about 2.30          pm onwards      it seemed that          there was only myself and

                PC 2980 Wright          left    directly outside         the    turnstiles.          After 2.30       pm
                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                             R335

the     crowd ouside    the turnstiles a p p e a r e d to swell           e n o r m o u s l y within a

few minutes        and from the queues         being    orderly and well         defined,      it

suddenly became        one    large mass      pushing    towards the turnstiles.               I

found myself        being    pushed    into the wall at the side of the turnstile

entrance.         A police    horse    came up to the entrance            in an effort       to

regulate     the    crowd but this       had very      little    effect as the        pressure

from the back of the           crowd grew.       E v e n t u a l l y myself and PC E980

forced our way        into the turnstiles and            into the ground.           We went

a r o u n d and back out of the         large Exit Gate C and            continued to try and

control     the    crowd,    w hi ch seemed to be trapped             into the are a between

Exit Gate B and a single              blue barrier which         runs away from the

turnstiles.

F ro m my position at the side of this                 barrier    I    could see that      the

crowd pressure was           becoming    severe.       People    near    the barrier were           red

in the face and straining              to push back.       Some fans were         panicking.

M any were    shouting and       pleading at       us to do something.            There were

punches     thrown as       some fans    came a r o u n d the barrier and tried to join

the     crush nearer    the turnstiles.          A small    boy was       passed over      the

head of the        crowd to us.        I pushed a small         space to a l l o w a young          lad

to escape the        crush,    but he wouldn't         come under the barrier           shouting

at me that he wa n t e d to see the match.

Behind me there were a large number                   of fans    standing a way from the

mai n    crush just    outside Exit Gate C.             Many fans were        shouting and

pleading for the        gates    to be opened to ease the               crush.    I could see

that    there were     numerous       fans   climbing    on top of the        outer wall       and

entering     the ground.        There was      some    talk amongst       the Police Officers

present and        Inspector Purdy       informed the officers            d i r ectly outside

Gate C that        it was going       to be opened.       The Gate was opened a short

time a f terwards      from    inside and a large         number      of fans    rushed    inside,

someone     stumbled as they went            through.     The    gate was then        closed
                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                 R335

again.        It had been opened for a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 0-60 seconds.              It had

the effect       of    clearing     the area d i r ectly outside          the Gate       but did

nothing       to ease the general           crush at the turnstiles.              The    s i tuation

continued to deteriorate,                 people were    in distress many fans             continued

to shout       for the    gate to be reopened.            That    they all       had tickets.           It

seemed that        it was      only a matter      of time      before    someone was       injured,

if not already.           Many fans were        helpless       in the    crush and       could

hardly move as the             pressure from the        fans    behind forced them towards

the turnstiles.,              I could see 3 or 4 police           horses       up near    the    large

iron gates       bordering        on Leppings Lane,       the    crush of fans          seemed to

stretch well          into Leppings Lane        itself.        Most   of the Police Officers

I could see were          between the        blue barrier and the tem p o r a r y barrier

guarding the          sterile area at the         rear of the S outh Stand.

W i t h the s i tuation        getting worse      the Exit Gate C was            opened again

from the       inside.        This time there was a m uch             larger    influx    of fans

into the ground.              The m a j o r i t y of them w e r e n ’t running     but all were

anxious       to escape the        crush and get      into the ground.            I positioned

myself    directly       outside Gate C in the           flow of fans who          had to       pass

either    side of me.           They were told not to           rush,    to take their          time.

H u n dreds    of fans must        have    passed me.     O nly a few      running,       the others

were orderly.           The    influx     died down to a small          trickle after a few

minu t e s and the Gate was narrowed to a llow one fan at a time,                               and

this time each showing              their tickets       to a steward.           The a rea outside

the turnstiles was             now clear.      I regrouped with officers                from my

serial.        Almost    i mmedi ately someone        reported that there was a pitch

invasion.        In company with other            officers      I went    in thro u g h Gate C

past the tunnel          to the Centre        section of the          terracing    into the South

stand and onto          the    pitch.      There were man y      people walking and

standing       on the    pitch.       There was a lot of confusion as to what was

happening.         I could see that there were              numerous      police    officers          near
                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                   R335

the    perimeter     fence     behind the Leppings             Lane    end goal.      I couldn't             see

the    crowd beyond.         Next     the   police     officers       began to     pass    injured

people     out from an open gate             in the     fencing.        Along with others           I

took them from these            officers and          placed them       in a safer        position

further     on the    pitch.         Many seemed       short    of breath and d i s t r e s s e d        but

each     person    I helped was alive and              conscious.        I helped one y o u t h who

said to me that        people were          dying     in there    pointing at the terrace.

At this time due to the number                  of    people    on or around the           fence    I

still     couldn't see       through to the terracing.                  I m oved    closer and          I saw

that there was a mass            crush of bodies          just    inside    the fence.            It was

a confusion of heads arms and                 legs.      I saw one man who was              obviously

dead     but he was    held upright by the              crush and his body moved with the

crowd.     By this time         I was directly outside                the small    open gate.

Officers     inside    the te rracing were             passing    the    injured onto        the    pitch

and giving        first aid     if n e cessary         I wo r k e d my way across         to between

the a m bulance w hi c h had pulled onto the track and the                          perimeter       fence

w hich had been forced apart.                 I continued        to assist       in carrying

injured onto the           pitch.

After a short        time     I climbed      into the     terracing       through the        hole       in

the fence and a s s is te d          in carrying       people    to the fence.            I assisted

w ith a p pr ox im at el y    10 people all          of whom were already dead.

E ve n t u a l l y the Centre    section of the terrace                cleared.      I remember

that     soon after    this an a nn ou n c e m e n t was        broadcast     that    the match

w ould not be continued.              Whilst     I was    in the terracing and on the

pitch helping        the     injured many Liverpool             fans were     directing t h e i r

anger at the Police.             Calling      us m u r d e r e r s and that      it was     our

fault.       Others    thanke d me.

A fter    the terracing        had    cleared    1 joined other officers on the

halfway     line.     E ve nt ua l l y we made our way back to the North Stand                           via

the Leppings Lane            terracing.

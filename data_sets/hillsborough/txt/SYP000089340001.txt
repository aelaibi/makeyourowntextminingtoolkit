           seeing       people being          pulled up the dividing              fence    to my right and over

           the fence          into    the    next     pen,   pen number    two,    at this time          I think      the

g etting     out through the gate               onto   the    pitch.

I can also         remember      seeing a policeman wearing a flat                 cap running           onto

the     pitch from an a rea towards my                 left.     I saw him running across                in

front     of the goal a rea waving his hands,                    I think he      ran towards        the

referee,        it was     then that       the game was stopped.

At this      time,      when the game was stopped               in the area around me,             there

was     still    the same e xcessive amount              of    pressure my are a still          being

packed tight,           with    people.     At this      time    I can remember         hearing     people

to the front of my              position shouting at us to get back,                    but   in the

are a    I was     in people      still     couldn't move.

G r a d u a l l y the    pressure ar ou nd me started to disperse and wit h the

easing     of the        pressure      I started to become more aware of the scene

a ro u n d me.     The     pressure      had d ecreased more n oticabley so              from      my

rear.      I could not          see much to the          front     of the   pen other than

pol ic em en up on the           perimeter      fence shouting at everyone               to get back.

As    far as     I could see a lt h o u g h the          game had stopped        there was

c on si de rable        panic at the front ofpen number                 three    (3)    I moved

backwards        back under       the    crush barrier just            to the   rear of my

position,        (number 2)        I was   then shouting at            people   to come back        up the

t erraces       to relieve       the    pressure at the front.

It was after            I had got back under           the     barrier towards my original

position number            1 that      I a gain saw      my friends,            a n d _______ who were

p o s it io ne d towards        the back of me.

Whe n the terraces             started to clear          of people       to the front    of   me    I

became aware            of a couple      of people      being    carried back up the terraces

towards      the   tunnel.         I could not say           if these    people who were        being

carried      by their       limbs were dead or alive,              they were m ot io n l e s s and            I

I next became aware               that a barrier had broken                 in pert number      three a

few feet         in front       of the    position        I had been       in at    position    number 2.

I could see a part of the horizontal                            round tubing       of a crush barrier

w h i c h was     twisted and as          I looked towards           the    pitch from the terraces

was a t ta ch ed to a vertical                 support     to my    right and fell awa y towards

the      left down towards          the    floor.        When     I first    saw this    broken barrier

I only g lanced but              1 was    not aware        of any bodies       in the v ic in it y of

the da ma ge d barrier            itself,      a lt h o u g h   I could see hats and scarves

lying about           that area.

I left my friends,               towards       the back of the stand and decided to go

down the         front of the       pen to see          if I could help.

As    I got down towards            the front of           pen numbet^ffTree         I could see a

mass     of bodies they were all mot                                          odies were       lying on

the terraces            others were       still     u                          describe    the scene as

foilows s

L o o k in g    down towards       the    perimeter        fence from the back of the             pen,    all

the bodies were motionless,                     some had bulging           eyes and some had

evidence         of vomit around          their mouths w h i c h a pp ea re d orangey            in

colour.          In the area       i mmediately below where                the gate    is in the

perimeter         fence       there was a mass          of bodies     I c o u l d n ’t say how many

they were all            intert wi ne d and looked              like they had been t ra mp le d on.

T he n   to the        left and    right       hand side of the gate           there were man y

bodies a ga in m o t io nl es s and             in a standing        position       pinned up against

the      perimeter       fence.     A g ai n    I c o u l d n ’t say how man y or describe any of

these     bodies        but    in areas    they seemed to be seven deep piled up

a g a in s t    the    fence.     There was then the odd body that                    had fallen

b ac kw ar ds     from this       upright       position and was           lying on the    terracing.

I only         looked at this scene             for a couple        of seconds       because    of the

horror         of what    I saw.

                    about      15 feet away from the          tunnel       entrance.         We    layed the body on the

                    floor and         immediately    ran back through the tunnel                    and    into    pen number

                    three.       This    first    body   I found        lying on the       terraces had his head

                    W he n   I got     back down to the front of                pen number^t+tree there were

                    bodies      being    passed over       the barrier          unde{/wnVch        I had found the above

                    can say about         these    second and third bodies                is that as best as              I can

                    recall      they were      both males and I think              they were        both wearing          blue

                    denim jeans.

                    I a ga in went       back down to the front             of pen number           three    to the       same

                    crush barrier as           p r eviously mentioned,            there were a group of fans and

                    a pol ic em an      passing    bodies    from the front           of the       pen from       I suspect

                    the      left hand side       of perimeter          fence gate,       over     the    crush barrier.

I took hold of one               body wit h other supporters as these               fans and

p ol i ce ma n     passed him over         the    barrier-     I can remember as          I took hold

of his     right arm he was           face up.        A denim jean jacket          that    I think

this male may have               been wearing       fell    to the ground some one          picked up

the jean jacket and               placed    it on the bodies          stomach,    when we

d e p o s i t e d this    body    in the area a g ai n between the tunnel               entrance and

the    rear of the terrace            turnstiles          that jean jacket was still             on

his stomach.             I w o ul d describe       this    body as    follows,    a white male aged

about 27 to 33 years               old,    about 5*10 tall,          he was   quite well     built,          he

had a large         frame and as best as             I can recall       he had a bit of a pot

belly.       He had a roundish face,                dark hair    of me di um     length,    I think he

m a y have       had a mou st ac he and a couple             of days    growth of facial          hair.

Apart     from the blue          denim jean jacket w h i c h a p p e a r e d one or two years

old,    he was wearing            blue denim jeans and a wide             belt about       1 and a

half    to 2 inches wide.             I think       it was a black       b e l t , he was wear in g a

short     s leeved tee       shirt,       w hich was either white         or a very faded             pale

colour,      I can't say what             type of neck the tee shirt             had.     I think he

was w earing        p r ed om in an tl y black training         shoes w hich a p p e a r e d quite

old.
On    returning      to the       terraces about          half way down pert three         1 came

acrjpss a policeman who was                 carrying a yoyj*g^Tad irt his a r m s , 1 he 1 pe d

the    pol ic em an carry this young               l>Kfih ro ug h the    tunnel    and out       into the

area    behind the t u r rts t i                 When we got    to this area this          time,       I

c a n ’t say ex actly w j ^ T -t h e ,time w ould have               been there were       two

a m bu l an c es   parked    irt the a rea and        I w ould say 20 to 30 bodies               lying

about.       The     pol ic em an said we would take the young                 lad to one of these

a mb ul a nc e s w hi ch we did,          I helped the       policeman up to the          rear    step ot

the a m bu la nc e and the          policeman then took the whole weight                   of the          lad

and carried him            into the back of the ambulance.

I d o n ’t know       if this young         lad was dead or alive all             I can say       is that
                                                                                                  PAGE          9
                                                                                                  S336Q

he was m otio nl es s and had a very pale                   colour.

I w o ul d describe       this young        lad as being a ge d between               11 and    13 years,

he was      of average     build for a a boy of his age,                   fairly       lean,   I think

he had light         coloured hair         of m ed i u m   length    I don't think         his hair was

covering       his ears.        I c a n ’t remember anyth in g about              the    lads   clothing.

    I can't    say muc h about       the    policeman,        I helped to carry this              lad

other than he was          tall     and    lean and I w ou ld say about 23 to 30 years

old.       I can remember         he was    still wear in g his helmet.

I cannot       remember anym or e         d escriptive      details about        the bodies        I

carried.        Apart    from the five         bodies      I have m e n t i o n e d   in this

s tatement      I had no other dealings with any other                       injured or deceased

persons.

I   cannot     be more accur at e about           times     of    i n v o 1vement wit h these          bodies

but      I can say that after ass is ti ng with the young                     lad I went        back     to

the      terraces and found my two friends an d we then                        left the football

gr ou nd at about 3.25            pm (1325).

The only other          thing     I w ish to m e nt io n      is that w hen the gate            in the

perimeter       fencing was        opened and        people      started to get out onto the

pitch there was a n oticeable                 increase      in the     pressure       inside    pen

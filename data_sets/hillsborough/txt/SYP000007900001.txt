each     supporter                  was    carrying          a     pack        of    six     i..ans of           beer     in     each       hand,.

approximately                          years      with        red    and        white        scarves             and    Liverpool

policeman             and       a    policewoman             standing               outside        Threshers             Off      License.

At    this        time      everything                was    quiet        and        normal        for       a    Saturday            lunchtime.

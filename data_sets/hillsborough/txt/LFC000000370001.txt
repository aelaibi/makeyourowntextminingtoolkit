           HILLSBOROUGH JUSTICE CHARTER

     In conjunction with a very large section of
the British public, I believe that the scrutiny by
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, which you established to
investigate   perceived   new evidence about the
Hillsborough Disaster of 1989, has categorically
failed    to   answer   satisfactorily    the  many
outstanding questions about the Disaster.

     I would urge you to take whatever action is
now necessary to ensure that the public interest so
far denied in this matter is finally served.      I
believe   that the transparent failures of the
judicial system since the Disaster should        be
rectified   not only to prevent similar future
miscarriages of justice but also to achieve justice
for the 96 actual victims of the Disaster a n rf for
their long suffering families,


     In signing this Charter at the request of the
Lord Mayor of Liverpool, I therefore pledge my
complete support to the continuing campaign for
justice by the Hillsborough Family Support Group .

     Dear Mr. Moores,

          During my year in office as Lord Mayor, I have lent my
     support to the campaign of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
     to obtain justice following the tragedy in 1989.

          Today, I was the first signatory to the Hillsborough Justice

          I am enclosing, for your information, a copy of the Charter

         If you are willing to do this, then I would be most grateful
     if you could sign the copy of the Charter and return it in the
     envelope provided. Eventually, a copy containing all the names of
     the people who support the Charter will be forwarded to the Home
     Secretary.

          I do hope that you will be able to support me in this
     initiative and, in view of the need to send the Charter to the
     Home Secretary as soon as possible, an early response would be
     appreciated.

                    Thank you for your assistance.

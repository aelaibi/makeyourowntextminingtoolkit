JOHN BERNARD HALFORD will   State


I am Secretary of Manchester City Football Club Pic.

I have held that position for 17 years.


At Manchester City we employ between 200 and 220 stewards for each
home match.   These are divided as to 80 to 85 gate men. These man
the 20 exit gates out of the stadium and the 20 perimeter gates.

There are police on duty at the perimeter fence but we have a steward
designated to each gate in the perimeter fence at all times in case
the police are called away on other duties. In addition we have
stewards within the stands themselves and a minimum of 6 to 8 fire
stewards on duty for each match together with a safety officer, who
is in control of all stewards works from the control room.   There
are 8 two-way radios in operation with the area stewards, senior
supervisors holding those radios.
In addition to our own stewards we engage a security company who
supplies 13 men of which 8 to 9 work outside the stadium and the
balance inside petrolling the bars and the exit gates.

Those who work outside prior to the kick off take up other duties
inside the ground after everyone is in. They then go outside again
towards the end of the game to resume duties as people leave the
ground.   All those security officers have radios and can radio back
to the control room. There is also a provision at the control room
to over-ride the tannoy.

As far as first aid is concerned there are two major areas at
opposite ends of the ground.   Each are supplied with oxygen
facilities.   We do not have a defibulator at the ground but this
does require trained personnel to use properly.

First aid is provided by the St Johns Ambulance Brigade and they are
positioned in parts of the ground in areas which they consider their
best sited.    We do not have an ambulance on stand by at the ground
but we do have an arrangement with a hospital nearby and if an
ambulance is required (as has occurred) it can be and is at the
ground within 5 minutes.
In addition to our own stewards if we have a game where there is a
visiting club we will invite the visiting club to bring any of their
stewards, who would like to volunteer for the day to come up to
alimited number usually 12 stewards.   They can be positioned in the
away supporters stands in the seating area reporting when they come
to our own chief steward and are put about the stands area.   They
are useful and helpful in their own area.   In an emergency our own
stewards would take over.
At Manchester City the standing capacity is 24,500 and that area is
served by 30 turnstiles.

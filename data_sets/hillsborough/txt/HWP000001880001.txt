Dear Mr Moneypenny

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I refer to your letter dated 7 August 1998 to Constable Greenway. Private prosecutions
have been commenced against two people for alleged offences arising out of the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 1989. I have received certain advice from the Director of
Public Prosecutions about the release of material from our archives. I will ask for legal
advice about how I should respond to your request. I will contact you again when I have
that advice.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines

Dear Mr Moneypenny

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

Further to my letter of 26 August 1998,1have now received legal advice with regard to your
request and I am able to respond as follows.

The Chief Constable has received guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in
relation to requests for documentation forming part of the Hillsborough archive, which
includes your statement. The guidance is that it may be appropriate to delay providing any
such documentation until the CPS has completed a review of the evidence and the Director
of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has decided whether or not to intervene in the prosecutions.
The guidance goes on to state that as original statements form part of a file involving a
criminal investigation, best practice would be to retain them within the file.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

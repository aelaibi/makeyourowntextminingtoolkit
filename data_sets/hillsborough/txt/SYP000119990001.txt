crush due to the y o u n g s t e r s                 being       crushed and feeling                   faint.          One

got    them out          of the        crush and onto             the    f o o tpath outside              the     shop.

1 also         saw grown men              coming     out    of the       crush       pale faced and               one       in

particular was              saying         "Fucking mad.              I *ve had enough of                 that.         They®re

fucking m a d . "           He      stood     beside me          until      he    regained a bit                of his.

colour and got his                     breath back before               going      out        of the f o recourt             and

out    onto Lappi n g s             Lane    to wait        for    the    crush to             s t o p . 1 can    remember a

lady of about 50 wear i n g a fawn o v e rcoat who was                                        crying      due     to being

crushed.           She was          crushed with her              head facing            me and        could      not    even

turn her         head forwards              due    to the        pressure         she was        under.          She    shouted

to me      "Help m e I ' m             going      to f a i n t . ”      I pushed         into      the    crowd and

got    hold of her             coat       by the front and              the      left    shoulder         and     pulled         her

towards         me t h r o u g h     the    crowd.         Once      my sack was           to the        sweeI     shop

wall     I pulled         the w o m a n      to me as        she      had     lost      nearly ail         her     colour          and

held     her     to me w i t h my arms a r o u n d                her    until       she      regained a bit                of

composure.!             then     stood, her        beside me          to my       right       so that      her     back was

agai n s t       the    shop wall. I don't              know what           h a p pened       to her      then         as        I was

     from a control             point     of view.         Young men were a c t u a l l y                  climbing          over

They were           "Help us *“                     1 saw that         the      lad on the coara was                  blue        in tne

they were           carrying                  and we        ran to the First               Aid Room,,

A man     looked at the y outh                               and said        "Sorry        i t ’s too l a t e “ ,         an a moved

on.       I knew           where               to take the body but               the   board w o u l d n ’t go            through

the door,           so    I picked                  the     body up in my arms and                    carried        it     into      the

gym and        laid 'him.down.                         No    one    s e e m e d •to know what was              n a p p e n i n g and

The next         person             I helped was a young                        w o m a n who was        totally           snaKen and

I sat     her       down at               the       pitch side.

I'd       stop p e d gett i n g                     details as things were well out of                         control          oy now

I then     ran to help a cobby who was                               strug g l i n g         with a s t r e t c h e r and

before     running and                 back      to    the L L T .

It seemed            that   by now more                dead than         a live were            being      carried       to    the

get stuck w ith stay i n g w i t h a body                            in the' gym tnat *s all,,

When- I went           back       onto       the      pitch a gain         I    saw a man who a p p e a r e d                to be

a doctor        going       from body to body,,                      This was              on the    pitch at          the Kop

I gave m o u t h to m o u t h on a man who                           the       doctor        thought       he    could save

but    to no avail.                He       had been        carrying           out     cardiac mass a g e             on the

same     man.        We then went                to another man and                    swopped roles.                 Both died

and were        taken away              by friends            etc.    to       the     gym.

By now     I was        feeling             rough.         I ’d carried              dead,    wo r k e d on dead and

what made            it worse.

Ely now the worst                 was       over and        1 went      back          towards       the         I and    began

to    console         people       on the          pitch who were                crying       etc.        One    lad just

passed out            in my arms as we sat                     talking.               H e vd lost     his mate          in the

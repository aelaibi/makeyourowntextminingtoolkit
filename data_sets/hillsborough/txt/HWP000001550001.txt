 Judicial Investigation - Provision of Staffing Assistance
 to Family Support Group

 The Working Party considered a further request which has
 been received from the Hillsborough Family Support Group
 for the Council to allow the Solicitor who has acted as
 liaison officer to the Working Party in providing legal
 support to the Group on behalf of the Council, to work
 full-time, for a temporary period yet to be determined, in
 the office being established by the Support Group, for the
 purpose of providing a full legal service to families
 making submissions to the judicial investigation which the
 Home Secretary has established under Lord Justice Stuart-
 Smith to examine the new evidence which has emerged about
 the Disaster and in the light of such evidence to make
 recommendations thereupon.
 Resolved that -
  (a) the Delegated Powers Committee at its meeting to be
      held on 4th August, be requested to approve the
      recommendation of this Working Party that the immediate
      secondment of the Solicitor to the Working Party, to
      work full-time in the office of the Family Support
      Group, for a period initially of six weeks from
      4th August, be authorised;
  (b) during the above period of six weeks, the Chief
      Executive and the Leader of the Council be requested to
      undertake the necessary action to investigate if other
      Councils in the Merseyside region are willing to
      contribute towards the salary and employment costs of
      the solicitor to enable her work with the Family
      Support Group to continue for a further period of
      six or twelve months;

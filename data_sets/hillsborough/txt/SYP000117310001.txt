             At    S .0 0 a m   Saturday        15    April,       I    reported          for    duty     at     the      mounted

             between       Nottingham           Forest       and       Liverpool          F.C.        General        duties         were

             with     other      mounted        officers          I was       deployed          in a c c o r d a n c e      with

             •instructions            received        from       Inspector          H a n d — Davis     of     the     Mounted

             Policewoman           136      Main     of    the    Nottinghamshire                Constabulary               Mounted

             the    ground       of     the    Hillsborough             Stadium.              These    duties        were     carried

             out    with        comparative          ease    and       no    problems          arose    during         my    period        of

Inspector          Hand--Davis                   requesting            2< t w o ) f u r t h e r          mounted          officers           to

attend       at    W ads 1ey            Bridge          Railway          Station            to    assist        with          the    escort       of

Liverpool          fans           to    the       ground          ie    the      Leppings              Lane    end       of    the

complex.            Together                with      Policewoman                Main,        I attended             at       that

location.            Whilst              en      route      to     the       railway          station          along          Halifax

Road,       we     were       met        by      large       numbers          of       Liverpool             supporters             who    were

making        their          way       to     the     ground.            However,             I also          saw       literally

hundreds           other          Liverpool             supporters                sitting          on    walls          and    at    the       sides

of    the     road       drinking                from       cans       and    bottles             of    what       appeared          to    be

alcohol.            They          w e re      making         no    attempt             to    go    to    the       stadium.




Many    of        those       also          walking          to    the       ground          from       their       own       transport

were     seen       to       be     in      possession             of    large             amounts       of    alcohol?             mainly

packs        of    lager          and       beer.           The    footpaths                and    roadside             was    strewn          with

discarded           cans.




On    arrival           at    Wads ley Station,                        again          on    instructions                from    Inspector

H a n d - D a v i s , 1 took                up    a    position          at       the       front       of    the       train       escort

which        had    only          just        arrived.             After          a    short       period          of    time,       together

with    a     Merseyside                 Mounted            Officer          I    led       the    train       escort          down       H a l if a;-:

Road     to       the    Leppings                Lane       end    of    the          stadium.           The       escort       was       flanked

on    its     nearside              by      six       (6)    other       mounted             officers          and       foot       officers.

The     fans       on    this          escort          were       generally                well    behaved          and       did    not       pose

me    a ny    pe rs o n a 1         pr o b 1 ©ms.




Whilst        en    route           to      the       ground       along          Halifax          Road,       the       scene       was       much

as    before?           large          numbers          of    people             making       their          way    to    the       ground?

many     of       whom       were        carrying            and       drinking             from       cans    and       bottles          of

lager        and    beer          and       others          sat    down          and       laid    down       at    the       sides       of    th e

footpath,           surrounded                   by    more       cans       of       alcohol.            1 heard         many       of     these
                                                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                                                             R92

who     were       at, t h e       side        of' t h e        road       ask       of    those         on    the    train        escort          for

spare        match       tickets.                 I did         not       see    any       pass      hands.




When     the       train          escort          reached            the       junction          with         Leppings        L a n e , one

had     no    alternative                   but      to    allow          it    to    intermingle               with        the    many       other

hundreds           of    Liverpool                supporters               who       were       making         their        own    way       along

that,    road       towards              the      ground.             Yet       again       many         of    these        were       consuming

alcohol        from          cans        and      bottles            which,          when       emptied,         were        discarded             at

the     side       of    the       road.




On    arrival           at    the        Leppings              Lane       end    of       the    stadium         I saw        that       the

area     around          that          end     of     the       ground          was       already         inundated           with       a

large        influx          of    Live r p o o l ,        supporters.                    Other      mounted          officers           were

already        in       position             at      that       location             dealing         with       the    control           and

s u p e r vi s i o n     of       t he      fa n s    e n t e r i ng       the       g ro u n d .        There       di d    na t a ppear           ta

be    many     problems                at    this         stage.




The     situation             on       Leppings            Lane       was       such       that      the       bridge        which       crosses

the     River       Don,          adjacent            to       the    ground          was       thronged         with        people          who

were     sitting             and       standing            a b o u t , still              drinking            cans    of     lager       and

beer     and       other          alcoholic               beverages.                 These       people         making        their          way

from     the       Middlewood                Road         area       to    the       Leppings            Lane    turnstiles              via

this     bridge          were          then       having         to       walk       on    to    the      road       into     the       path       of

oncoming           vehicular                traffic.             It       was    possible            that       someone           may    have

been     injured             as    a     result           of    this.




On    instructions                 from        Inspector              Hand--Davis,               together            with     Policewoman

Main,        and    two       other          Merseyside               Mounted             Officers,            I attempted              to

persuade           many       of       the     fans        around          the       bridge         to    move       away.         Most

refused        to       move       and       those         who       did       merely       changed            location           to    the
                                                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                                                  R92

other       side     of       the            road   and        continued             drinking from                     their      cans        and

bottles.            Many        of           these people           appeared                 to    be    in      drunken          states            b ut

the    situation               being          as    it w a s ,       with          £-3,000             persons          in    the       area,        it

was    both        practically                 and       physically                impossible                to    do    anything             about

this       matter.            On     one        occasion,            X took             it    upon          myself,          whilst          riding

the    full        length           of       the    bridge,          to       knock          off       the       bridge       wall       and        into

the    river        numerous                 empty       partially             full          and       unopened          cans       and       bottles

of    mainly        lager.




On    my    own     initiative                  I abandoned               this          idea       as       it    was    not       having          any

desired        effect           and          the    majority             of    the       supporters                appeared             to    treat

our    requests            with              total di sr ega rd               in    that          we    w e re     treated          to    a

barrage        of    verbal                  abuse and         obscenities.




At    one     stage        I do          recall          a    radio       transmission                      being       passed,

requesting           that           Leppings             Lane       be    closed             off       to    all       vehicular             traffic.




Ely t h i s    time        I    could           see      that       the       turnstiles                leading          to       the    Lepping

Lane       (standing            area)           for      Liverpool             supporters                   was    very       heavily-

congested           arid       large          numbers          of    them          were       literally                pushing          and

shoving        in w a v e s          from          the       back    of       the       queues.




Other       mounted            officers             were       already             in    the       area          and    appeared             to     be

making        vain       requests              and       attempts             to    stop          the       pushing          in    order          that

the    pressure            on       those          at    the    front          of       the       turnstiles             could          be    relieved




I then        took       up     a    position                next    to       the       iron       perimeter             gates          which        gave

access        to    the        standing             area       and       together             with          other       mounted          officers,

attempted           to     form          a    barrier          with       horses             through             the    crowd.           The        idea

being       that     pressure                 on    the       queues          from       those          surging          could          be
relieved,             this    preventing                possible              injuries          to     those         most       at       risk       ie

those       nearest          the     turnstiles,                       The    fans       fay t h i s      time       were        clearly

incensed,             many    still              drinking          and obviously                the       worse          for    wear         and

blatantly             refused        to          stop       pushing and            move        back.




On    numerous          occasions                myself           and    my       horse     were       being         pushed           sideways

into       the    metal       uprights                which        supported             the    perimeter                gates.           This

caused          more    supporters                to    surge           past       me,    adding          to    the       congestion

already          at    the    turnstiles.                     A    number          of    fans     also         crawled           on      hands

and       knees       between       my       horses           legs       just       to    get     nearer            to    the       turnstiles.




The       mood    of    the       fans           was    somewhat nasty                   and    many       vented          their          feelings

at    not       being    able        to          get    into        the g r o u n d ,      on    myself          and       other          mounted

officers.              This       consisted             of        obscene          verbal       abuse,          being          spat       on       and

being       showered          with          alcoholic              liquid.




It    was       impossible           to      maintain              a    static          barrier        of      horses          as     th e

horses          and    riders        were         literally              being          shoved       out       of    the       way       by    the

surging          mass.




At    one       point    I saw          a    young          boy        being       passed       over        head         high       from       t he

queuing          fans    at       the       front           of t h e     queues          to    as t e r i l e       area       away       from

the       turnstiles.              He       a p p e a r e d to          be    in   a     limp and           dazed         state.,




As    a    result       of    what          I had           seen,        1 again made many                     requests             of    the

mass       on    my    nearside             to     again stop                pushing       and       to    move          back,        b ut     1   was

again       met       with    a    barrage             of     abuse.




I also          caught       sight          of    a    number           of    fans       scaling          the       perimeter            wall

adjacent          to    Gate       IB a n d       gain        entry          to    the    ground.
    A   number       of     both    youngish              and    middle      aged      supporters              around         rne w h o

    were      in    obvious        fear        for    their       own    safety       tried           in    vain      to     stop     the

    pushing         from     behind          them     by    shouting         verbally            at    their       fellow

    supporters,




    Those     entering            the    ground           via    the    turnstiles          appeared             to     be    doing        so

 only       slowly          due    to    the        congestion          around       them.




    I saw     two     fellow        mounted           officers          attempt       to    form            o r d e r l y q u e u e s on

 the       approach          to    the       turnstiles           but    this    was       again        a    physical

    impossibility.                 fh e y     were     i.ite r a l l y    being       shoved           aside       by      sheer

 weight        of     numbers           who    had    total        disregard          for       the     horses          presence.




 At     one    point         in    the       events,        it    was    decided          that        the    iron       perimeter

 gates        should        be    closed,           this        providing       an    extra           barrier         to   assist          t he

 horses        and     prevent           the    incessant              surging       from       behind.           Foot       officers

on      the    outer        side        of    the    gates        attempted          to    physically             he?Id      them         in a

 closed        position           so     that       those        fans    nearest          the    turnstiles                c o u l d be

made       to e nte r tha              g ro und      as    safely       as   p o ss i b l e .




 fhose        fans     to my       nearside           (those        outside          the    perimeter             gates)         some

d        3,000       in number               were    by this        time     even more             increased.                They were

in time b e i n g            joined           by still          more    s u pporters            just a r r i v i n g at           the

ground,             1 tried        to expl a i n to              those a r o u n d me that                  people were             being

crushed at             the f ron t o t h e                 queue s »       Some appear ed to unde r s tand the

problem,            but others,              still        consuming alcohol,                were           oblivious          to any

form of            r e asoning whatsoever.                       They    still       attempted              to force          their

wa y     through.            O n two         o c casions         1 assisted          fathers with y oung                      children

to      escape       th e    m e 1 ee a n d t h r o u gh          the    gates       to    r e l a t iv e s a f e t y .

  on    the    field       and    after          a    short     time       I saw       numerous                persons          of    both

  s s k s s , both        dead    and       alive          being    carried           on    makeshift                stretchers                from

  the       playing       area,    past          me    to    the    gymnasium.                  Some          time       later       the

  match       was    officially             abandoned           and    I was          directed                to    patrol          the

  exterior          perimeter          of    the       stadium        in       company          with          Inspector             Hand-

  Davis,       to    supervise          the          dispersal        of       fans    from          the       area.           I was       later

  stood       down    to     Niagara         stables          where        I    later       retired                from       duty.




  In m y      13 y e a r s    experience               as    a Police           Officer,             8    of       which       have       been

  as    a    mounted       officer,          I have          regularly           policed             large          football          matches

  throughout          South       Yorkshire.                 Many     of       these       have          been       at    the

  Hillsborough             Stadium,          including             previous           F „A „ C u p            Semi-Finals.                 In

  all       these    years,       I have             never    come     across          a    situation                as       bad    as    I

  have       described.           The       actions          which     I have          carried                out    on       this

  occasion          are    similar          to       those    which        I have          carried             out       on    numerous

  previous          occasions          at    football           matches,          but       never             before          have    I been

  met       with    such     hostility               and    drunken        abusive          behaviour                from       football

  fans,       who    seemed,       in       the       main,     totally          oblivious                to       any    requests             for

  calm       and    order.




  Since       the    events       of    Saturday             15 A p r i l       I have          since          inspected             my    horse

  and       have    found    that       there          are    several          lumps        on       both          its    rear       hind        and

  off--hind         quarters.           The          coat    surrounding              those          lumps          appears          singed

  which       may    be    consistent             with       having        lighted          cigarettes                   stubbed          out     on

  his       body.     I have       informed                Inspector        Hand-Davis                   of    this       matter.            I

  have       never    known       this      to        happen       before        and       it    merely             confirms          t he

  physical          drunken       state          of    many    of     those       fans          at   Leppings                 Lane    and

  their       total       disregard         for        fellow       man     or    animal.

                 states
     I live at                                    Hillsborough           and was
             ISr
     born on     June, 1948.

     1 am a Qualified Ambulanceman.                    1 have been employed by

     SYMAS and its predecessors for 15 years.                 1 am not extended

     trained but have had the basic training and attended the

     Markfield six weeks residential course.                     My station is
     Middlewood Ambulance Station.
3.   On Saturday 15th April, 1989 I was on the afternoon shift

     (2   p.m.     to     10   p .m.).       At    a   time   which     will   be

     logged/recorded which I think was about 3. 10 p.m. I was
     taking a patient along Fulwood Road for admission to Royal

     Hallamshire Hospital, when Control issued a request via the

     ambulance radio for all Sheffield ambulances to become clear
     as soon as possible.          1 was accompanied by          L.A.
4.   We dropped our patient at Royal Hallamshire Hospital and

     contacted Control.             We were asked         to proceed     to the

     Penistone Road entrance at Hillsborough near the gymnasium

     as soon as possible.           It took us less than five minutes to

     reach Penistone Road.               We encountered an accumulation of
     traffic, people and police and were directed by the police

     to back into the Penistone Road entrance when it was clear

     to do so.           Another police officer told us to pull in

     forwards.          We did in fact proceed in forwards.              We were
     greeted by a group of lads with a person on an advertising

     board operating as a makeshift stretcher.                   He appeared to
     be dead.       He was put in the ambulance before we could do
anything.     My colleague used bag and mask to try to give

him some air but without any success.           In the meantime

another live casualty had been brought to us.        We put him

in the back of the ambulance.      1 was driving and 1 reversed

out and we took the two persons up to Northern General

Hospital.     L.A.           informed me on arrival that the

first person was dead and the second still breathing.      They
were unloaded and we returned to the stadium.
L.A.              is extended trained.     On arrival again at
the stadium he was told to take his equipment into the

gymnasium.    1 was left on my own for a while and was told 1

could reverse into the gymnasium area again and await more

casualties.       There was no overflow of casualties coming

through and I had to wait for a period.      One youth came up
to my ambulance screaming that he was dying.        He appeared

to be hysterical, his mates sat him in the car park and he
quietened down.      A casualty arrived with what might have

been a fractured pelvis and almost immediately another

extremely subdued patient.      I arranged for a police special

to drive my ambulance and        I went   in the back of the

ambulance and checked the subdued patient and the other one
while we drove up to Northern G e n e r a l .    Porters   were

awaiting us and the patients were off-loaded quickly.        We

then went straight back to the ground and parked up in the

mouth of Herries Road South waiting for clearance to get

into the gymnasium again.    We then proceeded onto the dual
carriageway and 1 was informed by Mr Jones that he had a
     spare ambulanceman who had volunteered and come to the

     ground and would pair up with me.        The police special had
     now left me.

6.   Mr Jones then told us to proceed to Leppings Lane end to

     pick up three dead from there.         There were now a lot of

     ambulances waiting at the Penistone Road entrance.

7.   We proceeded to the Leppings Lane end.       We told the police

     why we had come and we were instructed to collect the

     bodies.       This was just after 4 p.m.    We picked up three
     dead from an area set aside as a temporary collection point

     by the side of the river.       The dead were each accompanied

     by a policeman and we took them to the gymnasium.       We were

     then told,      having dropped them, that we should park round

     the back of the gymnasium and await further instructions.

     We waited for some 30 minutes and then Mr Jones called us

     together to assess his manpower.       I was then instructed to
     return to Middlewood Ambulance Station and to proceed with
     normal duties.



Dated this     o   day of           1989.

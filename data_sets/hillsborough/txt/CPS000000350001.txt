Subject:            Hillsborough: Re-issue of summonses by the private prosecutor

I have just been notified by CCP of CPS Yorkshire that fresh informations re manslaughter, wilful neglect in a
public office and perverting the course of justice have been laid this afternoon at Leeds Magistrates' Court. The
summonses will be issued today returnable for 18 August 1998 against both Duckenfield and Murray.

The CCP has notified the Press Office of these developments.

I expect that we will receive renewed requests to take the case over in order to discontinue it. I understand that
it is likely that the defendants will request an earlier hearing so that the issue of process can be contested.

                                THIRD DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                             WEDNESDAY, 17TH MAY, 1989

                                   (Afternoon Session)


                   MR. GOLDSACK:    Mr. Garrett, please.


                            PETER JOSEPH GARRBTT Called
                                Examined by MR. GOLDSACK:

          Q. Are you Peter Joseph Garrett? - A. Yes.

          Q. A resident of the Anfield District of Liverpool? - A. Yes.

          Q. Mr. Garrett, what time did you arrive in Sheffield on the
             15th of April? - A. About 10.30.

          Q. What time did you make your way to Leppings Lane^ - A. About
             2 o'clock.

          Q. Was that after spending some time in a local pub? - *A. No,
             we did not find a pub.

          Q. When you arrived at the ground did you have any difficulty
             getting in? - A. No, it was nice orderly queues that was
             what* by the time we got to the ground at about quarter-
             past-2 and everybody was just in a nice orderly fashion
             going in. There was still quite a few people outside.

          Q. What Police presence was outside the turnstiles? - A. I
             only saw two.

          Q. What about inside? - A. There was loads milling around
             inside.

          Q. Were they doing anything? - A. They were searching people
             as they came through the turnstiles after they had already
             been searched outside. As soon as they came through the
             turnstile they were getting searched again.

          Q. You made your way through the tunnel, did you? - A. Yes.

          Q. And into which pen did you go? - A. I went into the right
             pen first.

          Q. Pen 3? - A. Yes.

          Q. At the time you arrived, quarter-past-2'ish how full did
             it appear to you? - A. That was quite full in there.
             That is why we climbed over into Pen 4 which was empty.

          Q. And having climbed into Pen 4 did you stay in that pen?
             - A. Yes.
                                 P.J. GARRETT




Did it remain relatively empty for a time? - A. It was because
my friends they went up to the back them being a bit taller
and that, they went to the back and I went to the front where
it was very empty.

So what time did Pen 4 become uncomfortably full? - A. It
started getting pretty full about 10-to-3. Just as the
teams were coming out because I only saw one team come
out, there was a big push then, a big heave forward and
that was all I saw.

At that stage how far back from the perimeter fence were
you? - A. I was right at the front.

Where were you in relation to the gate? - A. I was to the
left of the gate, the gate was to my right.

How far from it? - A. I would say about 20*.

Could you see it? - A. If I was able to turn my head I could
have done because it was like sort of square on to me.

Once the surge had come just as the players came on to the
pitch what was happening in the area where you were? - A.
Everybody was just screaming and shouting for help for
somebody to open the gates and to get some order in because
there was just a big push forward and it was not like a
normal push because they always go back again. This was
just carrying on and carrying on and people around you, I
was doing it myself, was like shouting and screaming at
the Police and the Stewards to get some order because you
were going to die.

Polices how many Police could you see outside the pen? -
A. I saw three. I was shouting to one of them to get me
out because I could not breathe any more.

Could you gather whether or not he heard the screami? -
A. Yes, because he was looking straight at me. He was
only about a foot-and-a-half away from me.

What if any reaction did you get from him? - A. He sort of
just looked as if to say:  "There is nothing I can do".
This was before the gate was opened. Everybody was shouting
for them to "Open the gate, open the gate".

How many Stewards did you see on that part of the perimeter?
- A. None that I noticed.

So in the crushed position that you were how long did you
remain like that? - A. I would say roughly between 15-20
minutes.

What eventually eased the pressure in your part of the crowd?

                                                 P.J. GARRETT


          - A. Well the amount of people that did actually get through
          I was just hoping that the people could get through out of
          the gate on to the pitch so we could have eased off at the
          back and I was pulled back by a person behind me. He pulled
          me back after about 15-20 minutes where there was a lot of
          space and people were still fighting to get through to the
          little gates at the front when all it would have taken was
          for somebody to have come in and just to get like an orderly
          line for people to go out of the gate because there was
          loads of room.

        Q. Did you eventually leave via the tunnel? - A. Yes.

        Q. On your way into the pens at about quarter-past-2 did you
           see any Police or Stewards anywhere near the tunnel? -
           A. No,not that I noticed.

        Q. Did you see any Stewards in the area of the pens at any
           stage? - A. Not that I noticed, no.

                 MR. GOLDSACK:   Thank you.

                 MR. KING:   No questions.

                 MR. JACKSON:    No questions.

                 MR. MAXWELL:    No questions.


                        Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

        Q. Mr. Garrett, may I ask you, you went into Pen 3, did you?
           - A. Yes, the pen on the right.

        Q. You then went over the fence? - A. Climbed over it.

        Q. About what time did you do that? - A. As soon as we got
           in which would be about quarter-past-2 because it was
           getting a little bit full in there and we wanted to stand
           where we stood last season which was over the other side,
           so we decided we were just going to climb over.

        Q. You weren't forced out? - A. No, no, we climbed over.

        Q. You climbed over into Pen 4? - A. Yes.

        Q. That meant that you had gone over the barrier that    leads
           down from the entrance to the tunnel? -A. That is     right,
           yes.

        Q. Did you say in a statement that you remembered realising
           the gate to your right must be opened? The gate that
           you wanted opened was it to your left or to your right?
           - A. It was to my right, the gate at the front of the pen.

        Q. So you had gone beyond that gate having climbed over the
           fence? - A. Yes. That pen was empty. The one I climbed
                                 P.J. GARRETT


over into was empty. You know, I mean there was people
in there but there was a lot of room.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: That was at quarter-past-2?
- A. That was at quarter-past-2, yes.

      MR. WOODWARD: Did there come a time when you wanted
to get out of that pen? - A. About six or seven minutes to
three but you could not move.

This was when the players came on the field? - A. Yes, I
only saw one, I only saw one player come out of the tunnel.

There was a sudden weight as the people came on behind you?
- A. Yes.

Were you up against or in front of any barrier? - A. I was
up against the perimeter fence.

If we look at the photographs are you able to point to the
sort of position you were in please? Photograph 27 may
help you. Photograph 27 has in the foreground the cross
hatching the yellow lines that are on the exit from the
tunnel. Do you see the yellow paint on the floor? -
A. I don't know where you mean. I was standing about there
by that flag, by that scarf.

There is a scarf tied on to the perimeter fence, a red
and white scarf and that is where you were? - A. Yes.

You got to that position quite comfortably? - A.Yes, there
was nobody there. People were all in the back. My friends
and that went off to the back but I went off to the front
because I could not see.

If one takes into account those barriers there are signiÂ­
ficant obstacles from where you are and the exit from'the
tunnel? - A. Yes.

The crowd in a terrace does sway and does surge, that is
a common experience, isn't it? - A; Yes.

Had there been much swaying before? - A. Not by where I
was, no.

And the surge or the w a y that came upon you did it come
from your left, your right or from behind or what? - A.
It seemed to come from all around.

Everywhere. Was it really this: there came a point when
you found yourself being pressed in from all sides? -
A. Yes, getting pressed in from all sides and on to the
front, onto the fence at the front.

But not an impression of a sudden pressure coming on to
you from any particular direction? - A. No, it just like
sort of all happened.
                                   P.J. GARRETT


Suddenly you were being squeezed from all round? - A. It
started filling up about quarter-to-3, 10-to-3 when there
was like a reasonable amount of people in there, but all
of a sudden it just got unbelievable, unbearable.

      MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you.

      Sir, make I make this point. It is not the intention
of the South Yorkshire Police to criticise or challenge
every observation that a witness may make. Much of what
witnesses will say and have said will depend inevitably
upon their personal perception of where they were at the
time, so it would not be helpful to the Inquiry to detail
each with each witness all the matters, so I sit down at
this stage.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Well, Mr. Woodward, I hope I
made it clear yesterday that unlike a criminal trial or
any other trial for that matter, where one would normally
expect any part of a particular party^s case to be put
to the witnesses, I am not concerned about putting your
case to each witness so don't feel anxious about that.

      If it is a specific allegation against one of your
Officers obviously that is a different matter.

      MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   But there is no need to put
your case to each witness.

      MR. WOODWARD: Sir, I make the observation not in
the lack of understanding of what the Inquiry intends to
do but the perception outside of what is being said and
not challenged. The fact that things are not challenged
does not mean that they are accepted.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Right, thank you.

      Yes, Mr. Glasgow.


             Cross-Examined by MR. GLASGOW:

Mr. Garrett, one little matter. You were asked about Stewards
out in the front on the field? - A. Yes.

You are quite an experienced football supporter, aren't
you, you have been to a lot of grounds? - A. Yes, I have
been to quite a few.

Whether it is right or wrong may be something that the Inquiry
will look into at a later stage, but the fact is that over
recent years perimeter fences have been policed by Policemen
as distinct from attended by Stewards? - A. No, there is
                                 P.J. GARRETT


still some Stewards there. The Stewards are on the perimeter
fence in all the grounds I have been to. It is not just
Policemen that do it because you do get your Stewards there.

What are the Stewards doing out there once there is a periÂ­
meter fence? - A. I could not tell you. I don't know. I
don't know what their job actually is when they are out
there but they do sort of walk about and that, yes.

One of the problems Mr. Garrett is   that for people like
yourself who are not very tall you   usually find yourselves
at the front of the pen along with   tragically in this case
small children and small people? -   A. Yes, but it is normally
by choice.

There are quite often understandable complaints from people
at the front of the pens that anybody out on the ground
in front of them obscures what limited vision they have
of the game? - A. What do you mean the Stewards and the
Policemen upfront they stop you from seeing the game?

Yes? - A. Yes, that is sometimes correct, yes.

And it is a complaint which is reasonably made quite often
by supporters that they cannot see the ground from the
front if there is a whole row of Policemen or people at
the front? - A. Yes.

I am sure you accept that the Policemen have got to be there
because tragically we know that there are pitch invasions,
aren't theri? - A. Yes, but there is a difference between
shoutings  âGet me out. Get me out. I am going to die"
than sayings  "Get out of the way I can'fe see".

Of course we accept that. - A. He is only about a foot-
and-a-half in front of me, may be two feet at the most.

And I am sure you appreciate that whatever mistakes may
have been made if anybody could have got you out earlier
than they did once they understood what was going on,
they would have done? - A. Yes, but to me they understood
too late because you were shouting for a good four mihutes
for them to actually open the gates before they did.

But again I am sure you would not want to overstate the
case or anybody to misunderstand what you are saying.
You aceept, don't you, if there had been any way in which
people could have got you out earlier once they did
appreciate what had gone wrong they would have done so?
- A . I suppose so, yes.

      MR. GLASGOW:   Thank you very much, Mr. Garrett.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR;   Thank you, Mr. Garrett.

                         DAVID LOWE Called
                      Examined by MR. COLLINS:

Q.   David Lowe, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.    Mr. Lowe, I think you are, are you not, a friend of
     Alison Bennett who already has given evidence? - A.      Yes.

Q. Do you also live in Mansfield? - A.       Yes.

Q. And you came with her and a couple of others to Sheffield
   on the 15th of April? - A. Yes.

Q.   We heard from her that you did not have tickets and were
     hoping to get tickets from touts when you got to Sheffield?
     - A. Correct.

Q. In fact I think you managed to find a tout.      Is that right?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And got tickets in fact for the Nottingham end, the Kop
   end? - A. That is right.

Q. Were you hoping to get into the Liverpool end even though
   you had got Nottingham end tickets? - A. Yes.

Q. What had led you to the belief that you might be able to
   do that? - A. I don't know, we were just going to try to
   get in there.

Q.    Had you been the year before? - A. Yes.

Q.    Had you been that year in a special enclosure in the
     Nottingham end? - A. Yes.

Q.    And I gather that was not all that satisfactory? - A.   No.

Q.    In any event did you go to see a Police Officer at some
     stage in order to see whether you could get in the
     Liverpool end? - A. Yes, at Penistone Road.

Q. And where did he direct you? - A. He told us to go to a
   Steward.

Q. A steward at where? - A. Leppings Lane.

Q. Did you do so? - A. Yes.

Q. What time was this roughly? - A. About quarter-to-2.

Q. And did you find a Steward? - A. Yes.

Q. Did he make any suggestion to you? - A. He told us to go
   to the left-hand turnstile.

Q. That is the left-hand of the small A-G turnstiles I think?
   - A. Yes.

                                      D.P. LOWE


Q. Did you try that? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you succeed in    getting in? - A.    He   refused us all.

Q.   So did you go back to the original Steward? - A. Yes, he
     told us to go to the right-hand turnstile.

Q.   Did you do that? -A. Yes.

Q.   What happened then? -A. He allowed us straight in, looked
     at the tickets and let us in.

Q. You did not have to pay him anything he just allowed you
   straight in? - A. Yes.




                                     /Q. You explained
                                          D. P. LOWE



You explained that you were Liverpool supporters? - A.
No, we never said a word.

You did not say anything, you just showed your tickets
and he let you straight in? - A. Yes.

You then went down the tunnel,   is that correct? - A. Yes.

Did you go into the left hand or the right hand of the
two... - a. Left hand.

That is pen 4.   How full was it then, this is about
quarter to two, I suppose? - A. There were quite a few
people in to say it was only quarter to two.

But there was room still? - A. Yes.

Did there come a stage when it got full     enough for   you to
begin to worry? - A. Yes.

When did that occur, can you remember? - A. It would be
half past two, quarter to three.

By about half past two, quarter to three, it was full
enough for you to begin to be concerned? - A. My friend's
girlfriend was feeling sick and that and so I told him to
go down to the front.

Your friend's girlfriend was feeling sick so you
suggested they went down to the front? - A. Yes.

You say to get out.   How were they going to get out at
the front? - A. Well, we could see a gate and I told him
to take her through to the gate on to the track.

Did you   see the gate opened at any   stage? - A. No.

Did you see what happened to your friend and his
girlfriend? - A. No, not until later on.

You yourself, you remained in the pen.   Did it continue
to get fuller and fuller? - A. Yes, gradually.

At what stage was it that it reached such a stage that
you were affected?   By which I mean that you were
suffering in some way? - A. Yes, I went under that
barrier at the front and we were just squashed against
the fence down at the bottom.

How close to the fence were you? - A. I was not exactly
on the fence, there were a few people in front of us but
we were still crushed.

Q. Did you see Police Officers on the other side of the
   fence? - A. Yes.

Q. At this stage was anyone shouting anything?             - A. There
   was everybody shouting.

Q.   What were they shouting? - A. "Get us out'Â®.

Q.   What reaction from the Police on the other           side of the
     fence? - A. Nothing.

Q. We know there came a time when the gate was opened and
   the Police did react.   However, before then we have
   heard that people were climbing and getting over the
   fence in the front.   Did you see that happening? - A.
   They were trying to climb ov&r but the Police were like
   putting their hands up to stop them, to prevent them
   coming over.

Q. Eventually people were got over and I think Alison was
   got over at some stage, was she? - A. Yes.

Q.   Was that to the side or over the front? - A. She went
     over that side.   There is a fence that runs down.

Q.   That would be to number 5, next door? - A. Yes.              She got
     on to the top of that fence and then over.

Q.   What about yourself? - A. I stopped in for another            ten
     minutes or so.

Q. Was that because you were stuck? - A. yes.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. K I N G :

Q. Mr. Lowe, you had been to Hillsborough before,             I
   understand? - A. Yes.

Q.   How    many times before? - A.      Six or seven.

Q.   Had you been on the terrace before? - A. Yes.

Q. Always going down the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. Have you ever known of any other way to get on the
   terrace? - A. No.

                Cross-Examined by MR. W O O D W A R D :

Q.   Mr. Lowe, I do not want to ask you about all the matters.
     May I ask you about this in particular though?    There
     came a point when your friend's girlfriend became a
     matter of concern for you? - A. Yes.

             Q. She was feeling sick,      so the idea was to take her out? -
                A. Yes.

             Q. Did you at that stage feel any concern for yourself? - A.
                No, it was not really all that bad then.   They were
                swaying about like they usually are.

             Q. So far as you are concerned it wasn't really that bad?
                It was fairly normal for the sort of game you were
                attending, was it? - A. Then it was, yes.

             Q. What time is that? - A. Just before half past two I would
                imagine.

             Q. Then there came a time when you were concerned for
                yourself, is that correct? - A. Yes.

             Q.   Do you remember making a statement saying that you wanted
                  to get out for your own safety and that fans had started
                  to climb the fence? - A. Yes.

             Q.   At first the Police's reaction to people coming up was
                  the sort of reaction that was consistent with their
                  believing there was a pitch invasion? - A. Yes.

             Q. The Police first tried to urge them to go back? - A. Yes.

             Q.   At that time the game was going    on? - A. I do   not know.

             Q.   Had the game started? - A. No, I do not think so.

             Q.   Were there any players    on the field? - A. I do not know.
                  I could not tell you.      I did not see the players come
                  out on to the pitch.

             Q. Do you know whether they had been out for their first
                warm-up? - A. We were in the ground when they came out
                for their warm-up earlier on.

             Q. They had had their warm-up and gone back to their
                dressing room? - A. Yes.

             Q. T h e people at the back of the terrace, people behind you
                land further away towards the wall beneath the stand, you
                jmade this statement that whilst the people at   the front
                were concerned for their safety there were people at the
                back still chanting? -    A. Yes.

             Q.   Obviously, as you put it, they did not realise     what was
                  going on or how serious it was? - A. Yes.

             Q. There seems to be a sort of division.  Where the line
                might be drawn could be a matter of argument and debate,
                but you had got people at the front who were in

                                            D. P. LOWE


   difficulties, people at the back just watching the game
   and behaving and shouting and chanting and cheering? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Or, if not watching the game, cheering and chanting as
   they would do.   At the time people were wanting to get
   out there would be all sorts of clamour and shouting? -
   A. Yes.

Q. The Police did, when it was realised there was something
   that had really gone wrong there, they did try to help? -
   A. We were outside the ground before the Police started
   helping.

Q. You were outside the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. What do you mean by that?   You were on Leppings Lane? -
   A. We were outside the ground.   We walked the full
   length of the pitch. I went to a Police Officer and he
   said, "Go out there", at the side of the Spion Kop, and I
   went out on to the street at the side of the Spion Kop.

Q. What time is that you are talking about? - A. I do not
   know exactly.   I would think about half past three.

Q. Is this the understanding we should have from your
   evidence that the Police really did nothing until after
   you had gone out? - A. Well, I did not see them, that is
   what I am saying.

Q. You saw not a single Policeman doing anything to help
   before you got out, is that what you mean? - A. Not in
   front of me.   They were not helping in front of me, no.

         MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you.

               Cross-Examined by MR. GLASGOW:

Q. Mr. Lowe, I am only concerned with the way in which you
   bought your tickets.   I do not dispute anything you have
   said. I accept it as being truthful and accurate and I
   think it is right you should know your account accords
   precisely with what Alison told us yesterday.   However,
   I would like to clarify something through you while you
   are there.   There was an unfortunate mistake made in
   "The Guardian" newspaper this morning and I am sure they
   will wish to correct it tomorrow because it is very
   unfair to one of the stewards.   Under a headline,
   "Touting Turnstile Steward Kept Match Tickets Hidden Up
   Sleeve", the suggestion was made that Alison had told
   this Inquiry that you had bought the tickets from the
   turnstile operator? - A. No.

              Q. I just want to make quite certain through you there is no
                 doubt about this at all, is there?   That is completely
                 untrue? - A. We bought them on the corner of Penistone
                 Road, across from the park.

                         MR. GLASGOW:    Thank you very much for clearing
                   that up, Mr. Lowe.

                                GEOFFREY NIGEL MOODY Called

                                 Examined by MR. G O L D S A C K :

              Q. Are you Geoffrey Nigel Moody? - A. Correct.

              Q. I think you come from West Drayton? - A. I do indeed.

              Q. You are a friend of Mr. Devine who gave evidence before
                 lunch? - A. I am.

              Q. I think in fact you are a Chelsea supporter? - A. I am
                 indeed.

              Q. Have been for a very long time and have visited most of
                 the major football grounds in this country? - A. Correct.

              Q. How many times approximately have you visited
                 Hillsborough? - A. This was my first time.

              Q. I think this year when you did come you actually got to
                 Sheffield at about half past one? - A. Yes.

              Q. You arrived in Lappings Lane at about twenty past two? -
                 A. Yes.

              Q. What was the situation that confronted you when you got
                 to Lappings Lane? - A. I collected my ticket from
                 Mr. Devine's father, paid him the money.  It was very
                 congested outside the gate and even the street by the
                 ground was very congested.   We then proceeded...

                         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Moody, would you go a
                   little slower please and a little louder.

              Q. Just give me the time this was? - A. This was 2.20.

              Q. You say it was very congested outside the gate. - A. It
                 was congested outside the gate and also leading to the
                 gate down the road was very congested as well.

              Q.         MR. GOLDSACK:   How did that congestion compare
                   with what you have seen at other grounds? - A. A lot more
                   severe than I have ever experienced before personally.
                                      X3.N. MOODY


Did you join that mass of people? - A. Yes, I did.

Made your way as quickly as you could to the turnstile? -
A. The best possible way, which was not very good I must
confess.

Can you help us with what was actually happening when
people reached the turnstile itself? - A. It took me, I
would say, about fifteen minutes from the end of the
queue to get to the turnstile and I think I actually
visited every turnstile almost by just being pushed this
way, this way, and coming back.    Being very slight I
cannot push people about so I just go the way the crowd
went, to be honest with you.    I had my ticket grasped in
my hand like this and I was just being turned round
sideways, backwards, all over the place.    Between two
turnstiles I actually hit the wall at one point and sort
of just came across the wall to the turnstile and just
went through.   People were just pushing as you go
through, people were just pushing behind me.

Could you see what was happening when the individual
turnstile barriers were being operated? - A. Not clearly,
no.   I got through in a matter of seconds.    The ticket
just pulled off and pushed through because even then I
was feeling ill.    I was feeling very ill and sweating
badly and just wanted to get through to the other side to
get some air to me.    I was suffering then.

When it was your turn to be the next person through a
turnstile, how close to you were other people? - A. How
close were they to me?

Yes. - A. We were on top of each other virtually.    We
were just pinned together.

Was it just one person going through the turnstile at a
time? - A. Yes, at the time, because you cannot get more
than one person through at a time.

When you got in whereabouts did you go into the ground? -
A. I walked about ten paces through the turnstile and
waited for my two friends to come through, which was a
matter of about two to three minutes.

Were you intending to go to any part of the terrace in
particular? - A. I had never been to the ground before so
I had no idea where we were going to be quite honest with
you.

Do you normally have a preference to be behind the goal
or... - A. A personal preference is to have a seat to be
quite honest, but not I was just waiting for them to come
through and see where we were going to go.

                                                     G^V N. WOODY



Q.   Did you see any signs       inside telling you where       to go?
     A.  None whatsoever.

Q. Did you look?   A.   The odd time when I looked up
   all I could see was the tunnel and obviously the   stand up
   here and the two alleyways to the left and right which
   I would assume were for the seats above.

Q. And so did you go through the tunnel?               A.   Yes,    when
   my two friends come through.

Q.   Any sigp of stewards or anyone like t h a t âin the tunnel?
     A.   There was about four police of fi cers-and about two
     or three stewards that I noticed while I was waiting
     for my two friends but they were not       mar sh al li ng anybody
     at all.     I mean, there were people climbing over the
     turnstile roof at the time and they just were not even
     being stopped.

Q.   Having gone throug h the tunnel, did you initially              go to
     the right?   That is into Pen 3?    A.   Yes.

Q. And what time would you estimate,            or perhaps you know
   exactly, what time you got there?              A.   It was exactly
   2.48.

Q.    You know that because?       A.   Because I looked at my
     watch.   I d o n â t think I will ever forget the time, to
     be honest with you.

Q.   In your es timation as a regular f o o t b a l l - g o e r , how full
     was Pen 3 at 14.48?    A.   Extremely full.               Un co mfortably
     full.

Q.   As a result of that, did you decide to do anything?
     A.   Yes, we decided we would edge to the right.    In a
     normal football crowd you just edge and you edge and people
     try and let you through and we actually stood in front of a
     barrier for maybe 20 seconds and Mr. Devine said, "This is
     probably not too bad a place" and I actually said to him,
     "I am not going to stand in front of a barrier with these
     amount of people behind us and the amount of people that
     are going to come through knowing how many people are
     outside."   I was not prepared to stand in front of a
     barrier, no way, so we kept edging along.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can I understand that.                    You
     did not want to stand in front of a barrier?   A.                No
     not at all.

Q. Wouldn't the barrier protect you, normally?    A.   I don't
   think so, personally, because if there is a big surge
   and I am in front of that barrier, that barrier comes about
   here on me and I am going to get crushed as far as I am
   concerned if I am in *ront of the barrier, standing against
   the barrier.

                                                        G. N. MOODY

Q.   I am sorry,   you mean the barrier in front of you?
     A.   Yes.

          LORD JUSTICE    TAYLOR;        Yes,   I follow that.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:      So you edged to your right?               A.     To
     our right, yes.

Q. Did you at that stage know that you were in a pen?
   A.   No, I didn't know that I was actually sort of
   fenced in as such there, not at that point, until my
   other friend said, "I think we should try and get
   across that side" and then you could see the fence to get
   over the fence because it does look emptier in there.

Q.   Did you and your friends manage to get as far as the fence?
     A.    Yes, we got to the fence.    My two friends ---
     I was about maybe 10 ft. behind him.    My first friend got
     over.    I caught up a little bit.    The second one got
     over and I actually got my hand â    I actually touched the
     fence with my handT and then there was just an almighty
     surge, an incredible surge, and I just went sideways and
     forwards, I don't know, I think I travelled 15 to 20 ft.
     possibly, I don't know, and just ended up smack on the
     cage in front.

Q. Doubtless you have experienced           other surges?         A.   Yes,
   certainly.

Q.   How did this compare?   A.   If you haÂ®e a big surge in
     a football ground if you are standing behind a goal or
     anywhere in a ground, you get a big surge, people go
     forward so then a gap will obviously appar - there should
     be a gap appearing.   A gap did not appear.   People just
     kept coming forward so you would not be able to go back.
     You could not move once you had -- wherever you stopped,
     that was it, you didn't go any further.

Q. Did you say you ended up by the gate?                  A.     I ended up
   at the fence.

Q. Do you know where you were in relation to the gate?
   A.   About 5 ft. to the right.

Q.   You ;wereto the right of the gate?            A.     Yes.

Q.   As well as being pushed forward in   that way, what was                your
     physical position then?    A.   What was what?   Sorry?

Q.   What was your physical situation once you were at the
     fence? A.    Physical situation?     I was in pain where
     I had hit the fence, just the force of it, really, and
     more panic than pain at that time.    Certainly more panic
     than pain.
                                                   G. N. MOODY

Q.What were you or others doing or saying at that stage?
   A.    Well, I managed to edge back.          There was actually
   two girls in front of me and I was directly behind them
   and a couple of guys and I suppose for two or three
   minutes it was a case of you were just stuck together
   like t h i s .       You did not move.    And then there was
   another fairly big surge again but obviously more people
   were coming in through the tunnel and then we were just
   screaming.           There was a Police Officer standing on the
   fence and a W.P.C. Officer and we were just screaming.
   Everybody around me was screaming and crying and we
   were p l e a d in g , we were saying, "Tor God's sake, please
   open the gate."           I mean, we could see the gate in front
   of us.        "Please open the gate" and the guy jiijst kept
   saying, "Push back.            Push back.   Push back."   That is
   all he ever said and it was impossible.            Anyone with
   some in te lligence I would have thought could see that it
   was ph ysically impossible to push back from that situation.

Q. And I think at some stage,              Mr.   Moody,   you lost consciousness.
   A.  Yes, I did.

Q.   And when you came round           you were out on the pitch.
     A.  That is correct.

Q.   I will just ask you one other matter.        During the time
     that you were in the ground and conscious, did you hear
     any announ cem en ts over the lo ud -speaker system?
     A.  None whatsoever.

Q. Mr. Moody,      can I ask you about how you got to where
   you were.        Having gone through the tunnel ----  A. Yes.

Q.   If you have    in front of you the photographs.                 A.   Indeed,
     yes.

Q.   Photograph 23 shows the yellow markings at the front which
     are on the ground on the concrete just at the mouth of
     the tunnel.   A.   Yes.

Q.   And on Photograph 23 there is a fence running down to the
     left.   A.   Correct.

Q.   That is the fence which            divides     Pen 3 from Pen   4.   A.     Yes.

Q.    YouiWfent into    Pen ---- ?  Which did you go, tothe right                or
     to the left?        A.    Tothe right.

Q. And there was a time when you looked at yotff" watch.                    It
   was exactly 2.48.    A.  It was indeed.

Q.   Whereabouts were you then?   A.   I had just come through
     the tunnel, literally the exit of the tunnel, it was 2.48.

                                                        G. N. MOODY

Q.    You decided to go to the right? A.                Not my      decision,
     my friend's decision, basically.                    I was just following.

Q.   You followed him and you at that stage made your way
     through the crowd, did you?   A.  Yes.

Q.    Did you go down the terrace steps or were you                   going
     along them?     A.   Along and down.

Q.    Did you go under any barriers?  A.                  I didn't personally,
     no, not that I can recall, anyway.                  I didn't go under any.

Q.    Then if we look at Photograph            23,    we can see a    gate there.
     A . Yes.

Q.   Is that the gate that you ;are talking about?                    A.      That
     is correct.

Q.    You 'came to a position      somewhere  down in that distant
     corner, did you?     A.        That is correct.

Q.   Up by th e'r ai lin gs ?     A.         Yesr.:-> bout 5 ft.   tovrthe right
     of that gate.

Q.   When you reached out and you think you touched the railings                     ---
     A.   I was touching the railings, I didn't think it.

Q.   Forgive me,    I am not challen gi ng            that.   A.   That    is no
     problem.

Q.   You are right to put it as ypu said.    You touched the
     railings.   Whereabo uts were you on the terrace?   How far
     from the back wall were you?    A.   If I am touching the
     railings, how far from the back wall am I?

Q.    Yes.   I want to get a position,     if I can, of how fardown
     the terrace.    A.   I am on about the railings at the front.
     The front railings along here I was touching.

Q.    You~ were following       your   friend, intending      to gosomewhere?
     A.     Yes.

Q.   He was about    10 ft. ahead of you, you said.   A.   Yes.
     I mean, this    is after going down across and they got over
     the fence.

Q.   I want to ask you about when you said you touched the
     railings, do you follow?   A.   Yes.

Q.   Which point    is that?       A.         Time,    are you talking     about?

Q.   Which bit of the railings did you touch?   A.   If you
     look at the gate in Picture 23, the centre gate, yes?

                                              G. N. MOODY

Q.   Yes.     A.   I am 5 ft.   to the right of that gate.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I think you are at cross-
     purposes.      I think you said before that before the surge
     took you down    to the front you were trying to get across
     to the next pen.      A.    Yes.

Q. And you got as far as touching the fence in between,               is
   that right?    A.   That's right, I am sorry.

Q. I think what counsel is trying to find out is whereab out s
   on the fence you touched it.   A.   I would say 15 ft.
   back from the front.   If you take the front fence and go
   15 ft. up.
MR. WOODWARD:
Q. Does that mean that there were crush barriers between you
   and the perimeter fence?   A.   There appears to be one
   here, yes.   I didn't touch a barrier.

Q. Bat at the~poÂ±nt where you had reached the fence which
   you were intending to go over there were crush barriers                  or
   a crush barrier between you and the perimeter fence.
   A.   Yes.

Q.   Can we see that crush   barrier or any part of it  in
     Photograph 23?   A.Yes, the top right one      is probably
     where we tried to get across.     The top right-hand barrier,
     yes?

Q.   So you think that when you had reached the fence which you
     were going to go over ---   A.   It was about that point.

Q.    You   were on which side - on the pitch side of that?
     A.      The pitch side of that barrier.

Q.    And   that barrier extends, does     it not,   right to the     fence?
     A.     It would appear so, yes.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Turn to Photograph 30      and you
     will   see it.   A.   Yes.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   So you were between ---            A.       I
     was in front of that barrier.

Q.   Then there came a time when you were        down   at the bottom        by
     the perimeter fence?    A.   Correct.

Q.   There was a barrier fairly close to where you were that
     collapsed?   Do you see that in Photograph 23?
     A.   Which barrier collapsed?

Q.   One can see in Photograph 23 the black --          the barrier        that
     is lying on the ground? A.  Yes.

                                                         G. N. MOODY

         Q.   That is in line with another barrier that           is still in
              position,   A.    To the left of it.

         Q.   Now that barrier  which is still in position at the time
              you touched the fence ---   A.   yes.

         Q.   That is the   fence you were going to climb over.               A.   Yes.

         Q.   Where you wanted to go to, that is between you and the
              pitch.   A.   That is correct.

         Q. Did you go under or over that barrier that is there?
            A.   I did not touch a barrier.    There is agap between
            that barrier and    the barrier to the right of it.   You
            can see there is a gap.     I went from the fence sideways
'           across, is what I described earlier, and travelled 15 -
'/          20 ft.   There 3s a gap there.    I would assume that I
            obviously went through that gap.

         Q.   Youvere taken down through that gap?           A.     Correct.

         Q. And that was a sudden surge?       A.         Immense    surge.

         Q.   You say that at football #atches on the terraces you do
              get swaying and surging.   A.  Yes, that's true.

         Q. And there had been swaying and surging on the terrace
            whilst you were going towards the railings to climb over,
            had there?   A.   Yes, nothing untoward at that point,
            though.

     j   Q. Did you have much di fficulty in getting to where you  ere
            going to go to to get into the fence?      A.   Not great
            difficulty at that point.

         Q.   Was the crowd that you were making your way through a crowd
              which was dense but one which was the sort of crowd that
              one might find on the terraces?   A.   I have experienced
              that before.

         Q.   So youcwere moving to get over the fence because you saw
              a place where there was more space?   A.   I didn't personally.
              My friend saw the space.

         Q.   And it was not because   you were forced or driven to that
              position - you decided   to go there?   A.  That is correct.

         Q.   And then events took over you.        A.      That's    right.

         Q. About what time would that be that that happened,                 that you
            were pushed down by the surge to the front?   A.                  Well,
            I would expect it was kick-off time.

                        Re-examined    by MR.     COLLINS:

Q.   I do not know how important it is but I think perhaps
     these photogra phs are a little bit misleading.   We were
     looking at Ph otograph 23 about the position of the barriers.
     A.   Yes.

Q.   Can I ask you to look at Photograph 43?   It appears
     there are, broadly speaking - they are not continuous
     but broadly speaking - there are three lines of barriers,
     do youPsee?   A.   Yes, I do.

Q. As I say, very broadly speaking.    Which run 8 or so steps
   up first and then another similar distance and then
   another towards the top.   A.    Correct.

Q.   If you go back, turn      to Photograph 46, rather, not back,
     forward.   That is a      photograph taken from above and you
     see there the middle      and the bottom of those three rows, the
     top being cut off by      the overlap of the stand, do you see?
     A.   Yes.

Q. And if you look there you'can see the broken barrier
   and the little bit beside it and a little higher up the
   middle one which stretches to the fence.   A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, was it that middle one which was the one you decided
     to get in front of or was it the lower one, do you think?
     A.   No.  The first barrier we got in front of was one
     at the back here at the top.

Q. Right at the top?         A.   Right at the very top.                 This
   was within seconds       of getting into that entrance              through
   the tunnel.

Q.   Where you ended up before the surge knocked you down to
     the front, where was that in relation to the barriers?
     A.  I would say in front of the right-hand barrier.

Q.   Yes ---      A.    Down the   front.

Q.   The middle    or the   front one?      A.        The    front ri ght-hand
     one.

Q.   The very   front   right-hand   one?        A.        Yes.

Q.   So that there was no barrier between you and the very                  front ---
     A.   I didn*t incur any barrier whatsoever.

Q.   That is what I was wondering, as I say, because the
     Photograph -- if you compare 46, for example, with 23, it
     could be a little misleading because the front one looks
     a lot closer to the front than it actually is from the

     angle of the camera.   I hope I am not giving evidence but
     that does --   I think that is obvious from the photographs.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   h                gets more co mp licated        in
     Pen 4, but we need not go into                that at the moment.

          MR. COLLINS:   It gets more complicated in Pen 4
     but I do not think, f o r t u n a t e l y , we need bother with
     Pen 4 with this witness.

          LORD JUSTICE       TAYLOR:         No.

          MR. COLLINS:   There is a change of design it would
     appear and levels in Pen 4.   Yes, thank you, that is
     all I would wish to ask.

           LORD   JUSTICE    TAYLOR:         Thank you very much.

Q.   And you are a Liverpool          supporter, is that        correct?
     A.   Yes.

Q.   Living   in Garston?        A.     Yes.

Q.    And you had,   I think,    a ticket,         did you not,   for the
     match?     A.     Yes.

Q.   Was that a ticket       on the terraces?            A.     Yes,   terrace
     ticket, yes.

Q.   It cost you Â£6? A.         Yes.

Q.    And you arranged with some friends,               did you not,   to go
     by a mi ni-bus?   A.    No, a coach.

Q.    I am sorry, and there were about 40 on   the coach
     altogether but there were about eight of you that
     went together.     A.  Eight went together, yes.

Q. Th i s was a coach on which you managed, I think,                    to take
   some alcohol, is that right?    A.      Yes.

Q.   How much did you have to drink onthe coach? A.                    Three
     cans.

Q.   I am sorry?     A.      We took a four-pack          of cans.

Q.   You took a four-pack        and drank three of them?               A.        Yes.

Q. Did you get stopped          by the police at any stage?                  A.        No.

    Q.   You had been the year before,    I think.   A.   Yes,   and
         we had been searched then.

    Q.   You had been searched then but you took the chance this
         time?   A.   We never took as many cans.

    Q.   You did not take as many as the year before.   A.   Well,
         I never took cans the year before but the people that did,
         like, didn't.

                                            G. MORAN



Q. In any event, when you got to Sheffield it was, I think -
   what time was it you actually first got there? - A. Between
   quarter-to-1 and 1 o'clock.

Q.   Did you go to a pub?   - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you drink anything in that? - A. We went   to the off-
     licence across the road.

Q. What did you get? - A. Three cans of lager.

Q. Did you drink them all? - A. No, I gave my mate one of them,
   so I had two cans.

Q. So by the time you go to the match you have had 5 cans of
   lager? - A. Yes.

Q.   Are    they half-pints or pints? - A. Just under a pint.

Q.   Was that the normal consumption you would expect? - A. When   I
     go to Anfield I have about 3 pints before the match there.

Q . You told us you were not searched at all.Did you then walk
    down to the ground.   How long did it take to walk from the
    off-licence to the ground? - A. Ten minutes.

Q. Police Officers as you approached? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did any approach you or speak to you at all? - A. None.
     Actually, the people I was walking down with, some people had
     cans and they were putting them on the wall half full of their
     own accord. No Police Officer was saying, "Put that can
     down".

Q. When you got to the ground what sort of time was it? - A.
   About half-past-2, 25-to-3.

   control the crowd? - A. Two mounted Police trying to control
   the crowd.

          Q. What time did you arrive last year? - A. It must have been
             half-past-2.

          Q.    About the same? -      A. Yes.

          Q.        LORD   JUSTICE     TAYLOR:Last year was dead easy compared
               with this   year? -   A. Yes,it was just orderly queues.

          Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Was there any difference you could see in
               the state of the fans and the approach of the fans this year
               and last year? - A. no.

          Q. Was there any difference in the number of fans around this
             year and last year who came to the match? - A. A couple of
             thousand outside the ground at that time.

          Q. This year there were a lot waiting outside, but generally
             speaking, when the fans got in last year, was it full up? - A.
             No.   Well, I never went into that section.  I went to the
             corner section.

          Q. Anyway, you get to this crowd outside. How long does it take
             you to get into the ground? - A. It took me about 20 minutes,
             because I was outside the double iron gates at the corner when
             I got to the ground.

          Q.   Did you get yourself into the crowd? - A. I just got    pushed
               from behind with people coming behind me.

          Q.   How did you feel in that crowd?   Was it enough to ^make you
               worried for your own safety? - A. Not really.  I was with my
               friend and he was with his wife, and we were trying to protect
               her, because we were coming up to a wall between the two
               gates, and we were trying to get away from that and there was
               a Police horse, and we were right next to the Police horse,
               and we were trying to get away from that as well.

          Q. Were you aware of people climbing up over the walls? - A. I
             could see people climbing over, yes.

          Q. Eventually you got in through a side gate? - A. Through a
             gate.

          Q. Were you aware of this gate opening? - A. No. Afterwards I
             understood I came through the gate, but when I came through
             the gates I saw the sign "A" and "B" either side, and the sign
             above "Standing", and I went to get my ticket out thinking
             they had put more turnstiles in. I thought they had adjusted
             the ground. That is what I thought. So I never showed no
             ticket.

          Q. When you say you got in which you now know to be a gate, what
             led you to that gate, because it was not where the turnstiles
             were.  It was round the side? - A. I just got carried. One
             minute I was queuing up and the next minute I was just
             getting carried along with the crowd.

        Q. And were you able to stop before you got to the tunnel? - A.
           No chance.

        Q. What about going down the tunnel? - A. When I got to the
           tunnel I knew then I still had my ticket, and I could just see
           the top of all the heads. I could see the back of the goal
           nets and the back of Bruce Grobbelaar.

        Q. How would you describe your passage down the tunnel? - A. I
           was just getting spun round.

        Q. Why was that? - A. So many people going down.       I was getting
           turned around.

        Q. When you got to the end of the tunnel and emerged from it
           could you see the pitch? - A. Yes.

        Q.   Were the     players   on the    pitch? - A. Yes.      I could    only
             goal,  I could only see Bruce Grobbelaar.

        Q.   Had the match started or not? - A. I don't think so.

        Q.   So it was thestage before the match had started but when the
             players had got on to the pitch? - A. Yes.

        Q.   Which pen did you get into, the right or left? - A. The left.

        Q.   That is pen 4. Where did you end up    in pen 4? - A. Against
             the crush barrier.

        Q.   There are many crush barriers.    How high up? - A.The second
             row. The one behind.   On that   crush barrier there.

        Q.   Around about the middle of the pen? - A. Yes.

        Q.   When you say you ended up against it, you mean it was
             immediately in front of you? - A. No, as we got; spun round the
             top of my leg caught the barrier and     I    justgot pinned agains
             it, and I was on my tip toes trying to pushmyself off.

        Q. Did this mean you were in some pain? - A. Yes.  I could not
           even see the pitch.  I was facing the stand behind.

        Q. You were turned right round? - A. Yes.

        Q. Could you move back? - A. No, I could not move at      all.

        Q.   Because of the mass of people?   - A. Yes.   My arms were stuck
             into my ribs.

        Q. What about your friends? Were you still aware of their
           presence? - A. I had not seen my friends since I came through
           the gate, and then all of a sudden I     saw mymate going past
           me, and if I could get this arm free - not free but underneath
           - and he was going, sweating and everything and his eyes were
           shutting, and I just grabbed hold of his belt, put my hand up
           belt, and kept hold of him. I could not pull him towards me

          because there were people in between us, two people, but I
          just kept hold of him.

     Q. You had the misfortune to be aware the man next to you died in
        this crush? -A. Yes.

     Q. This was up in the middle of the pen, was it, beside you? -A.
        He was right next to me. He was facing the stand but he was
        being bent right over the bar.

     Q. He was being bent over the crush barrier? - A. Yes, and his
        friends were trying to pull him up. We were all trying to get
        him up but we couldn't.

     Q. That means he died standing up, effectively? - A. Yes.
Ml   Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   At what stage was that? What sort
          of time? - A. It must have been about 5 or 10-past-3.

     Q. Had the game been stopped by then? - A. I think. I don't
        know. All I was doing was screaming for them to get us out.

     Q.        MR. COLLINS:   You were still facing away from the pitch,
          were you? - A. Yes, by this time only a couple of inches I
          could move round, so I was trying to ease myself out.

     Q. Obviously you could not see what was happening in front or on
        the pitch? - A. No.

     Q. Eventually things eased a little? - A. Yes.

     Q. And eventually you got over the fence at the front? - A. Yes.

     Q. But only with some difficulty? -A. Yes.

     Q. Did you hear any announcement at any stage over the Tannoy
        once you got on to the pitch? - A . I think I heard one when I
        was on the pitch, saying, "Get off the pitchâ .

     Q. That was all? - A. Yes.

     Q. I think you can recall when you got on to the pitch you looked
        at theclock? - A. Yes, it was 25-past-3.

     Q. Which is when you managed to climb over? - A. When I got on to
        the pitch.

     Q. Did it seem to be at all organised when you were out on the
        pitch?   - A. No.   When we got on to the pitch, on     tothe fence
        and I pulled myself over, I think there was a Policeman
        standing about 3 feet away and I just had to throw myself
        over. He never gave me any assistance getting down off the
        fence.

     Q. They appeared, I think you thought, to be somewhat shocked by
        it all as well? - A. They did not know what to do. They were
        just young lads, 23-24, and did not know what to do.

Q. Did you see any stewards assisting? - A. Not at all, no.

Q. At no time? - A. None at all.

                    Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

Q.   May I take you tothe point as you were approaching the
     turnstiles. What time would that be? - A. Getting to the
     turnstile itself?

Q. As you were approaching the turnstiles.   Let us say you are 5
   or 6 yards from the turnstiles? - A. About 5-to-3.

Q.   AnyPolice Officers in sight? - A.     Just mounted Police.

Q.   Did you notice any Police Officers - just lift the marker,
     please. - A. To the side by those trees.

Q. What did they appear to be doing? - A. They appeared, about
   four of them, just sitting on the horses, talking to each
   other.  I could not see.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The mounted Police by the side
     there? - A. Further up. About there.

          MR. JACKSON:       May he see a copy of composite album No.
     photograph 15.7.A,     produced by the South Yorkshire Police.

          MR. WOODWARD:       May I hand to the witness ;one copy and
     hand to you another.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Is it possible to provide copies
     for the Assessors?

          MR.   WOODWARD:    Wewill endeavour to do that,   sir.

          MR. JACKSON:   This is composite album No. 1,
     photograph 15.7.A. I understand, sir, a number of the
     parties have not yet been supplied.

          MR. WOODWARD:      We have copies for the Assessors.     This
     is composite 1.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Will there be more?

          MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, one of the problems with the pace
     with which we are proceeding is material is being produced....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I am not criticising.   I am simply
     asking.

          MR. WOODWARD:    I can't answer.     I don't wish to appear
     to be sensitive, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Let us be patient.       We are going
to have composite volume 1 now. At the moment      we only have
two of them up here.

     MR. WOODWARD:   We will endeavour to provide a
sufficiency of them.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     This is "South Yorkshire Police 1"
as far as I am concerned

     MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, may I indicate what it is. This is
a compilation of photographs taken by different cameras, and
in the bottom of the photographs one will see times. For
example, the first one bears the date "15", and then looks
like "14.08". So the times are the camera time, and there may
be a minute or so   difference from real time.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Whose cameras are these?

     MR. WOODWARD:    MWL 10. If one looks at the      top ofthe
photograph, there is a code which will enable the camera and
the film to be identified.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Is that as forthcoming as we are"
to know?   Who is MLW 10?    It is a Police Officer, is it?

     MR. WOODWARD:     I understand it is. We have prepared a
timesheet, endeavouring to correct, and by reference to which
it is possible to identify the actual time which that
particular photograph portrays.   Thus, for example, although
the photographs which is head "MW 10 13 A", the first in the
bundle, bears the time at the bottom "14.08", which is the
camera time, and the actual time is 14.07.   There are
available actual timesheets which enables the
correction to be made.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What I suggest is if we hand them
back to you this evening those might be stapled into the
front.

  MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, if we handed them in at this stage,
perhaps we could make copies and get them stapled. We have
not facilities in the building.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     We will get that done.

                 MR. C O L L I N S : Sir, they are all one minute out. They
           are all one minute fast in this series so I don't think
           we really need a bit of paper.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         It is not right?

                 MR. WOODWARD:     Some are one minute slower.

                 MR. COLLINS:  The actual time is always one minute
           under the time shown according to this list.

                 MR. W O O D W A R D : Sir, when one looks at the whole of
           the material, there will be before the Inquiry furnished
           in a sufficiency two bundles of photographs, amongst
           other photographs, Composite 1 and Composite 2.         You have
           at the moftferft sir before you Composite 1.      It would be
           an error which we ought to avoid at this stage to assume
           that the times in all the composite photographs are only
           one minute out in a particular direction.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         But iff these ones are we can
           start on that basis.

                 MR. WOODWARD:  That bundle is and you have the time-
           sheet and it is one minute.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Yes, very well.

                 Now, Mr. Jackson, where are4 we looking?

                 MR. JACKSON:    We are looking, if you would sir, at
           MWL10 29A, and if I   can assist I have amended that to the
           actual time 14.52.    The one prior to that is M W L 15 7A
           where I began which   the actual time is 14.50.


                          Cross-Examined by MR. J A C K S O N :

      Q. Mr. Moran, I am seeking to find out the deployment of the
         Police Officers at the time you are describing it as you
         were going through the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

      Q.   As you  approached the turnstiles would you confirm tliat this
           is the route you took and waited and struggled and eventually
           got through the barrier? - A. Yes.

      Q. A t the time you were approaching and hoping to take part
         in orderly entry through turnstiles, did you see any Police
         Officers assisting in the organisation of the queues? - A.
         None at all.

      Q. Would you look please at first the one marked 7A at 14.50?
         - A. Yes.

      Q.   Do you recollect seeing a number of mounted and foot Officers
           apparently to the right of where the queues were not forming?
           - A. That is exactly.  That is wha t I saw.

                                            C. MORAN


    Q. Did you see any reason why anyone of those Officers    did not
       assist in attempting to form orderly queues? - A. I    don't
       know why they did not bother. I mean why they did      not try.
       You have got a horse weighing a tonne at you. You      are going
       to move out of the way, aren't you, and move back?

    Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I suppose the way round, if
         Mr. Poole moves his pointer upwards, round there would
         lead towards the South Stand? - A. They did not want fans
         getting through. I know that. I can understand that, yes.

    Q.   That is why these barriers are there? - A. Yes.

    Q.   And the Police are in front of the barriers? - A. Yes.

â¦   Q.         MR. JACKSON: It is quite clear isn't it from those
         photographs and from your recollections that a very large
         number of Police Officers were deployed in blocking the entrance
         to the stand? - A. I could not see the Police Officers on
         foot. I could only see the mounted Police Officers.

    Q. You can perhaps see those best in Photograph 30A? - A. Yes.

    Q. Where there are horses standing apparently with no problem
       either side, in front or behind them? - A. There is no one
       near them. There you can just see at the back of the pitch,
       yes, you can see the Police, two mounted Police horses.

    Q. The two Officers who were desperately but unsuccessfully
       attempting to form an organised queue where something like
       five of their colleagues wens on horseback apparently
       carrying out a different perhaps less necessary function?
       ~ A. Yes, that is exactly what I saw.

                MR. JACKSON:   Thank you, Mr. Moran.

                MR. MAXWELL:   No questions sir, thank you.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, Mr. Woodward.


                       Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

    Q. Mr. Moran, you have been asked to look at some photographs?
         - A.   Yes.

    Q. One can see in those photographs a number of mounted Police?
       - A. Yes.

    Q. And wlat photograph have you got in front of you? - A. 7A.

    Q. Have you got in that picture a man standing up holding on
       to a lamp post? - A. Yes.

    Q. And then in the distance some four Officers and then in the
       further distance some two Police Officers on horses? - A. Yes.

     I was by those Police Officers in the distance.

Q.   I will come to that in a moment. Over to the left do you
     see a traffic light sign? - A. Yes.

Q. A triangle and just beyond    that there is another Police
   Officer? - A. Yes.

Q.   How many Police Officers were you aware of there being on
     horseback as you made your way to the turnstile? - A. I
     saw the two outside the main cast-iron gates. I was next
     to one of them horses and I could just see the four horses
     near this big concertina gate.

Q. You only saw four did you? - A. Over by this concertina
   gate and two in the crowd.

Q. Were those in the crowd endeavouring to do anything those
   Police Officers? - A. They were trying to push people
   back.

Q. As you came along to the Leppings Lane entrance you became
   aware of the crowd of people getting denser, getting thicker
   as you went towards the gate to go in? - A. Yes.

Q.    You went   in and joined the crowd? - A.Yes,     to get intothe
     match, didn't I? There is the turnstiles.

Q.    You were taken in fact by the crowd? - A. I was carried
     with the crowd. There was a fella in front of me saying
     to his mate:    "Come on, let's get out of this crowd".
                                                                    i

Q. You went to the right, you went through a gate? - A. Yes.

Q.   When you     came onthis     crowd that was more than you expected
     to find, was it?   - A. I expected a crowd but it was more
     than I expected, yes.

Q. There were many more people there at that time than you
   expected to find? - A. I expected que&es as well, not a
   mass.

Q. They were more densely packed? - A. Yes, you could not move.

Q. And thiswas at about 5-minutes-to-3? - A. That is when I
   went through the gate about 3-minutes-to-3 when they opened
   that gate.

Q. 3-minutes-to-3? - A. Well it must have been because I was
   about 20 yards away from the concertina gate so it must
   have been about 5-to-3 when I was by them Police Officers,
   yes.

Q. And you came through the gate at what timef1 - A. I don't
   know.

Q. 3-minutes-to-3 did you say? - A. Something like that, yes.

Q. So it had taken you a couple of minutes to get down there?
   - A. Once the gate had been opened?

Q.   Yes? - A. Oh no, I was took along.

Q.   And then as you went along going through f x o m "the gate to
     get to the tunnel were you running or walking? - A. 1 was
     just getting literally carried.

Q.   Where were you taken to? -A. To the tunnel.

Q. When you got to the mouth of the         tunnel to come out       ofit
   on .... A. On to the terrace.

Q. Were you to the right or to the left? - A. To the left.

Q. And where did you then go? - A. The barrier below on this
   end and I just stopped against the barrier. My leg got
   trapped on a barrier.

Q. Which barrier is that? - A. That one, yes.

Q. Then what happened to you? - A. I just got trapped and I
   could not move.

Q. So this is the picture of your experience, that you came
   through the tunnel bn to the terrace and were just stuck?
   - A. I just got swung round and the only thing that stopped
   me was the barrier and that only stopped me because I just
   caught the edge of it.

Q. Had the match already started by the time you came out
   of the tunnel? - A. I don't know. I could just see as
   I was coming down the tunnel the top of Bruce Grobbelaar's
   shirt. I don^t know if the match had started.

Q. So the goalkeeper was standing somewhere by the goal was
   he? - A. Yes, he was in the goal area.

Q. When you were going to the turnstiles was there a swaying
   of the crowd? - A. Not really, you just could not move.
   You were moving like a foot at a time, that was it.

Q. If we look in the bundle of photographs with the Police
   in, have you got one towards the end MW10 37. It is
   near the back? - A. Yes, got it, yes.

Q. That is timed at 14.57.     Do you see? - A. Yes.

Q. If that is a minute fast we come down to 14.56? - A. Yes.

Q. That is the sort of time at which you were going through
   the gate, is it? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you see the number of mounted Police in that picture?
   - A. Yes.

Q. There is a line of them in the distance, eight mounted
   Police. Can you see across the centre of the photograph?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see a line of Police like that at any time? - A. Hot
   at all, no.

Q. But that would be at about the time that you are going
   towards the gate? - A. Yes, but I was just going like that.
   I was going like a bullet out of a gun. You could not
   stop yourself. You could not look round, you were just
   looking forward.

Q. Did you see any uniformed Officers inside the gates? - A. No.

Q. Did you see any uniformed Officers inside and beyond the
   turnstiles? - A. No.

         MR. WOODWARDS   Thank you.


                Cross-Examined by MR. GLASGOW?

Q. Mr. Moran, would you have had a chance to see anybody in any
   kind of uniform inside the gate when you were being carried
   along? - A. The only two people I saw were two programme
   sellers standing on the steps towards the West Stand behind
   the goal.

Q. Dp higher than everybody else? - A. Yes, they were standing
   on the steps selling programmes.

Q. If anybody had been standing on the ground you would not have
   been able to see them, would you? - A. You could not see
       three people in front of you.

Q. And you could not have paid any regard even if you had
   wanted to to any directions that anybody could have given
   you at that stage? - A. When I went through that gate I
   tried to get into the corner section,through that ....

Q. The gate we are calling Gate C? - A. Yes, that is right.
   I tried to go through that wall and come up on to these
   steps in the corner section because I was there last season
   and I just got took down the tunnel. I could not control
   ray movements, I just got took down the tunnel.

Q. Even though that fou knew there was a way round at~the
   side you could not physically get there? - A. Well I could
   not even see the wall. Well I could see the wall, I could
   not see the gap.

         MR. GLASGOW:    Thank you very much.

     followed by usefully a layout of the barriers. It looks
     as though there are some of those around. Have all Counsel
     got these?

           MR. WOODWARD:    Yes.


                      By LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

Q.   I wonder if you can help Mr. Moran with this:   you see where
     the tunnel is in the middle at the top? - A. Yes.

Q.    And you see that there is a divide   coming downand youwent,
     as we are looking at this drawing, you went to the right?
     - A. Yes.

Q. Now you can see where on the plan here the various barriers
   are marked? - A. Yes.

Q. Is it possible for you to say which one you fetched up
   against? - A. I think it was the one that says "bowed
   outward".

Q. I think that there are a couple that say that.         The higher
   one of the two? - A. That one, there.

Q. That is practically in the middle of Pen 4.         Is that right?
   - A. Yes.

Q. That is where you were? - A. Yes.

Q. And where this man died? - A. Yes.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Thank you very much. Does
     anybody want to ask anything .further on that? (No response)
     Thank you.

      HR. GOLDSACK:      Mr. Parry, please.

                      ROY PARRY Called

              Examined by MR. GOLDSACK:

Are you Roy Parry? - A. Yes.

From St. Helen's? - A. Yes.

I think you came to the match with your two sons? - A.
That is correct.

Aged 10 and 8? - A. Yes.

What time did you reach the entrance in Leppings Lane? -
A. It was about 2.15 to 2.30, but I think it was nearer
to 2.15.

What was the situation when you arrived? - A. There were
a lot of people there but it was not unusual.  It was a
typical match day at that time.

Were there queues at that stage? - A. It was a mass of
people but it was fairly orderly.

Did you and your two boys have any difficulty in
progressing to the turnstiles? - A. No more than normal.

Had you been to Hillsborough before? - A. No.

Once inside the turnstile how did you know were to go? -
A. Just followed the crowd, to be quite honest with you.

Where did that take you? - A. We went through the tunnel
and as we came into the ground we went down on to the
right.

Bearing in mind you had two boys with you, where were you
hoping to get to? - A. Well, we would try to get behind
the goal if we could do.

Right at the front? - A. Well, if we      could do because   the
small fellow he could not see.

Did you manage to make your way down through pen 3? - A.
We got to about four rows from the front.

What time do you think it    was by then? - A. Before 2.30.

Was that pen very full by    then? - A.   Quite   full.
                                          R. PARRY


Having got about four rows back from the fence did you
remain in that position? - A. No, we ended up in the
corner.

Which corner is that? - A. That corner there.

The bottom right hand corner? - A. Yes,      that is right.

Of pen 3? - A. Yes.

At what stage were you right in the corner? - A. We had
been in the ground about ten minutes.

Was that simply because of more people coming in behind
you? - A. Yes, it was.

How long did you stay in that position? - A. Until after
the match had started.   Then it got a little bit crushy
and so we tried to get further back if we could.

Up until the time the match started had you been
uncomfortable right in that corner? - A. I was not too
bad but the kiddies were uncomfortable.

Was there any particular event on the field at the time
you became uncomfortable? - A. Not really, no.

Did it coincide with anything that happened on the field?
- A . No, not that I can think of.

Did you at some stage decided to try and move your
position? - A. Yes.

Why did you decide to    move? - A. Because the kiddies were
getting pushed around a little bit and I    was getting
worried about the youngster.

You say the match had    started? -A. Yes.

Do you recall the incident where   someone had hit the
goalpost? - A. Yes.

Was it before or after that you decided to move? - A. It
was after that.

Just after or sometime after? - A. A couple of minutes
after that, but I do not think that was the reason that
caused us to be uncomfortable.

What were you going to try and do with your two lads? -
A. Try and get them back.

Did you succeed? - A. We got half way right along the
wall and then we stayed there for a couple of minutes.

                                                   R. PARRY


Q. When you say â'the wall", do         you actually mean the   fence?
   - A. No, the wall.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         You mean the front wall?    -
     A. That one there.

Q.   Let's get it clear.     There is a wall on top of which
     there is the fence?   - A. That is right.

Q.   You mean that wall?   - A. That's right.

Q.         MR. GOLDSACK:    You say you got about half way
     back? * A. Yes.

Q. How easy was that? - A. Not very easy at all.   Because
   they were children, people were going out of their way to
   try and get us up there, so we were getting a fair bit of
   help off people.

Q. Did something prevent you getting the other half way to
   begin with? - A. Just the amount of people who were
   there.    We stayed there for a couple of minutes or so
   and then we virtually fought our way and got right up to
   the back.    In fact I just dragged the kiddies behind me.

Q. As you went up the terrace were you conscious of people
   through whom you were going being distressed? - A. Not
   distressed, no.    They were being pushed around a little
   bit but I would not say distressed, not at that time.
   To be quite honest, I was not taking too much notice of
   other people because of the children.    I was more
   concerned about them and I was not really taking too much
   notice of other people.

Q.   Did you eventually get right to the back? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you head for the tunnel? - A. We did.    We went along
     the back.   We ended up alongside the tunnel.

Q.    I appreciate it is very difficult, Mr. Parry, but what            is
     your best estimate of the time you reached the tunnel?             -
     A. Fifteen minutes I would think.

Q. How many minutes passed three o'clock? - A. I would
   reckon...   W e started to move about two or three minutes
   after the kick-off and about fifteen minutes or so after
   that we were at the tunnel.

Q. Did you know at that stage what was happening to others
   down at the front? - A. I did not know what had happened
   until we were on our way home.   We did not have a clue
   what had happened.
                                          R. PARRY


As you were going back out of the tunnel at that stage
with your sons, were there many other people in the
tunnel? - A. Yes.

Going in which direction? - A. They were coming towards
us.

That is to say in to the ground? - A. Yes.

Were they spectators? - A. I would think so, yes.      They
certainly looked like it.

Did you see Policemen in the tunnel at that stage? - A.
No.

Or stewards in the tunnel? - A. No.

Did you see any Policemen or stewards at the top of the
terrace before reaching the tunnel? - A. No.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   These people coming through
the tunnel at that time, this is quarter past three? - A.
Yes.

Are we talking about just a few odd stragglers, or are we
talking about quite a stream, or what? - A. There were
quite a few people.

      MR. GOLSACK:   Now you have come out of the other
end of the tunnel into the courtyard area.   Were there
many people in there at that stage? - A. Not an awful
lot.   There were people there but not...   There were a
lot of people outside the ground.   There were more
people outside the ground than there was there.

How did you go out?   - A. Through a sliding door.

Just look   where the gentleman is pointing. Is that
where you went out? - A. Yes, round about there.

At the time you went out of there were there people
coming in through that gate? - A. Yes.

What did you assume those people to be? - A. I do not
know.   I just walked past them virtually.   I did not
take much   notice of them.

Were they   people in uniform? - A. No.

Were they   stewards? - A. No.

Can you give us some idea of how many people appeared to
be coming in through the gates at that stage? - A. There
were quite a lot.  I am not exactly sure.   As I say, I
                                               R. PARRY


was ushering the kiddies out and just trying to get them
past.

Was it a trickle or people in groups? - A. There were
people in groups.  It was not a trickle.

Where were the large number of people that you say were
still outside?   Whereabouts were they? - A. They were in
the roadway heading towards the ground.

Can you say whether or not people were still trying to go
through the turnstiles at that stage? - A. I do not think
so.   They were going into the door that I was coming out
of.

You went back to your transport, did you? - A. Yes, and
just came home.

       MR. GOLDSACK:      Thank you.

             Cross-Examined by MR. W O O D W A R D :

Mr. Parry, can you help a little bit about the times?
Obviously what happened that day must have been a great
disappointment and rather frightening? - A. Yes.

You got to the ground about 2.30? - A. About 2.15 to
2.30-ish.

At that   stage, whatever the true time was, when you
arrived   you were able to go through the turnstiles in a
more or   less expected way? - A. Yes, not un-normal.   It
was not   unusual for a match day.

The system, if there was a system, and the way that
people were ordering themselves, seemed to be working? -
A. Yes, at that moment it did.

People were going up, getting close together, but going
through the turnstiles in a reasonable manner? - A. Yes.

There were Police Officers about? - A. I think so.

You do not recall seeing any? - A. No, not certain.   As
I say, I had my eye on the children.   I was looking at
them more than anything else.

As you put it in your statement:

       "There were hundreds of people milling around but
       there were no problems, just a normal football
       crowd.   We queued up and went through B Leppings
       Lane end."
Yes.
                                         1. PARRY


Then you went towards the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Then you went on to the terrace? - A. Yes.

At the time you went in there were people in the tunnel,
a bit of pushing, but no problems, just a normal football
ground? - A. That is right, at that time.

Does it follow from that, if you had had any anxiety for
your sons you would not have gone on? - A. No, probably
not.

When you came out of the tunnel on the terrace you went
to your right? - A. Yes.

You went to a position in the far right hand corner? - A.
Not immediately, no.   We went down towards the goal and
we ended up in that corner.   We wormed our way across to
the...

So you could get an angled view? - A. Yes,    that is right.

So you went down to the front...   - A. And then along the
front, yes.

Not necessarily in straight lines, but worming your way
through? - A. Yes.

Were you holding your boys*   hands? - A. Yes, I was.
There was one in front, one   behind, I was in the middle
of them.

So the three of you were making your way? - A. Yes,    that
is right.

This would be a little bit after 2.30? - A. Between 2.15
and 2*30, nearer to 2.30 at this time I would think.

Nothing to cause you any concern at that time? - A.    Not
at that moment.  I was just looking for a nice spec    for
the children.

I do not know if you have the drawings before you? - A.
Yes.

Have you got the drawing there which shows the terrace? -
A. Yes.

With the crush barriers.   If we are to find your
position, where is it?   Somewhere bottom left corner? -
A. Somewhere bottom left corner, yes.

                                                                   R. PARRY

Q.   The game started?        A.    Yes.

Q.    Up to that time was there anything to embarrass you or
     worry youfor your sons?    A.   It was a little bit pushy
     but they were alright;   they were fairly happy at that
     time.

Q.    Did you see the beachball      being       bounced about?         A.        No,
     I can't remember that.

Q.   Then you decided to come out.            A.      To start getting
     up the back, yes.

Q.    And that was after someone had         -- there had been a near
     score?    A.  Yes.

Q.   Liverpool   had nearly   got the      first one.         A.      Yes.

Q.   You saw that happen,     did you?      A.        Yes.

Q.    Did that cause anything of a surge?    A.  It caused   -- I
     wouldn't say a surge but excitement if you know what I
     mean.    It caused a bit of movement, a bit more movement.

Q.    So that made it a bit tighter for you, did it?                   A.,        Just
     a little bit more uncomfortable, yes.

Q.    At that stage you are down at the front by the perimeter
     fence?    A.   Well, we are not   right at the front by the
     perimeter fence, no.    We are about four or five rows back.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Were you ever right at the
     front?    A.   No, we never got   right to the front.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   There is a barrier that we see, a crush
     barrier, that is seen on the drawing there.   A.   That is
     right.

Q.   Were you just somewhere in front of that?    Youwere
     between that and the ---   A.    Between that and the
     perimeter fence, I would say.   Yes.

Q. So after that near miss, the crowd pressure got more.
   A.   A little bit more, yes.

Q.   Or with that near miss the crowd              pressure got more.             A.     Yes.

Q.   So you decided   to come up a bit? A.           That's    right.

Q. And you worked     your way up to the back,           did you?            A.        Yes.

Q.   The crowd allowed you to do that?     A.   Well, they helped
     us.   They were helping the children more than me.     They
     were letting me fend for myse lf but they were trying to make
     a little bit of room.

           Q. And you had moved from a position - what - four or five
              steps back or four or five rows of people back from the
              perimeter?   A.   Four or five rows of people?

           Q.   You were not aware of any problem amongst         those people
                at that time, were you?   A.   No.

           Q.   You did not see anything, you did not observe anything
                to indicate that any disaster had occurred?   A.   No.

           Q. And you managed      to get up the back?       A.    Yes.

           Q.   And you worked    your way to the exit?      A.     That's right.

           Q.   Was it    getting less dense as you got towards the : back?
                A.   It   was virtually the same all the way, to be quite
                honest    with you.    It was more or less the same all the
                way.      Along the back it didn't seem too bad.

           Q.    Amongst the supporters, as opposed to the wall at the           back,
                the density or the thickness of the crowd was more or            less
                co nsi stent?   A.   Yes, it was.

           Q.   Nothing to choose between from where       you had come to where
                you were going.   A.   No.

           Q.   What about the    people that had been in front of you
                whilst you had    been at the bottom there?      Were they more
                densely packed    than you had been or    not?         A. I didnTt
                really notice,    to be quite honest.    I c o u l d n Tt really say.

           Q.    At the time you were coming out with your boys, did you
                observe any distress or anxiety   or horror on anybody?
                A.    Just the noise.    That's the one thing I do remember.

           Q.   Tell us'aboutthe noise, please.   A.    There was a lot
                of shouting and you could hear a bit of screaming and I
                got a little bit frightened because I didn't know what had
                happened but I thought something might happen and I just
                dragged the boys out of the ground but the one thing I do
                remember was the noise.    It was ard ifferent noise to the
                noise you usually get at a fotball match.     It was a
                noise of, so mething might have gone wrong and it was
                only on the way home when we found out what had happened
                that I associated the noise with - yes, that is that
                type of noise.

           Q.   There was something about the sound that was different
                but it was very, very noisy all the time?   A.   Very
                noisy, yes, and it was frightening the children a little
                bit, the noise.

           Q.   The noise thr oughout?  A.   Well, not throughout.             It
                was when we were trying to get out of the ground.

                                                     R. PARRY

Q.    It is the case that at some stage a barrier collapsed?
      A.   Yes.

Q. And it would appear from what you said that that barrier
   that collapsed was fairly near to where you at one stage
   were?   A.  Possibly was, yes.

Q.     But you are not aware of that happening?    A.  I can't
      remember agreat deal about things like that.     As I say,
      all I could think of was the children and they were the only
      two people that I can remember seeing.    I looked at
      other people but they were faceless - I just --     The kids -
      just drag them out, you know.    That was the only thing
      on my mind.

Q.     It is very   difficult to,as it were, burrow into the                 mind
      and recall    these events.   A.   Yes.

fl.    But may it be that there was something that happened that
      caused you to want to get out - some sudden press, the
      crowd just around you?        A.    it was just that the children
      were u nc om for ta ble all the time and I could see it on
      their faces, they just wanted to move, and it didn't seem
      to get any worse.

Q.     Was the game still going on as you went out of the tunnel?
      A.    I haven't got a clue.   I didn't know the game had
      been called off until we were on our way home.

Q.    As you'Weritout to go into the entrance of the tunnel to
      leave, there were people     still coming in?  A.  Yes.

Q. But you?Here able to go through,             ne ve rtheless?
   A.   We got through, yes.

Q. Was it a great battle to go through or was it just going
   through?   A.   No, it wasn't a great battle but it was a
   little bit uncomfo rta ble but not a battle.

Q.     You were not going against a surge of people?                A. Not
      a surge of people, no.

Q.    You were going against a flow of people who just happened
      to be more than you and going in the opposite di rection?
      A.   That's right.

Q.    Is that a fair picture?         A.     I would    think so,    yes.      I
      would think so.

Q. And then you left by the gates.               A.      Yes.

             asked you questions, I, too, have enormous sympathy
             for you and I think we all appreciate what a ghastly
             experience this must have been but I think it is
             possible that you are mistaken about the time that you
             actually left.    A.    I could well be because, as I
             say, the only thing on my mind was, "The children,
             the   children".    It seemed as if we were never going to
             get   out and it seemed an awful long time.

        Q. Mr.   Parry, that would have been the same for any of us
           in this room, parti cul arl y those of us who are parents
           and nobody is criticis ing you - certainly not me - in
           any way at all but I am concerned with your genuine
           belief that at about a quarter past three ---      A.   I
           will be honest with you.      I am guessing because I
           don't really honestly know.      I am just guessing because
           I don't really honestly know.

        Q. And if I were to suggest to you that if there were still
           people coming in a flow through the tunnel when you
           mercifully left with your children as early as you did,
           then that must have been very shortly after 3 o'clock,
           Would you       disagree with that?   A.  It took me a
           co n sid er abl e time to get through the tunnel because I had
           to fight my way through the crowd.        This is the only
           reason I am thinki ng of the time.

        Q.   I think, Mr. Parry, it must have been that you set off
             on that journey much earlier than you now believe that
             you did because I do not need to distress you by showing
             you the photogra phs but we can all see what the state of
             the crowd was like by 3 o'clock.    A.   Yes.

        Q. And to be absolutely candid, I think I can put it to you
           without fear of c on tra di ct ion by anybody, that you - even
           with children - you physically could not have got through
           that crowd from the front to the back at anything after
           3 o'clock.   A.    Mm.

        Q. Do you think it is possible, as Mr. Woodward was suggesting
           to you, that some frightening surge happened in the early
           stages and you, out of a natural sense of pr otection for
           your children, set off for the back while it was still
           possible to do so?        A.   Well, as I say, the children
           were un com fo rta bl e and the first thing I thought of doing
           was just ---       There was nothing that made me do it, like
           "Oh, let's get away from here because something has
           happened."      It was just that I looked at them and they
           were distressed and I just dragged them out.

        Q.   We all understand   that.   A.    Yes.

        Q*   But at any event your estimate    of 3.15 or thereabouts
             which you were talking to Lord    Justice Taylor about,

          that you very honestly say really is just a guess?
          A.   It is a guess, yes.   It is a guess.

               MR. GLASGOW:   Well, I will not press it further.
          Thank you for your patience.

                            Re-examined by MR.         COLLINS:

     Q.   Perhaps just one thing,       Mr.Parry,         had the game started
          before you moved back?        A.     Yes.

     Q.   It had?    A.     Yes.

     Q.   And do you recall anything particular about the play that
          you saw before you moved back?   Any incident that comes
          to your mind that you remember seeing in the play or was there
          nothing special?   A.   Nothing absolutely special, no.

     Q.   For example, if there had been a shot which hit the c r o s s Â­
          bar, that is something you would have remembered, I suspect?
          A.   Oh that - that is something I have r e m e m b e r e d , yes.

     Q.   You did not see that?         A.     I   did, yes.

     Q.   You did see that?        A.   Yes.

     Q. So you saw that happen before you moved back up the pen.
        You are quite sure about that.   A.   Yes.

     Q. And you started, remind us, from where in the pen.before
        you moved back?   A.   About five rows.   Five rows of
        people back from the corner.

     Q. Five   rows back    from the corner,        that is back      from the   front?
        A.     Yes.

     Q.   And did you move up round the edge,             as it were?      A.    Right
          on the edge, yes.

     Q. So you sort of made your way up the edge and round the back?
        A.   That's right.

     Q. And that was,      you^ Say, certainly after the shot had missed.
        A.     s.

     Q. Was it immediately         after that?       A.     Right away we started
        to move.

     Q. Was that when there was a surge?         A.   Well, I don't
        know, I can't remember a sudden surge where I was.          As I
        say, it was just the d i str es s^d lne ss of the children.
        That was the only reason I moved.         There was nothing
        else which made me move.      It was just the children.
        That was the only thing that made me move.
                                                               R. PARRY

          MR.    COLLINS:      I do not think        I can take      it any
     further,    thank you,    Mr. Parry.

             LORD JUSTICE    TAYLOR:       You are a lucky man and a
     lucky    father.

             THE WITNESS:      Thank you very much.

                             JOHN P H I M E S T E R , called

                            Examined    by MR.     COLLINS:

Q.   M r . Phimester,    you are    John Phimester,        is that      right?
     A.     Yes.

Q.   And you live in Wal lasey?            A.      Yes.

Q.   And   I think you are a retired            schooltea che r?        A.        I am.

Q. And have you been a supporter of Liverpool                   for a co ns iderable
   number of years now?   A.   Twenty-five.

Q. And have you been to virtually                every home match and most
   Cup games when they are away?                  A.   Yes.

Q.    I think you now do not attend away matches regularly.
     A.    I don't go to the  League matches as I used to but
     I usually go to the Cup games if I can.

Q.    Did you go both this year and last year to the Cup game
     at Sh effield?   A.  Y e s , I was here in 1988 and again
     this year.

Q.   I think you came with your son,              is that right?             A.      That's
     right.

Q. And some      friends.      A.      And three others        this year.

Q.   I do not need to go into the details of your journey.
     Suffice it to say you arrived here at about 1 o'clock?
     A.  Yes.

Q. And did you go to a public house to start with to get
   something to eat and something to drink?   A.  Yes,
   we did.

Q.   That was a pub      I think called         The Beehive?       A.        Yes.

Q.   And how much,      can you recall, did you have to drink
     there?   A.        At the most three pints.

Q. Was it full of other supporters                of Liverpool?          A.        Yes.
   There was about 200 in it.

Q.   How would you judge their state by the time you came to
     leave the pub?   A.   Well, they were in a happy state
                                          J. PHIMESTER

of mind.      I did not see anyone   the worse   for drink.

Now, you had a seat in the Stand, is that right?          In
the West Stand?  A.   In the West Stand, yes.

Above the terraces?     A.   Yes.

And two of those at least who were with you had standing
tickets, is that right, on the terraces?   A.   Yes, my
son and two friends had tickets on the terraces and another
friend had a stand ticket with me.

What time did you get to the ground?        A.     We got there
at 25 past 2, as we did last year.

Tell us whether th es ituation â      in what way it differed
from last year when you a r r i v e d at the ground?   A.   Well,
last year when we got near the ground, there were about
50-100 yards from the ground there was a line of about 20
policemen and you did not go past that line unless you had
a ticket and after you got past you were then filter&d
into different turnstiles.        We were in the ground   altogether
at 25 to 3, no problem at all,

And this year?   A.   This year there were no police stopping
anybody.  When we got to the ground there was an immense
mass of people milling around.    I saw at the most nine or ten
policemen and four Mounted Policemen, two outside the gates
and two inside.   My friend and I were m i sd ir ec te di nt o
the crowd that were going into the turnstile leading to the
terraces and I asked a Mounted Policeman if I was in the
right place for the STands and he said, "No, you should
be on the other side of that blue gate."    There was a big
blue gate that was open against the wall, and then his
horse got between my friend and I and the left rear foot
of his horse stood on my left foot, fractured a toe and
took the nail off another one^ completely.

When you talk about the gate, is this the perimeter gate
between the road and ---   A.    The big open gates that
had the scarves on the next day.

The perimeter gates to the road.   A.   yes.  I got to
the gate.    This was about -- I asked him about 20 to 3
and as I asked him I heard him shouting into his intercom,
"For God's sake get more men out here".

This was the officer on the horse?   A.    Officer on a
horse.   I was right beside the horse, I couldn't fail
to hear him and as I managed to work my way over to the
gate there was a great surge of people and I was squashed
against that gate for a full five minutes.

I am sorry,   which gate are you referring to,      the same
one?   A.     The outside, the blue gate.
                                        J. PHIMESTER

One of the pillars of that gate?

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can we be sure we have got
this right?   Would you look round a moment and see if
you have got it right at the model?      A.  Yes, one of
those, yes.   That gate.   And I had to get the other
side of it to the proper turnstile and as I got to the
gate there was a great surge of people against me.    I
was squashed against the gate for a full five minutes.     I
felt all the breath being squeezed out of me.    I thought
I had had it.   I hung on to the gate and I prayed and as
I prayed there was a respite and I pulled myself along
the bars of the gate to get round the hinges of it to the
turnstiles which led to the Stand seats.

     MR. COLLINS:   You     told us you heard the Mounted
Policeman at some stage saying, "For God's sake get more
men outhere".   A.   Yes.

CAn you help us as to what time it was by then?     A.    It
was about 20 minutes to 3.

Eventually I think you got through the turnstile into the
ground?   A.   Yes, I got through thet ur ns ti le by
about 10 to 3.

And did you make your way up into the stand to your
seats?   A.   Yes, I went across the ground and I saw
some steps leading up to the Stand.   I went over there
and that was where I saw the first steward who tore the
edge off my ticket.

                     I then went up to the stand seat.   I was in row 29 seat 137, I
                     think.

                Q. And that was virtually directly behind the goal, was it? - A.
                   Slightly to the right of the goal.

                Q. I think you could not see from where you were sitting into the
                   terrace? - A. i could not see into the terraces, but I could
                   see the perimeter, and I could see all of the goal.

                Q. Could you see the   top of the perimeter fence? - A. I could
                   just see the top of the perimeter fence.

                Q. Did there come a time when you were aware of people beginning
                   to climb over the perimeter fence? - A. Yes.

                Q.   Can you remember when that was? - A. A chap said to me,"Oh,
                     no, they are getting on to the pitch".

                Q. This was when? - A. About 4-minutes-past-3.

                Q.   Shortly after the game had started? - A. Yes.

                Q.   Taking it shortly from now on, from then on were you   aware of
                     more and more coming over, the game stopped and they    were
                     spilling all over the pitch? - A. Yes.

                Q. People were obviously injured and unwell? - A. Yes.

                Q.   I want to ask you just this, if you would.   Clearly fans and
                     Police Officers were doing what they could to help people, but
                     did you get any impression as to the organisation so far as
                     the Police were concerned in the early stages when people were
                     coming out and being helped on the pitch? - A. There did not
                     seem to be any organisation at all.   I saw about three
                     Policeman and onePolicewoman giving mouth to mouth
                     resuscitation and   heart massage. Most of the Police were
                     standing round bemused as I thought.   There were people lying
                     on the pitch not receiving attention.   After about 20 minutes
                     of activity on the pitch a line of about 200 Policemen came
                     across the middle of the pitch.   They were just standing in
                     the middle of the pitch while people were lying on the ground
                     not receiving attention.

                Q. But there were other Policemen who were helping? - A. Yes.
                   Things began to get organised when about a dozen Firemen
                   arrived with oxygen equipment.

                Q. Thank you, Mr. Phimester. - A. One thing I would like to point
                   out, on our way to the ground we commented that all our
                   friends and all the tickets we had seen were marked "Turnstile
                   Dâ , whether you were standing or whether you were sitting, and
                   this funnelling of all the people into a small number of
                   turnstiles, which was done by the FA, to my mind precipitated
                   the crisis.

                       Cross-Examined bv MR. JACKSON:

    Q. Mr. Phimester, are you able to describe the mounted Officer
       who was asking for assistance at about.... - A. Not really.

    Q. Had you seen him before as a local Officer? - A. I had not
       seen him before, and his horse was ahead of me. All I saw was
       the back.  I saw him leaning over with his thing, and I could
       not describe him.  I think he had a small moustache.  That is
       all I can say.

                     Cross-Examined bv MR. GIBSON-WATT:

    Q. One point, if I may. Mr. Phimester, you drew attention to
       the fact all the tickets you had seen were marked "Turnstile
       Dâ , did you say? - A. All the tickets we saw from quite a
       large number of acquaintances and people we see at the
       matches were marked "Turnstile D " , whether you had a seat or
       whether you were on the terraces.

    Q. What I am concerned about is this.    You went on to say that
       that was done by the FA. -A. Yes.

    Q. For your information the FA does not make that sort of
       detailed arrangements for tickets for turnstiles. - A. All
       right.  Thank you very much.

                       Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD;

    Q. You arrived in Sheffield at about 1 o'clock? - A. Yes.

    Q. You went to the pub. - A. We got in about 10-past-l.

    Q. And eventually you came to the Leppings Lane entrance? - A.
       Correct.

    Q.   And as you walk to that entrance the first   thing you encounter
         is the railings with the gates in it? - A.   No, there was a
         mass of people.

    Q. Forgive me, the first piece of geography you come to, the
       first feature is a row of railings with gates in it? - A.
       There are two big gates that were wide open.

    Q.   You went through those gates, did you? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Were you able to walk through them without difficulty? -A. I
         walked through them, but shortly afterwards I was being moved
         around by the crowd.

    Q.   When you walked through those gates did you go to the left-
         hand side? You see the usher is pointing.    There is the sort
         of fence that goes down the centre which roughly divides the
         arc? Do you see? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Which side did you go to? Did you go to the left     orright    of
         that fence? - A. We went to the right at first.

      Q.   How     far down did  you get before you realisedyou were going
           the wrong way? - A. I beg your pardon. We went to the left at
           first.

      Q. You went to the left, the other side from where the usher is
         pointing. - A. Yes. Then I had to go the other side of it.

      Q. How far down did you get? - A. I got halfway to the
         turnstiles.

      Q. This would be about what time? - A. 25-to-3.

      Q. So you managed to get that far and decided to go back because
         you were wrong? - A. Yes.

      Q.   Did you have any difficulty in getting back? - A. Yes, I
           had great difficulty getting back because of the throng and
           the fact the Police horses were moving through the crowd
           seemingly trampling on people indiscriminately.  They were
           moving backwards and forwards among the mass of people.

      Q. How many Police horses did you see in that area? - A. In that
         area there were two. Outside the gates there were two more.

      Q. There came a point when you were caught and fast against some
         part of the structure? - A. Yes.

      Q. Where was that, please? - A. That was the gate there. I was
         squashed against that side of it, and I pulled myself along
         the bars and when I got a respite....

      Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Let us have a look. We have got
           some photographs here. Would you like to look at the small
           bundle of photographs, which is West Midlands 1, photograph
           No. 3 or 4.    3 and 4 may help you.

      Q.         MR. WOODWARD:   Do you recognise it? - A. It was agate
           like this I was squashed against. This gate here.

      Q. Picture 4.

      Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Can you point to it? - A. I will
           mark the gate.   It was this gate here which was open.

      Q.   Thenearest one to   the dividing fence? - A. Yes.

      Q.         MR. WOODWARD:   The nearest one to the dividing fence and
           to the right-hand side of it as we look at the picture? - A. I
           had to go to the edge of the gate and get round the corner to
           the right turnstiles.   I had to come this way and round the
           corner of the gate to get to where I should be.

      Q. You were caught against it on the Leppings Lane side rather
         than on the turnstile side? - A. Yes.

      Q. What brought you up against that gate? - A. Just the throng of
m   '

                                                            J.S. PHIMESTER


             people.  I got pushed and carried against it.   It was a very
             unpleasant experience.  I thought I had had it.

        Q. You describe a Policeman speaking into his           - A. Yes.

        Q. And he had already done that by the time you got caught? - A.
           Yes. When I asked where I was he said, "You have got to get
           the other side of the blue gateâ , and at the same time he sort
           of put his head down and shouted into  his intercom.

        Q.   And he wanted help? - A. Yes.

        Q. May I come now to your approach to the turnstile. Did you go
           through the turnstiles? - A. Yes. When I got round the gate
           there was nowhere near as many people, and I got through the
           turnstiles for the stands quite easily.

        Q. Do you know which turnstile you went through, whether it was
           closest to the wall or fence? - A. The second one from the
           wall.

        Q. I think, usher, that would be on the other side of the fence?
           - A. Yes. That is right.

        Q.   That is right? Either A or Bgate?   - A.Yes.

        Q. Did you have any problem going through the turnstile? - A. No.

        Q. Did it take you very long to get from your position by the
           gate where you had been caught to the turnstile? - A. After
           being squashed for 5 minutes, when there was a respite it took
           me about a minute to get round the corner and then only a
           couple of minutes to get to the turnstile and through it.

        Q. So we are talking about 3 minutes or so, roughly, to get from
           the fence or gate where you had been caught to the turnstile?
           - A. Yes, but when I got round the corner from where the
           throng was for the terraces there were nowhere near as many
           people.

        Q. When you say you got round the corner from the throng for the
           terraces.... - A . I had to get round the hinge of the gate I
           had been pressed against. So I call that a corner. When I
           got round that there were turnstiles for the stands, those
           with tickets for the stands, whereas the turnstiles on the
           side where I had been trapped were turnstiles for those with
           ground tickets.

        Q. So which turnstiles did you go through? Did you go through
           the ones for the ground tickets or for the stands? - A. I got
           through a turnstile for the stand tickets.

        Q. It may be our misunderstanding or my misunderstanding. The
           usher is pointing to the line of entrances. There is a broad
           arc there in front of his pointer which contains the
           turnstiles that go through for the stands. Do you see? - A.
           Yes.

                                                  J.S. PHIMESTER



Q. It was our understanding a few moments ago that that area
   where the usher was pointing to was the area which you were
   when you realised your mistake? - A. That is what it looks
   like because I came this was to get round the corner.

Q. You then came out towards Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.

Q. Along to the gate which you identified? - A. Yes, and down the
   other side of it. There was a wall where the gate was hinged.
   I went down the other side of that wall.   You can see it here
   on the photograph.

Q. Which photograph are you looking at? - A. No. 4.     That is the
   gate I think I was squashed against.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can we understand this. First of
     all, we may not have got this clear. You went to the wrong
     lot of turnstiles first and had to go to a different one? - A.
     Yes, wrongly.

Q. Did you go to the right-hand lot first? - A. I went to the
   right-hand ones first, yes.

Q.   And then you came out past this gate you mentioned and had to
     get round to the left side of the fence? - A. Down that wall
     and down there.

Q.   Yes.   I think we may have misunderstood that at first.

Q.       MR. WOODWARD:    And it was about 2 or 3 minutes you took
     to get from the fence to those turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you have any problem going through the turnstile? -A. No,
     there was just quite an orderly queue on that side.   I went
     through easily.   I went across the open space to where I saw
     some stairs.

Q. Can we pause.   I am interested in the situation outside the
   turnstiles there at that time.  This time would be about when?
   Just before you are about to go through the turnstile? - A. I
   was in the crowd being jostled from 25-past-2 until quarter-
   to-3. About quarter-to-3 I got a respite and got round the
   corner.

Q. It is some time after quarter-to-3 you are going through the
   turnstile? - A. Yes.

Q. And at that time going through those turnstiles to give access
   to the stands things were fairly orderly, were they? - A. Yes.



                      /Q. There was some sort of queueing
                              136

                                      J.S. PHIMESTER


Q. There was some sort of queueing? - A. Yes.

Q. People presenting themselves so that they could go reasonably
   freely through the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. And the congestion and throng that you are talking about is
   on the other side of the fence from which you had escaped?
   - A. Yes.

Q. You went up and got your position eventually, got your
   seat eventually? - A. I took my seat about five minutes
   before the kick-off.

Q. At that stage when you took your seat were you able to
   see down into the terrace below? - A. No, all I could see
   of the terrace below was the top of the perimeter fence.

Q. So there comes a point when you are aware of people climbing
   over that fence? - A. Yes.

Q. Is that some time after the kick-off? - A. Yes, about three
   to four minutes after the kick-off.

Q. I suppose if there had been people climbing over the fence
   before that it is likely you would have noticed it? - A. Yes.
   Well it depends how far they came out. I had not noticed
    it before.

Q. But you became aware of it three or four minutes into the
   game? - A. Yes.

Q.    But from    your position you could not see    anythingelse of
     what was happening on the terraces? - A. I could not see
     what was happening on the terraces.

Q.   If people had been coming up from the terrace and climbing
     over the parapet to get on to the stand, do you follow?
     - A. Well I was too far back from the front of the stands
     to notice anybody being lifted up into the stands. I saw
     photographs of that happening to people later but I didn't
     see anybody being lifted up myself.

Q. From where you were sitting could you see the front of the
   stand? - A. Yes, I could see the front of the stand but
   I was not behind the goal, I was to the right of it.

Q. The position is this: you were not aware at any time of
   people coming over the parapet on to the stand? - A. No.

Q. And certainly nothing like that,no problem or concern amongst
   the people in the stand before the icick-off? - A. No.

Q. Those people obviously towards the front of the stand would
   have as one got further to the front, a better view of what
   was happening on the terrace? - A. Well my seat was on
   Gangway Z which was well over to the right of the goal and
   it was behind the goal that these things were going on.

You did not notice any concern amongst the people in the
stand before the kick-off? - A. No.

      MR. WOODWARD:    Thank you.


              Cross-Examined by MR. GLASGOW:

Mr. Phimester, do you remember that your ticket had the
words "West Stand" printed on it? - A. Yes.

If it had "West Stand" printed on it did you think it
said "Turnstile B"? - A. I got it in my M a t e m e n t exactly
what was on my ticket actually.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I was going to ask you. You
have not still got the stub of your ticket, have you?
- A. No. The Police have got a photocopy of it. The ticket
was marked for "Turnstile B. West StanSv Gangway Z.
Row 23. Seat 137â.

      MR. GLASGOW/ Could we have a look at the .... Is
that a photocopy of the ticket? - A. That is a photocopy
of my statement.

      MR. GLASGOW: Oh the statement. The statement does
not help us, Mr. Phimester, I think there may be a mistake.

      MR. COLLINS: Sir, if it helps I understand that
he did give it to the Police, it says so in his statement.
Unfortunately it is not here, it is in Birmingham, but we
will get it ferreted out and brought Jiere. I don't think
it is necessary to have Mr. Phimester back because we will
all see what the ticket says, if we find it.

      MR. GLASGOW: Thank you very much.        I need not
trouble you further, Mr. Phimester.

       THE WITNESS:     Thank you very much.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I imagine it is your case, is
it, as far as it is a case, it is your contention that
his ticket should have 'C' on it?

      MR. GLASGOW: Sir, would it help if I gave you an
example? Our understanding, the worry is, providing it
is not a forgery, forgive me just handing it in loosely
at the moment, but if it has West Stand, sir, it auto-
maticaTIyvfollows the computer line, it will have a 'C'
on it, unless of course something quite extraordinary has
gone on.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes, thank you very much.

                  DAVID POSTLEWAITE Called
                  Examined by MR. GOLDSACK:
                                    D. POSTLEWAITE


You are David Postlewaite, are you? - A. That is right,
yes.

From Chester? - A. That is right.

You came across to the match on the 15th of April arriving
in Sheffield I think at about midday? - A. That is correct.

Was there any particular reason why you came early? - A.
Well the week before in the Liverpool programme against
Sheffield Wednesday, the Police instructions were printed
asking supporters to arrive some time after 10.30 so that
all supporters would not arrive together, so I thought if
I arrived about 12 o'clock I would find somewhere to park
no problem.

In the Information that you read the week before was there
anything about the time you should arrive at the ground
itself? - A. No, it said that the gates would be open from
11.30 onwards and that there would be entertainment inside
the ground.

Now you after lunch went to the ground at about quarter-to-2,
did you? - A. Yes.

Was there any evidence that you saw of people who had not
got tickets? - A. There were several people who were asking
us for tickets. We previously had a spare one that was
sold within a matter of seconds at the ground and we could
have sold it twenty times over, so there were obviously
a lot of people at the ground not with tickets.

You got into the ground itself I think without any diffiÂ­
culty at that time? - A. Yes, no problem.

And went to Pen 3? - A. That is corrects 1

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That is what, at 1.45? - A.
1.45, yes.

Was there entertainment? - A. No.

      MR. GOLDSACK: Now whilst you were in Pen 3 did you
hear any announcements over the Tannoy system? - A. Yes,
at about 2.30 there was an announcement for supporters
behind the goal at the Leppings Lane end to actually move
forward to let other supporters on to the terracing.
Well in my opinion that terracing was already fairly well
populated and I could not see how supporters could actually
move forward allowing other supporters in on to that
terracing.

And that announcement, you say, was about half-past-2?
- A. That was about 2.30.

At that stage whereabouts in Pen 3 were you? - A. I was
about three-quarters of the way back just on line with
the six yard line on the pitch.

                                      D. POSTLEWAITE


Q. Now you say fairly full at that stage. Did it reach a
   stage where so far as you were concerned it was uncomfortably
   full? - A. That is right. At about 20-to-3 I said to my
   friend that it was getting uncomfortable and we attempted
   to actually get out of the pen. We attempted to go to the
   left towards the tunnel we had come down. We could not do
   that. We tried to go to the right to get in the pen next
   to it but we could not move that way either, so as far as
   we were concerned we were stuck there.

Q. So far as trying to get into the pen to your right was
   concerned, did you know whether there was a way through?
   - A. No, as far as we were concerned we would have to climb
   over the fence.

Q. Now did something happen shortly before 3 Â©'clock? - A.
   Yes, just shortly before 3 there was a tremendous surge
   downwards.  I shot forward approximately 15-20' and ended
   about 10* away from the fence. There was a considerable
   pressure which slackened off after about a minute. I
   eventually moved back about 2'.

Q. Was that the only noticeable surge? - A. No, there was a
   surge later than that, probably about a minute later.
   Again a surge towards the fence but this time theDa was
   no slack off and things just got tighter and tighter.

Q.   So far as that second surge, can you help with the timing?
     - A. I would say it was just after the players had come
     out to warm up the second time.

Q. But before the kick-off? - A. Just before the kick-off,
   5-to-3.

Q. Now after that second surge do you know where you were
   in relation to the gate to that? - A. I was just on the
   right-hand side of the gate as I was looking at it so
   the gate was on my left-hand side.

Q. How far away? - A. About 10* away from the fence.

Q. Could you see it? - A. I could see it, yes.

Q.    Now inthe few minutes after that what was happening to the
     people around you? - A. Well basically everyone was
     shouting and screaming for the Police to do something,
     to open the gate. Either by force of supporters or the
     actual crowd against the fence the gate was opened and
     a couple of supporters spilled out on to the pitch. The
     Police ran across and banged the gates shut, even though
     it was obvious that supporters were in distress.

Q. How many Police Officers could you see near to that gate?
   - A. There were two or three.

Q. Male or female? - A. There was one female and the other two
   were male.
                                    D. POSTLEWAITE


How far from the gate were they? - A. They were right on
top of the gate.

Did you only see that gate opened the once? - A. Ho, the
gate was opened again about five minutes after that. Again
a couple of people got through but then everyone seemed
to get stuck as if there were bodies in front of the gate
not allowing people to get through the gate.

I think eventually you were conscious that the pressure
was easing? - A. Yes, eventually the pressure seemed to
ease once I was trapped in front of the gate. It was as
if supporters were actually being moved out from behind us.
I was conscious of bodies just lying on my right-hand side.

Did you at some stage see a broken barrier? - A. The only
time I saw the broken barrier was when I was walking back
through the terracing after it had been cleared.   I did
not see the broken barrier whilst I was actually on the
terracing.

But you know now where the broken barrier was? - A. Yes.

Can you help us as to where in fact you were in relation
to that barrier? - A. I imagine that ray back was to that
barrier.

At what stage? - A. At the stage when I was in front of
the gate.

Was that before or after the surges? - A. That was after
the surges.

After the second surge? - A. Yes.

But you were not conscious of a barrier at that time? -
A. No, I shot past the barrier on my way down for the
initial surge and I remember thinking to myself:  "I am
glad I did not hit that" but I was not actually aware
of a barrier breaking.

After the gate had been opened the second time were you
conscious that people were being taken out of there as well?
- A. Well people were being, or the Police were attempting
to drag people out. There were people either side of me
not conscious and people underneath me as well obviously
not conscious so it was a question people could not walk
freely out of the gate as there were bodies in front of
it and those that were conscious were trapped.

Apart from the Tannoy message that you heard at about half-
past-2 did you hear any other messages over the Tannoy at
all? - A. Mot concerning the crowd, no.

Well did you hear other announcements? - A. I heard   /
the team being announced.
                                      D. POSTLEWAITE


So you were able to hear it? - A. Oh yes.

      MR. GOLDSACK:    No questions.

      MR. JACKSON:    No questions.

      MR. MAXWELL:    No questions, sir.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes, Mr. Woodward.


             Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Mr. Postlewaite, when you came into the ground to go to
the terraces, when you came through theturnstile that
would be about what time? - A. That was about quarter-to-2.

Then you went to a position on the terraces which you chose?
- A. That is right, yes.

And the position on the terraces that you took up was in
Pen 3? - A. That is right.

Somewhere to the right-hand side as one stands at the
tunnel entrance? - A. That is correct, yes.

Were you closer to the perimeter fence than awgry from it?
- A. Initially I was nearer the back of the pen.

There came a point before you were moved forward quickly
Whereaboutswere you then? - A. Before I was moved forward
quickly?

Yes, from the position from which you were moved was where?
- A. I was three-quarters of the way back, probably about
half in the centre of the pen itself.

So if anything the barrier which failed would have been
somewhere to the front of you at that time? - A. At that
particular point, yes.




                                /Q. You were not
                             142

                                           D. POSTLEWAITE



Q. You were not able to see the barriers unless you happened
   to be close up by one at that time? - A. That is right.

Q. The crowd in front of you, before you went forward in the
   manner you have described, did it seem to be very dense?
   - A. It appeared to be dense.   I could see no gaps in
   front of me at that time.

Q. HoV. did it compare with the crowd immediately around
   where you were? - A. The crowd was a lot tighter...
   Well, the crowd was tight where I was.    I cannot
   anticipate what the distance between the people was,
   people 30 feet away from me at the front of the fence.

Q. It got tighter towards the front, did it, or can you not
   say? - A. I do not know.   Presumably if there was a
   surge forward and I shot down 20' then there were
   obviously space there.

Q. In that progress that you had, that 20' or so, you did
   not come into contact with any barriers, did you? - A.
   No.

Q. There was nothing to   prevent you going forward that sort
   of distance? - A. As   I say, I shot past the barrier to my
   right hand side and I remember thinking to myself, "I am
   glad I did not hit that on the way down*', but there was
   nothing else.   When I came to a stop I came to a stop
   against somebody.    Now whether they came to a stop
   against a barrier or not, I do not know.

Q. About how far from the fence did you come to stop? - A.
   About 15' away.

Q. Were you aware of any barriers then being between you and
   the fence? - A. I was not aware of that, no.

Q. Could it be that the barrier which failed was one which,
   as it were, was in your path? - A. It may have been
   initially, but when the first surge went forward, it
   slacked off and I was there for about two or three
   minutes moving around horizontally, if you like, rather
   than vertically, so it is possible I could have moved
   vertically and then there would be a clear space between
   me and the perimeter fencing, rather than a barrier,

Q. Then there was a bigger surge, was there? - A. Well, not
   a bigger surge, another surge, which did not slacken off
   as the first one had done.

Q. At the time of the first surge that caused you to go
   forward as you have described occurred, were there any
   players on the field? - A. It was just as the players
                                143

                                              D. POSTLEWAITE


     came out, the first surge.   The second surge occurred a
     couple of minutes after the players had come out.

Q. This would be coming out to start the game? - A. That is
   right.

Q. When the team come out of the tunnel that provides great
   excitement? - A. It does do, yes.

Q. That was at the time that that surge occurred? - A. It
   did, yes.

Q. Up to that time that that surge occurred, were you
   anxious for your safety? - A. Yes.   Before that, at
   about twenty to three, I said to my friend if we wanted
   to get out, because everything was getting tight around
   us and the crowd was jostling and it was obviously over
   populated where we were.   We attempted to get either
   way, horizontally as the terracing is, and we could not
   move either way.

Q.   You say there was a message over the tannoy?    - A. Yes.

Q.   Are     you sure about that? - A. Yes.  There was   a message
     at about half past two asking Liverpool supporters behind
     the Leppings Lane end goal to move forward.

Q.   You remember   that quite clearly? - A. Yes.

Q. Was there anything more to the message than that? - A.
   Not that I can remember.

Q. Did it have any effect upon the people in the pen?   Did
   it seem to cause any movement, or lead to any movement? -
   A. No.  I remember thinking to myself that there was no
   more room to move forward anyway, so presumably if people
   had tried to move forward they couldn t.

Q.   You mentioned the gate opening? - A.   Yes.

Q.   That would be gate 3? - A. I am sorry, I do not know the
     number.

Q.   It was a gate close by you, was it?      To your left or    to
     your right? - A. It was a gate to my   left as I was
     looking at the pitch.

Q. Did you see how it was opened? - A. I did not.   The
   Police certainly did not open it because the Police were
   not actually manning the gate at the time, so presumably
   it was either opened with the force of the bodies against
   the gate or a fan had managed to open the gate from the
   inside.
                                       D. POSTLEWAITE


Is the game started by this time? - A. Yes.

So the time that that gate opened the game was already in
progress? Kick-off had happened? - A. Yes.

There was a point which you may be aware of when
Liverpool almost scored? - A. I did not see the game at
all.    All I saw was Ronny Wheland tossing up through the
fence and the only way I knew the game had kicked off was
by the noise of the crowd.    I did not see a ball being
kicked.

            Cross-Examined by MR. GLASGOW:

Mr. Postlewaite, did you have any difficulty hearing the
tannoy? - A. Not at the time when I heard the message
about supporters to move up in the Leppings Lane end, but
when the teams were announced obviously the noise had
increased and the crowd, and the tannoy was not as clear
then.

Were those the only two things you heard over the tannoy?
- A . No, I heard a message when I went out on the pitch
after I had been pulled out from the crowd.    I cannot
remember what that was.    I heard a message from Kenny
Dalgleish asking supporters to be patient.    I also heard
a message to say the game had been postponed and for
supporters to retain their ticket stubs.

Do you think it is possible that you confused the message
which you think you heard about the Leppings Lane end
with the message that was broadcast about clearing a way
so that the ambulance and services could get in and out?
- A. No, because that happened before while I was still
on the terracing.

I have to suggest to you that you are completely mistaken
about that message.   It may be that you are the only
person who thinks they heard it, nobody else has heard
it. - A. I definitely heard a message asking Liverpool
supporters to move up on the Leppings Lane end of the
ground.

Had you heard any use of the tannoy before that message?
- A. Not that I can recall specifically, no.    Often
during games of such nature they sort of say "Welcome
Liverpool", â'Welcome Nottingham , etc. and things like
that.

This is half an hour before the game? - A. Yes.

During the time you were on the terrace before that
message had there been total silence? - A. No, there was
music, records, being played.

You may not think much of him but there was an
entertainer disc jockey saying things between the
records, announcing birthdays? - A. That is the norm.
That is not something that would standing out.    That
happens at every football match.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Not what you would call
entertainment? - A. No. I mean, entertainment I would
call a band marching on the pitch, or something of that
nature.

      MR. GLASGOW:  It is not what I would call
entertainment either!   I wanted to know whether you had
heard what was being said clearly, rather than the
artistic quality of the content of it. - A. No, no, I
heard it.

You could hear it clearly? - A. Yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When you heard this
announcement and you thought there really wasn*t any room
to move, did you make any comment to your neighbour about
it? - A. Yes, I just said I thought it was crazy, you
know, we cannot move.    As I say, some ten minutes after
that we did attempt to get out of the pen and could not
move.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.

      MR. PHILIPS:   Thomas Kenneth Hilton.

What, amongst themselves or to you? - A. Amongst
themselves.

How were they doing that? - A. They would be like that,
horizontal and then they were be vertical, letting them
through and then come back again, stopping them.

How many people were going through at a time? - A. One
hundred and fifty.

About 150. - A. There were other people running
underneath the horses and that.

Running underneath the horses? - A. Yes.

Could you see what the situation was like on the far side
of the Police horses? - A. I was near the match, I just
wanted to get in.

Could you see if there were a lot of people on the other
side of the horses, on the turnstile side? - A. No, not
really.

Did you have to go through this sort of cordon of Police
horses? - A. Yes.

Where exactly where these Police horses? - A. Just before
the gate.

Would you look at the model there?   Is that about right?
- A. Yes, about there.

Once you had got past those Police horses, what was the
situation like then for you? - A. It was chaotic.   There
were no queues.   Just a lot of people trying to get to
the turnstiles.
           [
           i
Did you see any Police Officers on foot? - A. No.

Did you see any more Officers on horseback? - A. There
was one on a horse just inside the gate.

And beyond him were there any Officers that you saw? - A.
I did not see none.

Did you manage to get to the turnstile? - A. Eventually,
yes.

Can you say when that would be? - A. About ten to three.

Did you have any difficulty going through the turnstile?
- A. No.   I did not even give my ticket up or nothing.
I just went straight through.

There was somebody operating the turnstile, was there? -
A. Yes.

It clicked over for you to go through, did it? - A. Yes.

Did you offer your ticketto that person? - A. Yes.    I
had the two pieces of it.    It had already been ripped
into two and I had to show two in case I did not get in
and I just got pushed through.

Without giving up one half of it? - A. Without giving up
any of it.

When you got through the turnstile on to the other side,
did you make for the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Why did you do that? - A. I just wanted to get into   the
game, get a good position.

Did you know of any other way into the terrace? - A. No.

You had been there the previous year? - A. We were in the
stands the year before, the North Stands.

     over full or there was still room to spare?    A.   It was
     average, like.

Q.    It was average then, was it?                      A.        It was            just like the Kop
     is just before the match.

Q.   Did a nything happen to change that?  A.   My                                    mates    w e re n 't i

Q.   And there were people at one side laug hi ng at those on the
     other?   A.   Well, we were.   We were l au gh in g at our
     mate because, you know, we have a good laugh together
     and we were ski tt in g him.

Q.   You were - what - sorry?                A.      We were s k it ti ng            him.

Q.   What did he do when you skitted                     him?      A.     He was laughing
     back.

Q.    Did he join you?  A.   No.    We had, you know,                                got into
     the middle of the queue by the time he got in.

Q.   You have said in your s t at em en t that you a rr iv ed at the
     ground at 2.40t  is that corr ec t?      A.   I d o n 1t know,
     is it?   I think so.

Q.   It is a statement.   You say that you a rr ived at Shef fi el d
     about 2.30 and you arrived at the ground at 2.40 p.m.
     A.   That would be at the terr ac es at 2.40 -- o ut side the t u r n Â­
     stiles at 2.40.

Q. Do you mean having              gone past the police?                 A.          Yes.

Q.   Then you went off and into the t e rr ac es ?                       A.        Yes.

Q.   Did you have any difficulty                  going down the t un nel?                  A.      No.

Q.   Did the crowd that you saw on the t er ra ce s at that                                  time
     surprise you in any way?     A.   Not really.

Q.   So, having gone into the terrace, you made                          your        way all
     the way along the back?  A.    Yes.

Q.   To get into Pen 2?               A.    Yes.

Q.    And then decided to go back into Pen 3?   A.   Pen 4.   I
     went back to look for my mates and I got pushed into Pen 4.

Q.   In order to get            fEom Pen 2 you had to go t hr ough Pen 3.
     A.  Yes.

Q.   All the way across            and then to Pen 4.               A.        Yes.

Q.   Any p r o b l e m   in doing that?             A.         No, not JEEtlly.

Q.   So is this the sit ua ti o n so far as you were concerned,
     there was access all the way along the back of that
     terrace?   A.   At the back, yes.

Q.        LORD J USTICE TAYLOR:     I am sorry?   A.   At the back,
     you have people st an di ng against the back and you have
     sort of a little gap.      There is a sort of a tyre in it
     and you have a little gap so that you can walk through.

Q.   Where were          you when the k ic k -o f f o c cu rr ed ?            A.       In
     No. 2.

Q.   So you had not yet made ycur way all the way along?
     A.   No.

Q.   There came a point when Live rp oo l nearly scored?
     A.  Well, I didn't know at the time.            I was at the
     tunnel when the crowd were roaring because Live rp oo l
     were on the attack and then, you know, it goes "Ooh"
     and then "Ah", like bec ause he had just miss ed but I
     heard a f te rw ar ds that Bea rd s le y had hit the bar or
     something.

Q.   W h e r e a bo ut s were you when that emot io n - the e x c i te m en t -
     occurred and then the d is a pp o i n t m e n t as he failed?
     A.      At the back of Pen 4.

Q.   Up to that time had you noticed any d i f f ic u lt y                  amongst
     the parts of the crowd that you were in?          A.                     No.

Q. Any e m b a r r a s s m e n t   or d istres s amongst the peop le              that
   you were in with?                 A.    No.

Q.   And it is imp or ta nt to bear in mind, is it, that your
     e x p er ie nc e relates to the back of the t e rr ac e? A.                         Yes.

Q.    Were you c o n s ci ou s of any surg es coming down thro ug h?
     A.    Only the one I was taken in with.

Q.   That is when y o u a n& ve d at the terr ac e?                  A.     No.    4.

Q.    And was that at the time of the "Ooh" and the "Ah", the
     disappointment?     A.   I think e v er yo ne w an te d to see what
     was going on and they just ran in, like.

Q.   Did there come a time when you real is ed that s o m e th i ng awful
     had hap pe ne d? A.      Only when I clim be d over the fence
     and saw a few p e o p l e lying on the pitch inside the six yards
     area.

                           Cross-examined         by MR.   GLASGOW;

Q. Mr. Hilton, just this, when y o u^ ca me down the tunnel and
   entered the terrace for the first time, you vere in a
   small g r o up ,w er e you? A. I was on my own.

Q.   Oryour own?            A.     Yes.

Q.   And because you were on your own you had no d i ff i c u l t y in
     finding your way along the space at the back, through the
     gateway right t hrough to Pen 2?   A.   No, sir.

Q.   But after you had done that s u cc e s s f u l l y onyour own,
     when you came back to look for your friends and found
     y ou rs e l f in the e ntrance to the tunnel a g a i n r     A.                      Yes.

Q.   You were met by a wall               of people all coming            down together.
     A.   Yes.

Q. And people coming down in that group who g a th er ed                          you
   up with them and carried you into the p e n        A.                            Yes.

                    Q.   Neither you nor any of them had the time to spread along
                         the back.   That was the d if fe r en c e between the two entrances,
                         was it not?   A.   Yes.

                                                Re-ex a mi n ed     by MR.       COLLINS;

                    Q.   I think it follows from what you told us that even
                         after the kick-off, people were still coming down the
                         tunnel?   A.   Yes.

                    Q.   When the roar h appened when the cros s- ba r was hit,
                         were people still coming down the tunnel, as far as you
                         can tell?   A.Yes.    One of my m ates said he had gone in
                         at ten past three after the game had stopped and he
                         got told not to go down there because it was chaotic
                         but he went down anyway.

                    Q.   Told by whom?    By the police or by s om e on e else?
                         A.   Just by s omebody else.   He said, "Don't go down there,
                         it is chaotic" but he just went down anyway and he said
                         people were still coming in then, so

                               LORD JUSTICE          TAYLOR;            Thank you,       Mr.   Hilton.

                               MR. COLLINS:   Sir, if y ou ^w a nt e d we could ask one
                         w itness one matter.    Mr. Bell.       We propose to ask him
                         one matter.

                               LORD JUSTICE          TAYLOR;       Is he from Live rp oo l?

                               MR.   C O L L IN S:     Yes.

                              LORD JUSTICE           TAYLOR:        Let us not bring him back
                         again.

                                                     NICHOL AS BELL,            called

                                                 E x a m i n ed   by MR.       GOLDSACK:

                    Q.   Nicholas Bell,        is it?         A.        Yes.

                    Q. As well as coming to the match this year, have you been
                       to H il l s b o r o u g h before? A. Yes, on three other
                       occasions.

                    Q. Did you come to the Semi -F i na l                 last year?           A.        No.

                    Q.   So you have been on three other o cc as i on s ?                           A.    Yes.

                    Q.   Have you been into t h eL e pp i ng s Lane terr ac e on those
                         o cca si on s? A. Yes, all of them.

                    Q.   What a r ra ng em en t was made on those o c ca si on s for you to
                         go into the t errace?        A.   They had opened one pen and
                         the Police, when that is full, they, like, direct you
                                      156


                                                   N.    BELL.



     into another one, and so on, all the way along,                    so you
     w ould not get crushed, kind of thing.

Q.   On the o ccasions that you have been,                had you gone in
     through the tunnel?    A.   Yes.

Q.   On each occa si on ?      A.     Yes.

Q.    And where had the police been so that they could direct
     you?      A.   Ihey had been, like, s e c t io n in g off
     dif fe re nt pens, telling you to go to that one or this one.

Q.    Was it just the Police doing that or were there also
     s t ewards?  A.  There were stewa rd s as well.

Q.   So a joint e xercise      between      the two of them?           A. Yes.

Q.   And had that h appened on each of the three o cc a si o ns that
     you had been?    A.   Yes.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE    TAYLOR:   Were any of those              big match
     o cca si on s? A.      Just League games.

           LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR:         Yes,   any    questions?

             MR. WOODWARD:          Sir,   I am not in a p os it io n to
     c ro ss - e x a m i n e on that.    This s t at em en t was only received --

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I do not want you to be in
     d i f f i c ul ti es about it, Mr. Woodward, I was only trying
     to save this wi tn es s having to come back.        If you W a n t          him
     to come back when you have had a chance to ---

          MR. WOODWARD:    If we want him to come back,                   sir,
     could we ask for him?

           LORD J USTICE    TAYLOR:     Mr.    Glas go w?        The same?

          MR. GLASGOW:   No, sir, I think I would                   like to
     save him the trouble, if necessary.

                       Cross-examined        by MR.      GLASGOW:

Q. Mr. Bell, do you happen to know w he th er the stew ar ds who
   helped police the t erraces when the Live rp oo l fans came
   were L iverpool ste wa r ds ? A. I am not sure.

Q.   You do know, do you not,         that L iverpool s t ew ar ds       tend
     to travel with Liv er po ol      fans?    A.   Yes.

Depending at which end of the ground the Liverpool fans
are, the stewards, the whole reason for travelling with
them, is to go with the fans who know them? ~ A. Yes.

And they are usually deployed on terraces rather than in
stands? - A. Yes, I have seen them at other grounds when
I have been to other grounds.   I have seen Liverpool
stewards there but I am not sure if they were Liverpool
stewards when I went to Sheffield, and on three other
occasions.

I am sure you would accept that it is much easier for a
Liverpool steward to organise Liverpool fans than it is
for a steward from a strange club to do it? - A. Yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you very much.    You
are free to go although there is just a chance you might
be asked to come back, but I hope not.

      MR. COLLINS:   Sir, I am not asking for him to be
called.   I am just informing you that there is one other
witness whom we did have, Mr. Westergreen.   All Counsel
have seen his statement.   In the light of the evidence
we have already heard I do not think there is anything
new he would be able to add to the totality of the
evidence we have heard.   Therefore, I would not propose
to trouble him to come back tomorrow unless, of course,
anyone who has been served with his statement would wish
that to happen then I will see whether we can arrange to
do so, but I would not have thought it was necessary to
trouble him.

      S. M. WESTERGREEN:   I am that person.   There was
a gate that was open and it has not been mentioned at
all.

      MR. COLLINS:   In that case I will make
arrangements if necessary.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If that is all he wants to
say, let him come and say it now.   I would like to be as
helpful to witnesses travelling as possible.

               S. M. WESTERGREEN Called

               Examined by MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Westergreen, you had a stand ticket I think? - A.
Yes, the North Stand.

The gate you are referring to is gate A, the one right on
the very left hand side? - A. That is right.   The
concertina gate.

                                                    S. M. WESTERGREEN


             Q. That was a gate you managed to go through? - A. Yes.

             Q. In fact there has been an indication that that gate was
                opened, but that was the gate that you were able to get
                in and get to your place in the stand? - A. That is
                right, with no-one checking tickets.

             Q. What time did you arrive? - A. We arrived at those gates
                at about seven or eight minutes to three.

             Q. Was there a crowd outside them then or not? - A. The bulk
                of the crowd was in front of us then, but there were
                still people coming from behind us.   When we saw how
                busy it was there we looked to the left and that gate was
                open and an awful lot of people went through that gate on
                the left.

             Q. You joined them? - A. Yes.

                             Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD;

             Q. You were very late getting to the ground? - A. Yes.

             Q. Had you called at a public house on the way? - A. Yes, we
                called quite early at a public house, quite a few miles
                outside Sheffield, for a meal and a drink as we did the
                year before.

             Q. Was that the same time you had arrived the year before? -
                A. Yes, about ten minutes to three.

             Q.    It was your habit to arrive at that sort of time? - A.
                  Yes, the year before on the approach to Leppings Lane
                  there were Police across the street that year and making
                  sure we had tickets before we could go any further.
                  This year there was none of that.

             Q. Right across the street? - A. Yes, there were like silver
                railings spread out across the street.

             Q. Across the pavement? - A. Across the pavement and they
                had one scattered across the road.

             Q.   Across the highway? - A. Yes.

             Q.   Where were the fans walking? -A. They were walking
                  towards the Leppings Lane.

             Q. Whereabouts was this in relation to the entrance?    How
                far up Leppings Lane? - A. No, it was coming down this
                way.   There is a garage on the corner and as you are
                heading towards the ground there were Police across the
                road with the odd railings, checking tickets and you
                could not go any further without a ticket.
                                   S. M. WESTERGREEN


There were railings across the road? - A. Yes, they had
metal - square metal...

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Temporary barriers? - A.
Yes.

      MR. WOODWARD:   You have got a clear recollection
of that? - A. Well, we passed comment on it because in
1988 we had to produce a ticket before we went any
further.

There were railings across the road? - A. Yes, there was
the odd railing and during the gaps in the temporary
barriers there were Police there checking tickets.

Not a continuous fence, but there was...

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Have you got that book,
South Yorkshire Police 1?   The sort of things you see on
6A? - A. Yes, that sort of thing.

      MR. WOODWARD:   Just describe what you saw.   Those
sort of railings extending across the pavement with gaps
in them, right across to the other side of the road? - A.
In 1988 there were quite a few of them scattered across
the road and there were Police...

Right across? - A. We made for one of those gaps
obviously, where it was manned by Police Officers, and we
had to take our ticket out of our pockets and show those
tickets and we could not go any further.   We are talking
now about probably 100 yards from the gates.    That was
the main difference we noticed this year.    We said, MGod
bless us, there is no-one checking the tickets this
year91.

I suggest you are mistaken about that? - A. No.

             Cross-Examined by MR. GLASGOW:

Mr. Westergreen, you had stand tickets? - A. Yes, for the
North Stand.

When you got to the stand you found that there were two
Police Officers at the steps, two stewards and a Police
Woman, do you remember that? - A. That was in the stand,
the actual stand itself when we got through the open
gate, yes.

You see, Mr. Westergreen, it has been suggested both
against the Police and against the stewards, that all
that is required is somebody giving directions in the
ground, but what you saw on the entrance to that stand
was two male Police Officers and one female Police
                                  S. M. WESTERGREEN


Officer and two stewards on one entrance? - A. The two
stewards were at the top of the stairs, actually inside
the stand.   Totally there was probably about four people
there on a two and a half, three foot, entrance.

Despite that did you see fans forcing their way through
and under the Police Officers* extended arms? - A. Yes,
that was in the stand because the game just at that
second as we got to the top of those stairs going into
the stand, the game just kicked off.

It may have been the game had just kicked off, but I want
it absolutely clear, despite a Police Officer standing
with extended arms in the presence of two other Police
Officers and two stewards, you saw a number of fans... -
A. The two stewards were looking at the pitch.   They
were actually inside the stand so they were not trying to
stop anybody getting in.   The Police, they did, they
were trying to stop...

The Police had extended arms? - A. Yes, the Police lady
was trying to stop someone getting in.

The fans were pushing their way underneath the arms and
past her? - A. Yes.

      MR. GLASGOW:   Thank you very much.

             Re-Examined by MR. COLLINS:

Do you know whether those fans were stand ticket holders
or not? - A. I would not know.   I certainly had a stand
ticket intact.

Were you one of those who had to get past the
Policewoman? - A. As we got to the top of the stair she
sort of put her arms across. I do not know why, but she
tried to stop everyone.   I certainly had a valid ticket
and when she saw that she let me go past her.

So you at least were one she tried to stop although you
had a ticket? - A. Yes.

      MR. COLLINS:   Yes, thank you.   Sir, may I say in
the light of what Mr. Glasgow then said it certainly is
not a suggestion from this side that all that was
necessary were directions from Officers and stewards.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Right.   Well, ten o âclock
tomorrow.

                    THIRD DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                   WEDNESDAY. 17TH MAY, 1989

                        (Morning Session)


           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Before we start this morning,
     Mr. Goldsack, I want to say a word to the Press.

           I have noticed the last two days some reportage of
     this Inquiry which is unsatisfactory in two respects.
     I am not going to name any particular newspapers, but
     more than one highly reputable newspaper has inaccurately
     reported and inaccurately headlined evidence which was
     actually given in this Inquiry.
            Now you are skilled reporters and your duty is to
      report accurately what goes on here, not to slant it but
      to report what is said.
            The other aspect is this:  again a highly reputable
      newspaper has taken advantage of the facility which the
      Inquiry has offered to the Press namely by using the
      statements of the witnesses which are being provided as
      they come into the witness box, but instead of using
      them for the purpose which they were intended, they are
      lazily being used as the evidence of the witness whether
      he says what is in the statement or not.

            Now the object of providing the statements was to
      assist the Press to know in advance what the witness
      was expected to say and to be able to check and adjust
      according to what the witness actually said when he came
      into the witness box.
            It is not satisfactory to find in the newspaper
      when a witness has failed to say some things that may
      have been in his statement that it is reported that he
      said them.
            Now if this is going to continue I am going to
      withdraw the facility of providing the statements to the
      Press and you will actually have uo listen to what is
      said in Court with a rather closer ear, but I would like
      to continue the facility because I hope it is a helpful
      one but it should not be abused.

            Now I hope a note will be taken of what I have said
      and I shall watch the Press with interest.  Thank you.


                           MARK HUGHES Called
                       Examined by MR. GOLDSACK:

    Q. Are you Mark Ian Hughes? - A. Yes.

                                                   M.I. HUGHES


           Q. 19 years of age? - A. Yes.

           Q.   And a hairdresser by occupation? - A. Yes.

           Q.   Mr. Hughes, you came to Sheffield for the match on     the 15th
                of April.

           Q.   Did you have a ticket? - A. Yes.

           Q.   For what part of the ground? - A. For the   Leppings   Lane,
                standing. It was B and Section 3.

           Q. Where had you    purchased that ticket?-A. It was a friend
              of a client who had a season ticket.   He passed it on.

           Q.   What was the face value of that ticket? - A. It should have
                been Â£6.

           Q. And how much did you pay for it? - A.. Â£30.

           Q. I think you came in your own car with some friends?       - A. Yes.

           Q. Did all the friends in your car have tickets? - A. I think
              there was one that did not have a ticket but he was looking
              for a ticket before the game.

           Q. What made him think he would be able to find a ticket when
              he got here? - A. It was just common knowledge that there
              is always tickets there, like last year or any Wembley game
              or any big game there is always tickets with the touts
              outside.

           Q. What time did you arrive near to the Leppings Lane entrance?
              - A. Probably about quarter-past-2, round there, 20-past.

           Q. Do you know what happened toyour friend who needed a ticket?
              - a . Well what we did we all split up and a few of the others
              were going to look for a ticket for him and then the rest
              of us who had tickets, you know we were just going to go
              into our own bits because we were all spread out over the
              ground.

           Q. Did you meet up with those friends again before the match?
              - A. No.

           Q. What was the situation outside the Leppings Lane end when
              you arrived? - A. It was not really that bad. The queues
              at the gates were only about six deep. There was some
              Policemen on horses telling people to move on if they did
              not have a ticket and not block the entrance or to go in
              if you did have a ticket. That went on for abfeut ten
              minutes and then I don't know what happened then to the
              Policemen because everyone just sort of walked around then
              but that is when I went in.

           Q. What happened to you at the turnstiles? - A. I went in.

                                              M.I. HUGHES


             It was about six deep.  I went in. Just as I got through
             there was someone to, I can't remember whether it was a
             Policeman, yes it was a Policeman, to body search and check
             we had nothing with us.

        Q. That is on the inside of the turnstile? - A. Just inside
           the turnstile, yes.

        Q. Had you seen or heard anything outside the turnstiles
           whilst waiting to go in as to whether there were many
           people without tickets? - A. Yes, there was a lot of people
           shouting:  "Has anyone got any spares or any swaps".

        Q. Did you see any evidence of people standing selling tickets?
           - A. Just one or two with single. I mean if you go to
           Wembley you quite often see people with bunches of 30 or 40
           tickets where here I saw people with one or two tickets to
           sell*

        Q.   Once you had got inside theground whereaboutsdid you go?
             - A. Well the minute I went in I just saw this tunnel to
             get into the ground so I just went down there, I took it
             you went down there.

        Q. Had you been to Hillsborough before? - A. Never.

        Q.   Between the turnstiles and the entrance to the tunnel was
             it busy when you went in? - A. Not that busy. There was
             a few people walking around but most people were making
             their way through the tunnel then.

        Q. Apart from the Policeman immediately behind the turnstiles
           who searched you, did you see other Policemen in that
           area? - A. No.

        Q. Did you see any stewards? - A. I think there was one or two
           just walking around but not directing people anywhere.

        Q. What about at the entrance to the tunnel, any stewards
           there? - A. I can't quite remember. I would not like to
           say for definite.

        Q. So you went through the tunnel did you on to the terraced
           area? - A. Yes.

        Q. Help us with the time? - A. About 20-past, 25-past by then,
           about five minutes after I got there.

        Q. Once you got on to the terrace which part did you go to?
           - A. Well I went through the tunnel and all I did was
           walk forward about two yards and stayed there in the top
           left-hand corner of Pen 3.

        Q. Now at that stage how full would you describe Pen 3? -
           A. It was probably about half to three-quarters full.

        Q. Did it quickly fill up after you were there? - A. From
           half-past onwards.  It was just gradually filling up really.
*




    Q. At what stage #id you consider it was full? - A. At about
       quarterHto, lfNtQ-3.

    Q. Are you used to standing on terraces? ~ A. Well not since,
       I went to the Heysel Stadium and stood there and since
       then I have never stood at a game again, I have sat down,
       but that was the only ticket I could get. Before that I
       have stood on '-terraces since I -was about seven. â 




                                       /Q. At what stage
                                        M. I. HUGHES



At what stage did it become uncomfortably full? - A.
Around five to, I would say.

How did you become aware of that?   Was it just a gradual
build-up, or something specific? - A. It was a gradual
build-up and sort of every few seconds you were going
down another step in the terrace towards the front.

Had you been talking to people in the crowd while
waiting? - A. Yes, there were about ten altogether.

Had there been any conversation with any of those people
about tickets? - A. Yes.    There was a boy with blond
hair.    I had never met him before and I do not know who
he is.    He said he just went up to the gate and said he
had lost his ticket and the fellow just let him in.    I
spoke to a couple, a boy and a girl.    They had tickets
for the Nottingham Forest end and they just went to the
gate and said they were Liverpool supporters and they had
tickets for the wrong game could they come in and they
were let in and the other people were nothing to do with
tickets.

By about five to three had your position in the pen
changed? - A. Yes.    I was probably about two yards from
the front by then.I had gone right      down the terrace to
the front of the...

Had that been a voluntary movement? - A. No, not at all.

Where did you end up   at about the time the players came
on to the pitch? - A.   About a yard, a yard and a half
from the front, behind the goal.

A yard back from the perimeter fence? - A. From the
perimeter fence, yes.

Were you in fact able to see the pitch? - A. No.

Why was that? - A. It was that packed.   I am only
5' 7", so I am not that tall as well.   I could not see a
thing because there were people all around, you were
squashed in and you just could not see a thing.

What were your thoughts at that stage about what you
hoped was going to happen? - A. One or two people had
clambered out and were starting to pull people out around
three o'clock-ish, just after three.   Hopefully I was
hoping I could get hold of someone's hands as they were
lifted down.   However, I gave up.   I knew that would
not happen because I could not reach anyone.   At that
time I thought I was going to die and that was it.    I
relaxed then and thought I would take it as it comes.

                                             M. I. HUGHES


Q J Could you see signs about you of other people in distress
     by that stage? - A. Everyone was in distress.   Everybody
   I was screaming.   There were a few Police people walking
   | in front of the perimeter fence and they were screaming
     to open the gate which was about ten yards to my right,
   | nothing came of that.   One thing I did see was that
     people were climbing over and they were getting told to
     get back in.

Q. By whom? - A. By the Police, and not to climb out on to
   the pitch, but they were screaming and saying they wanted
   to get on to the pitch because it was too packed and they
   had to get people out.

Q. You say the perimeter gate was about 10 yards to your
   right? - A. Yes.

Q. Could you actually see it? - A. Yes.

Q. Did anything happen to that gate at about five to three,
   three o'clock? - A. No, people were just pulling it and
   trying to open it and shouting but nothing happened.

Q. Did you at any stage see that gate open? - A. No.   I am
   sorry, I saw it later on open when people were getting
   out later, but that was about ten minutes later,
   probably.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You did not see it actually
     open? - A. It not getting open, no.

Q.         MR. GOLDSACK:    Do you know for how long you were
     in the position you have just described? - A. Well, I had
     fifteen minutes, say, where I did not know what happened.
     I knew I was knocked out because someone fell off on top
     of me and I went down into the crowd and people fell on
     top of me and I felt myself go.    The next thing I knew
     was that I had woken up and it was a lot easier inside
     the ground.    I looked behind me and there was a space
     there.    I think someone pulled me out because there were
     people all over me.    I would imagine it was probably
     about fifteen minutes which I cannot account for because
     I was knocked out.

Q. Although you obviously cannot say for how long you were
   out, you were in the same position when you came round? -
   A. Yes, on the floor.

Q. Still about a yard back? - A. Yes, from the fencing.

Q. You say by that stage the crowd had eased somewhat? - A.
   Yes.

                                          M. I. HUGHES


Q. What did you then do? - A. Well, I made my way to stagger
   to the back of the terrace.    This was probably about
   twenty to twenty-five past three and there was room to
   get in between people and make your way to the back.   I
   got to where the tunnel was and I felt myself going
   again.   There were a few fans with me and I felt my head
   going and I fainted again.   A Policeman took me out
   through the tunnel, but I was really dazed, and then the
   next minute I went.   I woke up outside by where the
   ambulances were by a big gate.    I woke up there.

Q. As you made your way back up the terrace after you came
   round the first time, were you conscious of any Policemen
   within the terrace? - A. No.

Q. Any stewards? - A. No.

Q. Any first aid personnel?   - A. No.

Q. The Policeman who helped you when you fainted the second
   time, do you know where he came from? - A. He came from
   outside.   He was walking towards me through the tunnel.

Q. Through the tunnel from the outside? - A. From the
   outside.   He met me near the entrance.

Q. Where did you come round the second time, by the main
   gate? - A. There was a gate open with ambulances outside.

Q. What did you then do? - A. Well, the Policeman put me
   down and he said, "Put your head in between your legs and
   wait here and there will be an ambulance totake  you off
   to hospital soonâ , but I wanted to 'phone my mum so I
   walked off to try and find a 'phone.

Q. Did you in fact find yourself walking around the ground?
   - A. Yes.

Q. On the inside? - A. On the inside.   I walked round to
   the side.   That is when I discovered there were such a
   thing as an entrance to a side section because I walked
   round the side of the ground and up the steps and back on
   to the terrace, the right hand side section.   I walked
   down and around the ground, passed various suites, maybe
   the Executive Suites.   I asked there for the 'phone but
   they said they did not have one in the ground so I walked
   down towards the Nottingham Forest end.

Q. At about ten or five to three when the pressure had been
   building up, had you either made any efforts or thought
   to try and move your position? - A. You could not move
   anything.   The only thing I managed to move was an arm,
   to put an arm up to try and grab someone, which was in
   vain, but you could not move anywhere.

Had you at any stage between going in to the terrace and
the pressure getting too great thought of moving to
another part of the ground? - A. I thought of moving to
the side sections.   I thought it was a bit that maybe
was empty to segregate the crowd or something, because
you could not see anyone in there.  I thought maybe if I
could get in there, but I just did not know where to go
because the tunnel seemed the only way to get in.

Did you know at any stage there were fences running from
the front to the back of the terrace as well as along the
front? - A. Yes.   When I first went in I was in the
right hand section in the middle and I could see this
section with other fans in the middle.

Did you at any stage realise that right at the back of
the terrace there were gateways through to the other
pens? - A. No.


I think eventually you went to the home of a local person
and used the 'phone there? - A. Yes.

Eventually your parents came across later that evening to
take you back home? - A. Yes.

Mr. Hughes, what was your view about the way the tickets
were dealt with at the match? - A. I think with the
average attendance at Liverpool we should have had a lot
more tickets.   This is something that has been said for
a number of years now, not just for this, for Wembley,
for everything because we get such a big crowd every week
and obviously everyone wants to go to the game.    Another
thing, the tickets should have been distributed as
quickly as they could.   It was obviously going to be a
sell-out and maybe then they could have had it live on
television and say that if you had not got a ticket do
not go anywhere near because it is live on the box.

You have mentioned about tickets being available outside
big matches, what is your view of that? - A. I think if
ticket touts - I think if it was made as illegal as
drugs, sort of thing, then people are not going to travel
down if they do not expect there to be ticket touts.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    If it was made as illegal as
drugs, you say? - A. Yes.    So there is no way if you get
caught selling tickets.    I know every year at Wembley
whenever we are there, which is most years, we see people
with wads of tickets and the Police must see them.
Someone must see them every year with that many tickets
and it is wrong.   They are selling them for four and
five times the price.   Even for this Wembley game now we
have been offered tickets for Â£200 each and everything.

It's terrible.   I think if it was not for that people
would not go to the match without a ticket because if you
have not got a ticket you cannot get in and you cannot
buy one outside then.

      MR. GOLDSAGK:   Thank you very much.

                     C ro ss -e x a m i n e d   by MR.    WOOD WA RD

Q. Mr.   Hughes,   you arrived at about 2.15,                     is that right?
   A.     Yes.

Q.   The question of tickets, was it your e xp er i en c e on this
     day at the match in question that there were a c o n s i d e ra b le
     number of people who had turned up hoping to buy tickets?
     A.   Yes.

Q,   And is it right that those people were to be e n co un te re d
     on all appr oa ch es to the ground, on all parts of your
     approach to the ground?      A.   Yes.

Q.   There were people everywhere,               e n qu ir in g    for and asking
     for tickets?   A.   Yes.

Q. And that included the s i tu at io n right up to the t u r ns t il e s?
   A.     Yes.    In fact, as I was just ^bgut' to go into a
   t u rnstile s omeo ne asked me if I w anted to swop to sit
   down.

Q.So there were people seeking to n e go ti at e t ic kets or for
   tickets right up to the actual entr an ce to the indi vi du al
   t u r ns ti le s? A. Yes, even on the m ot or wa y when the
   t raffic came to a stop there was people h an gi ng out of
   the cars asking for tickets.

Q. Did you get any impr es si on or i n di ca ti on of people trying
   to even negotiate, not n ec es s ar i ly succ es sf ul ly , with the
   t urnstile o p e ra to rs ? A. I didn't see any.

Q. O ffering money, hoping to be allowed in and being turned
   away?    A.   No, I didn' t see a n yt hi ng of that.

Q. Does that happen in your e x p er i en c e? A. Well, I have
   never seen it but I have heard it a lot - I mean, "Walk
   up and offer the man a tenner and he will let you in."

Q.   Youeare not s u gg es ti ng you saw that on this day?
     A.   No, I didn't see it.

Q. And also people turning up with stories, to put it no
   higher than that, to the t u rn st il e attendants. A. Yes,
   well, as I say, the guy who I spoke to inside, he said
   he just went to the gate and sort of started saying,
   "Oh no, I've lost my ticket" and things like that and
   he just said, "Oh come in, don't w orry about it."

Q. And the t urning away of those people in i t se lf leads
   to problems, does it not, b e ca us e they are going the
   o pposi te way to the leg it i ma t e fans, to the ones with
   tickets?     A.   Yes, but, I mean, if ther e' s orderly
                                        11


                                                      M.    HUGHES



     queues, then there should be ---   You know, in between
     the queues there is always room for people to make
     their way back.

Q.   Had you been to H i l l s b or o ug h     before?       A.     Never.

Q.   You got inside and through the turnstiles in r ea so n ab l e
     form.   A.   Yes.

Q. Without difficulty.             A.        No.

Q. And it seemed         to be in an orderly manner               at that time,
   did it?   A.           Yes.

Q.   You had no c r i ti ci sm of what was h a pp en in g on your appr oa ch
     to go through the t u rn st il es ?  A.      Not for the ---
     There was an orderly queue but once I got in I didn't
     know where to go, apart from there was a tunnel, so I
     j u s t ---

Q.   Yes, you felt a bit lost once you got inside.
     A.  Completely, yes.

Q. But cer ta in ly       your o b se r va t io n   is that it all seemed     to
   be r e a so na bl y      well ordered.           A. Yes.

Q.   You went into a position, having got through the tunnel,
     which you cons id er ed to be a good spot to watch the
     game from?   A.      Yes.

Q. And the sit ua ti on changed w hilst             you were on the terrace.
   A . Yes.

Q. Did there come a time when you were w a nt in g to get out?
   A . Yes.

Q. When was that?   A.   Proba bl y b et ween about twenty to
   and five to.     At first I thought of going -- maki ng my
   way back but with the amount of people behi nd you it
   would have taken you forever, sort of thing.         It was
   really, you know, quite busy and then e ve nt u al l y I wanted
   to get on to the pitch but I just coul dn 't reach anyone
   at the front to pull me over.

Q.   You said that about five to three the p o si ti on or the
     sit ua t io n seemed to change? A. Well, that's the
     stage where it got to the point where I thought, "This
     is it, I'm not going to be able to get out at all."

Q.   The gate you were near to, would that be Sate No. 3,
     the gate you are t alking about?  A.   The gate at the
     front.

Q.   The perineter gate?         A.      I wo u ld n 't    know.

                                                     H.   HUGHES



Q.   Which pen were    you in?       A.      I was in Pen 3.

Q.   On the r i gh t- ha nd side?     A.      Yes.

Q. Are you saying you never saw that gate open?     A. I
   saw it open later, you know, about five or ten minutes
   later but I didn't see it actu al ly being opened.

Q.   You see, it was c e r ta in ly opened very shor tl y after the
     kick-off.  A.   Yes.

Q.   Was it not?    Did you know that?     A.   No.  Well, I
     p robably looked -    I mean, five to I said it was getting
     quite packed so pro ba bl y about five past I saw it open
     but I didn't see it being opened, so it could have been
     opened any time in between.

Q.   So there came a point c e r t a in l y by five past three when
     you looked and you saw that that gate was a ct u al l y open?
     A.   Yes.

                        R e -e x am i ne d by MR.   COLLINS;

Q. Mr. Hughes, I unde rs ta n d that you arrived at about twenty
   past two, is that correct - that is outside the ground?
   A.   Outside the ground, yes.

Q. Did I unde rs ta nd you to say that at that stage there was
   a pol ic em an on a horse turn in g away people, or getting
   people to move on, who did not have t ic ke ts ?           A.       Yes.
   There was two p o l i ce me n on horses and this a r r a n g e me n t went
   on for about ten m inutes w here he said, "If you have got
   a ticket^ make your way inside" and before you a ct u al l y go
   through the tur ns ti le entrance, there are gates which
   were a ctually open there.

Q.   Perimeter gates.   A.   And he just said, "Don't block
     the gates.   If you haven 't got a ticket, move on" but
     then we hung around for ten m in utes trying to find
     a ticket for this other guy and then we split up.    By
     the time I walked past the gate again, there was no-one
     there then.

Q.   It was not a question then of looking or c he c ki n g people,
     it was simply saying to people, "If you h av en't got tick et s               "
     A.     Oh no.  They were just saying, "Don't block the
     e n trance if you haven' t got tickets", basically, yes.

           LORD JUSTICE    TAYLOR:        Thank you veiy much,     Mr.   Hughes.

     arrived at the ground? - A. About quarter-past-1.

Q. Quarter-past-1? - A. To the ground itself.

Q.        MR. PHILIPS:   You are not very sure, are you, when you
     got there? - A. We parked the car, sat on the wall for about
     10 minutes, and then just walked to the ground slowly. My

     no problems.

Q. Did they seem to have any difficulty at all at that stage? -
   A. No, none whatsoever.

   No.

Q.   Did you see any at the turnstile? - A. No.

Q.   Who was manning the turnstile? - A. The Policemen at     the
     front. They were searching people.

Q.   Did you find your proper entrance into the ground?     - A.
     Exactly, yes.

Q.   Did you have any trouble doing that? - A. No.

Q.   Did you go through a turnstile? - A. Yes.

Q. And once you got inside the ground were there any people
   there? - A. People just milling around and going into the
   toilet at the side or going straight through or buying a
   programme.

Q. Can you give us any clue as to what time it would be when you
   passed through the turnstile? - A. I would say about half-
   past-2.

Q.   About half-past-2? Where did you go to when you      had gone
     through the turnstile? - A. I bought a programme     and I went to
     the toilet and I went into the ground.

Q. Did you know your way around the ground? - A. Not that part,
   no.

Q. Had you been to Sheffield Wednesday ground before? - A. I was
   there the year before.

Q. You had been the year before? - A. Yes.

Q. Where had you gone the year before? - A. I was in the stands
   behind the enclosure.

Q. The West Stand you mean above the terraces? - A. Yes.

Q./So you would have gone up one of the sets of stairs at the
   side of the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. This time you were going on to the terrace, were you? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Did you know of any way round the back? - A. no.

Q. Were you able to pick a position on the terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. Where did you go? - A. I went right behind the goal in the
   middle.

Q. In which pen did you go. Did you go the right-hand side or
   the left-hand side as you got out of the tunnel? - A. Straight
   in front of me.

                                                   D. HUGHES



Q. Yes, straight in front of you as you come out of the tunnel
   there is a fence. Now you have either to go to the right or
   the left of that fence? - A. To theright.

Q.   So you went into pen 3? - A. Yes.

Q. And you stood close to that dividing fence, did you? - A. I
   think so.  I can't remember.

Q.   Did you get close to the front of the pen? - A. Yes.

Q.   How close to the front of the pen? - A. This is behind the
     goal, you mean?

Q.   Yes. - A. Yes, right in the middle.      I would say about 10 feet
     from the actual wall to the fence.

Q. Ten feet from the perimeter fence? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were you near to a barrier? - A. I was right in front of the
     barrier, and a gap appeared, and there were two girls in front
     of it, and I said, "Excuse me", and I went underneath and got
     in front of the barrier.

Q. Were there any barriers between you and the one immediately
   behind you? - A. No.

Q. I am sorry, between the one immediately behind you and the
   perimeter fence? - A. Only the one that I had just gone
   underneath.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        You had your back to the front
     barrier? - A. Exactly.

Q.       MR. PHILIPS:    Were there many people in the terrace at
     that time? - A. Yes, it was building up gradually.

Q. Did you see people playing about in the terrace? - A. I did,
   yes.

Q. Did you notice anything particular? - A. There was one guy who
   was about 15 feet away from me, he had a big balloon and he
   was standing on one of the barriers and a friend holding him,
   and he was just passing the balloon around, and everyone was
   just knocking it around.

Q. And there was enough room for people to do that at that time?
   - A. Yes.  It was quite amazing, because the balloon went from
   one part to another part to another section, and eventually
   ended up with the guy who threw it in the first place.

Q. Did things alter after that? - A. Yes, it gradually built up.

Q. Gradually? - A. Yes.

Q. You did not notice any particular incident of building up?         It
                              18

                                                 D. HUGHES


     was a gradual process? - A. Yes, except the last surge.

Q. Yes. We will come to that. You remember the players coming
   out on to the pitch? - A. For the kick-about, yes.

Q. When would that be? - A. Within 5 or 6 minutes of me going
   into the ground.

Q. How long were they on the pitch? - A. About 5 minutes.

Qii At that stage was the terrace getting uncomfortably
    overcrowded? - A. No. I was looking around. In fact, I was
    looking for my friend, Richie, who was only a small fellow,
    and he went to the - he disappeared from me. So I was looking
    around for him.

Q. Were you worried about him at that stage? - A. No.

Q. Did the players go off the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q. After they had kicked about for a while? - A. Yes.

Q. What was happening then? - A. It was getting more squashed and
   squashed, and the two girls that were behind me, I was asking
   them how they were.  They said they were all right.

Q. Were they on the other side of    the barrier from you? -A. They
   were right in front of it with    me, yes, right by me.

Q.]I see. Yes. What did happen then? - A. All I remember is the
  Iplayers coming on to the pitch and then it was just an
  (almighty rush and I was just literally pinned.

Q. So as the players came on to the pitch the second time? - A.
   Yes.

Q. That is when this final surge came? - A. An almighty surge
   came, yes.

Q. What happened to you then? - A. I was just crushed completely.
   I could not move.

Q. You had a barrier immediately behind you, had not you? - A.
   Yes.

Q.   Was that still the case? -A. All I heard was an almighty like
     "whoosh", and the wind was taken out of people. That is all I
     remember.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Could I understand. Until that
     surge you had not felt any real discomfort? - A. No.

Q.        MR. PHILIPS:   Did you see anything of what was happening
     on the pitch? - A. No, not after that point.

Q. What happened to you when that surge came? - A. I was just
   literally pinned in and I was just looking around, "What's

          happened?", and I was trying to look behind me, which I
          couldn't do.  I couldn't move my head right round just to see
          how the other two girls were.  The girls said to me they were
          frightened, very frightened.

     Q. Was anything said by any of the people near to you or shouted?
        - A. Everyone was wondering what was going on.

     Q. Were they saying anything about it? -A. Yes, they were quite
        frightened.

     Q. And one of the girls you were talking about was very close to
        you, was not she? - A. No, that was another girl.

     Q.   That was another girl? - A. Yes.

     Q. What happened to her? - A. I did not realise she was there,
        but then I looked down and there was a girl squashed against
        my stomach.

     Q. Did you try to do anything to help here? - A. I was just
        literally pinned in. I could not move anything but my head.

     Q. Did you see anybody outside the perimeter fence that you could
        speak to? - A. Yes, there was a Policewoman and a Policeman
        behind her, and they were just looking in.

     Q. Did you say anything to this Policewoman? - A. I was shouting,
        "I have got a girl here who is panicking", who was about to
        faint.

     Q.   Did the girl look as she was going    to faintthen? -A. Yes.    I
          could only feel her going down.  I could not see her face
          properly at that point.

     Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Can you help me on this.    You were
          speaking to the Police? - A. Shouting.

     Q. We don't know what the level of sound was there exactly. - A.
        Screaming.

     Q. Just a moment. Can you tell me whether from your recollection
        of the noise that was going on you thought what you were
        shouting would be heard by the Police? - A. Yes, she was
        looking straight at me.

     Q. May be, but would she be able to hear what you were shouting
        in the general noise? - A. I should imagine so. I would have
        thought so.

     Q.        MR. PHILIPS:    Did you get any reply from her? - A. She
          just looked and she was just panicking herself as far as I
          could see. She just did not know what to do.

     Q. Did she say anything to you? - A. No.

     Q. What was happening to the girl then? - A. She collapsed.

                                                   D. HUGHES



Q. Were you trying to hold her up? - A. By my left knee.  I kept
   my left knee, which was all I could move, up her backside and
   tried to lift her up as best I could.

Q. Did you see any of the gates in the perimeter fence? - A. Yes,
   one to my left-hand side.

Q. Was that in the other pen or in your pen? - A. In my pen.

Q. And it was to your left-hand side? - A. Yes.

Q. What happened to this gate? - A. It was opened.  I saw it
   opened three times, and people were trying to get out, and the
   Police were throwing them back in again.

Q. Throwing them back in again? - A. Yes, grabbing them and
   throwing them in.

Q. Was the gate closed after every time it was opened? -A. Yes,
   it was slammed.

Q.     Did you   see anybody else in distress apart from this girl who
     was immediately in front of you? - A. Yes, another man right
     next to her at the same level.  Two of them were right low
     down.

Q. Did you see anybody getting out or trying to get out? - A.
   Only those by the gate. The perimeter fence was far too high.
   No-one could move at the front.

Q. Did you say anything more to any of the Police people outside?
   - A. Yes, I kept shouting at the Policewoman.

Q. Was this the same Policewoman? - A. Yes.

Q.    Can you    describe her? - A. She hada pony tail and dark hair.

Q.lDid she     appear to hear you on thislater occasion when you
   shouted to her? - A. I don't know.  I was just screaming all
   the time.  I was screaming, "I have got a girl who has fainted
  (here. Can you help her?".   I was getting very annoyed.




                                   /Q. Was there any response

                                         D. HUGHES


Q. Was there any response back to you from her? - A. No.

Q. Was any other Police Officer about? - A. Yes, there was
   Policemen behind her and then more Police on the perimeter
   fence itself looking in.

Q. what were they doing? - A. Just looking.

Q. Were they saying anything? - A. Not at that time, no.

Q. Did any of them seem to have a radio? - A. Yes, a man, a
   blonde Policeman behind the Policewoman to her right,my
   right.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      How did you describe him? - A.
     A blonde Policeman.

Q.         MR. PHILIfSl  Did you see him using his radio? -
     A. Yes, he was talking into it and listening into it.

Q. This girl was getting more and more distressed, wasshe              not?
   - a . Well she was not moving at all.

Q. Did you finally see the gate open? - A. No.

Q. Did you finally see people going out on              to thepitch? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Did you  see how they got out? - A . Through that gate. I
   presume  through that    gatl because I was just looking
   straight in front of me shouting.

Q. When people started to get out did the Police Officers
   take any part in that? - A. Eventually.

Q. What do you mean by "eventually"? How much after the
   people started getting out? - A. Well the supporters that
   were out they were right on the front perimeter fence
   and they were shouting at the peoples "Get back, get back,
   people are dying hereâ. One man he more or less climbed
   on to the top of the spike and he was climbing over,
   leaning over it pleading with people to go out. At this
   time the Police more     or less did the same shouting at
   people to go back.

Q.   And the gate was open at that time? - A. I was not looking.

Q.    Were peoplegetting out at that time?     -   A.   Yes, it must
     have been open, yes.

Q.   Were you able to move towards the gate? - A. No, I was
     completely pinned in.

Q.   Did you see   then what the Police did? - A. No.

Q.    Did you see them taking anybody out of the pen? - A. No.
     It was just total mayhem.
                                   D. HUGHES


Were you able to see the gate from where you were? - A. No,
not at that time, no.

You could not get to the gate you say? - A. No.

Gould you move at all? - A. No, I was just totally pinned
in. I could not move.

Did the pressure ease off subsequently? - A. Eventually.
I don't know how long, I have no idea, but eventually
people went back.

What happened to you? - A. As soon as I was released I just
fell straight on to the floor. My left leg with holding
the girl up was numb, I could not move it whatsoever. I
just fell straight on the floor, but I did not fall on the
floor I fell   on to about 20 bodies.

And then didyou get helped up? - A. Yes, well I hit my
head against one of the bodies that was face up and people
were just panicking everywhere and I just put my arm up
on to someone, I don't know who. Someone just grabbed hold
of my arm and pulled me up.
               r

Were you able to walk about then? - A. Well I was hobbling.
I hobbled to the right-hand side side fence.

How did you get out of that pen? - A. I just put my arms
up. Supporters were just, they grabbed hold of me and I
got trapped half way over the spikes in the middle.

Is that the perimeter fence? - A. At the side, yes.

On to the pitch or the fence at the side? - A. The side.

The fence at the side? - A. Yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Through to which pen are you
talking about? - A. To the right-hand.

So that is Number 2 where Mr. Poole is point now, is it?
- A. That is correct.

      MR. PHILIPS:   Was the gate tothat pen open when
you got into   it? -A. I got over and I fell over again
and I just got to the fence and it was open, yes.

You were then I think looking for your friend Richie,
weren't you? - A. No, I just collapsed on the pitch at
that time. It was much later when I got myself together
that I started to look for Richie.

What was your impression of what the Police were doing on
the touch-line outside the perimeter fence?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   At what stage?
                                     D. HUGHES


      MR. PHILIPS:   I am sorry, my Lord, yes that was a
bit vague.

After it was over, of course, you had a chance to look back
at things, didn't you? - A. Well I sat down yes at the side

And there was an occasion when the crush started which
you have put at the time when the players came out on to
the pitch. That is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Now can you give us any idea how long it was between that
time and the time when you were helped over the dividing
fence into Pen 2? - A. I have absolutely no idea whatsoever

It must have seemed a long time? - A. It was an eternity.

When you first were aware of the Officers on the touch-line
on the outside of the perimeter fence, did you get any
impression of what they were doing or trying to do? - A.
I don't think they knew what they were doing.

When you were later being helped across to the fence did
you get then any impression about what the Police Officers
were doing? - A. No, it was still the same. They weren't
aware of what happened I don't think, how bad it was.

Were you conscious of any of the barrier breaking in your
pen? - A. No.

You did not see what happened to it afterwards? - A. Not
until much later when I was looking round for my friend
and I looked in there and it was just mangled. I got
out of that. I was right in front of that.

Did you see any part of the barrier anywhere else apart
from in the pen? - A. No.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: What were you wearing? - A.
A white anorak and a pink jumper, a pink sweater.

      MR. PHILIPS:   Yes, thank you.

      MR. KING:   No questions.

      MR. MAXWELL:   No questions.


              Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSONt

Mr. Hughes, I want to concentrate on just one aspect of
your evidence. There was a time when a young lady was
pressed so close to your stomach you could not see her
face. Is that correct? - A. Yes.

At that time how far away from you was the Police lady
with the pony tail that you sought assistance from?
- A. I would say about six to seven feet.
                                    D. HUGHES


You were screaming? - A. Yes.

Am I not correct that she did in fact reply to you and
said that she was unable to do anything about it? - A. I
cannot remember.  I cannot remember.  I was just screaming
at her.

As you continued in that position you have told us that
after that on thresoccasions fans who were seeking to
escape were put back, you said thrown back? - A. I saw
three.

After you had screamed for help? - A. Yes, with everything
going on, yes.

How far away from you were the Officers who were throwing
people back at the time you were screaming for help? -
A. I would say about 15'.


              Cross-Examined by MR. MULLER:

You said you saw people getting out through the gate. X
just want to ask you something about that. What you said
in your statement was:  "Eventually the gate opened and
people spilled out on to the pitch. People were fighting
to get out". - A. That was inside. They were fighting
to get out of the gate.

But you described it in your statement as "People spilling
out through the gate". Is that right? Is that a fair
description of what you saw? - A. I would say yes.

So quite a lot of people got out as soon as the gate opened?
A. I did not take much notice of it really because I was
more interested in the girl that was here and just screaming

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Gibson-Watt?

      MR. GIBSON-WATT:   No questions.

      MR. DUGGAN:   No questions.


              Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Mr. Hughes, may I ask you first of all about what happened
outside the ground? - A. At the beginning?

Yes, before all this terror and horror that occurred. You
had gone to the match with your friends and you got there
rather early? - A. Too early.

Â©lat meant there was a lot of time to kill? - A. Exactly.

I don't intend to suggest that you were drunk but one of
the ways you spent the time was having a drink? - A. Yes,
two drinks with the meal.
                                 D. HUGHES


And then you got some more drink after that? - A. Yes, two
tins.

The situation was that even then that did not kill all the
time because you went to the bridge? - A. Well it was right
by the entrance in so we just stood on the bridge looking
over the water.

And there were Police Officers around at that time, were
there not? - A. Yes.

They were trying to encourage people to go into the ground?
- A. Yes, I remember the mounted Policemen saying.

So however it was being carried out there seemed to be s o b Â®
sort of system or method of encouraging the people not to
hang about outside but to go into the ground? - A. Yes.
I remember we had just finished the tin and the Policeman
had said: "Come on lads, everyone go in" so we went straight
in after that.

So you went in through the gates and you went to go to the
turnstile? - A. Yes.

But at this time is it right that you saw people around in
the vicinity of the entrance to the area to go to the turnstile
and the area of the turnstiles and round about the bridge
who were wanting tickets? - A. Yes, people were milling
around, yes.

Did there seem to be to you on this occasion rather a lot
of people about who had not got tickets? - A. I heard people:
"Any spares, any spares?"

That was a frequent request as you made your way in? - A. Yes.

In order to go through the turnstiles you were not directed
as to exactly where you should stand but you formed a queue
and went in? - A. Exactly.

And the crowd at this stage was fairly orderly? - A. Great,
yes.

It was a good atmosphere? - A. It was brilliant.

There was no antagonism with the Police? - A. No.

The Police were doing their job? - A. Yes, it was very jovial.

And it seemed to be well ordered? - A. Yes.

You made your way in through the turnstile and went up to
go to the terrace to find a good spot to watch the game?
- A. Exactly.

You have told the Inquiry on the terrace there was a good
                                     D. HUGHES


mood, people were having fun. Someone had got something,
I have been describing it as a beach ball. It might look
like a beach ball? - A. It was a massive ball.

A great big inflated object which could be easily bounced
around amongst the crowd and   the chap was  upcommanding
that and doing it? - A. Yes.

He was the Ring Master and the crowd were all joining in?
- A. Yes.

This was to the best of your recollection the situation up
to, round and after half-past-2? - A. Yes.

About that time there was no feeling of compression, no
a n xM t y? - A. None whatsoever.

Did you see other people standing up on crush barriers?
- A. No, I cannot remember.  I only looked at that one
fella.

Of course it depends where you are looking and it is quite
a large area? - A. Yes, I was looking for    my friend Richie.

Had he gone off to go to the     toilets? - A. No, he went to
the right, to the side.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: What, in Pen 3? - A. Yes, which
I found out latei> I did not know at the time.

      MR. WOODWARD: You were in Pen 3 as well? - A. No, I
was in the middle pen.

Well having gone through the tunnel did you go to your right
or to your left? - A.   I canât remember. All I did I was
in the middle pen.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: We had better check this. Have
a look at some photographs in front of you there, will you.
Would you have a look    at Photograph 21. There you are,
you had a choice when you came out of the tunnel.    Which
way did you go? - A. To the right-hand one.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     That is 3.

      MR. WOODWARD: And to put it beyond a doubt you were
in the area where the chap was with the beach ball? - A.
Yes.

To the right.   Pen 3. - A. Sorry.

Whereabouts were you at about half-past-2 in that pen? -
A. I was in the middle by that barrier.



                               /Q. Do you mean
                                         D. HUGHES



Do you mean you had just gone down? - A. I went down.     I
made my way down to the middle of the goal as best I
could to get a good spot to watch the match.

Did you go right to the front?- A. Not right to the
front, no.

How far did you go? - A. To that barrier and I stopped
because I thought I would be safe in front of the
barrier.

That was the barrier you then went under at a later
stage? - A. Yes, within five minutes.

Do you have photograph 23 in front of you? - A. Yes.

One may see the sort of area where you were standing? -
A. Yes.

To the left hand side in the centre? - A. Yes.

Then the gate you have described, is that the gate just
to the right there almost in the centre of the picture? -
A. Yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    That is the gate that opened
three times, is it? - A. Yes.

      MR. WOODWARD:    There was a lot of noise, was there
not, even when things were going well? - A. Yes.

People were shouting, they were chanting and they were
cheering in response to whatever they happened to hear
over the tannoy? - A. Yes.

You describe then something going wrong, something
happened?   What was the first thing that caused you
anxiety? - A. It was just the force, that people were
forcing, getting closed in.

That would be at about the time of the kick-off, would
it? - A. Yes.  No, it was prior to the kick-off.   I did
not see the kick-off whatsoever.   I did not see a ball
being kicked at all.

There is a statement that you made and you do says

      â 1 did not see any of the game.  I would say the
      big surge came the few minutes before the kick-off,
      just before 3.00 pm.11

That would be right? - A. Yes,   thereabouts.

                                             D. HUGHES


Q. So the teams were already on the field? - A. Yes,     I saw
   them coming out.

Q.    It would seem, so far as you could gather from what was
     happening, that they had had their short warm-up? -A.
     Yes.

Q. The ends had been chosen.   Did you know which end
   Liverpool were going to have? - A. Yes.

Q. That had been decided before the surge came, had it? - A.
   Yes.

Q.   Right behind you was a barrier? - A, Yes.

Q.   The surge that came upon you, how did it cause you to be
     affected if there was a barrier behind you? - A. It was
     just an almighty crush.    It was so strange.  You were
     just literally crushed together like that.

Q. Was it at about this time that you felt discomfort and
   anxiety? - A. Yes.

Q. And that was the start of your concern? - A. Yes, I did
   not know what hit me.

Q. Things after that became chaotic, did they? - A. Yes.

Q. Things in your memory probably seemed to take an
   eternity? - A. They did.

Q. Other things will have seemed to have happened very, very
   quickly? - A. Yes.

Q. The whole thing becomes a matter of perception and the
   best you can do now to recall it? - A. I wrote everything
   down two days later - well, the Wednesday after.

Q. I am not intending to suggest you have not tried your
   very best to get it accurate, but there must have been a
   lot of other people in and around where you were who were
   affected by this surging? - A. Yes.

Q. You were not the only one who was likely to have been
   shouting and screaming? - A. Definitely not.

Q. By this time you were all packed together and so far as
   you were concerned it really had happened?   Is that
   right? - A. Yes.

Q. When it is suggested to you that a Policewoman may not
   have responded to your cry, that may be right, but it is
   not likely that yours was the only cry, is it? - A. No,

                                            D. HUGHES


     no, I was just worried about the poor girl that was here.
     I was screaming for her not myself.

Q. You did your best? - A. Yes.

Q. So did everybody else in an around you, did they not? -
   A. Yes, everyone was shouting.

Q. Out beyond the perimeter fence you say there was a Police
   lady? - A. Yes, with a pony tail.

Q. It would be unfair to suggest that she ignored you? - A.
   She did not ignore me,  I do not think she understood how
   bad the situation was.

Q. The gate you have described, your attention will have
   been focused on all that was immediately by you? - A. In
   front of me because I could not move anywhere else.

Q. The gate was some distance to your right? - A. To my
   left.

Q. To your left? - A. Looking straight out it was to my
   left, the gate is there.

Q.    Well, we may need to go back a bit because which gate is
     important, or may be important.     You have been looking
     at a photograph which Lord Justice Taylor showed you? -
     A, 23.

Q. Would you have a look at photograph 21? - A. Yes.

Q. That is the way out of the tunnel on to the terrace.
   There is the fence there which you have told the Inquiry
   you went to the right of.   That is correct, is it? - A.
   Yes.

Q. If we look at photograph 23, just to the left we can see
   on the floor in the front the yellow hatching, the
   painting on the floor, and we can relate that to what we
   see in photograph 21? - A. Yes.

Q.   On your left hand side there isthe fence running down,
     do you see? - A. Yes.

Q. It seemed that you were saying at an earlier stage that
   you were down in the corner looking in photograph 23,
   with the gate over to your right? - A. No, I must be
   meaning the wrong pen by what I am saying.   T he gate was
   definitely to my left that was opening and closing.

Q. Had you got a railing near you, a fence close to you,
   running down the terrace? - A. No, I would say that was
   about fifteen feet away.

Which goalpost were you behind, the left hand goalpost as
you faced the pitch or the right hand goalpost? - A. The
right hand one looking at it.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If you go back to 21 you can
see the whole goalpost? - A. Yes, the right hand one.

You were definitely behind the right post? - A. Yes.

Can you tell me this:   the gate that you say was to your
left that opened and shut three times, was it in the same
pen as you, or might it have been in the next pen to the
left? - A. No, it must have been in my pen.   I should
imagine it was.   No, there was no fence to the left of
it.   It was in my pen definitely, yes.

Can we just ask you this, you do your best.          Look at
photograph 23 again. - A. Yes.

There is the right hand goalpost? - A. Yes.

You can see the gate that       seems to be in the middle of
the fence in that pen, it       is practically in the middle of
the photograph? - A. Yes.

Whereabouts on that photograph were you? - A. I was just
to the right of that gate.

With your back against the       front barrier? - A. Yes.

         LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR: Well,   you take   it on from
there.

      MR. WOODWARD:   Your recollection is that the gate
in question, the one you are describing, was somewhere to
your left? - A. To my left, definitely.

And you are up against a barrier? - A. Yes.   Well, the
two girls were behind.   I was just in front of the two
girls.

If you were in pen 3 and if that is the gate we see in
photograph 23, the barrier which was behind you is the
one that failed.   You would not necessarily know that. -
A. I did not know that.

But the failure of that barrier could explain why you had
that sudden tremendous push behind you? - A. Yes.

It was that sudden tremendous push which was, so far as
you were concerned, the start of it all? - A. Yes.

When that happened there were many, many people in and
around you who were affected by it? - A. Yes.

                                              D. HUGHES


Q. All would have been reacting and shouting and calling.
   Of course, those people who were further back up the
   terrace would not necessarily understand what was wrong
   down at the front? - A. No.

Q. Those at the front who looked to the back might have seen
   space, or less congestion, up the steps to the back of
   the terrace? - A. Well, if you were at the front you
   could not look at the back.

Q.   Not you, but persons on the pitch looking up? - A. Yes.

Q.    It would depend where your concentration   was or your mind
     was drawn? - A. Yes.

Q. All this is added to the cry and shouting that is
   accompanying a game that is going on on the field? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Throughout this you are describing a football match is
   being played? - A. Well, I did not see any ball being
   kicked.

Q.   You did not see it.   The gate you speak of being opened,
     did it allow, when it was opened, as you saw it, people
     to come out? - A. I remembered the gate was forced open
     to my left.   People tried to get out.   Men tried to get
     out and were forced back in.

Q. You say it was forced open.    Did you actually see that
   gate coming open? - A. Yes. People were pushing at     the
   gate to open it and the gate swung open.    I remember a
   couple of people going out.    They were grabbed and
   thrown back in again.

Q. Just a couple of people came out? - A. At      the beginning,
   yes, because there was that much surge at      that gate for
   people to get out.   People could not get      out because
   they were literally - one at a time could      only fall.

Q. It is just a narrow gateway,    i s n ât it? - A. Yes.

Q. It barely allows one big man through? - A. Yes.

Q. There were all these people pressing up against it? - A.
   Yes.

Q. All the people behind them pressed forward? - A. Yes.

Q. Are you saying people were actually put back through that
   gateway into the crowd? - A. Yes.   Three times.   I
   definitely saw it three times.

                                                D. HUGHES


Q. Are you saying the gate was opened three times and closed
   three times? - A. It was forced open three times and
   slammed.

Q. How many Policemen were putting people back through this
   narrow gateway? - A. Two or three.  I cannot remember
   that well,

Q. How was the crowd held back to allow the individuals to
   be put through this narrow eye? - A. It was literally
   being forced open all the time and they were trying to
   force it closed again.

Q. The gate was open and there came a time when people were
   not able to get out of it because of the press of people
   against it?   That is right, isn't it? - A. I did not see
   that.  I was just looking straight at this time,
   panicked.   I did not see the initial - when everyone
   roared out - I did not see anything.

Q. Forgive me, but that is an accurate description, is it,
   you were in panic during this time? - A. I was panicked
   for the girl that was there.   I just wanted to try and
   save her but I c o u l d n ât.

Q. Are you able to describe any of the Policemen apart from
   the lady with the - the Policewoman? - A. There was a
   blond Policeman behind on the radio.

Q. Do you say he was the one who used a radio? - A. Yes.

Q. He was more or less in the company of, or in the area,
   where the Police lady with the pony tail was? - A. A bit
   to the back of her.

Q. If one looks at films and pictures one might be able to
   pick h im out, because you would expect him to be round
   about the same place? - A. I should imagine so, yes.

         MR. WOODWARD:     Thank you.

               Cross-Examined by MR. G L A S G O W :

Q. Mr, Hughes, just about the gate.   When the gate first
   opened, did it appear to you that people could get out
   through it? - A. No.   One at a time, if that.   They
   were just falling.   The person who tried to push it open
   was the only one who could fall out.   They were just
   coming out in dribs and drabs.   Nothing could happen.

Q. How long was it open for on each occasion? - A. Seconds.
   The people were just grabbed and put back in again and it
   was closed again.

                                            D. HUGHES


Q. I wonder if you would just think about this.    We may be
   told that that gate can in fact only be opened,
   physically, from the outside? - A. It was opened from the
   inside, definitely.

Q. I would just like you to think about that because I want
   your help.   I am not contradicting you in any way but I
   thought it only fair to tell you that we may be told that
   it is physically only possible with a great big lever to
   open it from the outside and that cannot be got at from
   the inside.   You see the point I am asking you just to
   consider with me? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you think it is a possibility that the gate was opened
   from the outside in order to put people who had climbed
   over, back in? - A. That is a good possibility because I
   was not looking at that gate all the time.

Q. You cannot help the Inquiry as to the mechanism by which
   the gate opened, can you, only that it came open? - A.
   Yes, that's it.

Q. We know that tragically at a later stage there were a
   number of bodies piled up against the entrance to that
   gate and that nobody could get out? - A. Yes.

Q. I do not know whether you saw that or whether mercifully
   you were spared that sight? - A. No.   There was a pile
   of bodies to my left where I was.

Q.   At the time the gate was first opened, whether that was
     from the outside or from the inside, you are quite clear
     that people could get out of it at that stage? - A. Yes.

Q. Am I right in thinking that your concern, very naturally
   in the circumstances, was that the gate should be left
   open, whatever the reason was it had been opened for in
   the first place? - A. Definitely.

Q. I would like you to think very carefully about this:
   from the position which you were in and which we have
   seen in the photographs, with the gate about as far away
   from me as Lord Justice Taylor is, or probably a little
   closer than that.  Is it about as far away as my Lord is
   from both of us? - A. About the same.

Q. Are you really able to say that it is your clear
   recollection that if the gate had been left open the
   people around you would have been able to filter out
   through it? - A. Not in the capacity the crush was.      No,
   it would not have helped at all.

          MR. GLASGOW:   Thank you very much, Mr. Hughes.

             Re-Examined by MR. C O L L I N S :

Can we just explore the matter and see whether we can
clear up precisely where you were.   It may be helpful to
approach it from the end,   I think you told us earlier
on that after it was over and you got out on to the
pitch, you went back and had a look back in the terrace
where you had been? - A, I was just in a haze,   I was
just looking for my friend Richard.

I follow that, but you did look back into the terrace
where you had been, looking for your friend? - A. Yes,

You saw then, I think you told us, that the barrier had
gone, or where the barrier had gone? - A. Yes.  I thought
it was the barrier I was by.

Did you tell us that you then said to yourself, âThat is
where I was"? - A. Yes, "How did I get out of that?"

What means is that you got yourself a little further over
to the right when you came in than you thought
originally? - A. Yes.

You got yourself near the front with the gate to your
left? - A. Yes.

With the barrier behind.   You gave a sort of graphic
description of a sort of whoosh sound when the surge
came? - A. Yes, the air had gone completely.

Of course, that is consistent with the barrier having
collapsed at that moment behind you, although you did not
realise it at that particular point? - A. I did not know
at all.




                                    /Q. So it does look

                                                          D. HUGbES



Q.   So it does look as if you were one of those who were
     standing i m me di at el y in front of the b ar rier which
     c o llapsed and were caught in the surge that occurred
     as a result of that c ol la ps e?     A.   Yes.

Q.   Looking back on it,      is that the posi ti on         as you now see
     it?   A.   Yes.

Q. And the time of that - your r ec ol lection, as I u n de rs ta nd
   it, is that the p layers came out on the field twice.
   A.   Yes.

Q.    That, I think, is wrong - they only came out once.
     A.No, they came out twice.   They had     a k i ck -a bo ut
     first.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE      TAYLOR:   Then they go back in again?
     A.    Then they go      back in again.

Q.         MR. COLLINS:       I see.        That may be the position.
     A.    Definitely.

Q.    The time they came out when the w hoosh happened, that
     would be the second time, that was shortly   b efore k ic k- of f
     is that c orrect?    A.   Yes.

Q.   Is it your r ec o l l e c t i o n that this surge and w hoosh occurred
     roughly at the same time as they came out or you were
     aware of them having come out on that second o cc as io n?
     A.   It was just ---             I didn't see a ball being kicked
     at all in the game, so it must have been round about then.

          MR. COLLINS:        Yes,   thank you.       I think that is all
     I would ask.

           LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR:        Thank you very much.

     have my s y mpat hy but you can talk alright, can you?

Q.   I think you had some delays           in   the t r af fi c?     A.     Yes,

Q.sAnd what time did you arrive at t e p p i n g s Lane?                   A.     At

Q.   When you got to L eppi ng s Lane, what was the p os it i on ?
     A.     As I got there, we just &epgfeSSa^?d"rrTiang at)out^ there
     b e caus e there was a couple of fellows we were hoping to
     meet, so we walked up to the other corner and got s o me th in g
     to eat, like a can of Coke, and then we w alked back ---

          LORD J USTIC E TAYLOR:                I am sorry, could you stop
     a moment.    I fully u nd er s ta n d the d i f fi c ul t y you are
     having in s peaking but that does not mean you have got
     to speak fast so could you try and keep it a bit slower
     because the s h o r t h a n d - w r i t e r here has to take down what
     you say, do you follow?                 So the loudest you can and
     fairly slowly, please.

           MR. GOLDSACK:    What       time did you actu al ly go to the
      gate with a view togoing         into the ground?      A. About
     Itwenty to t h r e e .

Q. What was the scene o utsid e the gate at that stage?
  , A.   It was just stupid, you know.         It was just walk in g
    in ---   It was just like w h e r e ve r you stood you stayed.
   (I was just getting pushed forward.

Q. Did you see any po li ce ? A.              Yes, there was two on horses
   by the gate outside and then             two on horses inside.

Q. At the time you arrived, did the mass of peop le come
   outside the gates on to the r oa dw ay ?  A.  Yes, we were
   like on the road, wo rm in g our way through.

Q.   How did Stephen react to that crowd?      A.   Well, he goes
     to m atches every week, he just thought it was a bit normal
     until he got to the two gates outside and then he r ea li se d
     it wasn't.    He was crus he d against me and my dad,
     between us.    He was crying, like, his eyes were r ol ling
     and everything.

Q.   Was he the only person that you could see who was in
     d iffi culty or dis tr es s ? A. No. No, there was quite
     a few.     I was myself.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          I did not catch - how old is
     Stephen?    A.   Thirteen.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   Were people around you doing anyt hi ng
     to try and get out of the crush?   A.   There was nothing
     you could do.

Q.   Did you see anyone going over        the w alls?             A.    Yes.

Q.    How many people did you see doing that?           A.Fifteen or
     twenty.     I would have gone m y s e l f if I could have moved
     but I couldn't.     I could have gone and pulled our
     Stephen and my' dad up.

Q.   Were you gradually m ov in g t ow ards the t u r ns t il e s?
     A.   We were m oving slowly but it was just like what
     you would call baby-steps, you know, like half a foot
     length at a time.

Q. Did you have any control at all over your m o v e me n ts at
   that stage?     A.   No.   When we got to the turnstiles,
   e veryo ne just pushed forward again.

Q.    Did you event ua ll y get to the t u r ns t il e s? A. Yes,              I
     got there in the end, after about ten minu te s p u sh in g               and
     shoving.

Q.   Once the other side of the turnstile,                 did you see any
     police offi ce rs ? A.  Yes, loads.

Q.   How many do you mean by loads?              A.        Betw ee n 30 and 50.

Q. Just look round at the g en tl em an who is pointing.
   W h er ea bo ut s were those p ol ic e me n ? A. Where his stick
   is now.         They were just all lined up across there.

Q.   Lined across where the stick is, a few feet inside the
     t u rn st il es ? A. Yes, you know, as though they were
     all getting s earched and that.    They were s ea r ch i ng us.

Q. Did you speak with any of those p ol ic e me n ?               A.         Yes,
   we spoke to a poli ce ma n about 27, 28.

Q. Was he one with a helmet or a flat cap?                   A.    Helmet.

Q. What did you say?      A.   We said, you know, "Can you get
   som et hi ng done about there, it is rLrttiTess.w

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    What was the last word?
     A.    It is  ruthless*-- you know, terrible.

Q.   L udic rous?      A.      Ruthless.

          MR. GOLDSACK:    L ud ic ro us       and ridiculous,         I think
     both words were used.

Q. Did you get a reply from the p ol ic e ma n ? A.   He said
   he can't move, he has got tots ta y where he is, that is
   his orders, so I said, "Well, can't you use your radio
   or s om et hi ng ?" He said, "We haven't got them.    S er ge an ts
   upwards have them round here."      So, you know ---

Q.   Can I just ---    " Se rg ea nt s upwards have radio s" ?
     A.   "Round here", yes, so I said, "Why don't you blow your
     whistle, then?" and just walk ed away b ec au se it was silly.

Q.   Having r ealised that he could not or would not do anything,
     where did you then go?     A. Went to  buy my p ro gr a mm e and
     then into the ground.

Q. Did you know where to go, had you been to H i l l s b or o ug h
   before?   A.   I was there last year but I was up in the
   Stands.   I didn't know, like, about down the bottom.

Q. Was there any sign telling you where to go that you saw?
   A.  No.

Q. Did you realise           there was a gate just to the right               of
   the t ur ns t i l e s ?     A.     Yes, it opened.

Q. At what stage did it open?   A.                There was this p o li ce ma n
   just opened it a bit and a couple              of lads got in, 100 or
   150.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I am sorry, you said a couple
     of lads got in and the next thing I heaid you say was 50.
     A.   150.

         they opened it or not, I don't know.

    Q. Did that gate stay open?   A.   No, two police               horses
       come across and blocked it, or a police horse.

    Q. A ndyjur estimate is about 150 people came in whilst it was
       open?    A.   Yes, and about 50 police as well come m ar ch in g
       through.

    Q. About 50 police     came mar ch i ng   through.       A.   Just after
       that.

    Q.   That would mean getting on for a        hundred poli ce in that
         area?   A.   Yes, but they seemed       to go round the side
         somewhere.    They seemed to come       in and then go sideways.
         They didn't come across to w here       we all were.

    Q. Do you mean round      to the right behind the Stand?             A.     Yes.

    Q. Did you see that gate open again?         A.   No.   It was,
       like, with all them coming in, my dad said to me, "They
       might have tickets there, let's get down and get in
       before they start" because as he got in, he had to give
       his ---    He was c ru sh ed on the turnstile, him and
       Stephen. He gave his ticket in and the fellow was saying,
       "Hang on, hang on".     He was trying to rip the two tick et s
       up to get them apart and my       dad just said, "Get us in"
       and they never had the stubs on.        The stubs are still
       inside the ground.

              MR. WOODWARD:   I am sorry but it is very d i ff ic ul t
         to hear and understand.

              LORD J US TICE TAYLOR:  It is indeed.    I am sorry,
         we are at the wrong side of the Penn in es for you, I
         think.   Do your best to speak a little slower, would you.

              THE WITNESS:      Yes.

    Q.           LORD JUS TICE TAYLOR:     Thanks.   Could you just say
         that again.       Some th in g about Stephen was cryi ng and
         s o me thin g about a cigarette, is that right?        A.    No.

    Q.   I got it wrong.       Start again on that bit.     A.   He was
         crushed on, like, the t ur ns t il e gates.    He was in the
         front and my dad was crushi ng on to him beca us e he could
         not move, and he gave the t ic kets to the fellow on the
         t u rn stil es - the two t ic kets - and the fellow could not

                                                        A. BARNBROCK

     s eparate them quick enough and Step he n was crying so my
     dad said, "Just let us through, forget about them"
     and once we got in there and the gates opened, that is when
     he said, "Let's get in there before they start thro wi ng
     people out who have not got tickets" beca us e we never
     had a stub.

Q.   You did not have time to retain your stubs and you were
     f rightened you might be chuck ed out, that was it?
     A.    I had my stub b ack,i t was my dad and Step he n - he
     never had time ---

Q.   So you wanted    to get inside   quic kl y?   A.     Yes.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:    Did you, in fact,       go t h ro ug h a
     tunnel on to the ter ra ce ? A.   Yes.

Q. Were there any p o l ic em en near the entr an ce     to the tunnel?
   A.   I didn't see none, no.

Q. Were there any s tewards near       the entr an ce   to the tunn el ?
   A.   No.   I never seen any,        no.

Q.   How busy was the tunnel when you were in it?       A.    You
     know, they were just all w al k in g down singing.    There
     was loads.   There was like the lads who just got in,
     those who were already in, those who c li mbed over.

Q. Did you want to co nt in u e t h ro ug h the tunnel on to the
   t er ra ce s? A.  No, I w anted to try and turn round and
   go s omewhere else.

Q.   Why did you want to go som e wh e re else? A.  When I
     looked down, all you could see was just heads.    It was
     just all, like, too close toge th er for me.

Q. Did you know w hether there was anyw he re else to go?
   A.   No, b ecause I had every i nt e nt i on of going down
   the tunnel and w or ki ng my way to the sides beca us e on
   your ticket there is nothi ng showing you that there
   are (i n a u d i b l e ) fences going down the middle. I
   have got my ticket here for you.

Q.        LORD J USTICE TAYLOR:   You did not know    there
     would be these fences down the m i dd le ? A. No, beca us e
     they are not m arked on the map on the back of your ticket.

Q.         MR.   GOLDSACK:   Did you in fact think of turn in g
     round in    the tunnel and coming back?   A.   Yes, thought
     about it    but that was all you could do - think.    You coul dn 't
     a ctually   do it.

                                                 A. BARNBROCK

Q.   Is that because    of the number of people?        A.      Yes.

Q. As you got to the end of the tunnel,          were there any
   players on the field?  A.   No.

Q. Did you see them come on to the field?   A.                I seen
   them come on to the field a couple of minu te s            later.

Q.   In that couple of minutes, as you put it, what had you
     been doing?   A.   Like d uc king under people and w or mi ng
     my way down to the front.

Q.    Do you know w hether you went into the r i g h t- h an d side
     or the l eft-hand side?    A.    The l e ft -h an d side beca us e
     I walked into the right -h an d side first.       My dad said
     I could not get out on this side so I sque ez ed through
     the fence and went down the left -h an d side then.

Q. How   far down the l eft-ha nd side, that is Pen 4, did you
   go?     A.   Right to the very front.

Q.    How did you m anage that? A.          Just pushing      past people
     and ducking under the barriers,       andthat.

Q.    Was Stephen still with you?  A.     Yes, we had our Stephen
     in, like, a bit of a headlock, p ul ling him down.

Q. Was it so that Stephen got a better view that you wanted
   to be at the front?   A.   So Stephen could get at the
   front and we were hoping to get to the front and then
   try and walk along again but ---

Q. Did you manage      to get right down to the      front?      A.    Yes.

Q. Were you up against the p e ri me te r fencing?  A.            No,
   I was about two yards back.       Stephen was right          up against
   the p erim eter fencing.

Q. When you f irst'got to that position, how c ro wded was it?
   A.   It didn't seem too bad at the very front for
   about 15, 20 seconds.     I said to my dad, "It isn't too
   bad here" and as 1 -turned round I just got pushed sideways
   and my dad went the op p os i te way.

Q. Did you know what had caus ed you to be pushed one way
   and your dad the other way?    A.   No, just a big crowd
   of people, just seemed like you were pushed forward.

Q.   Just a big push forward.   What about Stephen, what
     h app ened to him? A.    He was stuck agai ns t the fence
     at the front.

Q.   Once that big push had come, what was your own s it ua t io n ?
     A.    I was stuck between, like, the fellow in front of
     me and behind me and my feet were about a foot off the
     floor.

Q.    Your own feet were about a foot off the floor,                     crammed
     between other people? A.   Yes.

Q. Could you see w hether there were any p o li ce me n or police
   officers o utsid e the fence?  A.   Yes, there was about
   four or five, like, more or less at the front of me.

Q.   Were they all pol ic e me n        or some p o l i c e w om e n?    A.     No,
     there was a p ol ic e w o m a n    as well.

Q. Did you do a nything so far as they were c on ce r ne d ?
   A.   Did they do anyt hi ng ?

Q. Did you do any th in g? A.     I c ou ld n' t do nothing.   I
   was stuck with my arms s t ic ki ng up like that.      I coul dn 't
   move.

Q. Did anyone try to attract the polic e' s a t te nt io n?
   A.   Yes, we were all s ho ut in g but that was all you
   could do - shout.   They looked down as if it was an
   empty pen they were looking at - no-one there.           They
   just did not react one way or the other.

Q. Do you know what you were s ho ut in g?                  A.      f?Get us out.
   Help us", things like that, you know.                         What you would
   shout when you were stuck like that.

Q. Did you .^ et he L iverp oo l goalkeeper, Bruce G r o b b e l a r ?
   A.     Yes.    I was about 6 ft. up in the air then beca us e
   I was off the floor.           The ball come b ou nc in g down to
   where our Stephen was s ta nd in g when I first left him
   and he picked the balTâup and he was w al ki ng away, looking
   in, and then he said som e th i ng to a policeman.            He just
   s h rugged his sho ul de r s and then w alked back and then he
   walked to where we were, looked in again, shou te d s o me th in g
   to the p ol ic e w o m a n and she opened the gate.

Q.   So the gate was opened            by a policewoman.            A.   Yes.

Q. After Bruce G robbelar          had s poken to the policeman.
   A.   Yes.

Q. Did you actually see the gate being opened?       A.    No, I
   just knew it got -opened beca us e people s ta rted ---    L ke,
   I came down to the floor then.     People s ta rted getting
   out.

Q. How far from the gate were you?                  A.      About two and a half
   yards.

Q.   Can you give us any ind ic a ti o n of how many people went
     out of the gate at that stage?        A.   Twenty-five, thirty.
     They were all in front of me and my dad and our Step he n
     got out with them.   They were in front.        Then as I went
     to get out, the gate jast closed again.         The p o li ce ma n

                                                       A. BARNBROCK

Q.    Your father and brother went out in that               first batch?
      A.   Yes.

Q. Did you see who closed           the gate?     A.        Just a policeman.
   It was a policeman.

Q.    Pol ic em an ?   A.   Yes.

Q.     What happened when the gate was c lo sed?     A.   My bottle
      just went.    I thought, you know, we w er en 't going to
      get out, so we started s ho ut in g again.    It was only like
      about 20, 25 s econds but it sfefemed like a ages and the gate
      just opened again and I was, more or less, one of the first
      ones that got out again.      Some on e just pulled my hair
      and said, "Get hold of these kids".        There were two or
      three young lads there so I just pulled them up.

Q.     D u ri ng that period that you say was p ro ba bl y 20, 25
      seconds, could you see where the police o ff ic er s were?
      A.       S t and ing at the front.

Q.    Looki ng which way?      A.      Into where we all were.

E[.   Were they sayin g or doing a n yt hi ng ?        A.      No.

Q.     Do you know who opened the gate for the second time?
      A.    I think it was the same policewoman.

Q. Did you manage to get out on the second occa si on ?
   A.  After a while, yes, because I pulled these two kids
   out and then I got stuck half in and half out of it
   with some fellow's arm embe dd ed in my chest and that
   just broke then - his arm - and then I squee ze d out and
   pulled him out with me.

Q. Once you were out, did you help others to get out?
   A.   Yes, I helped the p o l ic e wo m an just p ul li ng people
   up by their hair, by the arms, whatever.

Q. And what was the state of these you were h el pi ng out
   then?   A.   They were just, like, s ho cked and some of
   them were, you know, crying and that, w ai li ng and all
   that, but they got up and w alked or some were sitting
   down, like, ca tc hi ng their b reath again.

Q.    The people you helped out at that stage,               they were
      co ns c io us ? A. Yes.  Yes.

Q.    The p o li ce w o m a n who opened that gate on those occasions,
      can y o u ^ d e s c r i b e her at all? A.  She looked 25, with
      blond hair down to about here.

Q.    S h o u l d e r - l e n g t h blond hair? A. Yes. It w asn't down ---
      It was like down and then up but, like, it come down later
      on.       That's how I knew it was down to about there.       It

                                                  A. BARNBROCK

     was pinned up behind her hat at first but as we were helping
     she lost her hat and her hair just came down out of the
     pins or wha te ve r she put in it.

Q.   Once you were outside,        were you able to look back at the
     pens?   A.   Yes.

Q. What could you see at that stage about the                fencing?
   A.   Out the front?

Q.   Yes.     A.      Bulging.      It was just b ul ging   out.

            LORD    JUSTICE    TAYLOR:    Iam sorry?

            MR.    GOLDSACK:     It was bulging    out.

Q.   I know it is dif fi cu lt but can you give us any idea how
     much it was b ulging by?     A.   Just a couple of inches,
     you know, but it just seemed like it b el lied forward a
     bit.

Q.    Was there a St. John's person there?    A.   He was at the
     corner with my dad and Stephen beca us e when I got up
     there our S tephen was crying.    He had hurt all his ribs
     and his chest and that.

Q.    And I think at that stage you went to the First Aid Post?
     A.    Yes, we took Steph en away and I was a c ouple of
     yards behind him, just looking.

Q. And the First Aid Post was under the North Stand?
   A.   Yes, you just had to go up to the top, like, where
   all the Forest s u p po rt er s were and then turn round.

Q.   Just look at the plan.    Did you walk all along the
     front of that Stand?   A.    Yes, right to the top there.

Q.   And then down that corne r?           A.    Yes.




                                                            I think after you

                                                 A. BARNBROCK



Q. I think after you spoken with Stephen you then helped moving
   other people out? - A. Yes, but before I got to where Stephen
   was there were about 20 Police dogs snarling at us and biting
   us and whatever.

Q. Just indicate where the Police dogs were? - A. Further up, at
   the very top, this side, on the walkway there.

Q. Somewhere in that alleyway there? - A. Yes, about 20 Police
   dogs.

Q.   All with    their individual dog handler? -A. Yes.

Q.   When you went to the first-aid post to see Stephen did you go
     right back down to the Leppings Lane terracing? - A. No, I was
     walking out with Stephen and I saw these St. John's Ambulance
     lads, 12 or 13, and they had this big fellow on the stretcher.
     They were walking from one end of the pitch to the other and
     no-one was helping them or nothing.   They were buckling at the
     knees and everything.   So I said to Stephen to get back to
     where my dad was, and I got hold of   the stretcher. I told
     Stephen to get back down to the corner where my dad was
     hanging on down there for him.   I grabbed the stretcher on
     side and I said, "Get at the front", and we carried him in
     that way.

Q. You relieved one of the St. John's men? - A. Yes.      He was only
   a boy. He was no more than 14.

Q.   You took someone through on a stretcher? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you then go back to the Leppings Lane terracing? - A. Yes.
     I saw the two kids and saw where they were and then walked off
     with him.

Q. Now, the second time you helped, was that by carrying a
   stretcher with a Policeman at the other end? - A. Yes, I think
   it was a Policeman. As I was running down I said, "Come
   here", and just ran off.

Q.   Did that person on the stretcher also have tobe carried the
     full length of the pitch? - A. The full length of the pitch,
     but we left him down on the grass.

Q.   You put him down at the end of the pitch. By the time you
     were carrying that stretcher were there any Police across the
     middle of the pitch? - A. They were across there. They
     started to put a line up to clear the pitch.

Q.   I am not quite sure I understood that. Did you have any
     difficulty getting through the Policemen? - A. Just a bit the
     first time.

Q. I think after that you were one of those who helped ;with
   using the hoardings as stretchers? - A. Yes.

                                                  A. BARNBROCK


Q. During the time this incident was going on did you hear
   anything over the loudspeakers? - A. Yes, to clear the pitch
   because the game would not start until we cleared the pitch.

Q. Do you know at what stage that was? - A. That was about
   quarter-past or 20-past-3.

Q. What were you doing at the time you heard that announcement? -
   A. I was putting some lad on a stretcher. He was alive, but
   his life seemed to be in bad shape.

Q. Apart from that announcement on the Tannoy did you hear any
   other announcements between about 10-to-3 and then? - A. No,
   not really. Until I got out you could not hear a thing. We
   were just screaming to try and get out on to the pitch.

Q. I think after helping in the way I have described you in fact
   were injured yourself, were not you? - A. Yes.

Q.   What was your impression of the way the Police reacted to the
     situation? -A. Very slow. Very, very slow. Those who were
     experienced, like over 30, they just put the line across the
     pitch. All the younger and inexperienced ones, same age as
     myself, they were giving a hand.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I am sorry, the ones that were
     experienced and were over 3 0 - 1 did not catch what you said
     after that? - A. They were forming the line across the pitch
     and getting us all off the pitch, but what I call the
     inexperienced Police Officers between 20 and 28, whatever,
     they were having a go and trying to help.

Q.   The young ones were having a go.   The older ones were only
     concerned to get you off the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   I don't know whether you can help on
     this. The Police Officers you saw just outside the perimeter
     fence, were they all young, older or what? - A. They all
     seemed young. All under 30, anyway.

                   Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

Q.   Mr. Barnbrock, when    you obtainedyour   tickets you knewyou
     were going to go in the standing area behind the goal? - A.
     yes.

Q. When you went through the turnstiles had you decided which
   part of that terracing you were going to aim for? - A. No.

Q. Did you see any other possible means of entry to the terrace
   other than the tunnel? - A. no.

Q. When you were going down the tunnel am I right in saying you
   had already formed a view that the area in front of you was
   too crowded for your comfort? - A. It seemed like that, yes.

Q. In fact, did you make an observation and discuss it with your
                              47

                                                 A. BARNBROCK


     father and decide when you got to the end of the tunnel you
     would, if you were able to, go to the outside? - A. Yes, go to
     the sides. Yes.

Q. It was when you got to the end of the tunnel that you realised
   that plan was impossible? - A. Yes.

Q. Moving forward now, and turning to a different aspect.   In
   answer to questions a moment ago you differentiated between
   the attitudes of some Officers who apparently were more
   experienced, and the younger. Can I ask you to consider one
   aspect where that difference apparently showed itself, when
   the gate was opened and thereafter closed, did you see a
   disagreement between Police Officers, one female and one male?
   - A. Well, I can't say it was a disagreement but they seemed
   to saying something to one another and their hands were going
   like that, and the next thing they just seemed to open the
   gate.

Q. I can claim to be a little closer and halfway across the
   Pennines at least, but I have not a clue of a single word of
   that. - A. I can't say it was a disagreement or not.

Q. Don't worry about me. Don't look at me. Look at the
   microphone and think about the position. You remember the
   gate seemed to open, someone seemed to go through it. It was
   closed by one Officer and then I think opened again by a
   Police lady? - A. Yes.

Q. What seemed to you to be going on between the male and the
   female Officer as one closed and one opened the gate? - A.
   They seemed to be arguing amongst themselves.  That is what it
   seemed.

Q. Do you confirm that I have got the sequence correct. The gate
   was opened, someone came out, the gate was closed by one
   Officer, an apparent disagreement and the gate opened by
   another? - A. Yes.

                    Cross-Examined by MR. MULLER:

Q.   When the gate opened and you say something like 25 to 30
     people got through that gate, it is right that that caused    a
     pressure on you to be eased? - A. Just slightly, yes.

Q. And when that gate was closed again the pressure built up
   again? Is that right? - A. Yes, it is.

Q.   Are you able to give us any indication as to the period for
     which the gate was open when those people got out? - A. 30
     seconds to a minute.

                   Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Mr. Barnbrock, I come from even further east, so be patient
   with me. When you arrived at the turnstiles intending to go
   through, you describe seeing a crowd of people there? -A. Yes.
                            48

                                               A. BARNBROCK



Q. And that would be at about 20-to-3, would it? - A.
   Thereabouts, yes.

Q. You managed to get through the turnstiles by about what time?
   - A. About 10-to-3.

Q. So it took you about 10 minutes to get your way through? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Does that mean you were passing people in the crowd or were
   waiting your turn? - A. I just got in there, and one queue it
   seemed to come out like that on a bend like the crowd was, and
   as if it wanted to get away from this wall, so we went where
   the wall was, and we got pushed further and further forward.

Q. Does that mean you were passing through the people or were
   taking your turn to go in? - A. We were passing through people
   who were walking to the side or before us to the side.

Q. Were there many people like yourself going through? There is
   the crowd. Some are going slower and some are worming their
   way in? - A. There were quite a few worming their way through,
   or getting pushed through, whatever you want to call it.

Q. And there were people who were pushing, were there? - A. Yes.

Q. The way you were going through was the way others were going
   through, too? - A. Yes.

Q. When you got to the turnstiles, they are rather narrow, the
   entrances to the turnstiles? - A . Y e s .

Q. And unless people take their turn, again it is a bit of a
   throttle and a bit of a shove to get in? - A. Yes.

Q. Were people shoving and throttling to get into theentrances
   to the turnstiles? - A. They were just pushing each other out
   of the way, like having to squeeze in.

Q. So even at the entrances to the turnstiles when there was room
   just for one person to go through people were shoving and
   barging to get in? - A. Yes, for their lives, because they
   were getting crushed and they were worried about themselves
   first.

Q. They were worrying about themselves first? - A. Yes.

Q. And I think you did say "for their lives"? - A. Yes.

Q. Was anybody holding back? - A. How do you mean?

Q. Well, trying to do it in an orderly way, or was it just one
   scramble and scrum to get in there? - A. They were trying to
   queue up but you could not.  It needed to be a bit more
   organised.  There were more coming from the back of you and
   squashing you.
                                               A. BARNBROCK



Forgive me. You say it needed to be a bit more organised? - .
A. The lads themselves were trying to get organised a bit, and
more came in from behind us and just pushed forward against
us .
So people were trying to organise themselves to queue and be
orderly, but that was frustrated and prevented by others just
barging along and coming in? - A. Yes.

People being thoughtless and selfish? - A. Not really, no. It
is like any other match. There is usually a gap you can get
in and you go for it. It is 10-to-3 and especially the semiÂ­
final and you want to see the match, don't you? You have paid
your Â£6 or Â£12, whatever. You don't miss it. If they miss it
that's their hard luck. You want to watch it.

And that is a fair description of certainly what was in your
mind? - A. I was with our Stephen and I wanted to get our
Stephen in as   well, so I held back a little bit, but a couple
of friends in   front of me never bothered.  That is only to be
expected.

Every man for himself? - A. Sort of, yes.

To get in, if   there is a gap,   to go for it? - A. You have a
go, yes, especially if it was     like the way it was there. At
Anfield you wait in the queue     because it is organised. There
it was just like an organised     riot.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Tell me something. Did you see
any Police on horseback there? - A. Yes, there was a copper
screaming at everyone.

Did you recognise them as Merseyside Police Officers? - A.
Yes, I have seen them at the match before.

How would   they manage at Anfield and not there? - A.Because
they have   got a gate there at Hillsborough, and there is about
100 yards   to the turnstile. At Anfield there is just one big
long road   you can queue up there.

There is more room outside, you mean? - A. Yes.

     MR. WOODWARD:   You are not all drawn into the
narrowness? - A. That is what we had here, yes.

But you say there were Police around?     You saw two mounted
Officers? - A. Yes.

Did you see any foot Policemen? - A. No, not until I got
inside the ground.  There were some outside but you were
getting them down side streets or whatever.  That is all they
were doing, stopping lads and taking cans off them.

There was a Police presence on the approach to the Leppings
Lane entrance? - A. Yes.

                                                       A. BARNBROCK



    Q.   And they were ordering the fans and making sure people moved
         on? - A. Well,they were just standing on side streets, just
         talking amongst themselves, and if anyone stopped and asked
         them something they just pointed and the odd one or two were
         stopping lads who had cans of drink in their hands or bottles
         or whatever.

    Q. The Officers on horseback that you saw, you say they were
       screaming at people? - A. Yes.   The man with the moustache, I
       thought he was going to have a heart attack, the way he was
       screaming.

    Q. There was one Officer who got very upset? - A. His face was
       red.  It is the same one who was there last year. He was down
       the other side last year.  I have seen him at the match a
       couple of times. He is always the same. He is always
       shouting and screaming, leaning down off his horse and
       giving you a clout.

    Q         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Which side of the Pennines is he
         from? - A. He is one of ours.  (Laughter)

    Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   The Officers Were obviously trying to get
         some order? - A. The Police just gave up.

    Q. They may have given up. You saw those Officers give up, did
       you? - A. They didn't seem to do anything.

    Q. It had no effect what they were doing? - A. It couldn't have
       had any effect, because if you are stopping up a little
       alleyway that was there, and there are more just piling in
       behind you, there are only two ways of going.  It is up or
       down.
    Q. What you are describing is people being there and others
       piling in and piling in? - A. In a way, yes. But not the way
       like you are putting it. Your version is always different
       that it was our fault. You are saying we were running in and
       squashing each other.  It was a case of once you got in there
       you had nowhere else to go.

    Q. Who was piling in and piling in? - A. The lads were piling in,
       and the Police horse was by the gate. Once you were in there
       you could not get out because he would not let you out.

    Q.   The time you are   describing is what? - A.Quarter-to-3.

    Q.    Did you see anybody do as an Officer asked   him? - A. Yes.   I
         did myself.

    Q.   What did you do?   - A. Stood still.

    Q.   And then what? - A. Got pushed over.

    Q. Where was that? - A. Outside the terraces.

                                                    A. BARNBROCK


Q.   Outside the terraces? - A. No, outside the turnstiles.

Q.   Did you get knocked over? - A. No, but I was on my    knees
     though.  I just got back up again.

Q. May I ask you about the turnstiles and the people trying to
   get in, each one going because he did not want to miss the
   match.   Did you see any people in that area trying to barter
   for tickets or try to get in without tickets? - A. No. Even
   the lads who were on the roof he was shouting at had tickets
   in their hands. Even the lads who had come through the gate
   that had got opened had tickets in their hands, because the
   Police were trying to get them off them.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The shorthand writer is having
     difficulty not only with the accent but with the speed. Can
     you try and speak more slowly. - A. They all had tickets in
     their hands. The lads who were on the roof had tickets in
     their hands and were showing them, and the lads coming through
     that gate, they all had tickets.

Q.         MR. WOODWARD:  So the people coming through the gates,
     is that the railings there? Not the turnstile. The gate that
     lets you come into the area. They were showing their tickets?
     - A . Yes.




                                   /Q. They had them in their.

                                        A. BARNBROCK


Q.   They had them in their hands? - A. Yes.

Q.   Which gate are you talking about? - A. Thebig       gate.

Q.   The concertina gate? - A. Yes.

Q.   May I ask you about that? did you see thatactually opened?
     - A. I seen it come across.

Q. Did it open completely or just part of the way? - A. No,
   just part, about halfway.

Q. Now you say when you got inside you saw 50 Policemen. Is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Then you say more came in through the gate? - A. Yes.

Q. How many? - A. 30.

Q.   So are you intending to say   that there were about between
     80 and 100 Policemen on the   inside of the turnstiles, just
     inside? - A. Just 50 on the   turnstiles.

Q.   Did they march in? - A. They came in in pairs.     As best
     as you can get to a pair, anyway.

Q. Are you sure about that? - A. Yes. It has been verified
   in the papers as well that that had happened.

Q. Well you must not believe everything you read in the
   papers.

     When you went in through the tunnel you were not decided
     which way you were going to go but you eventually went
     to your left, did you, when you came out of the tunnel?
     - A. I took a step to my right first and ray Dad said:
     "Go this way".

Q. So if ye look at Photograph 32 in the bundle we can see
   the exit from the tunnel and the gate to the right as
   we look at the photograph, Gate 4, you would havegone to
   the right of the ixsxtel entrance as you came out? -A. Yes.

Q.   As we look at     the picture?   - A. As we look at the       picture
     yes, I was on the right as you look at it.

Q. Now when you. got in through the exit of the tunnel you
   have described seeing the quantity of people in the terrace?
   - A. Yes, it was packed to both sides of that fence.

Q.   You decided to go down   to the front? - A. Try.

Q.   And    you did go down tothe front? - A. Yes.

Q.   If we look at Photograph 4 it can be seen that in order      to
     get to the front to be a yard or so from the perimeter,
                              53

                                         A. BARNBROCK


     one can see that you have to pass at least two crash
     barriers and depending upon the way you came down you
     might have to negotiate four. Do you see? - A. Yes.

Q.   Whereabouts would you be? Could you show your position
     please on that photograph?   It looks like a supporter's
     flag hanging on the railings. - A. There.

Q. You are indicating just to the left as we look at
   Photograph 32, just to the left of that white .... A. My
   Dad was right behind it.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Behind the white shirt? - A.
     That is where my Dad would have been.

Q. That is where your Dad was, and you? - A. Right next to
   him to the side of him.

Q. That was before you got separated? - A. Yes.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD: When you got down to the front there
     you said there seemed to be more space? - A. It seemed
     to be a bit better.

Q. Did it seem to be a sufficient state of affairs suitable
   to stay there and watch? - A. Yes.

Q. It was an acceptable state of affairs at that time at the
   front there to stand and watch the game? - A. Yes.

Q. And that would be at about what time? - A. A couple of
   minutes to 3 o'clock.

Q. That was your feeling? - A. For a couple of seconds.

Q. Now you said earlier on:        "not seemed to bad down there"?
     - A. Yes.

Q. Then you said something which forgive me I may have misÂ­
   understood completely, something about:   "Here is a
   baddie coming". Were you referring to a surge or a wave?
   - a . What do you mean? What is a baddie?

Q. I did misunderstand you. Forgive Tne, it is a bit like
   cigarettes. - A. I said to my Dad: "It's all right here
   now".

Q. What happened then? - A. There was just a b i g g e r push.

Q. That bigger push must have come on you then despite those
   barriers behind you? - A. There is people sitting on them
   barriers. If they get pushed they fall off and they push
   them in front of them and just keep going down and downi

Q. Then what happened? - A. I went sideways.        I was up in the
   air then stuck.

     Q. Before that moment were people pressed up against the
        railings in front of you or not? - A. Not "pressed up",
        they were just standing by them because our Steven was
        one of them because he goes to the railings at every
        match just so that he can see.

     Q. Did you see any Policemen before this matter happened,
        before this press, before you were pushed forward outside
        the perimeter fence? - A. Yes.

     Q. How many did you see around? - A. About four.

     Q. Were they very far from you? - A. No, they were walking
        on the gravel.

     Q. They were walking along? - A. Yes.

     Q. You saw the gate open? - A. Yes.

     Q. Did you see how it got open? - A. A blonde Policewoman
        opened it.

     Q. And having opened it some people came out? - A. Yes.     My
        Dad and our Steven got out of that one.

     Q. At that time? - A. Yes, a couple of minutes-past-3.

     Q. You came out of the gate at that time? - A. No, my Dad
        and Steven.

     Q. Then the gate was closed? - A. Yes.

     Q. Did all that was happening to you caught down there from
        this moment on seem to take a long long time? - A. Yes.

     Q. The gate was opened again? - A. Yes.

     Q. You say that that happened after something was b M n g said
        between a Policewoman and a Policeman? - A. Yes, I have
        no idea what it was.

     Q. You   have no idea what it was? -A. No.

     Q. But when that was said the gatewas opened again? - A. Yes,
        they just pulled the gate open.

     Q. Immediately that conversation took place, that conversation
        led immediately to the gate being opened? - A. Yes.

     Q. Arethere steps up to get out of that gate? - A.Not steps,
        just like a wall. You have got to put your arms up and
        pull yourself up.

     Q. You could not get out of that gate easily, could you? - A.
        No.

Q. And there were other people trying to get out?-â A. Yes.

Q. The Police and everybody else tried to deal with the
   situation that then developed? - A. What do you mean?

Q. Well people did their best then, did they not? You tried
   to help? - A. Oh yes, we just tried to help each other.

           MR. WOODWARD:    Thank you.

           MR. GLASGOW:    Ho questions.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Thank you very much. You say
     you got your chest injured and also I think your hand,
     is that right? - A. I broke two fingers in my hand.

     And they are on the mend now? - A. Yes.

         Q.   What time do you think you got there? - A. 20-to-3.

         Q.   Was there any sort of order to the people milling about?
              - A. No, it was just one big crush.

         Q.   Did you see any Policemen? - A. There was a couple on   horseÂ­
              back but besides that I did not see any more.

         Q.   Did you see any Stewards? - A. No.

         Q.    Did you recognise any of these Policemen on horseback? -
              A. Yes.

         Q. How come? - A. I had seen them at Anfield.

         Q. They were Liverpool people, were they? - A. Yes.

         Q. What were they doing? - A. They were telling everyone to
            push back and to organise themselves in some kind of way.

         Q. Was anybody taking any notice of them? - A. Well as you
            got to the back of the crowd there was more people coming
            behind you so it was difficult to turn round and walk away.

         Q. Did you get through towards the turnstile? - A. After about
            five or ten minutes, yes, more ten minutes.

         Q. When you got to the turnstile did you have any difficulty
            getting through? - A. Yes, unfortunately I was trapped
            between two turnstiles, like a metal barrier and I was
            trapped there for about 20 seconds.

         Q. Did anybody release you? - A. There seemed to be a little
            break but there was a surge of people going through the
            turnstile but I managed to push myself off it, off the
            barrier.

         Q. This is the moving part of the turnstile itself? - A. No,
            there was two turnstiles next to each other, the thing
            that is separating at the wall.

         Q. The partition wall? - A. Yes.

         Q. You were stuck on that? - A. I was trapped, yes.

         Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    What, the door post in effect?
              - A. Yes.

         Q. Look at Photograph 8 for a moment will you. There is a pair
            of turnstiles and a post between them. Is that what you
            mean, you were stuck on there? - A. Yes.

         Q.         MR. PHILIPS: What was making you stuck on that
              door post? - A. Just the force from behind.

         Q. You could not get squared into the entrance, in other words?
            - A. No.

                                             D. CUNNINGHAM


     Q. Did you know where you were going once you got through the
        turnstiles? - A. No. Because there was six other lads
        we obviously went to the ground together and we got lost
        in the crowd. There was only two of us who actually got
        through who knew each other.

     Q. Had you been   to the ground    before? - A. No.

     Q. So where did you go once you got out of the turnstile? -
        A. We waited for the lads who we were with because they
        had gbrte last year and we could not find them anywhere
        so we decided to go through the tunnel.

     Q. Were there any Police Officers or Stewards? - A. There may
        have been a couple of Police Officers but not many. I
        did not see any Stewards.

     Q. Were you searched^ - A. No.

     Q. What did you expect at the other end of the tunnel? - A.
        Just the crowd like in the Kop, just get to the end and
        walk through and find a space where you can see.

     Q. Did you expect to see any barriers running down from the
        back to the front? - A. No.

     Q.. What happened when you got to the end of the tunnel? - A.
        \ We were all walking through,  there was a lot of people
        |walking through. We got to the end and the next minute
          there was a surge and then I saw Bruce Grobbelaar. That
          was the only part of the game that I saw. He was picking
          the ball out of the net. That was the only thing I saw.

     Q. Which side did you go when you got to the end of the tunnel?
        - A. I walked through the left-hand side but I did not
        know it was partitioned.

     Q. You did when you got to the end of the tunnel, didn't you?
        - A. I didn't know, no, only when I went back on thefollowing
        Tuesday did I know there was a partition separating them.

     Q. I see. Would you look at Photograph 21. You see there,
        you went to the left of that photograph, did you? - A. Yes.

     Q. Were you well over towards the wall? - A. I have no idea.
        There was that many people going through the tunnel I
        just went withyfehe crowd.

     Q. Where did you  end up? - A. I assume I was at the top   and
        then there was a surge and I was forced down.

     Q. How far down did you go? - A. About halfway.

     Q. Were you near to any barrier? - A. Originally I wasn't and
        then there was more of a |>ush and I was crushed against
        the barrier and my mate tried to push me off because he
&'                                 59

                                           D. CUNNINGHAM


          was more or less on the side of me, he tried to pull and
          push me but he could not release me and then he fell on
          the floor and that was the last I saw of him then.

     Q. So then how long were you at this barrier then? - A. I
        assume it was about 15/20 minutes, more 20 minutes.

     Q. Did the crush get better or worse during the time you were
        there? - A. It was just constant pain rammed against it.

     Q. You were rammed against the barrier itself? - A. Yes.

     Q. Did you look again afterwards and find the barrier against
        which you had been when you came back a few days later?
        - a . Yes, because when I was pulled off the barrier I did
        not encounter any more barriers and the kind of fence that
        I climbed over there was a small link and a larger link
        and I think I found the place where I climbed over and
        because I did not encounter any more barriers ....

     Q. What I want to know is whether you found the barrier again,
        later? -   A. I assume it was the one I was on, it was buckled.

     Q. Will youlook at Photograph 27.    This shows a fairly full
        view of the whole of Pen 4. Can you identify which of those
        barriers it may have been which you were against? - A.
        Number 27 did you say then?

     Q. Photograph 27, yes? - A. No, I was to the left of the goal
        post.

     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I think that photograph is taken
          just as you come out of the tunnel looking towards the left?
          - A. No,  it was buckled the one I was on, I am sure it was.

     Q.        MR. PHILIPS: Well if you look at the very first one
          in the foreground there do you see the legs of that appear
          to be bent where that white towel is wrapped round it?
          - A. Yes.

     Q.    Is that any help? - A. I don't think it was that, no.

     Q.    Can you say which part of the barrier was buckled when you
          saw it a second time on the Tuesday? - A. The middle was
          pushed down.

     Q. After you got away from this barrier you say you were
        pushed down towards the fence? - A. Yes. I did not remember
        being pulled off the barrier.   I just remember asking someÂ­
        body to get me off.The next thing I am in the crowd with
        my head in the air.   Gradually the crowd moved forward and
        I was stepping over bodies on the floor. I wanted to do
        something but I couldn't because I had no energy left inside
        me and then all of a sudden I am at the front and there is
        like two feet of space. There was a lot of people on the
        pitch but there was about two feet of space.

                                            / q . Was there anything^
                                         D. CUNNINGHAM



Was there anything in that space at all? - A . No, it was
just like a two foot space for some reason.

Was the gate open at that time? - A. I do not know. I
was totally unaware of anything that was going on for
twenty minutes.

Did you say you tried to climb up the fence? - A. Yes, I
climbed up the first time and I was kicked off.   Some
lads were in front of me and I moved a bit further along
and climbed up.   I do not know how I did it but I got to
the top and just lay there for a second and then I threw
my leg over because I just wanted to get out of there.
I was not bothered if I hit the floor.   Luckily someone
caught me.

Somebody caught you? - A. Yes.

I think then you were helped out and laid down on the
pitch? - A. Yes.

Did anybody come up to you when you were on the pitch? -
A. My friend saw me.    He thought I had died buthe saw
me and came over to me.    A few other people cameover to
see whether I was all right.

I think you were then taken off the pitch on an
advertising board? - A. Yes, a bit later on.

Then went off in an ambulance to hospital? - A. Yes.

Looking back to the time when you were in the ground,
before you were put on to the pitch, were you conscious
of any Policemen or stewards in pen number 4 where you
were? - A. No.

Did you see any outside that pen on thetouchline?   - A. I
saw a WPG and a PC.

Did you see what they were doing?   - A. They were just
saying, "Push back. Push back.       They did not seem to
understand what was going on, but   people were screaming,
like, "People are dying in here",   andthey just did not
seem to understand what was going   on.

You were really concentrating for much of the time on
freeing yourself from the barrier? - A. I could not free
myself.

Eventually you were freed from it? - A. Yes.     I was
concentrating on breathing.

      MR. PHILIPS:   Yes, thank you
                                       D. CUNNINGHAM


           Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Mr. Cunningham, you had been to a public house, you had
been to the Silver Fox? - A. Yes.

Was it very busy? - A. Yes, it was.

Were most of the people in there Liverpool supporters? -
A. Yes.

Did you take your drink inside or outside? - A. We stayed
inside.

Were there people drinking outside as well as inside? -
A. Yes.

You got to the ground eventually and you came upon the
crowd. You have told the Inquiry that there was a point
where you were caught up against the turnstiles? - A.
Yes.

You could go neither one way nor the other.   That was
because of people pushing was it? - A. Yes.

Did you see any Policemen about? - A. Only the ones on
horseback.

You only saw one Officer on horseback? - A. There may
have been two. I cannot remember.

You are saying on your way from the outer gates to the
turnstile you only observed one Officer? - A. I think it
was two*

Did you notice what those Officers were doing? - A. They
were just in the middle of the crowd telling people to
push back and to organise themselves,   I cannot really
remember what they were shouting.

Were the people pushing back and organising themselves or
not? - A. I do not think it was possible to.   There were
too many people in there.

Did you see people going underneath the legs of the
horses and between the horses? - A. No.

Going right close up by the horses? - A. Obviously there
were people round the horses but I was nowhere near that.

You were not close to them so all you could see
effectively was the man up on his horse? - A. Yes.

                                            D. CUNNINGHAM


Q. This would be at about twenty to three? - A. I was
   actually in the crowd for quarter to three, twenty to
   three, yes.

Q. So you vrere actually in this throng at quarter to three?
   - A. Yes.

Q. What time did you get through the turnstile? - A. Nearly
   five to, I assume.

Q. Does that mean you wormed your way through, you worked
   your way through the crowd, or just waited your turn? -
   A. Just carried through.   You were just pushed through.

Q. From the start of joining that group of people to getting
   through the turnstile took you about ten minutes? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Did that include going through the turnstile? - A. Yes.
   It may have been thirteen minutes, or something.   I am
   not too sure.

Q. That included being caught.   How long were you caught
   for between the two? - A. Obviously it seems a long time
   but it could not have been more than twenty seconds.

Q. On your way to the ground had you been aware of many
   people asking for tickets? - A. Yes.

Q.    Had you been aware of a number of people who had had -
     not such drink that they were intoxicated - but they had
     had quite a lot to drink? - A. There was no-one falling
     over the roads.    They were all walking in straight
     lines.

Q. I am not suggesting they were not able to walk in a
   straight line, but there were a lot of people there who
   had had drink? - A. There was no-one drunk.

Q.   Were there not a lot of people around who had had drink?
     â A . Ye s.

Q.    Thank you. Although you could not see the feet of the
     horsemen, or right by the legs of the horses, did you see
     what the attitude of the people around was to those
     Policemen trying to give directions? - A. There was just
     a lot of yelling and screaming.

Q.   The crowd was shouting at the Policemen? - A. Yes.

Q.   The crowd was hostile to the directions? - A. I would   not
     say they were hostile, no.
                                        D. CUNNINGHAM


They were yelling? - A. Yes.    I could not make out what
it was.

The Police were gesturing and shouting also? - A. Yes.

Had you been to Hillsborough before? - A. No.

Having got through the turnstile you made your way and
came to the terrace, having gone through the tunnel? - A.
Yes.

What time would it be that you got on to the terrace? -
A. As I said before, Bruce Grobbelaar was picking the
ball out of the net   so I assumed he was kicking in at the
start of the game.     That was all I saw of the game.   I
did not hear the whistle go at the start.

The situation is this that Grobbelaar was in the
Liverpool goal? - A. Yes, it was about five to.l

You saw him in the goal as you were making your way
through the tunnel? - A. Yes.

That was the first sight you saw of   the pitch and the
team? - A. That was the only sight.

The first and only sight.   At that stage Grobbelaar was
getting the ball out of the net? -A, Yes.

This appeared to you to be the very short kick-about that
would occur immediately before the kick-off? -A, Yes.

When you made your statement to the West Midlands Police
were you meaning what there appears, that you entered the
pen at about 14.55 - at about five to three? -A. Yes.

Did you know where you wanted to go? - A. No. I thought
I would just go down to the terrace, find a good spec and
stay there, as I do normally at any game.

Which way did you go, to the left or to the right? - A.
It was the left hand side.

How far down did you go before you took up the position
to watch? - A. I was pushed down.   We were at the back
and I was pushed down.   I was about fifteen feet from
the front, the ones who were stuck on the bar.

Do you know whether the game had started by the time you
got down to that position? - A. No, I was totally
unaware.

Can you show us on the photograph roughly where it was
you were?   If we look at photograph 30, photograph 29,
                                       D. CUNNINGHAM


photograph 31.   Can you see where roughly you were on
any of those?   Pick the best one which showsthe best
picture - A. I would say on 30.   There is a small piece
of the barrier, about half way down.   On the right hand
side you can just see the stanchion.

If one looks in the distance there is Finlux Video TV
sign? - A. It is just there.

That is the barrier in line with the "U" of Finlux, is
it?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    No.   You mean the one on
the extreme right of the photograph? -A. Yes.

You can only see the diagonal stanchion? - A. Yes.

      MR. WOODWARD:   How far were you from the perimeter
fence? - A. Fifteen feet, roughly.

If we look at photograph 32, does that show anywhere on
it the barrier against which you were? - A. It could have
been the one where the number 4 is, just behind that.

Somewhere down towards the centre of the pen, is that
what you mean? - A. Yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Is that the gate straight in
front of you, the one with the 4 on it? - A. Yes.

So you were directly behind that? - A. I was on the
barrier behind that, yes.

      MR. WOODWARD:   That is the barrier about half way
down the terraces that is in line with the letter 4 that
cuts through it? - A. Yes.

Did you worm your way to that position? - A. No,   I was
pushed there.

You came to a stop at the barrier, the barrier stopped
you and you could not go any further? -A. Yes.

Did you notice what was happening to the people ahead of
you as you went in? - A. No, just a general push.   We
had no choice where we were going.   I was unlucky enough
to hit the bar and the people who were around me just
carried on going forward.

This would be around the time the kick-off actually
happened? - A. Yes.

That you came to a stop, making your best guess? - A.
Yes.
                                            D. CUNNINGHAM


Did anything then happen after that? - A. People were
just screaming, "There are people dying here".   I was
just crushed.   It seemed like ages and ages before I was
pulled out.   Nothing else happened although the crush
was still intense.

       MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Were you injured? - A. Yes,
I was taken to hospital.

Are you all right now? - A. Yes.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Thank you.

       MR. COLLINS:    Mr. Darcy please.

                  PETER DARCY Called:

                Examined by MR. COLLINS:

Peter Darcy? - A. That is right.

A Liverpool supporter and you had a ticket for the
terrace? - A. That is right.

Went to the ground with three of you, together with
yourself, in the car? - A. No, just two.   My brother and
my brother-in-law.

Three of you altogether? - A. Yes.

You got there quite early? - A. Very early.

About one o'clock.   Any reason why you wanted to go in
the ground early? - A. Well, we always do. Obviously
there is always congestion at games, big games, so we get
there in plenty of time.

Had you been there the year before? - A. Yes.

I think you decided to go to the edge of the terrace? -
A. Yes, the extreme left.   As we did the year before
because we knew there was very little congestion.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    By the corner flag? - A.
Yes.


                           /Q. MR. COLLINS:    In fact

                                                  P. DARCY

Q.        MR. COLLINS:     And, in fact, as you went down to
     the ground, o bvious ly you had no d i f f ic u lt y gett in g in.
     Was there a police presence outside?          A.     Oh yes, there
     were groups of police as we w a lk ed down from where we
     parked the car.

Q. Were you spoken     to by any police?         A.   No,    none.

Q. Would you look at Phot og r ap h 35, please, in the bundle
   in front of you.    Event ua ll y you got to a p o si ti on by
   that corner flag, do you see?       I am sorry, you have not
   got there yet.   A.    No, not yet, not quite.

Q.   Got it?     A.    Yes.

Q.   You see the corner where you were of the t er ra c in g ?
     A.   Yes.

Q. Do you see a No.     6 on a gate on the corner there?
   A.   Yes.

Q.   Just at that point there are some steps up and a sort of
     area right to the side which steps up to the back.
     A.   Yes.

Q. Which part were you in?       A.   Do you see the "Finlux"
   sign at the top?      We were actu al ly direc tl y below,
   where it says, "She ff ie l d Wednesday", just about there.
   " Sheffield W ed nesday", just the "N E S D A".

Q.   You were just above that?     A.      No,    we were b elow     it.
     We were a ctually in the bottom.

Q.   In that sort of cr es c en t shape,   if that is the right
     shape?   A.   That's it, yes.

Q.   Tria ng ul ar shaped bit there. A.  Yes, just by the
     Club Call and actually on -- as against the lower terracing.

Q.   You got there, I think, by going down a c en tr al tunnel
     b ecause that was the only tunnel you could see when you
     came through the gates.    A.    Yes.

Q.   Thr ough the turnstiles.   A. Yes, like wi se      the year
     before.    We were all under the i m pr es si on the only way
     we could get into the L epping s Lane lower stan di ng
     was to a ctually go down that tunnel.

Q. Because there were no other d i r ec t io n s?      A.      No.     If
   there were, we didn't see any.

Q.   How did you get to the corner?   A.      Obviously, there was
     hardly anybody there, so we just s t ro ll ed through the
                                      67

                                                       P. DARCY

     tunnel and we knew that you turned i m m ed i at e ly left as you
     got to the end of the tunnel because we had been there
     the year before and we just sidled along and ---

Q.   Those gates - there are gates between                 the ---          A.    That's
     right.

Q. â    actual   barriers.       A.        Yes.

Q.   You just went s traigh t      along.         A.      We s t ro ll ed      right
     along and sun-bathed.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When you got to the end, there,
     there is a concrete wall.   Do you have to come down and
     go up those blue steps or do you go round --- ?  A.   That's


Q.   You do?     A.   Yes.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:        You saw the rest of the t er r ac i ng                   fill
     up as you w aited?       A.   Yes.

Q. Did the central pens or the bits behind the goals get very
   full?   A.    Yes.'" As it got nearer to K k i c ^ i o f f and
   it was strange because the pens, or this pen, well Gate 6.
   It seemed to be so unusual that ---           It was d if f ic u lt to
   describe.   There seemed to be so much h a pp en in g in the
   middle pens and the pen next to it.           You know, you could
   have put a table and four chairs down.           It just seemed
   so empty in c om p a r i s o n and when you know, obviously, what
   happened it is ---

Q.   Very full in the    middle but c o mp a r a t i v e l y      empty at the
     side pens.   A.     Yes.

Q.   You saw the teams come on the pitch?                   A.     Yes.

Q. Did they come on twice?            Were they --- ?             A.    They had a
   warm-up as normal.

Q.   Did they then go off again and come on again?                        A.       Yes.

Q.   The second time they come on,           which is about            five minutes
     before the match starts  --              A.   Yes.

Q.    Were you aware or were you looking             at the centre pens at
     all or were you c o n c e n t r a t i n g on the play er s?  A.   Well,
     obviously from the vantage point that we had you could
     just ---    When you were looking at the actual goal, I
     mean, you had to look behind, if you see what I mean.

Q. When were you first aware of a n yt hi ng u nt ow ar d or out of
   order h appening in the central pens?      A.      I think when
   people tried to come out on the side and climb out on the
   side.

Q. When was that?   Can>ou help us?     A.   It was just ---
   Well, just before the kick-off, really.     Obviously,
   the time ---   All I can comp ar e it to is when the
   actual game kicked off.  It was just prior to that.
   People started to come out.    People were s t ar ti ng to get
   lifted out into the stands and the sidepens, or climb
   out of there, and then people were gett in g lifted up
   into the Stand behind.

Q.   Your r e c o l l ec ti on is that this is just before k ic k- o ff ?
     A.   Yes.         This was a ctua ll y h a pp en in g before the game
     actually kicked off.

Q.   Then there came a stage when people started to try to
     climb over the front, is that right?      A.   Well, they
     a t tempted to. I think what was happening was, they
     were actually getting over towards ihe side and then
     people were getting on to the pitch and then being
     helped over by people who were clim bi ng up on to the
     actual front of the t erra ci ng and they were being lifted
     up by mates and friends.      There didn't seem to be any
     police activity, to be truthful.

Q.    When did people start getting out on to the pitch side?
     A.   Well, before the game was stopped, so that was six
     minutes past three, w as n' t it, so you are talking a couple
     of minutes.

Q. After the game sta rt ed ?   A.    It was very near it.
   People were o bviously ---      It must have been that it
   was diff ic ul t to go that way.    People were d ef in i te l y
   coming over the side before the game started, o b vi ou sl y
   because the p ressure must have been gett in g that big
   on the sides and on the back.       That was befo re the
   game started they were getting lifted into the Stand
   but when the game actually kicked off, beca us e people were
   then getting on to the actual terrace, or not the terrace
   the track in front of the pen, their mates who mana ge d to
   get out seemed to be going round      and then actu al ly helping
   them out.      At that stage there didn't seem to be
   anything --     you know, the police were not m oving or anything.

Q.   The police did not seem to be doing a n yt hi ng at that stage?
     A.   Not then but o bvio us ly when â you know, it sort of
     built up after that  and the Fire Bobb ie s came on and that
     is when e verybody was helping.

Q. Were you aware of the gates in the pens being reopened at
   any stage and people getting out on to the pitch that way?
   A.   To be truthful, I hone st ly can't say.

Q. What did you think was the cause of people g et ting out?
   Did you think it was a pitch inva si on or did you think
   it was o ve r c r o w d i n g --- A. No.

                                                P. DARCY

Q.    It was o v e r c r o w d i n g ? A. It was.    It looked like
     o vercrowding.           It looked very genuine.   Obviously, I
     mean, just looking at it you could see what was happening.
     Because it looked much worse than the year before.

Q.   You mean the c r o wd in g?      A. Yes, the crowding, the
     number of people in the pens, because last year alth ou gh
     it was a bit tighter in the middle of those two pens,
     the other pen was quite full, you know, they did not
     seem to be as empty.         It seemed u nb el ievable.   We were
     looking at it and there were actu al ly gaps in, you know,
     the terracing, and you could have stood.            As I say, you
     could have got (i n a u d i b l e )

Q.    That is in the side?  A.    In the side. Just the other
     side and people were dying on the other side.

Q.    Did you      hear any a n n o u n c e m e n t s over the tannoy at any
     stage?           A. I heard the ann ou nc em en t, a lt ho ug h it
     was not very clear because the tannoy s ys te m was not
     very clear.         It is not very clear at a lot of football
     grounds but so me bo dy said can we move back on to the
     terrace and clear the pitch.                     Now, I heard that
     d i s t in ct ly and then it garbled off a bit or s o me bo dy shouted
     something.

Q.    Can you help us when t he a n n o u n c em e nt was made?
     A. That was p robably 15 minutes, quar te r past three,
     twenty past, s o m e th in g like that.

Q. About ten m inutes         after the game s t ar te d? A. Yes,
   because obv io us ly       they must not have realised what was
   going on.

            MR.   COLLINS:       Thank you.

                          Cross-examined   by MR.   WOODWARD:

Q.   In relation to your view of the terrace end, you always
     expect the central pen or the area behind the goal to be
     denser than the other sides of the t e rr ac e? A. Yes.

Q.   People tend to go to the middle          to get the best view if
     t hey :c an ? A. Yes.

Q. What y o u a r e saying is on this day, a l th ou gh there were
   a lot of people crowded in the centre, youcwee amazed at
   the absence of people in the wings beca us e there was
   lots of room?       A.   Yes.

Q. And it would           look as though there could be more people
   a c c o m mo da te d   at the sides of that t er ra ce ? A. Yes.

                                                        P. DARCY

Q.   The impression, looking at it, would be that there was more
     room -- there was room for more people to come on to the
     West Terrace. A.    Yes, if they  hadn't all been in those
     two pens, u nf ortunately .

Q.   You say that there        came a point when people were climb in g
     out.   A.   Yes.

Q.   There were people climbing over from the c entre terrace
     or Pens 3 and 4 to get into the wing s?  A.   That's
     right and getting lifted up into the stands.

Q.   But that did not happen until after the kick-off, did it,
     climbing up into the Stand?     A.    Well, I remember
     actually getting lifted out or clim bi ng over, you know,
     the fence that went up along to actually make the pens.
     They were c limbing over them into the terracing, you
     know, where we were, but the actual lifting up of the
     people into the Stands, it was touch and go, there w asn't
     much in it.    You know, it didn't seem that long that
     they were a ctually get ting lifted into the Stands.
     Possibly I am wrong.

Q.   You have an i m pr es si on that the              first c l im bi ng   from the
     centre pens ---       A.    Yes.

Q.   Pens 3 and 4 was over the radial barr ie r that went                         from
     front to back.   A.   Yes.

Q. And there came a timeTafter when people were being pulled                             up
   on to the Stand.   A.    That's right.

Q. May I suggest to you that that happ en ed after the kick-
   off?   Would that be right?         A.    Well, again, all I can
   say, it was very near it.         I can remember people clim bi ng
   over the radial one that you are talk in g about going up,
   that was before the k i c k -o f f but I must admit that getting
   lifted into the Stands is a bit -- it is very near.             If
   it was, it wasn't long after.

Q.   Did things    seem to happen          very quickly then?               A.    Yes.

          MR.     COLLINS:       Thank you Mr.           Darcy.

Q.   Ian Devine,     is that right?               A.    Yes.

Q.    I think you in fact live in London                   or rather West Dray to n?
     A.   That's right.

                                                          I.   DEVINE



Q. But are a L iverpool        s u p po r te r ?     A.   That's     right.

Q. Did you drive up from London with some friends?
   A.    Well, I didn't actual ly drive. A friend of mine
   drove , you k n o w .

Q.   You   went by car?       A.      Yes.

Q. With some friends.         You had tickets for the stan di ng                    part,
   that is the t e r ra ce s?    A.   That's right.

Q. And did you get to the ground                   at about half past two?
   A.   Yes.

Q. D escribe the state of affairs at the Lepp in gs Lane e n tr an ce ?
   A.   W e l l , vihit it w a s , we had to still pick a ticket up off
   my father, you see, so when we met him just outside the
   gate, which is about 15 yards from the terracing, and we
   had d i f fi cu lt y a ctu al ly finding him because there was a
   mass of people there and then actu al ly we found him within
   say about five or so minu te s so then we had to try and
   get o bvio usly from the gates to the turnstiles.

Q.   How long did that take you?   A.   I would say in the
     region of about fifteen, twenty minutes.

Q.   That was because       of the crush,          was it?     A.        That's    right.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Fift ee n m in ut es to get through
     the t u rn st i l e s ? A. Fifteen minu te s to get from the gate
     outside the ground to the turnstile.

Q.         MR.   COLLINS:      Because of the crush.                A.    That's    right.

Q. Any police p resence that you were aware of?
   A.   Yes, by the gate i ts el f there was about ---        I must
   have only seen about three or four policemen.           From the
   gate to the t ur ns ti l e there was two M ou nt ed Policemen.

Q.   Were they doing any good?              A.      Not   really, no.

Q.   How did it compare with other sorts of crowds that you
     have e xp er i e n c e d g et ti ng into grou nd s? A.   I went to
     Sheffield the year before and I was stood in the same end
     and the year before it was just smoother.              It was just
     t h a t ---

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Did you say just s i mi la r?
     A.    Smoother.      Like, you could just walk from the gate
     to the tur ns ti le w ithou t anybody being in the way.

Q.   Same time?     A.      Yes,   same time.

Q.          MR. COLLINS:     What was the d i f f e r e nc e ? Why was it
     d i fferent on the p re vi ou s year?  A.        As far as I was
                                      72



                                              I.   DEVINE



     c o ncerned there wasn't any o r ga n is a ti o n outside the
     ground.     It was just a mass of people.           It was a case
     of, to me the police should have been asking ---
     They stated a lot of people didn't have tickets and
     they knew that before the game so why d i d n H they ask?
     Like, I ahve been to a lot of grou nd s and on big games
     like that they have like a police line and they will
     ask to see your ticke ts before you can go past.

Q. Nothing    like that?        A.      Nothing at all.

Q. Once you got in, there            is a tunnel   in front of you.
   A.   That's right.

Q.    Were you aware of any other way into the t er ra c es ?
     A.No, b ecause as you come through    the t ur ns t il e s
     the first thing you see is the tunnel.

Q.   And there were no signs to show a ny wh er e else?     A.   No,
     all it was, on the l e ft -h an d side as you come through
     the t u rns tile you could see p eo pole that had gone to the
     other t u r n st il es on the other side of the wall who were
     going to the seated area.

Q.   So you go down the tunnel.    When you get to the end of
     the tunnel there is a barrier s tr ai gh t ahead of you, a
     fence, you can either go to the right or the left.        I
     think you went to the right to Pen     3?   A.   That's right.

Q.   And it was pretty     crowded, was it?        A.       It was very
     crowded.

Q.   Eve nt ua ll y you get y ou r s e l f down near the divi di ng fence
     between 3 and 2, is that c orr ec t?          A.   Well, what we
     decided when we got in there, o bv io us ly b ec au se we knew there
     was still t h o us an ds outside or I don't know how many people,
     there was a lot of people o ut side still, so one of my
     friends said, "Let's try and get away from the entr an ce
     to the tunnel because there is more people coming in"
     so we then dec ided to try and get over that way, you know,
     to try and obvi ou sl y let the people come in behind us,
     if they could, that is.

Q.    Did you d ecide that it was  not healthy tostay in Pen       3?
     A. It wasn't.        We were all t hi nk in g it was until one
     of the ads a ctually said, you know, "This       is crazy" because
     we were actually getting crushed then, so by him saying
     that we then got over from Pen 3 into ---

Q.   Pen 2 next door?      A.        Yes.

Q.    You climbed over that fence.   Had the game started by then
     or had the people come out on the pitch?     A.   The players -
     just as we got into Pen 3 the players were more or less
     coming out on to the pitch.

                                               I.   DEVINE



Q.    When you climbed over, what was the stage?          Had the game
     s tarte d?  A.   It was just star ti ng then.

Q.    And did you then see people begin to try to get over
     the front per im et er fence?  A.      No, what it was.   There
     was people in front of us o b vi ou sl y getting over the
     fence from 3 to 2 so then we got over and then the
     section we got over, I would say was not even half
     full, so we got over there and that is when we started
     seeing people g etting on to the front fences, you know.

Q. Were you aware of any Police reaction to what was going on? -
   A. I remember there were two or three Policemen actually
   standing on top of the railings pushing people back.
   Obviously you could see there were going to be problems, and
   the Police were pushing the people back into the pen. They
   were trying to get out because they were getting obviously
   crushed.

Q. Did there come a time when the Police appeared to realise what
   was going on and help people out? - A. There was one Policeman
   in particular I can remember that was actually on the fence.
   He was actually screaming at the other Police Officers to say,
   "Lift them out". He was actually lifting people out himself.
   Apart from him the others just carried on pushing people back
   in.

Q. Were you aware whether the gates in the perimeter fence were
   open or not at any stage? - A. They were not open.

Q. We know they opened at some stage. Did you see them open or
   not? - A. No, because by this time there was more and more
   people getting actually on to the pitch, getting over
   themselves if they could, and there was this Policeman pulling
   people over. Once the game stopped, one of my friends I was
   with he was still actually as far as we knew was in the first
   pen, pen 3, so I said to the other lad, "I'll go and have a
   look for him and you wait here". By the time I had got back
   towards the fence the Police were actually starting to jump
   over themselves, but the gates were still not open.

Q. Thank you.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

Q. Mr. Devine, you told us you had experience of grounds other
   than Hillsborough? - A. That is right.

Q. In particular, I want to ask you about the checking of tickets
   at a point away from the turnstiles. - A. Yes.

Q. The previous year had you been to Hillsborough? - A. I had.

Q. Did you have your ticket checked away from the ground the
   previous year? -A. I did.

Q. Can you tell us the circumstances surrounding that particular
   check?   Were you on your own? Was there a cordon of Police?
   What was the position? - A. No, there just like Liverpool fans
   flocking to the game, and just like a mass of Liverpool fans
   again, but obviously not as many as like when we arrived this
   year, and the Police were just saying, "Have you got tickets,
   lads?", and we said, "Yes,", and they said, "Can we see your
   tickets?". So we showed them the tickets and they said, "Off
   you go then".

Q. Was that an organised check or a random check?   Was it one

                                                    L. DEVINE

     Policeman on his own or a cordon across? - A. There were a
     number of Policemen altogether.

Q. And did each of your party have his ticket checked the
   previous year? - A. That is right.  I was with two people and
   they actually got their ticket checked, so I was taking for
   granted the Police would do everybody. Whether they did or
   not, I don't know.

Q. I want to move forward to just one other aspect of your
   evidence. Can you confirm you have just told us that at the
   same time one Police Officer was pulling people out as his
   colleagues were pushing people back? - A. One was trying to
   pull people out, and he was actually - well, I couldn't hear
   what he was saying but you could see the reaction on his face,
   like the anger on his face, because he was screaming at other
   Police Officers or whoever they were, Policemen or whoever, to
   actually say.   Obviously he was the first one to realise what
   was going on, even though the fellows were only 5 or 10 yards
   along the fence themselves.  I don't know what he was saying
   but he was actually having a go at them.

Q. Apparently doing one thing, shouting at someone who was
   apparently doing something else? - A . Yes. They were more or
   less pushing people. The people that were on the top of the
   railings, they were pushing them back, and he was telling
   them, "Look, get them out", and but this time people were
   getting dragged out the back as well into the seats.

                   Cross-Examined bv MR. WOODWARD:

Q.   Mr. Devine, can I ask you about 1988.  In 1988when you    had
     gone to the ground where did you parkyour car?   - A. Iam
     sorry?

Q.   In 1988 did you go to the match? - A. Yes.

Q.   Where did you park your vehicle? - A. I did not go in a
     vehicle.  I went on the train.

Q.   How did you get there in 1989? - A. In a car.

Q.   Did you arrive at Wadsley Bridge station in 1988? - A. I don't
     know what station I was. We arrived in the citycentre.

Q. You did not come on a football special? - A. I came on a
   normal train from London to Sheffield.

Q.   You set off from Middlesex again? - A. Yes.

Q.   You had come from   the same base? - A. Yes.

Q.   So you had arrived at the main railway station in Sheffield? -
     A. Yes. I presume it is the main one.   I don't really know.

Q. From London? - A. Yes.

Q. In answer to Mr. Jackson you told about having your ticket
   checked. - A. That is right.

Q. Do you recall where that was it happened? - A. Exactly.   It
   was right outside - you have got a gate section, about 15
   yards from the turnstile.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Look over that way.   May be you
     can see?

Q.       MR. WOODWARD:   Somewhere by the gates in front of the
     turnstile? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q. What, at the gates? - A. Yes, at the gates. You have the
   gates here open and you can go in that way to the seated area
   or that way to the standing area.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Were there mounted Officers last
     year or just foot Officers? - A. The ones checking the tickets
     were obviously on foot, were not they.

Q. Were there mounted Officers as well, or not? - A. Not that I
   can remember. Not right outside the gates.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   What time was it last year you arrived at
     that position by the gates to the turnstiles? - A. We actually
     had our tickets round about 2-ish to quarter-past-2. I can't
     remember to be honest, but round about 2 o'clock.

Q. And this time what time did you arrive at those gates? - A.
   2.30.

Q. So there was a difference of about half-an-hour or so? - A. it
   is hard to say.  It could have been 2.15. Around 2-ish.   It
   was round about 2 o'clock time.  It could have been quarter-
   past-2.  I don't really know.

Q. What you are saying is there were Policemen at that time by
   those gates? - A. That is right.

Q. In a complete line or just individual Policemen here and
   there? -A. There were Policemen together.  The ones that
   checked my ticket, there were about four or five of them
   together.

Q. Did you notice whether there were other Policemen by those
   gates at that time in 1988? - A. There were Policemen for the
   seated area entrance and for the standing area.

Q. About how many for the standing area? - A. The ones that
   checked me, there were about five fellows there. There were
   more Police, because by this time there were buses pulling in
   right outside the gates, and they were checking as the people
   were getting off the buses as well.

Q. At this time when you came to Hillsborough in 1989 there were
   a lot more people there than when you had arrived in 1988? -

     A. I should say so.   In the section between the gate and the
     terracing, yes.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        The gate and the turnstile? - A.
     Yes, I am sorry.

Q.       MR. WOODWARD:    Did you see the mounted Police on this
     occasion? - A. This year?

Q. Yes. - A. There were two between the gate and the turnstile,
   and that was it.

Q. Did you see what they were doing? - A. They were telling
   people to push back. To me there was no way people could push
   back and still allow the people to come in to get into that
   section to the turnstile.   You couldn't do it. The Police on
   the horses at times were actually charging through the
   people to try and do something about it, but that was just
   causing more problems.

Q. Let us be clear about this. Do you mean what you say, that
   the Police were charging their horses through the crowd? - A.
   I do mean what I say, yes.

Q. They charged through the crowd? - A. They charged through the
   crowd with the horses.

Q.,How many times did they do that? -A. On a number of
   occasions.  There were two mounted Policemen, and they started
   off at the turnstiles and were going out back towards the
   gates on the horses through the people.

Q. There may be a difference between charging and going through
   the people? - A. No, I am talking about charging.

Q.   Galloping through? - A. Yes, I am talking about making that
     horse get people out of the way.

Q.   You mean a sort of gallop through the people? - A. That      is
     exactly what I am saying.

Q. That is what you would have the Inquiry understand? - A. That
   is right.

Q. That is an exaggeration and and a gross exaggeration of
   anything that happened, is not it? - A. No, it is not, because
   obviously you are going to get a lot more people are going to
   say the same thing because that is what I saw them doing,
   because we were actually screaming at the Policeman because
   there were a lot of young children there that were actually
   getting crushed by having the crowd there.

Q. Have you told anybody before about Police charging through the
   crowd? - A. The two people who saw me from the West Midlands
   Police, I told those two Policemen who actually came to see
   me, and they thought it was a bit off as well.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I would just like to understand.
     People don't always use words the same way as everybody else.
     You have used the word "charge", and I think accepted the word
     "gallop" at one stage. What pace are we talking about these
     horses going through? - A. If you can just picture it, you
     have got a lot of people in the one area, and for that
     Policeman to do anything he was trying to get the people back.
     He was going through the people with the horse. He was using
     the horse's weight to push people back

Q. I am just asking you what pace? Are we talking about the
   horse moving at ordinary walking speed or what? - A. At first
   it would have to, but when people started to get pushed it was
   going through a lot of the people.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   Do you mean to describe the Policeman on
     his horse separating the crowd by making his horse go forwards
     through it? - A. Yes, to move people.  That is what I say.  I
     don't know what the aim was. That is what he was doing.

Q. You have heard of the Charge of the Light Brigade, have you? -
   A . Yes.

Q. You don't mean "chargeâ like horses charging, do you? - A.
   What I say is the fellow was on the horse and he went through
   the people on numerous occasions to make those people move,
   and he was going in between the gates and the turnstiles back
   and forwards like that.

Q. At a. steady pace or a fast pace? - A. It depends on how quick
   the people moved, did not it?

Q. You agreed with "gallop". - A. No, I said he was charging
   through it.

Q. Very well.  Was this Police Officer saying anything as he
   charged? - A. He was saying, "Can you move back?", and people
   were saying to him, "How can people move back because you are
   still allowing people to get from the gate to the turnstile?".

Q. You eventually got through the gate to the turnstile, did you?
   - A. Eventually, yes.

Q. Did you have trouble getting into the turnstile? - A. Yes, I
   did.

Q. What was the problem getting into the turnstile? - A. You
   are facing the turnstile one minute and the pushing comes
   again, and because the fellow is moving this horse around
   the place people are getting pushed this way and that way.
   So one minute you are going towards the turnstile and you
   end up going by the brick wall between the turnstile.

Q. Were the people who were   with you as you got to the turnstiles
   making their way through   the turnstiles? - A. Yes, but as soon
   as you got in you handed   your ticket in and you got in, so I
   got some air, because it   was crazy out there.

     Q. Did you see anybody refused admission through any of those
        turnstiles? - A. No, I did not see one person.

     Q. Were you holding your ticket as you were approaching the
        turnstile? Had you got it in your hand to show to anybody? -
        A. No, I had my ticket in my pocket.  I took it out just as I
        got to the turnstile.

     Q. Did it take you long once you got in the turnstile to go
        through it? - A. No, not really.

     Q. Was your ticket torn? - A. Yes, the section was ripped off
        that was supposed to be.

     Q. Were you being pushed by people? - A. What, before I got
        inside?

     Q. Yes? - A. Yes, getting crushed.

     Q. Were you doing any pushing? - A. No, you can't even move your
        arms. Your arms are like that. You are moving.

     Q. You were not doing any pushing? - A. No, everybody was just
        crushed against each other.

     Q. But you yourself were not doing any pushing? - A. No.      The
        pushing was coming from the back, was not it?

     Q. You started at the back, did you? - A. That is right.

     Q. Can I ask you about on the terrace.  You went along the tunnel
        to get to the terrace. Did you have any problem getting along
        the tunnel? - A. No, the tunnel was empty.

     Q.   About what time isthat? -    A. Round about 10-to-3s roughly.

     Q.    And as you walked towards the exit from the tunnel you get a
          view eventually of the goalmouth and the pitch? - A. No, you
          could not see the pitch.

     Q. Why was that? - A. Because you have a square tunnel and as you
        get to the end of the tunnel you have got like I am standing
        here, a row of people. You could not see anything until you
        tried to get through the people.

     Q. And you went which way?    To the left or the right? -A. To the
        right.

     Q.    What was the state in the pen on the right as you entered it
          at that time? - A. It washeavily congested.

     Q. You made your way from one side of that pen right across to
        the other side? - A. As we came through we went that way.

     Q. Eventually you climbed out? - A. Yes, we got over the side
        fencing.

     Q. So you moved right across from one side of that pen to the
        other? - A. We came through the tunnel and went up to the
        right.

     Q. You went diagonally into the right? - A. As we came through we
        veered right.

     Q. Have a look at the photograph, please. Photograph 33 shows
        the goalmouth, the goal and the tunnel through which you came?
        - A. That is right.

     Q.   You made your way through that crowd of people to those
          railings we see running radially up and down the terrace on
          the left-hand side? - A. Yes, and the fence we got over has a
          red banner in front of it.

     Q.   There seem to be more than one red banner there.    - A. It is in
          front.

     Q. Could you hold it up? - A. It is there.

     Q. That is the fence that lets you into the next pen? -A. Yes.

     Q. So you got that distance from the tunnel to that fence through
        that crowd? - A. Yes.

     Q. Were you making your way diagonally across? - A. When first we
        went in we did not have any intentions or thinking then,
        "Let's get into the next section".

     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Counsel is not asking you what you
          thought.   Just what actually happened.  Did you go right
          across or diagonally? - A. We went into the pen but we were
          still on the right, and then we went more or less there to the
          fence.

     Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   Did you go under any barriers to get to
          that fence? - A. We went under one barrier.

     Q. You went under one? - A. When we first went in I thought we
        stand under that barrier thing and the crushing would not be
        so bad if we stood in front of the barrier.

     Q. You were able to get through the people, were you? - A. It is
        like any big game like that.  If you want to see the game it
        is not a case of pushing and shoving.  It is just that you are
        like that and in certain areas you will get a view and watch
        the game.

     Q.   You work your way through the crowd? - A. That is right.

     Q.   That is what you did? - A. That is right.

     Q.   And you   were able to do that at about 10-to-3? - A.   Yes.

     Q.   Did you   see the beach ball being thrown about? - A.   No.

                Q. What were you wearing that day? - A. I was wearing a T-shirt,
                   a pair of jeans and a pair of trainer shoes.

                Q. What was the colour of your T-shirt? - A. Green, I think.
                                                                       I
                Q. And you climbed over the fence between the two pens? - A. Yes.

                Q. At about what time was that? - A. That was just as the game
                   was starting.

                Q. At what stage did you decide, having worked your way to a
                   position or intending to get to a position to watch the game,
                   you wanted to get out of that pen? - A. It was not actually me
                   decided.   It was my friend. He said, "Look at the next
                   section.   It's empty. Let's try and get in there", because
                   there were people actually getting over themselves.  That was
                   roughly just as we got under that barrier that we thought this
                   would be handy, no pushing and that.

                Q.   You were climbing over because you saw more space? - A. It was
                     like that, because we knew there was still people coming from
                     outside.   We did not see any other exit to let the fans in, so
                     everybody was obviously coming down that tunnel.

                Q. But you were climbing over because you saw a clearer space to
                   stand in? - A. That is right, because it was too crowded and
                   congested in there.

                Q.   You were    not being forced out?    - A. No, we tookit upon
                     ourselves to get out because it was too crowded in there.

                Q. Thank you.

                          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Thank you very much, indeed.

                          We will break off now until 10-past-2.

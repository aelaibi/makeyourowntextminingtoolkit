             Further          to    the w r i t t e n     recollection              that         I submitted           following        the

             Hillsborough              Football         Stadium Disaster                    on    the        15th of A p r i l    1 98 9

              (150489),            I have       been    asked      to     elaborate              and     clarify a few           of    the

              details         contained          in     it,



    To'P"    On      page     2    I re f e r    to a d e a d      m a n at y ^ate           8.        All     he w a s   wearing       was

             a      p ai r   of                                    boxer/shorts.                   I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r     what

              colour         t h e y w e r e.     He    was    very       overweight              and        it wa s   obvious        to me

              that      he wa s      dead,




              I carried            on to    the       area    at   the     b a ck      of    the        tunnel     where      I saw about

£$Xe.         10 b o d i e s       laying       there.        I went       and      checked             if    there    were   any      signs

              of     life.         I checked          their    pulses        and am          convinced            they were       dead.

                                                                                                                                        S1269A

         I carried         on       u n t il    such    time       as    I found        somebody           I could          hel p .      I

         just    generally             made      people       as    comfortable            as     I could,            putting          them       in

         the    recovery            position          and    removing          outer     clothing           to m a k e       them
                                                                                           /
         comfortable.                 I was      also       directing          ambulante         cr e w s       to    the    most       needy

         and    urgent         cases.           The    only    other         officj/r      I can        n am e       who    was    working

         near    me     wa s    POL PC 3Q89            Jane    WARRILLQW/               I d i d n ’t r ec a l l            the    names       of

         the    other      policemen.




         At    this     stage        we    began       to    put    c o at s    over     the     faces          of    the    people          we

         knew were         dead.




         The    youth      that        I carried            w i t h POL PC8Q9 ELSAM,                 was        about       12 to       14

4®       years    old.          He w a s        slim    bu i ld ,       he   had   fair        ha ir.       That's          as m u c h       as    I

         ■-emembe r .          He    ha d a      re d L i v e r p o o l      shirt      and     l i g ht    trousers.              We

         carried        the     youth          to a    cordoned          off    area     outside           Gate       A on       the    lane

     ^   running        adjacent           to'the       River       Don.// We w e r e           told       by a n o t h e r       police

         thereon.




         I then       just      made       myself       useful          as   per   my    recollections




         I am    unable         to     describe         in a n y        useful     detail        any       of    the       other       bodies

Dear Sir,
    I would wish the enclosed letters to be placed before the inquiry into
the disaster that occurred in the fa Cup sewl final between Nottingham
Forest and Liverpool on 15th April 1989.
    Hie letters were written tot
            The Secretary of the Football Association
            the Minister of Sport
to express wy very serious concern at the disgraceful overcrowding that was
allowed to take place in the t-eppings Lane Ter face area in the 19§8 send
final on 9th April. No acknowledgement or reply was received from either
party. In the cafce of the Minister of sport, for $6rae inexplicable reason
toy secretary has not addressed it to the Department of the Enviornment but
to a Liverpool address. Regrettably, I did not spot this mistake at the
tiro*?.
     in the light Of the above correspondence you will understand »y anger
*?hen X had to witness (from the Leppmga Lane end of the South Stand) the
appalling scenes on the 15th April, 1989.
    If X can be of any fucthet assistance, please do not hesitate to
contact me.
                                Yours faithfullyi

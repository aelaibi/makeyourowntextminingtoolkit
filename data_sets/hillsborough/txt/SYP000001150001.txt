          Having       sat     down      I. i m m e d i a t e l y    heard        frantic,          radio        transmissions                   and

          it    became       cle ar      that       serious         problems            were       developing           in       the       ground

          s o m e w h e r e , I heard          reference            being        made     to       opening       a gat e           within         the

with      me    and       a    couple        of      civilians,               I covered            the         mans     f ace      over          and

we     walked        to       the    exit       gate       between           the    N o r th S t a n a          and     the       Kop«           We

were      told       to       place       the     body       on     the      ground       at      the      side       on a m b u l a n c e            in

which       people            were    being          treated,:          there       was     one      other           body     present             on

the     g ro u n d ,      the       ambulance           wa s      just       to    the     ri ght       of      the     exit       gate.

An     officer         was      requested             to    stay        with       the    body,         someone            did    and        I

returned          to      the       scene       of    the      incident.

i think         it w a s        at    t h is      point        that         1 first       saw a senior                  officer           'Caking

this     eased         the      situation             considerably and                    more       and        more       people         were

able      to    be     released.                Together            with      some       Liverpool              supporters              and       a

obviously            dead,          yet    the       supporters              were    rushing            saying          t h at     we     had         to

said      to    the       supporters              that      the        man was       dead         and      t h at     there        ‘

I    ALBERT    RONALD MARSH of !
WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS


I was born on the                                 I am unemployed but I was an
electrician       by      trade.        I have been employed since        the         steel
works closed in 1980.


I became a steward for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club some 16
to     17 years ago.           I am now Assistant Chief Steward of the                West
stand.     I became Assistant Chief Steward about               4 to 5 years ago.
I     have always served as a             steward in theWest stand.         The Chief
Steward is Stuart Thorpe.


I am paid £12 for a league match and £18 for an F .A Cup match.


There     is a general division of responsibility.                 Stuart       Thorpe
is     responsible        for     looking    after the    seated    area.         I     am
responsible           for B and C gates and the two stairways leading to
the     seated        area.     The     deployment of    the   stewards      is        our
responsibility           and I cannot remember when we agreed upon                this
general       division         of responsibility.       It has existed for            many
years.        Stuart           Thorpe        of   course does      have      overall
responsibility           but     the    actual number    of stewards       that        are
allocated        to     the West stand is something upon which I am                    not
able     to    comment.         That is a matter for Stuart Thorpe and                 the
Club.


The normal number of stewards is 26.                In my view, 26 stewards is
a     perfectly adequate number for a league match.                 Full     capacity
crowds normally only arise on semi finals and extra stewards are
taken on for these games.                Extra stewards were taken on for last
years     semi        final and this years semi final.
There are three gatemen allocated to each gate and six stewards
are allocated to each stairway leading to the seated area.                       The
gatemen and these stewards normally work a rota system so                    that
there is always at least one steward at the bottom of the steps
leading       to   the     seated   area and   at   least   one    gateman        in
attendance for each gate.           A gateman receives £12 per match and
a     steward £6 per match but for an F .A. Cup match they                receive
£18 and £9 repsectively.            B and C gates are exit gates.


At no time have I discussed with the police how stewards should
be    deployed at the ground.          Nor have I ever been consulted             by
the     police     and     to my knowledge nor has     Stuart     Thorpe     with
regard to the deployment of stewards and their duties.


Since the West stand became an away area only, the police                     have
developed a system for segregating and controlling fans.                    As     I
have described, the North West pen is kept empty and away                     fans
a-ce channelled into the centre pens and South West pen.                     Firsr
of     all, the South West pen is closed by the placing              of     metal
barriers       near the snack bar area.        Police officers are by            the
barriers to prevent any access.            This means that with the           gate
to     the partition wall shut, fans can only go into              the      centre
pens.     The police then open the South West pen presumably                  when
they     consider the centre pens are full.           I have not      seen       the
police        seal off the centre pens by preventing           access through
the     tunnel.          On a few occasions when there          hasbeen      avery
large     number         of away fans, the police open          thegate      to the
partition wall           and allow fans into the North          West pen.    Ihave
seen this done once this season although I cannot remember                       the
match.


The     police     have     retained complete control over        whether        the
North     West     pen     remains an empty area.     I have      asked     police
officers        on occasion including the senior police officer               that
fans     at     the back of the South West pen who are unable to                 get
                                                    -   3   -




through          should           be directed to the North West pen.                   When        this
type        of segregation occurs, the gate to the partition wall                                    is
kept shut and manned by police officers.


When        I have asked the police to direct fans to the North                                    West
pen     this is not because I believe the South West pen is                                     full.
It     is        not possible either from the seated area                         or     from       the
staircases behind the stand to ascertain whether those pens are
full.        It is usually where people on the South West pen are not
prepared to move forward and there is a build up of fans                                        going
up to the corner of the West Stand.                             I would not have any clear
idea        as       to whether these pens were full.                     Of course, if            fans
do     approach              any     steward including myself,             we     would       direct
themto           a        pen.     The stewards at the bottom of                the     staircases
leading              up     to     the seated area are responsible                for     checking
tickets               and        those   on   the       gangways    are     responsible             for
directing                 fans     to their seats and ensuring that the                   gangways
are clear.


It     has been a practise of the police to put metal barriers                                        in
place        across the South West corner as I have mentioned.                                  I     do
not     know when the police decide to allow access to                                  the     South
West        pens           during league games or whether they                   do     put     metal
barriers              across the tunnel to the centre pens or whether                               they
simply           put        police officers in position to stop                   fans        gaining
access.



Prior        to the West Stand becoming an area for away                               fans        only,
the     West              Stand was of course divided between                   home     and        away
fans.            The        home fans had the North West pen and most                         of     the
seated           area, and the remainder was taken up by the away                                  fans.
The     same              distribution occurred even when the radial                      barriers
were not in place.


This        distribution of home and away fans caused problems as                                     it
                                                         -    4   -




    was     difficult             at    times to prevent home and                       away     fans     from
    mixing particularly in the area behind the turnstiles.                                          It     was
    for     this        reason         that the partition wall                    wasbuilt.         I      did
    suggest        to a senior police officer some seasons ago                                    when     the
    home and away fans distribution caused problems that certain of
    the A - G turnstiles should be allocated for those standing                                             in
    the South West pen and the remainder of those turnstiles should
    be     for     those to be seated where the away                              fans    use     only     the
    staircase           nearest         to C gate and to allow                    away fans using          the
    centre        pens        to also gain access.                    My suggestion was            ignored.
    I remember at that time there was no partition wall.


    The     purpose of this suggestion was to avoid so                                    many     standing
    and seated fans from becoming mixed up together.                                       It would have
    made         things          easier     for      the       stewards       on        that     particular
    staircase.


    There        have       never been stewards positioned                         on     the     terraces.
    It     is     too dangerous for stewards to be put on                                 the ~ terraces.
    They        would       be     prey to abuse and violence by away                            fans.      In
    addition,           I     regard it as custom and practise that the                                 police
    have        always exercised control over the movement of fans within
    the     ground          and      also of course outside the ground.                            We     rely
    upon        the police in the event of any ground misbehaviour and we
    have         never        been      asked       to       check     or    be     responsible            for
    controlling             the      flow      of    fans into the            various           pens.      The
    police        have        both      before and since the West Stand                          became     an
    away fans area only, always exercised control.


    The     police          have       never        attempted           to    interfere           with     the
    deployment           of       stewards.          I have asked            the        police     on     many
    occasions           for them to deploy police officers at the bottom                                    of
    the     steps and usually this request was granted.                                   At      the     semi
    final        on 15th April two police officers were attached to                                       each
    staircase.

The    major'          means    of access in and out of the centre                        pens     is
through          the     tunnel.        To    close         off    the    tunnel,     would        be
irresponsible             as this is the only major exit and as the                          doors
open       inwards,        it would constitute a trap in the                       event     there
was    an emergency and the fans rushed out.                             I have never        known
the police to close the doors to the tunnel.


I     am        responsible for ensuring that the stewards                         and     gatemen
are        in    position,       that there are sufficient numbers,                        and     to
deal       with any problems that may arise.                        The same procedure             is
followed           for every match whether it be a league match, an F.A.
Cup match, or indeed an F.A. Cup semi-final.


Before           the commencement of each season, a meeting is                            held     of
all        the     stewards      and     gatemen at           the    Club.         This    meeting
provides           for the registration of the stewards and gatemen                               who
all recieve a photo identity pass.


A briefing also, takes place at the meeting relating to                                     safety.
The procedures for fire are explained and also the position                                        of
the extinguishers at the ground.                        Any alterations in                emergency
procedures are also explained.                      For example, any change in                    the
code        for     an     emergency evacuation to be                    announced        over    the
public           address       system.       It is only in recent years                   this    has
been        introduced.          This    is     largely a           direct    result        of    the
disaster at Bradford City Football Club.


This            disaster       made     stewards        far       more    safety      conscious.
Normally,              representatives from the fire brigade and the police
attend           the     meeting who provide talks on fire safety                          measures
and        on the duties of stewards. One year we were shown a                                   video
of the Bradford disaster.


The fire officer gives instructions on which appliances                                      should
be used for different types of fire, how to use the                                   appliance,
 and       where        those appliances are situated in                     the    Stand.         The
                                                  -    6   -




stewards            on the West Stand have not been trained in first                                  aid
although           I seem to remember that a representative from the                                  St.
Johns Ambulance Brigade does attend the annual meeting and                                            may
have     given          some basic instruction on first aid.                           Doug        Lock,
explains the emergency evacuation procedure and the code.


Stewards          and     gatemen          are issued           with    written        instructions
titled            "Instructions for Match DayStaff".                       This document               is
issued        at        the annual meeting of the stewards.                      Stewards             are
also         provided         with       photo-passes             which      are worn         on      the
steward's          jacket.              Doug   Lock, the Club Security                  Office,        is
responsible             for       the training and supervision of the                         stewards
and     gatemen.          There are also briefings by the police inspector
responsible             for       the Leppings Lane end before any                      big        games.
This     is usually to remind the stewards to tear off the corners
of     the         tickets         for those     taking           seats      and to      seek         the
assistance          of        a    police      officer in the event               of     any        crowd
misbehaviour.


Clothing          for stewards consisting of a yellow jacket is                                    issued
at     each       match.          The     normal practice               is for         stewards        or
              '                                       T'CiltV           j-S ft
gatemen            to hand over their pass in return for a                        jacket.             The
jacket        is handed over shortly before the end of the match when
the     stewards          or gatemen are paid.                   The stewards          and     gatemen
report        to Stuart Thorpe.                He has a cupboard in the snack                        room
at     the        rear    of       the West Stand seated                area     where        all     the
jacketsare kept.                  Each steward           or gateman produces a                booklet
together          with his pass and these are taken and Stuart provides
a     jacket in return.                  A steward or gateman can only gain                         entry
through           one     of the gates provided the photo identity pass                                is
shown.            Even if a steward is known to the gateman, if he                                   does
not produce the photo identity pass, he is not allowed in.


Both     Stuart           and       Iare guided by the match               day     instructions.
These        instructionsare               important in                two respects.           First,
emphasis           is placed on all exit gates being manned.                                 Secondly,
                                        -    7   -




it    is not the responsibility of stewards or gatemen to                       become
involved       with spectators who mis—behave.                That is a matter for
the     police       and    in the event of any problem           a   steward        must
obtain tho aaaiatanoa of tha p o li c e .


There     is also a requirement that the stewards must                      arrive     at
the ground at least two hours before a match.                     That requirement
may be changed depending upon the importance of a match.                             How­
ever, some stewards are unable to arrive at the ground on                            time
because of work commitments, i.e. many work a Saturday morning.
If a steward or gateman arrives very late he is allowed in                            but
he    is not able to be a steward or gateman for that                       particular
match.

I     normally        gain     entry to the          ground   through the      players'
entrance.             I go to the office near the players' entrance                   and
collect     the       keys for B and C gates unless             of    course       Stuart
Thorpe     has        already done this.             I then walk over to     the     West
Stand.         I also take the keys for the padlocks to the gates                      to
the entrance to the seated area.                     I make sure that the padlocks
are     unlocked and I then go up to the seated area to make                         sure
that     the fire extinguishers are all in working order.                       I    then
go back down stairs to the B and C gates to make sure that they
are     unlocked.          I then stand at the C gate and             wait     for    the
stewards and gatemen to arrive.


I     have not been told to check the fire extinguishers but I                         do
so     before every match.         B and C gates are the steel concertina
           The lock is built into the gate.                   I provide the keys to
Stuart     Thorpe          to be returned to the office or if I forget                 to
do     this,     I    return     the keys once          the   match   has    finished.
However,        it is normal for these gates to be unlocked before                      I
arrive     by the ground staff.             They also lock up the gates after
a match.

Although        the    gate is unlocked, a gateman is able to keep                    the
                                               -    8   -




gate     in a closed position by operation of a safety catch.                                     It
is     not     possible for the gate to be opened from                        the     outside.
Before        each game I check that the stewards are in position                                 at
the     bottom        o£     tho   a-taira   and    also    that   tho     gatomsn        are     in

position.


The     three        gatemen to the C gate are                normally       Malcolm        Bain,
Mr.     Ian Marsh (my son), and Richard Beadsley.                           They have           been
the gatemen throughout this season.


They have their own routine.                   Before the kick-off all three are
in attendance at the gate.                   Once the game has started,                   Richard
Beadsley remains on the gate and the other two go off to                                    watch
the game.           At 3.15 pm he is relieved by Malcolm Bain.                        At        3.30
pm     my son relieves Malcolm.                Just before half time                all     three
resume their duties at the gate.                        They remain in position until
the     resumption           of    play for the second half,                when     the        same
routine is repeated.


There        is a similar routine for the B gate.                        This is     something
worked        out     by the gatemen.         At 4.35 pm my son normally                    opens
C gate.        B gate is also opened at the same time.


We     have done two practice evacuations this season when a                                    code
is     read     out on the public address system.                        I cannot     remember
the     exact        wording       but it is something like
                                             Mr. Thorpe is responsible for                       the
stewards        in the seated area.                The stewards are responsible for
the     gang-ways and also for the fire exits.                           Once the code           has
been     read        out, all the stewards must ensure that they are                              in
position        on the gang-ways.             There are two emergency gang-ways
leading        to two exits. These exits are at the front of the west
stand        seated        area.     On the right hand side,               the      fire        exit
leads     to        steel     steps leading down to the ground                     level.        As
part     of the evacuation procedure the B and C gatemen open                                   the
gates.         The     stewards at the bottom of the stairs ensure                          that


                                                                          cue
                                           -   9   -




the     gates       to the Stand are open. With regard to the                              terrace,
the     gates leading onto the pitch are opened.                          In the event                 of
a     fire,     those      spectators in the central                pens        must        proceed
■through t h o t u n n e l .


The     stewards and gatemen collect their money just before                                      4.40
pm     when     they hand back their jackets.                     The B    and         C     gatemen
normally hand back their jackets at 4.40 pm.


I     now turn to the events which took place on 15th                                 April        1989
at     Hillsborough.             I arrived at the ground at about                      10.45        am.
The stewards and gatemen had been told by Stuart Thorpe at                                          the
previous match that they would have to arrive at the ground                                            at
least     4     hours      before kick-off.            I    collected           the        keys     and
checked        the fire extinguishers.             B and C gates               were         unlocked
but     kept        in the closed position.                I checked      that         the        gates
leading        to    the seated areas were unlocked.                       I     collected             my
jacket.        I waited for one of the C gatemen to arrive.                                 Normally
all stewards and gatemen gain entrance through this gate                                         ^/fter
having        displayed their identity photo pass.                        The     police           also
use this gate if they wish to gain entry or where they wish                                            to
take away any spectators they have arrested.


One of the C gatemen arrived and I went off to check the                                          other
stewards and gatemen under my control.


I     went     upstairs to         the seated area            and    arranged              for         six
temporary stewards to be placed on the gang-ways to the                                       seated
area.         The     gang-ways are known by the letters U, V, W,                                 X,     Y
and     Z.     Each temporary steward was placed with an                              experienced
 steward.           The    experienced steward              was      asked        to        explainthe
 seating       order.        I    remember that we had               ten extra stewardsfor
 the    West        Stand.         I was told this by Stuart               Thorpe           at         the
 previous match.


 Once     this       was     done, I remember spending some time                           with        the
                                                              -      10   -




stewards            just chatting and waiting for spectactors to                                             arrive.
At     1.30 pm there were very few people in the West Stand seated
area.   I knew that Liverpool had taken all their ticket
allocation  which meant   a capacity crowd.     I could    not
understand why there were so few people arriving at that time.

At     about 2.30 or 2.40 pm I went down to C gate.                                                  I could       hear
very        loud         banging            on the gate by the supporters                             outside.         I
told        the         gatemen          not to open C gate.                         The gatemen        were        the
three         I     have already mentioned in this statement.                                           Supporters
were        attempting               to get over the roof of the turnstiles                                       which
serve the west terrace area.


About         a     dozen           police officers were                         behind        the     turnstiles.
They        were          searching the supporters as they came through.                                              It
is     quite            normal           for almost a dozen policemen to be                                  in    this
                          The police were stopping a number of the supporters
that        had climbed over the turnstiles but a number were allowed
through once their tickets were checked.


At     one          point a policeman shouted to the gatemen to                                             open     the
gate.         The purpose was to eject a number of supporters who                                                    had
climbed             over           the wall without tickets.                            The gate       was        opened
about             two     or three feet.                   The gate can operate on                      a     special
mechanism               whereby           the       gate can be opened only                          some     two     to
three             feet.            The    gate can be held                      in      this    fixed        position
without the gatemen having to use any physical force.


As      the         police were about to eject some supporters I                                             saw     one
supporter throw his counterfoil through the gate.                                                     It was clear
that         a      number of supporters had assembled outside                                          the        gate.
Over         a period of about 5 minutes the police were                                              involved        in
ejecting                supporters.             I remember that there were a                            number        of
supporters                being ejected then quite suddenly the                                       gate        opened
and          40         to 50 supporters, perhaps more, burst                                    through.            The
gatemen, with the assistance of the police, closed the gate.
                                                -   11   -




I   left      C gate and went to the bottom of the right hand                                    steps
to the seated area (i.e. those nearest C gate).    I told the
stewards to closa the crate at the bottom of the stops.  There
is a bolt to the gates. The purpose was to prevent any of
those       who were meant to be standing from gaining access to the
seated       area.            Only those supporters with a counterfoil for                              a
seat     should          be     allowed       to the seated          area.     The         stewards
normally          tear        the corner off the counterfoil just in                           case     a
supporter           throws        the     ticket     over      the     stand        to         another
supporter.  I remember that I was man-handled by a group of
Liverpool supporters. I was not so much kicked but trod upon.
This     was       quite deliberate.             I was not seriously                injured           but
did     suffer          a bruise to the thigh.               At this time the              stewards
were becoming the subject of much verbal abuse.


I     went back to C gate.                A policeman shouted "Open the gate". I
cannot       remember if one or more police officers shouted and nor
can     I    remember whether those words were repeated^                                 The     three
gatemen        were       in     position, standing next to                  each        other        and
directly          behind        the gate.       I was only a few yards                   away     from
the     gatemen and was standing next to the barriers which form a
section behind which the programme seller stands.


The     gate       was opened almost straight away once the                              order        was
given       by     the police.          I did not see who opened the                      gate.         I
simply        heard        the    police       shout     the    order.         The        gate        was
definitely closed immediately before the order was given.


Once        the     gate       was opened, the supporters               who     came           through
headed            for    the     central tunnel leading to the                  terrace.               At
that        stage it was too late to do anything to direct supporters
elsewhere.              There     was     a    great surge       of     supporters              coming
through           the    C     gate.      I had no idea at this               time        how     many
supporters there were outside.

A     few minutes after the gate was opened I heard a message over
one     of     the        police     radios.       The message          was    simply       "pitch
invasion,           pitch     invasion".           The police officers               behind       the
turnstiles              disappeared and ran towards the south west                         corner.
The     gatemen and myself were                left on our own.             I asked a senior
police        officer        whom       I now know to be            Superintendant              Roger
Marshall           to     provide       some police protection.                Within       a     few
minutes        police officers arrived through C gate.                             I had no idea
that the match had kicked off by this stage.


The     next        thing     I remember is seeing                  supporters       and    police
helping        to       carry people out through the central tunnel and                               C
gate.         I went outside the gate and saw Inspector Sykes.                               He is
a     regular           officer in attendance at the ground.                       There were         a
number        of people laid out in the lane by the gate.                             I was told
by     Inspector Sykes that these people, about 15 in number, were
dead.         He told me not            to go inside, i.e. towards the pitch.                     I
had     no     idea        at this      time what was happening               on    the     pitch.
There        was     nothing       we    could do.           The     fans   were     aggressive
although           there    were no physical acts of violence. I was                            spat
at     once        or twice and there was a great deal of verbal                            abuse.
No     evacuation procedure was announced over the public                                  address
system.


I     did open the gantry gate for the fire exit to the right hand
side     of        the west stand seated area.                     I went up to the         seated
area     at        about 5 pm.          The majority of the crowd had                  gone.          I
stayed        there        until 5.15 pm and then went outside C                       gate.          I
remember           seeing    bodies        being put into             ambulances.          Shortly
afterwards I went home.


This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and believe.

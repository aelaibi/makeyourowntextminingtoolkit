            HILLSBOROUGH PRIVATE PROSECUTION
            ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD

            1 am grateful to you for your letter of 5 November.

            I now en close a copy of Ms Adlington’s letter of 11 November, and the
            reply of 6 December. At present, I do not think th a t I require any further
            assistance from you, but I will revert to you if it becomes apparent th at
            you can help in some further way.

            You will wish to note paragraph 20 of Ms Adlington’s letter, with its
            request th at the DPP waive his privilege in the advice given by leading
            counsel in 1990. I am inclined to think th a t it is a m atter for you to
            decide how to respond to this request.

          1999. In those circumstahces/swe trust .tbit you will understand why we considered it
          necessary to seek an extension of time in 0*4$r to respond.

          For ease of reference we propose to deal with. each of the subjects raised by Ms Adlington
          in the order in which she wl^ressed them h&Self in her letter to you.

          Procedural matters

          The histoiy of the matter has been accurati&ly^et out by Ms Adlington.

          Procedural irregularity - .                                        .• ...

          It is quite wrong and misleading-for Ms Adltegtan to assert that the CPS did not give her an
          opportunity to make frbsh^ubnassions. ■

          The judgment of the Divisional Court made it clear that the CPS would be required to
          reconsider the decision not to intervene , and discontinue proceedings in relation to the
          allegations which form the basis for counts 4an d 5 of the indictment.

          Ms Adlington was well aware of the feet that we, who represented Mr Duckenfield, relied
          upon the fact that no prin^ facie; evidencfrexisted as the basis of the submissions advanced
          to the court. She hadTaiopl^- .time to m a k £ ,fu rth e r representations to the CPS if she had

            The statement of Mr Kelly cannot possibly, in our judgment, provide any evidence to
            support the information laid and discontinued by the Director.

            We are in no position-fttidisp^ the reas^ ^ Ms Adlington gives for not seeking judicial
            review but we would :?t^e^ifcai; any agpcation would inevitably fail because she had
            chosen not to make repteS&taifoHs to t h e ^ S at the appropriate time after judgment in the
            first review proceedings. . .             ::f—.

            She is, with respect, wrc^gjwhenvshe sajn^that the alleged “alternative remedies’7 would
            have resulted in a refusal of relief. This js an adaptation of an argument advanced and


            Ms Adlington has personally i^tributed ta^ie delay in the case by making representations
            to the South Yorkshire-.Pblice.Authority seeding to argue that no power existed for them to
            provide financial assistan<5e..to the. defendant. She then instructed counsel to advance the
            same:

            Each application made on behalf of the^defendant to the Divisional Court has been
            successful in whole or in. part. Ms Adlinjgton is wrong when she says that the application
            for judicial review was “lost” It succeeded insofer as it related to the matter now being
            considered.

            Insofar as it is relevantheqwckjstanding c^|he funding of the defence case is also wrong.

            The changed legal content',: ;>/

            Ms Adlington is again wr6ngwhen she says that “the prosecution decided not to attempt to
            reinstate the charges at. committal”. She could not reinstate them; the Director had
            intervened and discontinued.. She could not possibly have sought committal on charges that
            had been discontinued..                     -.

            We cannot comment upon adyice .which sh^ says that she has received from counsel. No
            copy of that advice has been disclosed andUve do not know the basis upon which the advice
            was given.

             course of action has not ^een attempted bbfeause the result would be a further intervention
             by the Director

             Alternative remedies for the defence: the powers of the judge

             The alternative remedies identified,,exist in^gvery case. If these were a bar to the obtaining
             of a nolle prosequi then Ec^/fe^ould nevs&fce entered.

             Ms Adlington is wrong to suggest thataio power exists to enter a nolle prosequi on
             individual counts of an indictment. We notethat no authority is cited to support her view
             and the 1933 Act doesnotsupporther interpretation.

             The merits of the application . . . .

             There is no evidence on :c<>niits -4.'and 5, tiieVDirector was correct in his assessment. The
             statements of Kirton arid Kelly add nothingio the state of the evidence as at the conclusion
             of the Taylor Inquiry.

             No "course of justice”.,ex ited at- the timetfhB words spoken by Mr Duckenf eld were said.
             There could be no attemp§f.the ^ords werfeiiever spoken to anyone who was subsequently
             charged with investigat^the-ilisaster. iV&Kirton and Mr Kelly do not advance the case at
             all.

             The state of the evidence is. as it was when counsel advised the Director in 1990.

             The reason why the representations of Ms Wellington dated September 1998 were not sent to
             you was because we sent-a copy of our request for a nolle to her enabling her to send any
             representations that she. wanted..

             It is quite wrong for her-to .assert that the, decision not to prosecute in 1990 was flawed or
             that any "‘deception” operated bri.those thetfadvising.

             This allegation was fiilly investigated by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith at the time of the
             Scrutiny and found to be vdfodUtfoundatioji^

             111)1November 1999

         Dear Attorney,

         Regina vDuckenfield and Murray

         1         I am the solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group, and laid the
                   informations alleging crimes on the part of the above named at the Leeds District
                   Magi spates Court in July 1998. As such I was the prosecutor before the matter was
                   committed for trial in J u ly 1999, and I continue to act as instructing solicitor.

         2        I write to set out the Crown ’s submissions on the application by Mr Duckenfield to
                    you to enter a nolle prosequi in relation to counts 4 and 5 on the indictment currently
                    before the Crown Court sitting at Leeds. A copy of the signed indictment is attached
                    for ease of reference.

         The Attorney’s position

         3        Although the application is addressed to you, wc appreciate that you cannot take the
                   decision in this matter in the light of the principles set out in Re Pinochet No 2,
                  because you personally advised the Director of Public Prosecutions in 1990 that no
                   criminal prosecutions should be instituted. Neither can the matter, in our submission,
                  be delegated to the Crown prosecution Service, which would then be invited to act as
                  iudex in sua causa. However, we nonetheless invite you to take note of the contents
                  of this letter particularly in relation to the written a d v ic e of August 1990.

         Procedural aspects

         4        The Crown Prosecution Office came to the view that there was no prima facie case on
                  what is now count 4 on the indictment However, the CPS initially declined to
                  interfere in the prosecution on those charges having decided it would not interfere
                  with the prosecution on the manslaughter charges. The Divisional Court ordered a
                  reconsideration.

               Accordingly, the CPS, acting through Christopher Mr Newel], reconsidered its
               previous decision, and took over and discontinued the prosecution in relation to the
               charge which is now count 4 of the indictment. It is apparent that the decision was
               based upon the opinion of Mr Newell that there was insufficient evidence to
               constitute a prima facie case on that charge.

               Procedural irregularity

           6
               Unfortunately, the CPS did not give us an opportunity to make fresh submissions
               upon the question of sufficiency of evidence. The Crown regards this, therefore, as a
               decision flawed by procedural impropriety and a breach of natural justice. If they had
               provided such an opportunity, we would have referred to the statement of Graham
               Kelly, enclosed, which we did not have when we made our representations to the CPS
               in October 1998.

           7   The prosecution did not seek judicial review of the CPS decision for the following
               reasons:

                      (a) We had “alternative remedies”, such as the ability to put these counts on
                      the indictment in the event of committal by virtue of section 2(2) of the
                      Administration of Justice ( Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933. This potential
                      remedy would no doubt have led to the refusal of relief even if the Divisional
                      Court had agreed with us as a matter of substance.

                      (b) We were afraid of delay. After service of process in July 1998, the
                      defendants have delayed these criminal proceedings by a variety of devices.
                      They applied to the CPS to take over and discontinue the proceedings.
                      Having failed, they applied in February for judicial review, arguing, among
                      other things, that the CPS decision not to take over and discontinue the entire
                      case was irrational. A further application for judicial review by us, launched in
                      April 1999, would have caused further unacceptable delay in the hearing of
                      these proceedings.

                     (c) We were afraid of cost. The South Yorkshire Police Authority agreed in
                      1998 to fund the entire criminal defence of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray,
                     including out of pocket expenses, and was willing, it appears, to fund ancillary
                     applications for judicial review. Two applications for judicial review have
                     been brought by the defendants, one of the decision o f the CPS, another of the
                     decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority in March 1999. The first of
                     these they lost. The second of these argued that the Authority had been wrong
                     to decide, in February 1999, that it had no power to grant financial assistance.
                     In this they succeeded. They were then given their costs by SYPA of
                     applying, for the most part unsuccessfully, for review of the CPS decision
                     Another application mooted was an application for judicial review of a
                     decision of the South Sefton Magistrate Court in July 1998 in relation to an
                     application for their costs. Summonses had originally been brought there by
                     the prosecution, but dropped because, though the court had jurisdiction to hear
                     the case, no process existed to compcl the defendants to appear there.

            The changed legal context

            8      The position is now different. In the light of the CPS decision, the prosecution
                   decided not to attempt to reinstate the charges at committal. The defendants were
                   committed for trial on the charges of manslaughter and misfeasance, having argued
                   unsuccessfully that there was no case to answer, and that the proceedings were an
                   abuse o f process.

           9      Pursuant to the 1933 Act, and on the advice of leading counsel counts 4 and 5 were
                   added to the indictment by the Crown after committal as charges disclosed on the
                   committal documents. Count 5 is entirely new. It is based upon the same facts, but
                   was never considered by the CPS- The transcripts of evidence given by the
                   defendants to Lord Taylor and the Inquest were in evidence at committal, and those of
                  Mr Duckenfield contained admissions to telling lies to the Taylor Inquiry as part of
                  his evidence about the disaster generally.

           10    The Crown wishes also to emphasise that, where a prosecution is discontinued under
                  section 23 (3) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, by v ir tu e of section 23 (6);

                          “The discontinuance of any proceedings by virtue of this section shall not
                          prevent the institution o f fresh proceedings in respect o f the same offence.”

           11     This subsection does not even contain a requirement for fresh evidence to come to
                  light before fresh proceedings are instituted.

           Alternative remedies fo r the defence; the powers o f thejudge

           12    Even if there were insufficient evidence to support a case to answer on those counts
                 disclosed on the committal papers, the judge could grant a voluntary bill on
                 indictment on those counts if there was sufficient evidence now available. He himself
                 referred to this power in the preliminary hearing of 3rd September 1999, and has set
                 aside time in the week of 20th December to hear argument on this matter, should the
                 application for a nolle prosequi fail. We enclose a copy of his observations on that
                 matter on     September 1999.

           13     If the Crown is wrong in its position, which is entirely a matter of law, Mr
                  Duckenfield’s remedy is to ask Hooper J. to quash those counts. The judge can hear
                  oral argument and is therefore in a much better position than Mr Newell to assess as a
                  matter of law whether or not a prima facie case is made out on those charges, It is
                  beyond argument that Hooper J. can quash those counts under the Administration of
                  Justice ( Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933 or by way of abuse o f process; see R v
                  Bedwelty JJ ex parte Williams [1997] AC 225.

           14    Further, the judge has set aside four days from 4* January 2000 for a full abuse of
                 process hearing. The judge has ample power to find that it is an abuse of process to
                 prosecute for those offences, even if they are sound in law.

           15    It is not accepted that, since the powers conferred by the 1933 Act, whatever had been
                 the position at common law, a nolle prosequi can be entered on selected counts in
                 relation to an indictment. It was surely the intention of Parliament that the power of
                 the Attorney-General, exercisable without the power to hear submissions or evidence,
                 exists to prevent a trial; not to quash individual counts. The power in relation to
                 individual counts is surely the prerogative of the judge.

          The merits o f the application

          16    On the merits of the application, it is the submission of the Crown that the case
                against Mr Duckenfield on counts 4 and 5 is very strong. It will be noted by the
                Attorney-General that the letter of Winkworth and Sherwood of 13th October fails
                utterly to deal with the substance of the case or the strength of the charges. Our
                representations of 2nd October deal with the facts, and the enclosed statements of
                Kirton and Kelly throw further light on the matter.

          17    We are surprised that the defence solicitors should not have enclosed copies of the
                annexes to our representations of September1998. You are asked to exercise a
                discretion, which, as Winkworth and Sherwood should know, must be exercised in
                the light of all the circumstances of the case. You will note that the prosecution
                produced abundant primary material to show that the DPP decided not to prosecute in
                1990 on the basis of selected statements, some of which had been improperly edited
                to exclude statements by South Yorkshire police officers. It is necessary to look at the
                actual excisions to appreciate the significance of the deception.

          18    In all the circumstances it would be wholly inappropriate for a nolle prosequi to be
                 entered for counts 4 and 5 of the current indictment

          The advice o f leading counsel to the DPP in 1990

          19    Although for some reason the advice of leading counsel to the DPP in 1990 has been
                sent to the South Yorkshire police, who retain a copy, and has been disclosed to Lord
                Justice Stuart-Smith, who quoted it in part in the report of his “Scrutiny” in 1998, it
                has not been disclosed to the Crown in the prosecution of this case.

          20    It is believed that the DPP was given a misleading account in the final West Midlands
                 Police Report about the question of gates being forced. Paragraph 8 of the
                 representations made by the prosecution on 9‘h October 1998 refers to this. It is
                 believed that the attention of leading counsel in 1990 could not have been directed to
                 the true facts. The Attorney is invited in his capacity as statutory superintendent of
                 the Director of Public Prosecutions to invite; the CPS to waive privilege in respect of
                 this advice, so that the judge can determine the abuse of process application on 4th
                 January, and the motion to quash on 20th December, on a fijlly informed basis.

            The Winkworth and Sherwoodjibe

           21     The final paragraph ofWinkworth’s letter to you of 13,h October contains an
                   apparently gratuitous jibe, alleging, without giving particulars, that 1 have made
                   misrepresentations. This is connected with the fact that I am employed, rather than in
                   private practice.

           22     I have asked Winkworths for an explanation of this, and for the provision of an
                   example of a misrepresentation that I have made, but have received no reply. I
                   enclose a copy of the ruling by Mr Cadbury, the Leeds stipendiary magistrate
                   dismissing the argument that the prosecution was an abuse of process, and upholding
                   the integrity and motives of the prosecution.

           23     I should, in turn, be grateful to be given an opportunity to deal with any new matters
                  raised by the defendants in reply to this letter.

           24     I shall be pleased to deal with any queries arising out of this letter.

           Yours faithfully,

                 f ld iA M c jt v H   .

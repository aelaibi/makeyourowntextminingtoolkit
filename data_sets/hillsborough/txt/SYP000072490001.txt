             I am a Liverpool supporter and on Saturday 15th April                        1989   (150489),      I

             travelled by coach to Hillsborough Football Ground.                         The coach company

             was BarneS Travel and I booked the coach myself.                         I had bought the

             ticket from Anfield.             £6 standing Leppings Ln.              I travelled with

             Liverpool about         11.05am          (1105), we travelled directly to Sheffield

             with no delays en route.                  We arrived in Sheffield about 2pm           (1400),

             We parked on a dual          carriageway with the other coaches,                 there were

             Police Officers         in the area as we left the coach.                 Fans were well

             behaved in gpnd spirit,              some were drinking from cans of beer.               We

5 .0 .&      arrived at'             ntrance to the ground at 2.10pm                (1410).    It was packed

   AT '   people to get into line without much success.             I h a d n ’t been to the
 U   U
          ground before,       but   I just followed the crowd through.        I passed

                  h the turnstile,         I handed in my ticket and retained the stub

                            •1) I d i d n ’t see any other gates opened.

                         tu nne 1 in front of me and went     into it, there were people in

                          it wasn't too busy.      I d i d n ’t see any Police Officer or

                        by the tunnel.      When I got to the terraciryg I went to the
                                                                P 6 -rV
          right and stood at a position I estimate to be R3/on the attached

          Grid.        It was now about 2.25pm     (1425) - it was very uncomfortable,

          The area was packed - I was still with                              ."   Jtt remained

          uncomfortable but about 2.55pm (1455) there'                         ush behind

          which resulted in me moving to a position I estimate to be F<b on the

          Grid.        I had been pushed forward and you normally expect to be able to

          move back however this w a s n ’t the case,        I was just trapped in the

          position.        I found myself surround by people who were         injured and

          having problem breathing.            I c oul dn’t breath myself but some had

          passed out.       The   people around me were standing.         About 3.25pm    (1525)

          I was pushed out backward by other fan into the tunnel.                  Lots of the

          fans around me had got blue faces           I realised that they must have died.

          Once    I had been pulled out I made my way back to the coach.               I met up

          with              and we travelled back to Liverpool'.          I ’d been having paxn



                                                                              During the crush

          on the terracing        people were shouting to the Police for help but they

          seemed to either        ignore   it or not know what to do.

          I feel that Liverpool        fans should have been allocated more tickets.

PART 16      SCHEME FOR PEACETIME MAJOR DISASTERS                             . V.i.*


SECTIOIT 1    OBJECT                                    .                          \ '

The purpose of -the outline scheme described; herein is to establish -
predetermined arrangements for South Yorkshire County Fire Service
participation in the overall activities of the County Council in the
event of a declared Major Disaster in Peace Time*


SECTION 2 .DEFINITION' OF MAJOR PEACE TIME DISASTER

A major disaster nay occur in many forma and:.to some ext.ent would be - . ;
determined .by the. local environment* .   ,. :r.   .; ,

The number of casualties involved should not be regarded as the main
criterion for defining whether an accident reaches the magnitude of ;a
Major Accident. Other factors such as the type of accident, the -
probable number of services which will be involved, and the time Which -
will be taken up in reselling the injured must all be included in the
assessment,:e.g. an air crash on an airport involving fifty injured,
who with relative ease can be removed to hospital, is,no;t necessarily a
Major Accident, .whereas a collision involving two trains with fifty
people buried under wreckage could be termed a Hajor Accident ^because of
the length of time and the extensive operations which would be involved
in releasing trapped victims.         -.-.v     •       'vlr       ■

This being so there is a general ;agreement nationally that a peacetime ...
major disaster is defined as:— j :    /    •      r         ‘‘ :    •'•I-: '

"Any disaster or any serious disruption of life arising ,with little or ..
no warning, causing or threatening death or serious injury to, or
rendering homeless, such numbers of persons in excess of those which
can be dealt with by the Public Services and Local Authority operating
under normal procedure and which calls for special mobilisation and
organisation of those services." ..   -          j •              ■->v...\5.


SECTION 3     VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT                               .. - -

South Yorkshire covers 35 miles from East to West and 20 miles from
North to South; in comparison with most other parts of the country
large areas of the County are heavily industrialised.;:It-is.criss--- ;
crossed with motorways, airways, and main railway lines? -historically- -
and more significantly South Yorkshire has suffered extensive' damage...
by flood and gale.

The main potential for disaster invthis County.is seen, to result from*— ,

(a)   Widespread flooding           : •'     :                                          " • :•

 (e)   Aircraft crash

 (f)   Railway accident


SECTION 4   CODEWORD FOR ACTIVATION PROCEDURE

The codeword "Catastrophe” will be used by Police, Fire, Health and Local
Authorities as a preface to all initial alert and call out messages.


SECTION 5   ACTIVATION PROCEDURE

When a major disaster occurs it is probable the Police will receive the
first notification, and consequently act in accordance with their "Major
Disaster" Scheme. This scheme is designed to instantly alert all
essential services, i.e. Fire, Ambulance, Medical Authorities, Railway,
Aerodrome authorities etc.                                                             ^

The Police have a responsibility on site to control and to co-ordinate •
aspects relating to the disaster so as to enable Emergency Services and
other bodies to discharge their responsibilities, r

The extent to which each of these services is involved will depend upon
the nature of the disaster but, whatever form the incident may take and
notwithstanding the size of .the task facing each of these services the
Senior Police Officer on site will be responsible for the control and
co—ordination of action at the scene so as to enable the Emergency
Services and other bodies to discharge their responsibilities.
Exceptionally and whenever a large scale fire is considered to be a
major disaster, then the Senior Fire Officer on site will be in control
of all activity to extinguish the fire; in these circumstances the
Senior Police Officer on site will remain responsible for the control
and co-ordination of all other related activity on site.


SECTION 6   COUNTY/DISTRICT CO-ORDINATION

Whenever a major disaster occurs in South Yorkshire a "co-ordinating cell"
will be set up in the Emergency Planning Section at County Hall and
manned full time irrespective of the number of local government authorities
actively involved. This cell will be manned as quickly as possible after
the Police have notified the County Chief Executive of the disaster through
the County Emergency Planning Officer and will commence to operate if and
when the effects of the disaster escalate beyond.the resources available
to the District Council* ill which it has occurred. .This cell will be the
channel of communications for all reports and all.enquiries of the County
pertinent to the disaster.                               '. . .


SECTION 7   PROCEDURE FOR DESIGNATING "OPERATION CATASTROPHE"

Where Police and/or Ambulance Services are already in attendance at an
incident the Senior Fire Service Officer present shall not unilaterally
designate the incident a "catastrophe".

Consultation shall take place between all .three services and in such
situations the incident will be interpreted as a "catastrophe" by agreement
of the Pblice and Ambulance Services.
                                                                                1449

          301TH YORKSHIRE METROPOLITAN AMBULANCE SERVICE

                     MAJOR INCIDENT PLAN


 Introduction

A major incident is a situation that we can never predict, it can occur
at any place at any time. The object of this plan is to enable us to
deal with any incident in an organised professional way, by each and
every menfcer sticking to their own job and knowing exactly what their
role is.

The Ambulance Service has more problems regarding manning levels than
the other two Emergency Services especially at nigjtit, the weekends and
Bank Holidays. This problem alone makes the construction of a plan
such as this a major task due to the difficulties that can occur in
contacting off duty personnel. The plan has been designed to be simple,
easy to read and each duty itemised so individuals can concentrate on
the areas that concern than and all unnecessary information left out.

Attention mist be drawn to the following factors

The colour of Safety Helmets will denote the duties and rank of the
wearer i.e.

1.   Ambulance Personnel transport         =   White
     Leading Airbulance Person             =   White with Black Band
     Emergency Support Team (FootSquads)   =   Yellow
     Ambulance Officers                    =   Blue

2.   All personnel must ensure that their H. V. jacket and suitable
     footwear are taken to the scene of any major incident with other
     items of personal safety equipment.

It is most important that the Incident Officer remains in or close to
the Ccmnunicatipns Vehicle, this being the centre for directing and
monitoring the whole operation. He must also ensure that a V.H.F. R/T
Handset (which will be marked) is given to the first available crew
that depart for the designated hospital so it can be handed over to the
Liaison Officer who will be on duty.

Antoulance crews must remain with their vehicles at all times, their
role at a major incident is transportation and Ambulance Nursing whilst
mobile, all rescue and treatment duties will be performed by the
Emergency support team which are Ambulance Personnel without arrbulances.

Delegated officers will be issued with a U.H.F. R/T Handset to enable
communications to be made via the mobile Control.

The support and cannunication vehicle will be based at Headquarters, this
vehicle will contain all the necessary equioment and drivers will be
allocated by Control.

To enable the plan to run efficiently, it is essential that all personnel
concentrate on the objectives and check list of their individual role.

as requested.

As you will be aware, the Council's functions and responsibilities are
not primarily designed to provide an emergency rescue service and its Emergency
Plan is supplementary to the Police Scheme for major disasters.

In the case of the Hillsborough disaster, the Local Authority broadcast
an appeal for trained Social Workers to attend the incident and it was
in this area of care, comfort and counselling of the bereaved that the
Local Authority's services were primarily directed following the incident.
Further details of the action taken by the Council's officers can be provided
by the officers concerned, if required.

With reference to your query regarding specific emergency plans, I can
confirm that the role of the Authority does not require the preparation
of a specific plan for a major emergency within the Hillsborough Stadium.

Yours faithfyi*Lly,
     11      I____

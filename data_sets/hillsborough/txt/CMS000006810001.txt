MEETING WITH THE ALL PARTY COMMITTEE ON FOOTBALL

1.   The all party committee is an ad hoc body of about 150
interested members. Six members will attend the meeting with the
Secretary of State; Tom Pendry, Joe Ashton, Joe Greenway, Alan
Meale, Jim Lester and Menzies Campbell. Attached at Flag A is a
brief pen portrait of those attending. They intend to raise the
following issues;

      a.   all-seating at football stadia;

     b.   The nature of Government support for the European
Championships 1996;

      c.   Ticket touts; and

      d.   Police Charges.

All-Seating
2.   On all-seating I attach at Flag B the relevant briefing
that was provided for the Adjournment Debate on 8.5.92.
Following a meeting with the Football Licensing Authority (FLA)
and the Home Office, last friday we are drafting a submission
recommending that a review take place quickly, outlining the main
options, suggesting what its terms of reference should be and
including a draft letter inviting views on the issue.

3.   I attach at Flag C a recent report on all seating published
by the committee responding to the FLA's draft guidance on safety
certificates issued in November last year. The committee
supports the FLA's endeavour to make positive use of its safety
certificate responsibilities in improving safety standards,
including taking into account amenity issues and the role of
stewards. A revised version of the guidance is expected out
soon, although we have suggested to the FLA that it would be
sensible to wait for the outcome of the all-seating review and
for us to see the Home Office legal office which apparently takes
a rather narrow view of what the FLA can do. The committee takes
the view that all-seating for Third and Fourth Division sides
cannot be justified, given that there is to be no extension of
all seating to other sports, such as Rugby where the numbers of
spectators in attendance could be far in advance of that at lower
division football clubs.



                                                                   1
4.   You will wish to ask the committee to expand on whether they
are in favour of retaining standing at all Third and Fourth
Division grounds, or a more selective basis where the FLA judges
it to be safe, or ask for safety improvements to be made, or for
the timetable to be extended. It might also be helpful to hear
their views on all-seating for the Second Division clubs.

European Championships 1996
5.   I attach at Flag D a revised note on the European
Championships 1996, which makes clear that the Government is
providing moral and diplomatic support for the Championships.

Ticket Touting
6.   Ticket touting and police charges are both matters for the
Home Office. At Flag E is a letter from the Prime Minister to
Mr Pendry setting out the position on ticket touts and explaining
that while the Government intends to introduce legislation on
this subject, lack of parliamentary time means it will not be
possible in this session.

Police Charges
7.   On police charges both Mr Atkins and Mr Moynihan took the
view that the full economic cost should be charged to clubs, but
that this could be phased in. Mr Atkins also felt that more
efforts should be made to improve the standard and training of
stewards.  I attach at Flag F the Home Office's line to take on
the issue.

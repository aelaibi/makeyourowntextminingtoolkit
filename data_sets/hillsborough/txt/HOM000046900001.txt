         1200     -       Mr & Mrs Jones (no relation to the Mr &
                          Mrs Jones coming at 12 on Tuesday)

         1400     -      Mrs & Mrs Joynes

         1445     -      Mr Harrison *

         1530     -      MrsMcBrien**

         1415     -      Ms Louise Brookes* **


                  Mr Harrison arrivedfor his appointment but told me he did not wish to go
                  through with it -he therefore (despite my attempts at persuasion) did not
                  have an interview with the judge.

                  Mrs McBrien arrived early and we saw her at around 1450.

                  Ms Brookes fixed her appointment on the Wednesday morning, after I had
                  phoned her at workfollowing a suggestion to me by Mrs Sefton. She
                  turned up for the meeting but decided, after talk with me and Professor
                  Phil Scraton, that she would rather see the Judge later on, in London, as
                  she had not properly worked out what she wanted to say. So she did not
                  have an interview on this occasion. I agreed with her and Scraton that we
                  would see her with him in QAG at some point.
       Statement from Lord Justice Stuart Smith - 6 October 1997

       "I deeply regret the remark I made to Mr Hammond this morning. It was an off-the-
       cuff remark made without any intent to offend and which I did not realise would be
       taken seriously.

       "I have apologised both to Mr Hammond and to all the families here today.

       It has been a fruitful and productive morning during which I hope eveiyone who has
      wished to do so has had an opportunity to put their concerns to me.

      "I emphasise again that I have an open mind on the outcome of the scrutiny."

                                                                                              A\

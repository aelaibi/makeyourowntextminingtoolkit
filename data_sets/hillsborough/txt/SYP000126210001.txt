AND THE AREA SHOWN BY OFFICERS WHO I ASKED DIRECTIONS OF AS MOST APPEARED TO
HAVE BEEN DRAFTED IN FOR THE MATCH. I WAS ALSO AMAZED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
WHO GOT INTO THE GROUND WITH FULL TICKETS (IE TICKETS HAD NOT BEEN CHECKED ON
ENTRY, ALSO LIVERPOOL FANS WERE IN POSESSION OF FOREST TICKETS PURCHASED
OUTSIDE THE GROUND. THE POLICE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE GEARED UP TO THE EVENT.

IH!              >> MY SON WAS AT THE MATCH, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT
                    THE POLICEOFFICVERS WERE OBVIOUSLY TENSE AND OVERREACTED. THEY
                    STATED THAT THEY WANTED NO LIPFROM MY SON AND HE SHOULD BEHAVE.
                    MY SON STATED HE WAS DOING NOTHING FOR THIS TO HAVE HAPPENED. I
                    AM NOT MAKING A COMPLAINT JUST POINTING OUT THE TENSENESS BEFORE

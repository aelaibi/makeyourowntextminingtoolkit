^   Dear Mr Whalley

    Hillsborough

    Thank you for providing a copy of your letter of the 20th
    September addressed to Mr Metcalf relating to the scale
    drawings prepared by Brade & Partners for the Public Inquiry.

    I note Lord Justice Taylor's views concerning the release of
    these drawings and confirm my agreement to the conditions upon
    which those drawings are to be made available.     I therefore
    would ask you to write to Brade & Partners in order that
    copies of the scale drawings are provided.     Upon receipt, I
    will provide a cheque for the cost of providing the same.




                        I also enclose a copy of my letter today sent to Mervyn

^ D e a r Mr Jones

    Hillsborough/Crush Barriers

    I enclose a copy of a letter dated the 11th September from Mr
    Heyes of the Health and Safety Executive in response to my
    letter of the 24th August.   I understand that copies of the
    relevant correspondence between my firm and Mr Heyes are in
    your possession.

    As you will appreciate,     a number of experts have been
    instructed by the parties to the civil claims to advise upon
    the effect of the missing barrier, and also as to the adequacy
    or otherwise of the broken barrier ie, barrier 124A.    I note
    that the Health and Safety Executive have yet to complete
    their tests both in relation to the broken barrier, and those
    further barriers that were removed on the 7th July.

    It would be of great assistance if you would kindly confirm
    when it is likely those investigations or tests now being
    conducted by the Health and Safety Executive,          will  be
    completed.  A Pre-Trial Review will take place on the 26 th
    October before    Mr Justice Rose    in Manchester,   and   the
    arrangements for the experts involved will be considered.

    As the barriers are of course the property of the Club,                                                               it is
    likely that our Counsel will be asked the following

    1.                When the investigations by the Health                                                   and       Safety
                      Executive are likely to be completed.

    2.                Whether the test results so far obtained by the Health
                      and  Safety Executive will    be disclosed for     the
                      purposes of the civil actions, and the likely date
                      when such information will be made available.

                                                                                                                Contd../..

    2/                                                  18th October 1989



    3.      Whether those experts to the civil actions may have
            access to the barriers to carry out their own tests
            and when.

    The above request is of some importance as it is likely at the
    hearing on the 26th October that a trial date will be given
    probably in May/June 1990, and there may be some concern that
    the expert's involved will not have a proper or reasonable
    opportunity in which to consider the evidence in relation to
    crush barriers.

    I would like to be able to refer to the latest position rather
    than simply refer to the letter of the 11th September.
    Accordingly, I would ask you to comment upon the above points
    so that I, in turn, can make use of your replies at the Pre-
    Trial Review.

^^1    look  forward   to   hearing   from   you   at     your   earliest
   convenience.

    Yours sincerely



    PETER DOYLE

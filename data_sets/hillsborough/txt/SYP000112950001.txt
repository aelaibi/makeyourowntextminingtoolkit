    approached, I saw a numlSer of people                            emerging    from the           c oncertina gate

    o b v i o us ly    injured.       D i r e c t l y outside         the gate       I saw a -youth lying on

    On entering          the area behind the West S t a n d                    1 saw a targe              number       of

           le o b v i ou sl y     injured being             tended to by other             persons and Police

    police wo ma n a s s i s t e d      by other           officers.

    D ir ec t l y     in .-front of the tunnel               w hich    leads    to the       terrace           of the

    West S tand         I- saw a man d es cribed as white male SO-25-years,                                     6 - tall,

    very heavy          build,     brown hair,             wearing     blue    jeans and a light                    coloured

    shirt.          He was      laid on his         s i d e . ’ His    face was       blue

                                  A second man was               leaning      over    him and        I a pp ro a c h e d

    and on';.checking -wa s unable                 to find a pulse at w hich the man                            informed

    me that         he was a n urse and that                 he had also        been unable -to find a

    pulse and that              the man was        dead.

    At    this      point a senior          officer         I believe a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t        instructed

    4 officers          including myself             to     remove     the    body to the           perimeter          road

    w h ic h we did,         a number, of other              bodies were a l r ea dy          present.

    H aving      done this        I was a p p r o a c h e d      by a hysterical          man       r equesting my

    assista nce.          I accompanied            him back          inside    the    perimeter           wall      where     1

    s aw,a man        lying     on his      side     obv io us ly      injured being          tended           to by

 CQry^L nual l'y felt        the police            officers     in the         line were           likely to be

     ,tacked by memb er s          of the         crowd who were           shouting abuse                and threats

 towards      officers,                       '                                        ;.

 During      this    time     I was a pp ro a c h e d        by a Liverpool                supporter          d escribed

 as white male,            25--30 years,          5 *7 ^ tall,       slim build,             dark hair, .wearing

 a   light    b lu e/ tu r q u o i s e    nylon tracksuit            who      informed me that a gate

 at the      back    of the      stand had been opened                    to allow          fans    in    (and that

 •he himself        had got      in without           showing       his     ticket)         resulting             in there

 b eing,a     crush on the           terracing.;         He    stated that             the    fans wo ul d. ne ve r

 blame    he stated         that     it didn't; matter              if the          gate    had been opened or

 not because         the    fans w ould have            got    in an yw ay even if                 it meant

 A woman a p p r o a c h e d     the      line of      police       6Vf f i c e r          a rve point and said

 "Here's      one L i v e rp oo l        supporter who w ou ld              like to thank you all                     for

 your., help."

 The youth       in the      blue        tracksuit above,            on several, occ as io ns                     stopped

 After    the m a j o r i t y    of s upporters          had    left       the ground          I returned to

 the Police         vehicle- an d the serial                 then     responded to several                        reports

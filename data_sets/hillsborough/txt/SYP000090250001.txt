         ‘ollow him to the L ap pings Lane end I f the ground.                               We went out,

         w al k e d down the        concrete    ramp and went       onto    the       perimeter       of the

         ground.         I saw that        the game was      in progress and there were a large

         number of fans            an the    pitch near      to the Leppings Lane end and behind

         the g o a l .



         I saw a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t wit h a meg ap ho ne    in his hand,             run on to the

         pitch,       speak      to the    referee and the       players were          then obv io us ly being

         told to       leave the      pitch.     Together with thjjr serial              I carried on

         wa lk in g towards         the area    behind the goal/           By this time            there were

         more     fans    coming     onto the    pitch from X p i s       area behind the goal.


                    c a t                                                                    j q u j o o
         W h en    I got to the terrace          I could ^Te that          the    people        inside were

          :rushed up against              the wire    fen!      From the state of thei r faces                       it

         was obvious          that a great many of them were               dead or s eriously                injured.

         P eople      on the terrace         behind were shouting          that       they    could not move

         and they were            being    pushed from behind.        I pulled at             the wire        fence

         but      J. was unable      to break    it free or bend          it over from the                 top.

           the    crush on the          terracinc^r        With other o f f i c ers       I stood on a small

           wall    and a s si st ed t h e n ^ v e r .        A y outh shouted for me to help him and                      I

           a ss i st e d him on to the top of the fence*                      One   of the metal          spikes at

           the top of the fence               got    stuck    in his    jeans,      near to his        groin-      I was

           unable     lo push his          legs     back   to release     the spike       because       of the angle

           of the spikes,              I m a n ag ed to break       the spike with rny hand and the

           y outh fell      on to me.          Another       officer    grabbed hold of this youth and

           a s si s te d him on to the            pitch.



           By this time          the fans      in front       of me    had slipped        climbing      over the

           fence and       I then went         to the s m a l 1 a c c e y f gate      in the fence where

 <*-       groups    of officers           were a ttempting         to/pull    people     from the        terracing,
flsucd     W it h PS F L A C K,       I formed the o f f i c e r y     into two      1 ivies and the       bodies and
 <vr       the    injured were          pulled out oa to/the            pitch and      passed to other Police
ethHfrtt
           officers.        W hi ls t we were         doing"" this     people who were           not   injured were

           pushing     their way over             the dead and        injured to get on to the              pitch

           through this          gate,



           I saw that       the a rea       in the terracing was           beginning        to    clear a bit and

           so    I left    the gate,        intending        to   climb sfCe r the top of the fence                to

           get    into the terrace            to assist       the injured      lying on the ground.                I
                                                                       VI076U
           i nstructed two officers                 one of them PC FENWICK* (D2 Division)                   to    climb

           over    the fence with me and               I had to assist         them to      climb o v e r .



           As    I was starting           to climb over the fence             I heard a P o l i c e w o m a n

           shouting       for    help.      I looked to rny right and saw a young P ol i c e w o m a n

           stood on the          low wall      in front       of the fence.         Her    right arm was          over

           the    top of the fence and               she was holding       on to a small           boy.     She was

           shouting       that    she     couldn't     hold him and there was a drop of about 6 ’0

           to the floor          of    the terrace.          I went    to her assis ta nc e and           put my arm
                                                                                                 PAGE


over     the top of the fence and took                  hold of his        belt.    The    boy was

either     dead or unconscious, 'I don't                 know w hich because          he was    not

moving a nd all        hi s   M imbs    were    loose and       I imp.     I could only use one

arm to hold him.

                                        iaX .

I was unable        to get      enough    leverage       to pull      him over     the top of the

fence because        of the angle         of the spikes          on the top and        the height of

the fence,            shouted to PC FENWICK              to   push          boys     legs over    the

top but because           of the noise         he o bviously      c/uld not hear me.

Eventually       I somehow mana ge d           to pull    him over the top of the              fence and

the P o l i c e w o m a n and another      officer       took/him away.



“I was    un<3y?le/to climb'over          the fence a#          this JCime     because my      right arm

was numb due to the             boys weight       so    I then w £ n t     back to the access

gate.     This     time      I was able    to get tnro ug n the gate               into the terrace

and together wit h PS FLACK and other                     off/cers we         cleared the      remaining

fans     towards    the      rear of the terrace.\ f i y          this     time all    the dead and

injured had been removed from the                      terrace,



 "he fans     in the      ter race above        us were shout i ^          and swear i ng at us

calling     us   ’Bastards'.           Wit h PS FLACK         I le^      the terrace      to try to re­

group our serial.              We went    onto the       pitch/and there were             large numbers

of Liverpool        s upporters who were              shoutiand           g e st ic ul at in g at the

N o t t i n g h a m Forest    fans at the other          en / of the ground.



T hey s t a r t ed to charge across             the    piAch o bviously to get at            the Notts

Forest     fans and       I m a n ag ed to restrain some and then                  instructions were

given to form a cordon across                   the    pitch,



W ith other officers            I joined the          cordon on the haif-way           line and
                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                S3 451

           p revented the Liverpool              fans from getting              to the Notts Forest            side of

           the ground.



           The Liverpool        fans were all a ngry and upset,                       some were      crying    but

           after    speaking      to them they         returned to the Leppings L^ane end of the

           g round.



           Eventually      I saw    Inspector        DEWS and he instructed PS FLACK ansi myself

           to remain where we were whilst                     he went        to obtain further         instructions.

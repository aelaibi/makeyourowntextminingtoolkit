 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I T APPEARS THAT THE POLICE AND Cgfcfe OFFICIALS WERE SLOW IN REALISING THE

 SERIOUS NATURE OF WHAT WAS H A P / E N ING.   FANS IN PENS 3 & 4 WERE AT FIRST BEEN

 PREVENTED FROM GETTING OVER/THE FENCE, ONTO THE PLAYING AREA.         EVEN ON

 REALISING WHAT HAD OCCURF^D THE ORGANISATION REGARDING GETTING FANS OUT OF

 PENS 3 & 4 WAS APPARENTLY UNCORDINATED AND THE PA SYSTEM WAS NOT USED EXCEPT

 FOR SAYING.    PLEASE KEEP OFF THE PLAYING AREA, AS FANS IN PENS 3 & 4 WERE

 COMING OVER THE FENCES.


G19

jj>4

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THE FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE MORE AWARE OF THE SITUATION BY

 USING THE PA SYSTEM INSIDE THE GROUND.        FROM WHERE I WAS SEATED I COULD SEE

 THAT THE MIDDLE ARE OF PENS 3 & 4 WERE PACKED YET THE SIDES WERE EMPTY.

 I FEEL THAT IF THE MATCH HAD BEEN SLIGHTLY DELAYED THIS DISASTER WOULD NOT

 HAVE OCCURRED.    IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE AT THE SAME GROUND, WHEN THEY HAD

 PROBLEMS IN THESE TWO PENS, AND IT WORKED THEN.

 Q1S

 I ASKED AN OFFICER IF THERE WAS ANOTHER ENTRANCE FOR US.               THE OFFICER

 DIRECTED US BACK INTO THE CRUSH, WHICH WE HAD BEEN STANDING IN FOR A GOOD

 TWENTY - TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES.             DUE TO THIS WE DECIDED TO TRY AND FIND OUR OWN

| Q53

I DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

     AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

     IT APPEARED THAT THE SUPPORTERS ACTED VERY QUICKLY AS THEY REALISED WHAT WAS
I
     HAPPENING.    THE ST J O H N ’S AMBULANCE CREWS REACTED VERY QUICKLY
                                                       C/Tr
     LYINGS     LANE.  AS FOR POLICE AND STEWARDS, THEY APPEARED VERY                REACT

     FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING IT WAS OBVIOUS SOMETHING VERY WRONG GOING OH4             I

     C O U L D N ’T UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLICE REACTED SO SLOWLY.   THE POLICE WERE

     DEPLOYED IN FRONT OF BOTH THE NORTH STAND AND SFION HOP DOING NOTHING.           IT WAS

     OBVIOUS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DEPLOYED TO THE LEPPINGS LANE END TO

     ASSIST IN THE EVACUATION OF THE CROWD AND REMOVAL OF INJURED.          I SAW MANY

     INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS ACTING BRAVELY AND VALIANTLY ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE.               I

     D O N ’T WISH TO CRITICISE THE OFFICERS ON THE PITCH BUT THE SUPERVISION SEEMED

     BADLY LACKING.     WE SAW MANY INJURED AND DEAD PEOPLE BEING TAKEN FROM THE

     GROUND, THE CORDON OF OFFICERS STILL REMAINED, NOT OFFERING ANY ASSISTANCE.

     THE MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM THE ST J O H N ’S SEEMED GOOD BUT THE ARRIVAL OF
                                                                                    PAGE    9

AMBULANCES INITIALLY SEEMED SLOW AND AGAIN DISORGANISED.

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

1. I FELT THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS W R O N G .      THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS SHOULD

HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED THE SPION KOP END.

2. OUTSIDE THE GROUND, NO PRIOR POLICE CHECKS BEFORE ARRIVING AT THE GROUND,

IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE TURNSTILES NOT ENOUGH POLICE OR STEWARDS PRESENT.

I WONDER ON THE RATIO OF SPECIALS - PCS.           THE TACTIC OF EMPLOYING MOUNTED

OFFICERS IN THE CLOSE AREA OF THE TURNSTILES WAS WRONG, A LARGE NUMBER OF FOOT

O ^ p C E R S WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE TO DISPERSE THE CROWD.

3   . FROM   A POLICE O F F I C E R ’S VIEWPOINT, THE POLICE SUPERVISION AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEEMED VERY POOR,         THERE SEEMED A LARGE NUMBER OF UNIFORMED

OFFICERS LACKING DIRECTION FROM SUPERVISORY OFFICERS.             I GOT THE IMPRESSION

THAT THE UNIFORMED OFFICERS WERE JUST AS CONFUSED,           IF NOT MORE SO, THAN

MEMBERS OF THE CROWD.         I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE TACTIC OF DEPLOYING SO MANY

OFFICERS IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND AND SPION KOP WHEN IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT

PEOPLE NEEDED URGENT ASSISTANCE AT LEPPINGS LANE.            I RECALL SEEING ONE OFFICER

BREAK RANKS FROM IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND AND GO TO LEPPINGS LANE OF HIS

OWN ACCORD.

4 ^ M Y PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT THERE IS TOO MUCH EMPHASIS PUT ON SEGREGATION OF

THE SUPPORTERS PRIOR TO THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE GROUND,            IN THIS INSTANCE IT WAS

ALMOST AS IF THEY HAD SPLIT THE GROUND AND TOWN IN TWO.             IN MY OPINION THIS IS

NOT NECESSARY TO THE EXTENT SHOWN AT HILLSBOROUGH.

5.    I SAW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ASKING FOR SPARE TICKETS.          THIS IS FURTHER

EVIDENCE THAT POLICE CHECKS WERE NOT EVIDENT AS THIS WAS A MATTER OF            100 YDS

FROM THE TURNSTILES.         I ALSO SAW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OPENLY DRINKING FROM BEER

BOTTLES OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

6.    I FEEL THAT THE SYSTEM OF FENCING SUPPORTERS SHOULD BE REVIEWED WITH A VIEW

TO THE MORE SPEEDY AND EFFICIENT EVACUATION OF THE CROWDS IN THE EVENT OF SUCH
                                                                                        PAGE

 A DISASTER.         I ALSO FEEL THAT FOOTBALL STADIUMS IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE

 MODERNISED.         ALL SEATER STADIUMS,   I FEEL, ARE NOT THE A N S W E R .

                                                    y
 1430 ONWARDS I FELT THE MOOD OF THE CROW          T H E OTHER SIDE OF THE STEEL GATE

WHERE I WAS STANDING GROWING HOSTILE.        I     MY BELIEF THAT IT WAS THE FANS

      OUT TICKETS WHO WERE TRYING TO CAUSE AN ATMOSPHERE WHEREBY THE MAIN GATES

WOULD BE OPENED.      AT QUARTER TO TWREE 1445 I EXPERIENCED A SEVERE CRUSH AS I

QUEUED FOR OUR TURNSTILE,      IN A n / A RE A IN WHICH I CONSIDER I SHOULD NOT HAVE

BEEN SUBJECTED TO, THE SAME WITH REGARD TO THE FANS WITH NO TICKETS,            I CONFIRM

THAT IN MY OPINION THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY SUCH SUPPORTERS,         IF ONLY BY THE

NUMBERS OF REQUESTS I RECEIVED AND HEARD FOR SPARE TICKETS ON ROUTE TO THE

GROUND AND INDEED IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

FANS BEING ABUSIVE TO POLICE AFTER        INCIDENT.    BUT THIS WAS CAUSED

BY ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AT THE POLICE CONDUCT BY SOME OFFICERS WHO

DID NOT HELP.

Q33

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

H A N D L E D , AFTER THE NATCH WAS STOPPED.

(1) THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCEMENT TO WHOLE GROUND INFORMING

BOTH SETS OF FANS THAT A TRAGEDY HAD OCCURRED.

(2) THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A REQUEST FOR DOCTORS OR PEOPLE IN GROUND

WITH FIRST AID KNOWLEDGE TO COME AND GIVE ASSISTANCE.

(3) POLICE AND ST JOHNS AMBULANCE IN LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE COMPLETELY

o f R W HELHED.

(4) AT FIRST POLICE TRIED TO ARREST AND REMOVE FANS FROM PITCH.

(5) POLICE RESERVES CALLED IN AND INSTEAD OF ASSISTING DEAD AND INJURED

THEY FORMED CORDON IN FRONT OF NORTH S T A N D .      THE ACTIONS OF THESE

OFFICERS WERE VERY PROVOCATIVE AND CAUSED ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AMONGST        ,

FANS BECAUSE OF THE POLICE ATTITUDE AND THEIR LACK OF ASSISTANCE.

(6) THE AMBULANCES HAD TO ENTER AT THE FAR END OF THE PITCH

AND THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ACCESS.

( ^ P R E S S I N G PEOPLE INTO THE AREA WHERE THERE WERE PEOPLE TRYING

TO GIVE ASSISTANCE.

(8) A LOT OF POLICE DID NOTHING TO H ELP.

OR INJURED FROM ONE END OF THE PITCH TO THE O T H E R .      HE WAS

OBVIOUSLY STRUGGLING BUT OTHER POLICE STOOD BY AND DID NOTHING

TO HELP HIM.

(10) APPEARED COMPLETE LACK OF MEDICAL FACILITIES.

(11)      I HAVE HAD FIRST AID TRAINING AND HAVE BEEN TAUGHT IF PEOPLE

ARE INJURED TO LEAVE THEM AS ST ILL AS POSSIBLE.          FANS WERE
 PUTTIWG INJURED AND DEAD ONTO HARDBOARD HOARDING AND
        *


 RUNNING ACROSS THE PITCH SHAKING AND BANGING THE VICTIMS

 WHICH COULD HAVE AGGRAVATED INJURIES.

 (IE) THE ACTION BY THE POLICE IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND WAS CAUSING

 SO MUCH ILL FEELING AMONGST THE FANS IT COULD HAVE DEVELOPED

 ASSISTING INJURED PEOPLE.            I DON'T THINK T H E Y N sE R E AWARE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.

 SOME WERE ASSISTING AND APPEARED TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

 054

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THAT A SMALL SECTION OF THE SUPPORTERS FROM BOTH SIDES WERE GENERALLY

 I^A    DISRUPTIVE MOOD.        I AM SURE THAT DRINK CAUSED THE PROBLEM.          IT WENT A LOT

 FURTHER THAN HIGH SPIRITEDNESS.

 I THINK THE GROUND IS BADLY DESIGNED AT LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILE AREA.                   I HAVE

 ENTERED THE GROUND AT THIS POINT ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS.

 I FEEL THAT IT IS POLICE POLICY TO ALLOW NON-TICKET HOLDERS INTO THE GROUND

 RATHER THAN HAVE LARGE NUMBERS OF SUPPORTERS OUTSIDE THE GROUND.                  I FEEL THAT

 THIS WAS A FACTOR IN THE HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY.

 IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THE FA. SHOULD HAVE ALLOCATED THE SPION KOP TO THE
                                      C A <          OGm/U'
 LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS.  AT LAST YEA!    MATCH THERE APPEARED TO BE A SIMILAR

 S ITUATION WITH FANS BEING PULLED OUT OF t*ENS X              4 INTO THE SEATS A B O V E .

 IF THE CROWD WERE INFORMED THAT THERE WAS A SERIOUS INCIDENT THEN THERE WOULD

 Bi~ A LESS   CHANCE OF HOOLIGANISM AND THOSE POLICE OFFICERS ON THE PITCH COULD

 HAVE BEEN    USED MORE PRODUCTIVELY.              I FELT THERE WAS NUMEROUS POLICE STANDING

 i^pUND DOING NOTHING WHEREAS THERE WERE FRANTIC EFFORTS BY MAINLY THE FANS.

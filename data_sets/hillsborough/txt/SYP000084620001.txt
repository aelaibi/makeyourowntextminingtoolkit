regard/to          the traffic.

I d o / ’t recall a n yb o d y        corning in the shop asking                  for tickets         but       I do

rei|ember some             coming   in a ro un d about        1.30    pm    (1330)    asking        for    the
   %
H orse and Jo ck ey and B ee hi ve               public houses.

It was about 2.55              pm   (1455)      when the m a i n s t r e a m    of s upporters            had

passed        that       I noticed about        fifty or more         s upporters walking             past       the

shop but          not    in a group.        Q n ^ of these groups            stuck     in my mind          becaus

h e was       being      carried by^jTwo other           suppo rt er s      w h o wer e s 1a p p i n g h i s

face and trying to              bring    him     round.       He a p p e a r e d to be e x tr em el y

d ru n k .       What a Isss struck me about             these    s up po rt er s was        that    they

a p p ea r e d    to h i / in no h urry to reach the              ground bearing             in min d the

time     of          .    It w a s n ’t long after wa rd s        that      someone        came   running        int

the    shop shouting a bout all                 the    people    having      died,    as did about

t w e n t y others want in g         to use      the    phone.       I e v e nt u al l y    locked the          door

as    I c o u l d n ’t let them behind the               counter      for secur it y         reasons and

this was          quite    distressing.

The    only thing          further    to this         is that w he n       I was walk in g        home     I saw

alot     of supporters          being a l lo w e d      into houses         to phone       their    homes.         I

saw one y outh sitting               on a wall         drinking      a can of beer w h i ch he threw

into     the garden whe n he f in ished                 it.     My only thought            on this        is that

I believe          that    the L i ve rp oo l    fans have       got a different a tt itude                 to

any other          supporters       I know of.

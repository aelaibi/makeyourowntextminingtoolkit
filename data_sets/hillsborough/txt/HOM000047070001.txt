ACC (L&T)



Took a call from                this morning re. Hillsborough

Before his retirement, Mr            used to be a consultant engineering for
SWFC. He was party to the building of the turnstiles at Leppings Lane, and is
very knowledgeable about the ground in general.

He has his own opinion about who was to blame for the disaster but feels that the
decision to open the gate was the correct one. Five minutes later and the gate
and the wall would have gone over.

He was not called to give evidence at the time of the disaster, although he did
indicate to David Duckenfield that he would be willing to support the Police.

He is now willing to make himself available to help SYP, and Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith's team, and has asked if his name could be passed on to whoever
needed to know.

I have thanked him for getting in touch with us, and said I would pass on his
name and 'phone number to you.

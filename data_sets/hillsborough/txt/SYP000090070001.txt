TEAM'S     than the first              one.     I was     pushed and g o t y t ru s he d against                 the    crush
o / ±
           b ar r i e r . /    I seemed       to have been stuck               there   for ages.           The    fans were
P( W i t
           shouting           to the    police to open the gate at the front                             of the    pen,    as

           well     as    in the stand above.                  I also       noticed there were a lot of

           s u pporters         being     pulled up into the stand.



           A few feet           infront       of me about three              or four       feet to my       right,       I saw a

           man go down to the ground and then get trampled on by the                                             crowd.     I
Iiv/So^
           only saw his head a nd shoulders                          so    I w ou ld estimate        him to be about 35

           years      of age,         I cannot     describe          him further       or be able          to    identify

           him.       I then realised that                something was            terribly wrong,              fans were

trying     d e sp e ra te ly to get out of the              pen,    some were making their way

to the side        fence and were           being    lifted over and some were                  being

lifted up into the strands due to the                       pressure     becoming       less,      because

of    people     c 1 im b iag out       I was able    to get awa y from the             barrier and

make my way tc/the            left hand fence             into what     is known as Pen 5.                I was

lifted over/into            the    pen.     I then made my way down to the lydttom of

the    pen/find made my way through the gate                       onto the       pitchy/    I looked

back A t    the    pens and        could see the wire meshing                of this perimeter            fence

being    forced     outwards        from the      pressure      of the     peo pte    pushing       forward.

I could also        see     the wire meshing          cutting       into the flesh of            people

being    crushed against            it.     I went    to the       15 yard       line box an d looked

and saw     police     officers and stewards               he 1 ping    to get      people     out of the

pens.      I then made my way to the                 right h a n ^ k r t i c h    line as my ankle was

hurting and        1 sat down.            Later wha«<i       saw a police          officer J-'-'knew by

the name       of Alan R A MS DE N        I a.'Id to him        “ I t ’s terj      fTe in t h e r e ;

people are        dying,     people? are dead.



As    far as     I reco/iect        from here,       as   I am a bit       confused about           the

course     of events        but Alan RAMS DE N fetched a lad over                    to me.        He was

trying     to be sick,        his face was quite white and drained,                         he kept

asking him his name               but    c o u l d n ’t get anything     from him.          Alan    then

went    off to help some            others.       I just sat with this              lad,    I c o u l d n ’t

assist     him    in any way as           I w a s n ’t feeling      too good myself.            Then after

a short while Alan R A MS DE N brought another                       lad over.        Ala n a sked me

to give     him a hand with him to move                    him out/ft      the way of the           people.

I a ss is te d to carry him and sup po rt ed J/nm with my shoulder

just    to the touch         line.        I cannot    identify either             of these     persons         by

their    clothing      or    physical       features as       I wasn't       really taking much

notice     to tell you the              truth.

After we got the        lad to the touch           line   I made my way to the other          side

of the       pitch to the    left.        X sat for a long while on the           bill   boards,

before making my way out of the kop end and onto                      the dual     carriageway

and    I caught a bus       home.     This w ou ld have      been about 4.15       pm    (1615)

time.



Prior    to or t hroughout      the match         I did not witness any unruly

behaviour      or e xcessive    drunkenness.          There were    o bviously the normal

e xp ectations     of fans    drinking and enjoying            themselves.



From my       obs er va ti on s at the ground after the          m atch there     was a lack      of

medical       provisions such as      respirators and oxygen.



In comparison to        last years match the o rg an is a ti o n on the whole match

was    different.     There was a lack of policing               in terms    of   checking    the

fans away from the ground and sealing                 of the     roads and controlling the

fans    on    the way to the ground.



There were       no problems with         last years m atch      it a p p e ar e d to be very

well    controlled     in terms      of   crowd   control.

ADJOURNMENT DEBATE FRIDAY 24 JANUARY:
GEORGE HOWARTH MP (LAB) ON THE IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE TAYLOR REPORT.


Following ^our telephone conversation today I am writing to
confirm that we have been advised today by the
Chief Whip's Office that George Howarth intends to raise the
subject of the implementation of the Taylor Report in an
adjournment debate on Friday 24 January. The debate will be
taken at around 2.30pm and will last approximately half an
hour. Mr Lloyd is currently expected to reply for the
Government.

I should therefore be grateful if you would set in hand the
preparation of a short speech of about ten minutes duration
which, together with any necessary background material, should
reach Ms Rae by 5.00pm on Wednesday 22 January (copied to me,
please).

It would be helpful if, in due course, you could inform
Mr Wheeler (ext 3526) which officials will be attending the
debate.

including            the        Owlerton Sports Stadium.

At    11 a m the            same       d a y DC B a g g u l e y          and    I commenced              the       duties       as

outlined above.                       We    left       the       football       ground and walked                    from       there        to

Leppings          Lane          where       1 had       previously arranged                     to m e e t         a Police

Informant.                 The    route          took       us    past    the S p i o n H o p           end    of    the       ground

and    the       general          route          to    the       ground     from      the C i t y C e n t r e .            At       that

early       h o ur     a    large          number       of s u p p o r t e r s       were     already          beginning             to

arrive         and a number                 of     those         were    drinking          alcohol           from    cans.

Following            a discussion                  with      the       above    m e n t i o n e d man,         we    continued             our

foot     patrol            up    to    the       Owlerton Stadium                   where     we m a d e       our    presence

known       to    staff          at    the       car    park          entrance.         The     time         then w oul d           be

a r ou n d midday.                O p p o s ite        the       stadium       is    the     main       junction          of

Penistone            Road,        B r a d f i e l d Road and L i v er se y Street.                             S i t u a t e d at         the

jucntion          is a P u b l i c           House          named       the R o y a l      H o t e 1.        The    footpath

outside          that       public          house       was       completely          congested with                 supporters              of

N o tt i n g h a m Forest.                  There       was       the    sounds       of     singing          inside       the       pub

suggesting             fans       of       t hat      club were          also       i nside.

At    t h at     time       we    were       monitoring                channel       19 or our           personal          radio          that

channel          being          solely       for Cl'D use.                R e c e p t i o n was         good and          in fact          we

received          notification                   via D S 8 0 5 B u x t o n           t hat    other          local    public

houses         were        also       congested             in the       same       area.      We       did    in    f act      make       our

way    to      the     Royal          Hotel        where         we    spoke    too     and     identified            ourselves              to

uniformed Police                      Officers          who       were    outside.            This       was       done    so       that

they would             recognise             ourselves                in the    event        that       we    required

assistance.                 We    spoke          to a u n i f o r m e d        Inspector,           believed          to       be    called

Following            our        conversation                 I actually          entered           the      public         house          to

assess        the       behaviour                of the        f ans    ins i d e .          The      pub w a s c o m p l e t e l y        full

of N o t t s       fans         and    it        iss a f e    to    say    that            the m a j o r i t y       of    them were             the

worse        for     drink.            One       y o u t h was       actually             standing          on a      t a b 1e in the

pub       leading          the    fans        singing.              There       was       not     however         any      signs          of

trouble.             We     reported             our      observations               to     the    uniformed              officers

outside          and       volunteered              our       services          should          the     pub n e e d        re-visiting.

We    then       continued             ou r      f oo t      pa trol     along           Penistone          Road      towards             the

ground.            By      this       time       it w o u l d       be a p p r o x i m a t e l y        12.30        pm.        The

footpaths            leading           up        to the g r u n d w e r e        heavily            congested with                    fans

and       from     speaking            to        t h e m a l a rge        number           were       in f act " t i c k e t

t o u t s ’.       One      particular               t out     was     poken         to a n d      boasted           of    having 20

tickets          for       sale.         He      said a            6 terrace             ticket       would       cost         me      25.

W h e n we       identified              ourselves             to    him,       he       said     he w a s      from Liverpool

and       ’t o u t e d '    on a       regular            basis.          He    s a i d he        obtained           his       tickets

from       players          of    the C l u b a n d a l s o               held       a    large       number         of    ’H o p ’ s e a s o n

tickets          which were              purchased with                   the    sole          itnetion         of    getting             l a rge

allocations                of    tickets           for       ’big    games’.              This     particular              tout        stated

that       in the w e e k             before         the      game L i v e r p o o l           Police       had      taken          his

tickets          from       him       to a s s e s s         their     origin            and    validity.             He       aid     he h a d

only       got     them         back     the       previous          night       and        this      had      reduced          their          s ale

v al u e .       Each       ticket          he     stated wouldhave                      fetched around                   50    in m i d - w e e k .

As    s t a t e d at        that       time        t his      man was          one       of a p p r o x i m a t e l y      20       touts

present.             We     were       approached              on m a n y       occasions             by f ans        wanting             to    buy

tickets,           and      the       high       volume        of    them       e v e n at        that      time      suggested                t hat

many were            travelling               to    the       game     without            tickets.             This       was       mentioned

within         the      ground when                we a t t e n d e d      there          for     our m eal          break          at a r o u n d

1.30       pm.

At    2    pm DC B a g g u l e y            and      I    returned         to    our        pat r o l     as    m e n t i o n e d abo v e .
In the       short       space          of    t im e    we    had    b e e n a w ay ,       the     volume        of    supporters

outside        the      ground          had    risen         dratically.              I should          p o int       out    however

that     the      number         of     fans       actually         entering         the      ground was              minimal.

The    turnstiles             at      the     Kop      end    showed       no     signs       of    congestion and                    the

ro a d at      t h at    end       of    the       g r ound was          clea r.       Traffic          was     moving           easily

for a m a t c h         of    the       standard          t hat     was    taking        place.           At     the C i t y          end

of    the    entrances             to    the       Spion Kop         is a g a t e w a y        leading           to    the S o u t h

Stand       entrances.                That     gateway and also                   a bridge          on the        far       side       of

it was       ocmpletely               congested.              It w a s     noted       that        this     blockage             was

caused       by    f ans      asking          for a n d a l s o          offering        for       sale m a t c h       tickets.

There       were       Police         Officers          in u n i f o r m     present          at    t hat       location          and

despite        the      f a ct     that       it    did      not    fall     under       our       br i e f ,    we    took       it

upon     ourselves            to m o v e        these        persons       on.

We    continued along                   Penistone            Road    towards          Owlerton Stadium.                      Throughout

that     patrol         we    saw       two     uniform           oficers       only who were               standing             at    the

junction with Parkside                         R o ad.        The    lack       of    officers          visibly         present

was    commented             upon.           Fans      present       were       arriving           in n u m b e r s , a          large

number       of w h i c h w e r e            drinking         beer       from     cans.

At a p p r o x i m a t e 1y 2 . 4 3           pm DC B a g g u l e y        and       I had     returned           to    the       bridge

area     immediately               before          the S p i o n K o p       entrances.               That       area       was

completely             blokced          and    f a ns     were      spilling          i nto    the      roadway.             A group

of S O      plus       fans      came        running         down    the     road away             from     the       site       of

Hillsborough             Park.           It w a s a p p a r e n t         t hat      these youths               had    been

involved          in s o m e       incident            and    so w h i l s t      DC B a g g u l e y      watched           o v e r me       I

stood amongst                them.           The youths            were    boasting           to e a c h        other       of    their

part     in a f i g h t          which        had just            taken    place       in H i l l s b o r o u g h       Park.           It

is    pertinent          to m e n t i o n          that      at    the    identical           semi      fin a l       meeting

I had       personally             dealt       with       one y o u t h w h o        wa s     involved           in    the

Sheffield Crown                 Court.           The y o u t h s          who      I was         standing           with       were       all

Nottingham Forest                    fans       and       one     in     particular              was     instrumental                in

arranging          them       to m e e t        on    the        bridge        after        the     g am e w h e n a           further

fight was          to    take        place with Liverpool                          fans       in the          park.           From

comments       made          it a p p e a r e d       that        t his       fight        had     been mut u a ll y            arranged

by the      rival        factions.

Due    to   the     possible              consequence               of    t his       youths        actions             it w a s     my

intention          to    either           arrest          him     or     to    strongly            advise          him.        The       mood

of    the   c r o w d at        that       time,          who     comprised            in the m a i n              of    drunks,          was

such    that       either        would          have       been        impossible             without          the a s s i s t a n c e          of

a    uniformed          officer.             That         particular             piece        of    r oad      (Penistone                Road)

is    directly          prior        to    the       City        side     of     the       football           ground.           I

continued          to    follow           the    particular               youth        and       I was        surprised             to    find

that    the    only Police                 Offices              in v i e w w e r e         three        or    four       from       the

N o tt i ng h am Force.                The      y o u t h was          cautioned             in t h e i r      presence             and       his

details       obtained            by      one    of       the N o t t i n g h a m          officers.               Whilst       this

co nversation was                 taking         p l ace         the y o u t h s       friends           became          very       hostile

towards       us a n d        there        was       no    doubt         t hat     this       section          of       fans    were          not

only    the w o r s e         for      drink         but        intended         to    fight        with anyone                they       could.

Immediately             before         this      incident              a number            of S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e

Passenger          Transport              B u s e s a r r i v e d at           the     ground.               The    majority             of

persons       on    those         buses         were       also        dru n k .       It     should          be    noted       however

I believe          that       the      time      would           be a r o u n d S . 5 0          pm ~ S . 3 5           pm.     We       had

been Join ed            at    the      scene         by    Inspector             Manus        Booth and             I asked          him       to

relay a message                 to m a t c h         control           warning         them        of    the       potential

control       channel           was       heavily          congested             and       suggested           that       we    pass          the

Around        3    pm we        assumed             the m a t c h          had     started           by the       sounds          of     che e r s

coming        from        the    inside             the       ground.             Traffic           in P e n i s t o n e     Road       on        the

cleared.               It was        our       opinion             that      it w a s       in f a c t      less       than a          norm a l

Saturday           home       game        at       Hillsborough.                   No     persons         appeared           to     have

difficulty              in e n t e r i n g          the       ground.             Apart        from a number                of    persons

who       will     be     described                in the          n ext     paragraph              the m a j o r i t y      of

Nottingham              fans     appeared                to    h av e      arrived          in t ime        to    enter          the    ground.

At    3    pm h o w e v e r ,        a    group          of a p p r o x i m a t e l y          100 y o u t h s        had    congregated

outside           the     gate®          immediately                p r ior       to    the     S p i o n Kop,         those        gates

leading           to    the     rear          of    the       South Stand.                  Their        was     no    uniformed

officers           in view.               The       mood       of     the     youths           was     restless,            and     it w a s

obvious           t hat    they          did       not    hold        tickets            for    the      game.         From        comments

we    overheard            they wre                speaking           of     rushing           the     gates      to     gain       entry.

At    this        time     we    withdrew                to    the      central           carriageway             of P e n i s t o n e            Road

because           we w e r e     both          of    the       opinion            tha t     we w e r e      isolated             from     o t he r

officers           and would              neither             ha ve     been       able        to    stop      the     youths,           or

defend        ourselves              if       the    situation               became         ugly.         Without           warning           the

youths        suddenly           began             running          down      behind           the S o u t h S t a n d           towards           the

Leppings           Lane       end        of    the       ground.             We    b e l i e v e d at       that       time       that        a

fight       was        probably           taking          p l a c e at        the L e p p i n g s         Lane        end    and       s t il l     we

could       neither           pass        or       receive          messages            on the C I D C h a n n e l .

At    around 3.05               pm       it w a s        apparent            that       something           was       taking        place

inside       the        ground           to    the a n n o y a n c e          of       the N o t t i n g h a m        fans       who    were

’booing*           strongly.                  We    went       to a t u r n s t i l e           nearby where                we    s a w PC

■1302 P i t t          inside.            He       told       us    t ha t    there         had      been a       pitch          i n v a s i o n at

the L e p p i n g s       Lane           end.        I climbed               over       the     turnstile             and    entered a

gangway           between        t he S o u t h           s t a n d a n d S p i o n K op.                 I could           see     persons

on    the     p i t c h at       the L i v e r p o o l              end a n d          others        climbing          from       the W e s t
Standi t e r r a c e s         to    the       s e a t e d are a .

DC B a g g u l e y and          I then          returned          to P e n i s t o n e        Road       unaware        that        a

problem        had a r i s e n           of    the       nature       that       was    later       to u n f o l d .          A short

time after           this       we       saw Police             vehicles          arriving          at    the       ground and            it

was    obvious           that       something             serious          had    occurred.              We    decided         to

return        to    the     Police            Gym    to f i n d       out    if we       could assist.                 The

turnstiles           at     the S p i o n           Ho p end were            now       em pty.

On    entering           the    G y m we        were       told       that       persons       had       been       c r u s h e d at      the

Leppings Lane               terraces.                There       was       talk    of m a n y       casualties             and

possibly           someone          dead.           In the G y m at              this    time was             Inspector          Towell

and    other        CID     Officers.                DS L i n dl ey         came       into    the G y m a n d t h e r e                was

then       talk     of      o v er       eightdeaths.                 I suggested             to DI       T o w e l l t h a t we

could       clear        the    tables          from       the G y m        in    case     it was         needed         to    receive

casualties.               Before          a decision was                   made,       Chief     Inspector             Beal      ordered

us    to    clea r       the Gym.

T h e G y m at       that       time          was    divided          by    nets       into 3 s e c t i o n s .            The      section

nearest        the       entrance             was    occupied          by the          Police,       the       centre         section

had    tables        laid       out w h e r e            programme          sellers        were       counting           their

takings        and       the    far       section was             unoccupied.                 I assisted             clearing

tables        from       the P o l i c e        end and          casualties             began       to    be    brought          into

the    Gym.         I ran       to       the m i d d l e        section and             demanded          the       programme

sellers        to    vacate          it.        Many       bodies          were    being       brought          into       the      Gym

and within           minutes             there       were       obvious          dead    bodies          and    o nes      needing

urgent        medical          assistance                in b o t h    sections.              There       was       completed

mayhem and           relatives                were       also    entering          the     gym      looking          for      each

other.         The       mood       of    some       of    them was          violent          but    obvious           under        the

circumstances.

At    t hat    t ime      I ran          over       to    the G y m        entrance        where         I t ook       hold      of a

uniformed           officer.              That       officer          appeared          in a s t a t e         of    helpless            shock.

I grabbed           hold       of    him as          previously             sta te d and         identified myself                       to
him.        I told       him       not       to m o v e      from    the       doorway and           to    i n f o r m all

entering          to    t ake      dead       bodies         to    the    nearest          section and            injured           to

the m i d d l e .        The       officer          seemed         relieved          to    have     been      given a

particular             task       to    do.        I obviously            had       no a u t h o r i ty    to     do    s o , but

told    hi m      that       if    he m o v e d      he h a d me          to a n s w e r      to.       Persons         in the           gym

were    then        likewise            organised            by S e n i o r     Officers.

At    that     stage         I assisted             to    try and         resuscitate             two     persons         l y ing        on

the G y m      floor         but       our    actions were               to    no a v a i l .       I had a         feeling          of

helplessness.                 I can o n l y          describe            the    next       few m i n u t e s      as    complete

and    utter        confusion.                One m i n u t e        there      were       five     bodies,         the      next

there a p pea re d            to       be    fifty-five.              The      bodies       being       brought         in

appeared          to    be    never          ending.           There      were       fans     in the G y m          demanding             to

see    or    identify             bodies,          people         being       resuscitated and                people weeping

over    the       dead.           The       dead and         injured were              being      brought         into       the     Gym

on s t r e t c h e r s       and advertising                   boards.

1 c o u l d not b e l i e v e w h a t w a s h a p p e n i n g a n d d i d not w a n t                             to do        so.        At

that    stage          1 decided             to    l e ave     the    gym and          see w h a t      was     happening            on

the    pitch.           I walked             onto     the      pitch and            could     not    believe           what     I wa s

seeing.           The    pitch was                full    of      fans,       dead and        injured         lying       on    the

pitch.         One      fan was             obviously          dead,      a    coat       o ver   his     head,        was     lying

immediately             in f r o n t         of a n d     in full         view       of    fans     on the S p i o n K op .                   A

uniformed officer                      said       he wa s      waiting         for     an a d v e r t i s i n g     board       to       be

brought        to      remove          him    on.        I told       the      officer        that      there       was      no m o r e

room    in the G y m              for       such    boards         and    he w o u l d      have     to    carry        the     body.

Before       we     could         do    so a s t r e t c h e r       was       brought        and    the m a n w a s m o v e d

from    the       pitch       to       the    caring         applause          of    the N o t t i n g h a m      Fans       who     by

now    had o b v i o u s l y           understood            the     seriousness            of    the     incident.             I

returned          to    the       Gym.

The    flow       of    bodies          brought          into      the    gym       continued and             the      dead were

laid    out       in    rows.           I s a w PC E a m o n L a r k i n             standing        n ear      the     gym
                                                                                                                                    PAGE

entrance         and        noticed        t hat      th e    original           officer         I had          " p osted'         there

had    gone.           I a s k e d PC L a r k i n            to    carry       out     the      same       duty       and     he

agreed.           I l a ter        saw     t hat      officer           collaps        as a n a r g u m e n t          took        p l ace

w i th a man           entering          the     gym demanding                 to     find a         relative          who     was

missing.

I personally                then    became          involved            in a h e a t e d a r g u m e n t          with        two

persons          trying       to    gain        entry        to    the    Gym.         One      said       his    relative              was

dead       inside       and    the       other        said and           identified             himself          as    being        a

reporter          from       the    People Newspaper.                       The       reporter            stated       he w a n t e d         to

get    into       the G y m        but     I refused              him access.               I explained               t hat    his

actions          were       misguided           and    he a g r e e d       to      leave,       apologising                to me        for

his    unprofessional                   approach.             He    did      not      return.

Things       then       began       to     slow       down,        and     later       a    room was            set    up w h e r e

bodies       were       to    be    identified               by    photographs.                 My    duty was             to m e e t

relatives          and       explain          the     position.              I did         so a n d       then    brought           them

into       the    r o o m w h e re       they       identified             their        relatives           firstly           by

photograph,             and    then        in    p erson ,         as    the     b o d y was         brought          up f r o m        the

Gym.        I continued             to     carry       out        this     duty       unt i l    4 am.           I can        describe

the    events          of    this       t ime    in m o r e        detail        if    required            to    do    so     but       I do

not    feel       up    to    compelling              it     to    paper       at     t his     time.

My    duty       finished          t hat      d a y at       4 am.

OBSERVATIONS

It    is    perhaps          pertinent           to m e n t i o n        that       I h ave      been a          lifelong

football          supporter             and     I have        attended           many major               matches          including

World      Cup Finals,              FA Cup          semi      finals        and       fin a l s ,     and also             many

European Cup                matches.            I have        on m a n y       occasion attended                      football

matches          involving          the L i v e r p o o l          football           club.          My    observations

             gate     the       runners       came       away      from       their      channel         and       the    base      of       the

             gat©     was       pushed       forward.            This     resulted            in the        gate       turning          sideways

             at    about        head     height.           Persons         who had         been standing                 near      to    the       gate

             were     crushed          by     the m o b w h o         had      no s e n s ©    of    saf e t y .         They were            going

             to    enter        the    ground        no m a t t e r      w h a t.     Many      got      under         the     g ate     before

             order       wa s    restored,           however,          I could         not     believe           that     this      was

             without        serious          injury        to    those        who    had      been      innocently             standing

             n e a r b y at      the     t i me    of    their        stampede.

             Other       like     'mass       r u s h e s ’ took         p l ace     t ha t    day     but       obviously          1 d o n ’t

             know whether              any    injuries           were     sustained.

             I feel       t hat       the     e v e n t s of      that      day show          the    problems            which      these

             supporters           have        c a u s e d in the         past by         their       organised methods                   and

             which may           ha ve      led    up    to     the    tragic        events         of H i l l s b o r o u g h .

             I h ave      worked         at H i l l s b o r o u g h      on    football         duties           since       1977.           I have

             therefore           worked       at    numerous           big m a t c h e s       that      have         taken     place

             the r e .      I have          always       felt     that        too m a n y      f ans     were         admitted          on    t h ose

             occasions           in the L e p p i n g s          Lane     end.

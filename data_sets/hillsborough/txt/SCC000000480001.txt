 Dear Lord Mayor,

 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND

 We are a group of four students, on the Youth Training Scheme, studying
 s Business Management Course, at Mander College.    lie were very upset
 by the tragedy at Hillsborough, and felt that we wanted to do something
 to help.
 During our Enterprise Block week last vyeek, we made wooden keyrings,
 some of which carried the Liverpool Football Club logo (all personally
 designed by one of our group, Lee Butterworth, who is a life-long Liverpool
 fan). We sold these keyrings and were also given some donations.

 Our total sales/donations figure amounted to £120.17 and we have great
 pleasure in enclosing a che«ue for this amount. We are also sending you
 a large cardboard che«ue for the same amount for display purposes.

 We hope that our effort will in some little way help     to e«se the pain of
 Hillsborough.


 Yours       sincerely,
                                                                        A

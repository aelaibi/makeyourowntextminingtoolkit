about          1405       hrs    on     the    same          day.         We    passed          numerous           police           officers

o n our         walk       to    the        club.

O n ar r i val            at    t he    club       I drank           three          p i nts     of    bitter,           and     we     all      left

the       c l u b at       about        1430 hrs             to w a l k        to    the      football            ground.            On

turning          from          the     main    road          into        Leppings          Ln    there        was       the     normal          flow

of    people           walking          towards          the        ground and             I saw what              1 would           call       the

normal          amount          of     police          offi cers          whilst          walking        along          Leppings           Ln.

It w o u l d         be a b o u t       2.45       pm     (1445)          that       we    arrived           at    the     gates          for

entry          into       the    ground and               I would          estimate             that     the re w e r e             about       five

hundred          people          waiting           to    get        in.        I didn't          see     any       stewards           and       only

one       police          officer.            The       police           offi cer w a s          asking           everybody            to m o v e

back       and       in    fact        he w a s        pleading           with       people          to m o v e        b ack    due       to the

     ount       of     people          the r e ,       I was        pushed away               from      the       turnstiles.                  11 w a s

about          1 500      hrs    on     the    same          da y    the       big    b lue      c o n c e rt i na g a t e s          we re

opened.              I was       only about              f our       yards          away      from      the       gates        when       they

opened          but       I was        not    able       to    see        who       opened       the     gates.            The re         hadn't

been       any       disorder           or    violence              up    unt i 1 t h a t        time.

As    a    result          of    the        gates       be i ng      opened          I was       literally              carried           through

the       gates        by a m a s s i v e          surge        from       behind          me.        I was        totally

surrounded                by    peo p l e .        I    can     say       that       the      gate      I am       referring              to    is

the       one    for       the       North     Stand.               I had       j ust      got       inside        the     ground          that

due       to    the       pressure           from       b e h i n d me         that       I fell        to    the       ground.            I was

not       injured          in t his          fall       and     I was          not    trampled           on.           I was        he 1 ped     up

by    two       lads a n d m a d e            my       way    to m y       seat       a r r i v e d at a b o u t           1 50 4     hrs       on

the    same     day-         Also       on       entering         the       ground     I    saw a b o u t      five       or    si:-:

police       o f f i c e r s , they             were    standing            facing     the       st and,      they were          just

standing        there.

The    game     was     stopped             shortly        after        I    had     got    to m y      seat,       and    I

could    see     t hat       something              was    happening           in the W e s t           Stand       Terraces

with    people         trying          to       climb     o ver    the       perimeter           fence     and      climbing            up

into    the     stands,           and       I    d i d n ’t k n o w w h a t        to m a k e     of    it,    t hat      is w h a t

was    going     on.

After    about         10 m i n u t e s          after     the     ga me      ha d    been       stopped,        I saw         the

police       with      at    least          ten     police        d ogs      come     onto       the    football          pitch .            I

also    saw     on e    of       the    police          dogs      whi c h was         on    its    lead w i t h        the

handler       attack         a    person          on    the    pitch,         and     it a p p e a r e d      to me       that       the

dog    had    bitten         the       lad a n d        the    lad      then mo ve d         b ack      towards        the

penalty       area.          This       incident           happened after                  the    cordon       of     police         had

been    put a c r o s s          the    pitch.

I remained          in th e        stands           until      about         1 635    hrs    on    the     same       d a y , and        I

saw a    lot     of     people          being          stretched            towards        the Kop       end     of    the

pitch.        I would            say    I saw          about      forty       people        stretchered             off.        On

leaving       the      ground          and w a lk ed          back      to    the     car,       with                     and

              a n d me t                          at    the    car.

                                                                                                               We     never      saw

Carl    again.

             On Saturday 15th April              1989,    (150489), I commenced duty in full

             uniform at Police He adq ua rte rs, Sheffield.                   I then attended at the

             gymnasium at West Bar Pol Stn for a briefing at 9.00 am                                (0900).

                                                                                 y                     it/
             After the briefing I walked to t h e /Midland -€tn, Sheffield to take up

             duties as part of West Bar Serial number                    16.^( Q-ri arrival at the

             station I was enoaged in the control of football fans alightino from

             the trains.       /0oth Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans a rrived at the

             station and were segregated and directed through separate exits and on

             to P.S.Vs, which were w a g i n g             to take the fans to the Sheffield

             Wednesday Football           cluj



             At approximately 2.30 pm (1430),                  together with the rest of my serial,
                                                                                  PAGE    2
                                                                                  S332S

I travelled to the        ground on a P.S.V,



At approximately jg.45 pm (1445)            I was still on the       PSV in Leppings

Lrt.   I saw there was a large/ crowd of fans still outside the ground,

and a large number of people walking

from the direction of ^Halifax Rd along Leppings Ln towards that

entrance.     On our a/rival at Penistone Rd,            I   alighted from the bus and

walked into the ground via the main police access                  road.

                                                                       j


Together with the other officers from my serial                  I went Ito the

gymnasium where we were to report for standby dut ie s.^ Almost as soon

as we had arrived,      our s e r i a / w a s   instructed to go to the perimeter

track in front of the J A e s y S t a n d .     I understood that there was       a

problem with the crowd but I             did not know exactly what.



I walked onto the track        in front of the West Stand.            I noticed that

the football players were on the pitch, although I cannot say whether
                                                    /
the game had in fact started., or if it was the pr^-mat ch warm up. At

this time I was not aware of anything untoward/^                  I continued round the

track until    I got to the centre of the West/Stand.                That was when I

noticed that the people directly behind y n e                fencing were screaming and

shouting at us to do something as they were getting crushed.



I was spat at by a number of the fans.                I saw that the people at the

fencing were being crushed up to the fence and a young girl aged about
                   '/
15 years old was extremely squashed.               She was crying and obviously

distressed.      I bemt down to her and told her not to panic it would be

alright.     The people round her wet/e trying in vain to push back away

from her.     She was   in pen no. 3 -A rea, to my left o f the railing, which

divides    pens 3 and 4.      There was no way of gettyng to this gi rl.              I
                                                                             PAGE      3
                                                                             S3328
                                        /
initially shouted to the crowd to/push backwards,           but I realised

immediately that this was of no/use.         A youth aged about      16 years old

pi imbed up onto the fencing,      /I climbed onto a metal bar in front of

the fence and helped him o v e r .    Once on the track X told him to stay

there and he did, as requested.        Other fans followed suit and I he 1ped

them climb over the fe nc e ^apd onto the perimeter track.           1 was

then joined by a number j/f male officers who ^lso started pulling

people over the f e nc^pfg.   As they were taller and stranger than 1, I

moved out of the way,     thinking they would get more people out quicker

and relieve the crush around the girl.         There was nothing more        I could

do at this   point so I went to gate number 4/ which had beejt opened



Some fans were climbing over the railing’s which divided pens 3 and 4.

I was --------------------------------
      assisting them out of the g a tye /     It was at this point that one

supporter who was standing at the^gate in pen no. 4 refused to move

out of the w a y .   He be came abusive and conti nually swore at m e , saying

he'd got out of the crush and/was watching the match.             I realised the

game was still be i ng Vplayecj^   I had to forcibly move this man out of

the way onto the periKjet^'f track.      I assisted other fans out of the

gate.   People   in pen 3 were hindered by the centre railings and had

difficulty climbing over them in order to reach gate 4.



I saw that some of the     perimeter fence had beep pulled down, people
                           -------------------- ----- j --------------- - --------
we re be i ng carried out and laid on the pitc^/        As othe r officers hdd

joined me at the gate     I left in order to see if I could help anyone

else.   I made sure that everyone      laid on the pitch had someone helping

them or rendering first aid.



I assisted a fireman who was giving the/kiss of life to a heavily

built man aged approximately 25 ye            who was wearing black tracksuit
                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                            ww w£<~w

         bottoms and tra in ees .        We were subsequently joined by a doctor who

         took over until an ambulance arrivedySmd the man was conveyed in
                                               /
         that.      At one point a couple of fans on the pitch were becoming

         aggressive towards fans in the North Stand.                   I spoke to them,

         eventually calmed them down and they left the pitch area.                     Police

         Officers and fans carried other injured people off the pitch to the

         gymnasium,          1 went to the gymnasium a nd in that area saw a number of

         a m b ul an ce s.    I helped clear a route f o ^ t h e m .     I subsequently w ^ n t , as

         directed,      onto the North Stand for 4        de br ief , following whicfor I

         attended at the casualty bureau at Ecclesfield Training Cei/tre and

 4^      carried out duties there.

              Dear Mr Jones,.

              I c o n fi r m the r e q u e s t made i ni t ially by Counsel for the i n j u r e d a n d b e r e a v e d
              Mr Hytner QC, t h r ou g h Mr C o l l i n s QC, for a r ra n g e m e n t s to be made for the video
              footage of the s ce n es on the ter ra c es at the L e p p i n gs Lane end to be s h ow n to
              those b e r e a v e d fam il i es who w i s h e d to see the v id e o s at Liverpool.

              We are    very    mu ch o b l i g e d to y o u for a greeing to this r e q u e s t and I will be in

K             touch to arrange a c o n v e n i e n t date for the showing.

              I have writ t en in the last B u l l e t i n to all S o l i c i to r m e m be r s of the Group
              n o t i f y in g them o f the p r o p o s e d showing, warni n g t h e m that the scenes are
              distr e ss i n g and a s king them to c o nf i rm wheth e r their clien t s do w i s h to
              attend.

              Todate I have r e c e i v e d p o s i t i v e replies from a p p r o x i m a t e l y 6 or 7 firms b u t
              have g i v e n eve r yo n e a dea dl i ne of Friday this w e e k to let me k n o w whe th e r their
              c lients do wish to a t t e nd and if c on v en i e nt to y o u I wi ll g e t in touch in the
              early pa r t o f n e x t w e e k to let y o u kn o w numbers an d so that a co n v en i e n t date
 A            and time can be arranged.

            Some Social W o r ke r s are w i l l i n g to attend w i t h their clien t s w h i c h should help
            and as agreed I h a v e e x t e n d e d the invitation to Social W o rk e r s w h o are in volved
            in the "helpline" p r o j e c t s in the Merseyside area.            I also c o n f i rm that some
“ [) il    of the Groups c l i en t s have also e xp r essed the w i s h to see the still phot og r ap h s
  5.      / which were e x h i b i t e d at the Inquiry and if they c an identify r el a tives have
               a print.

               I u nd e r s t a n d that there is a spare set of n e g a t i v e s and if y o u wi s h I w o ul d
               be happy to take those and to arrange for print s to be available at Liverpool
          V    for Social W o r k e r s a nd c l i e n ts to see and then if they w is h we can arrange to
          ^ ‘take further p ri n t s for their use.

                I look forward to h e a r i n g fro m y o u and again I am very gra t ef u l for yo u r assistance

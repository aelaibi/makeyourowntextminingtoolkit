                  ten mi ntues or so and then                     car r ied o n .



                  We a r r i v e d     in S h e f f i e l d at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 pm        (1400)        and the       coach

                  driver      parked the          coach at the top of a big hill about                               two miles           from

                  the    ground.         There were           lots of other          coaches and t h o usands                of    people

                  walking.            After    the   coach was          parked      I began walking                towards       the

                  g round w ith



                  We w a l k e d down a big hill                 past shops houses a n d supermarkets.                             I saw a

                  number      of supp o r t e r s      d r i nking alcohol           from      cans w hich          I think       they got

                  from shops           I d i d n ’t see a n y fighting among                   the    s u pporters       or any other-

                  kind    of disorder.



                  At a p p r o x i m a t e l y £.1 5     pm     (1415)     we a r r i v e d at       the L e p pings LN gates

S .o - e .        t h a t ’s the       large    blue     railing        ones.      There was a large                 number       of
  u . I—      .   s up p o r t e r s a lr e a d y there         but    they were       going      t h r o u g h the    turns t i l e s

                  not very fast            it a p p e a r e d    quite     slow.       There was            a number        of

                  Policemen           between the        blue     gates and the            t u r n s t i l e s and    I queued at

                  one of the turnstiles,                  as     I got to the actual                 t u rnstile      the P o l i c e m a n

                  outside       the turnstile            checked my ticket and told me                         I was at          the wrong

                  one and       pointed out the               correct      one to me.
                                                                                                               page          ::
                                                                                                               SI 354

At this       time the        crowd was         quite dense          but there was           no chaos.          The

tu r nstile         I was at      then was          the ones       to the       left    inside   the     blue

gates.        We then began to make                   our way across            the     t urnstiles      towards

the other           set w hi c h were         on the       right    hand side          of the blue gates.

At this       time the        crowds were            now getting          really tight and          I began          to

get worried.             I said to                    " I ’m not getting           in that."           And decided

to stay back           from the turnstiles.                   T here were         some P o l i c e m e n there        on

horses who were trying                   to tell       people       to move       but    due to the       crowds

there     now       it was    impossib le           to do a n y thing       other       than move w i t h the

people w hi ch ever way they                    pushed you.



The    crowds were           now surging            back and forth trying                to get t h r o u g h the

turnstil es.           But we      didn't       have a dogs          chance       of getting       in and

people were           getting      pushed together                very tightly,          so tight      in fact        one

ma n had his hand against                     up against my s h o u l d e r and he               couldn't       move

it.     I saw a number             of s u p p o r ters       climbing a wall             w hich was      to my       left,

an d getting          into the ground.                I d o n ’t know       if these       had tickets          for

the game.            A number      of P o l i c e m e n were        trying      to tell      supporters         to

move    and not        push but         there was          nothing       that    could be done.           At

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.45    pm    (14455       we were       still    outside       the turn s t i l e s

getting       no nearer          to getting          in when all          of a sudden a large             gate       to

my    right     opened and e v e r y b o d y          near to       it    including myself and

made    for     it.     We went         thr o u g h the gate and            found ourselves            inside        the

area at       the back of the              turnstiles,            it was    now about 2.50          pm    (1450).

I saw the           tunnel and         i mm ed i a t e l y thought        that was       the only entrance

to the      terraces and made                 for    it at a w al k i n g        pace.      There was      other

s u p p o rt er s    there also m a k i ng           for    it,    some    of w h o m were       running.        We

e n te re d the tunnel           w h i ch was        quite    dark       but you       could see the end of

the    tunnel.         At this         time    the tunnel          was    not    crowded and we made             our

wa y quite          comfortable         to the side.              At the    end of the tunnel             we went

                                                                                                                S 1334

            to the      left    of the     tunnel      because     of the    very    large    steel     girder,

            w hi ch    causes you to go one way or another.                      We stood at the           back      of

            the    terrace      in Pen Four and we saw the                 pitch.     I saw that        there were

            some      players a lr ea dy on the           pitch and the       s upporters were          in good

            voice      shouting      from the time that            I got to the terrace             to the     time

            the match started w h i ch was a couple                   of minutes.           I found myself

            being      pushed more and more             towards     the front       of the terrace.            This

            h a p p e n e d quite    quic k l y at first       but then as the m a t c h star t e d            it
        5
            became a surge and             I was      pushed very q u i c k l y towards         t he f r o n t .    At
K .O.
            this      time we were        so tigh t l y     packed together         in the Pen that           there was

            a b s o l u t e l y nothing    you    could do to move          independently,          that   is you

            m o v e d whe n    pushed and at          no other     time.     This    crushing       t o g ether went

            on for a few mint ties.



            The    crush then became             so bad that       people    seemed to start          to   panic and

            I found myself          so t ig h t l y    packed that       it became a t r e m e n d o u s      struggle

            for me      to get my breath.             People at the         front    of the terrace w h i c h was

            no more than five foot               in front     of    me were     screaming and s h o uting and

            being     forced    right      up aga i n s t   the fence a n d wall.            There were Police

            on the      perimeter      fencing        looking at the        crowd and they were            indicating

            to the      crowd to      push back but there           was     absolutely       no way this           could

            be d o n e .



            The    pressure     on me at         this time was so great             that    I was    being     pushed

            down.      People all         a r ou nd were    standing       on your    feet and you were

            unable     to move your         feet      so w hen you was       pushed the       thing    that

            ha p p e n e d was you went          down on the floor.           This    h a p p e n e d to me    I went

            right     down on the floor and               people    fell    on me.     At    this time        I thought

            I was     going    to die      because      of the weight        on top of me        I just       couldn't

            breathe.                Imy fr i e n d who was       still     by my side       had g r a b b e d my hand
                                                                                                                   PAGE             !:

               and held on to it.

s a io P e -   While     I was    on the    floor    I became aware            of a man a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 4-26

               yearg     lying on top of me.              He was    blue       in the face and did not appear
Sft?vj(*£r                ---------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
                     ^,e breathing, he was as stiff as a poker and I saw no m o v e m e n t from

               him.     S o me ho w I      I then m an a g e d to get me           to my feet and as           I stood up

      ^        I could still        see    people    crushed up a g a i n s t        the fence       screaming.            I

               c a n ’t remember who        I saw being        passed over          the    fence   but there was a

               lot.      There was also        people      lying on the         floor at      the foot        of the

               ter r a c e s .



                       and myself       then began to make               our way    back towards        the    rear of

               the    terrace.      W hen we      got there      I saw a large            number   of   lads    sitting

               on the     floor against        barriers       and we did what we             could to help         them.



               I d o n ’t know what        time     it was by now because             I ’d lost all track           of

               time.      We then made       our way       to the front          of the     terrace and got

               t h ro u g h the fence w hi c h      had    by now been          ripped open.



               We    got onto the       pitch helped        by a P o l i c e m a n and g e n e r a l l y w a n d e r e d

               about    trying     to help.         We did c a . r r y    one ma n to the Gym.



               We stayed on the           pitch until     about 4         pm   (1600)     and the Police         told          us

               to make      our way back       to our      coaches w h i c h we       did.



               We got on the        coach and the          organiser        spoke    to us and had all            the

               tickets      from us w h i ch had not been ha n d e d               in and    ripped them up.

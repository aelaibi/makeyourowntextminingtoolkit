Dear Member

POLICE AUTHORITY SPECIAL MEETING - HILLSBOROUGH

Further to my recent letter I wish to advise you that I do not consider it will be necessary to
call a special meeting of the Police Authority this week. Unless the situation alters it is my
intention to update members at the next ordinary meeting of the Police Authority on
11 December 1998.

Yours faithfully




Maureen uaaes        f
Assistant Clerk and Solicitor

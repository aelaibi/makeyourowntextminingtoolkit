             He wa lk e d down to the ground and               purchased a m atch day          programme,

             because       it was   so early we decided           to go to a pub for          some    lunch and a

             d r i nk



             We went       to a public      h o u s e , w hich was about     half    hour's walk       from the

             ground.        I can't    remember what        the   pub was    called but       it was fairly

             close       to a hospital.



             The six of us had about             two or three        pints   of beer and a s an dwich

             lunch.



             At about 2 „ 10 pm        (1410)    we    left the    pub and made       our way back towards

             the      football    ground,    there were a few pubs           open on the       route we walked

             back       towards   the ground.         There were other \ u p p o r t e r s    d r i nki ng   in

             thes'fe'sjjubs, however        I never saw any signs of d r u n k e n e s s , disorder                or

             any fighting.



             T here were a large          number      of supporters making          their way towards             the

             football       ground and the a tmosphere            seemed very friendly.

In Lep pi ngs Ln we split                 up and                         and myself went          towards      the

in the      fcurnstile a r e a .



There were         no q u e u e s visible at              the turnstiles.              On a rr iving we joined

onto     the    rear of the mass              of     people heading           towards     the terrace

turnstiles.              I h a d n ’t been        in the terraces at H i l l s b o r o u g h before and

at first        I was      not    sure    if we were           in the      correct      queue.     The mass       of

people we had joined onto                      extended backwards                  from the    turnstiles and

b eyond the outer             perimeter           gates.

all    the time they were                in my view.             I did not see anyone             close     them at

chain      link    perimeter           fence    by the     river    e m b a n k m e n t , it was    fairly free

in that area.



We    stood    in this         position for about            two minutes         looking     into the mass

of    people      heading       for the turnstiles*                On the    side    closest        to us    by

At about 2.50         pm <1450)           I m a n ag ed to enfrer the ground through a

      We star te d to walk            towards       the tunnel w h ic h we         believed was       the only

      entrance       to the terracing,              I h a d n ’t seen any signs         indicating

      otherwise.           As we w al k e d      towards       the tunnel      I heard a Policeman,           I

      think       he was wearing a flat              cap,      shout out something        like    i!Gpen the

      I c a n ’t recall        what    the P o l i c e m a n    looked    like.     I heard someone        reply

      from    the area of Gate            ’C ’ querying          the   command.     And a gain the officer

      shouted something             like,     "Open the gates            to   relieve   the   pressure. 11         I

      then    looked at                a nd said something             like,    "Bloody hell,      t h e y ’re

      H av in g    seen the     number      of    people outside          the turnstiles        I decided to

      be cautious and went and sTtt^d by a wall                           in the vicinity of the t u n n e .

      c o nt ro ll ed flow of         people      through the gate steadily.                  I w ould estimate

      between about 50 and              100 people were a l lo we d through the                  gate and then

      theNiate was          closed.

and     I could see we were              in line with the goal.                            We wanted to work                 our

the     increase       in pressure        did not appear              to be as a result                     of any surge

                                                                     <   f^ ru n rt
I was aware         t'ha& ^the Police were                         stopping people                   from climbing      ova/-

the    perimet'erNfenee         onto      the          pitch?                the Police were            pushing     them back

into t h p e n ,



W hi ls t all   this was        o ccurring                p^~opie in my vicinity                           e s houting at

the Po 1 ice w ho were          on the other side of the                                      perimeter    fence to open

up the g at^Nonto         the    pitch.                I saw t h K ^gate opened and a P o l i c e m a n

stood    in ths entrance          g e st ic ul at in g at the                            people      to our     rear to move

backwards?      he was     shouting              but          I c o u l d n ’t say what                he was    shouting.



I could see                he was         standing                    just to my              left and    closer to the

gate.     I could hear          people s h o u t i n g , "Stop the g a m e " , this was                                 the

first    time   I was aware          that           the game had started.



I. can ’t say what        time    it was               but when a P o l i c e m a n finally opened up

the gate      leading onto the                pitches, both                              and    I made    our way towards

it.     There was a surg"e\forwards as^^ e o p l e                                      headed towards          the g a t e.    I

saw           go towards        the gate and                        lost sight            of him.        I got    cut off

by the    rush of      people     towards                 the gate,



I next saw              a couple of minuses                                  later      just as he was          getting     out

through the gate?          there was a Pol ic^qian pulling him out thro ug h the

gate.      I shouted to                  " D o n ’t leave me",     or something        like that.

I cannot      relate        to time    exactly but by the time                    got out through

the gate      I could just about            see onto     the   pitch and the game         had

d e f in i te l y stopped.



I think      it was about 3^20           pm <1520)      when         e ve nt ua ll y   pulled ms out

t hr ou gh the ^ate,          it was just as they were taking               the goal     nets d o w n .

I had a problem g a t i n g            out through the gate onto            the    pitch because

there were          two bodlesNilyirig through t h e open gateway.                1 cannot         say

m u c h about       these   two bodies,      they were face        down,    I can't     r e c a l 1 what

they were wearing,             1   d o n ’t know   if they were dead bodies            or just

u nc on sc i ou s    people.



As a reship!\of my e xp er iences              in the    crush    in pen number        four    I

r eceived br\:i.s!i^ng to the           ribs on the      right hand side of my body and

s c ra p i n g of t he s ki n on my        r i g h t hand side.     After    I got out onto              the

pitch someone          carne up to me and asked me             if I wan te d to go to hospital

but    I d i d n ’t want     to at the time.




                    CAT

As far as       1 am aware         I did not witness any deaths,             the first        time       I

was\^are        that      peh&j^le had died was when           I had got out onto        the       pitch

a nd   I saw a number          ofNj^odies    lying on the        pitch with things        covering

their    heads.



I was    not aware of any sort of disturbance                     or fighting       or drinking

inside the          footbal 1 ground.        I was    not a^^re at      the time       that a crush

barrier      had broken        in pen number        three.      I Eventually       left the

            football       groimd at about         half    past four     (1630)    of my own accord.



            I would       like to ''add that at thsKtime              between about 3 pm      (1500)    and    I

            think    ten past thrVe          (1510) ,x when\p eo pl e were        trapped on the terraces

            a n d s creaming       to be    let out,      tm? Police     failed to    respond to these

            cries for help and             in failing      to allow     people    out through the gates

            onto    the    pitch contri bu te d to more             injuries and deaths      occurring.



            In regards          to the way the      incident was hahd le d after the m atch was

            st op pe d    I would    like    to say that      initially tftf Police         did not appear

            to    respond quickly enough,            b u t X gnce    things   got moving    they were     really

            wo rk i ng    hard to get       people o u t .



            I also       felt    in\elation     to tl\ Po     I i   c i ng at the ground that     there was

            no crowd       control    auts i de the ground           in c omparison to     last y e a r ’s game.

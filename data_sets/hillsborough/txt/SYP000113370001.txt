              Since October                 1987,    I have been the fifth                      Inspector at           ’F I ’ Sub-

              D i v is io n and from that time                            I have    had    respons i b i l i t y for the

               preparation of the                   *F1*   football             orders at         *F1*.       I took over from

               Inspector Calvert                   who had been doing                    the football         orders at Hammer ton

              Road for a number                    of years and the                 systems       of organising           the manpower

              etc.       are    largely        based on systems                    he    introduced.          G e n e r a l l y speaking,

              officers who a t t e nd the S he ff i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football                               G r o u n d on match

               duty all         say that           the Policing               of the grounds at H i l l s b o r o u g h             is more

               efficient          than that at other                       grounds       in the     country.         It may well           be

               that as S h e f fi el d W e dn es da y Football                          Club    is a First         d i v ision      club,

              more money             is a v ailable and as such,                        m a n power    is not      reduced as            it is

              at other          grounds.

               I was      involved with              the o rg a n i s a t i o n of the              1988 S e mi-Final             for

              Liverpool           and N ot ti n g h a m Forest.                    This was       done together with Chief

               Inspector Beal                and    Inspector Calvert                    in consultation with

              S up er i n t e n d e n t     Mu r r a y and Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mole.

              As the s emi-finals                   for    1989 were drawing                   near    I was w a t c h i n g which

               teams were            likely to be          in the semi-finals.                        During     the week

               commencing            13 M a r ch     1989,           it looked as           if a semi-final            could r>®

staged at H il l s b o r o u g h and at that                  stage    I started a d d r e s s i n g my mind

to a possible             semi-final         at Hillsborough.

On Saturday,             18 M a r c h    1989 the F .A . Cup 6th           rounds took         place.        On 20

March        19S9,     the draws         for the semi-final            took    place and again,

L iverpool           and N o t t i n g h a m Forest were        drawn to       play.        I believe       it was

later on that day that Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mole                       informed me that             the

semi-final            between those          two teams was         due to be staged at

Hillsborough.              Easter Bank Holi d a y w e e k e n d was due on 24,                      25,   26 and

27 March         1989 and together with Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t                   Mole,    a meeting

was a r r a n g ed for Wednesday,                 22 M arch     1989,     of all     persons        involved

o pe r a t i o n was m a i n t a i n e d throughout.

Together wit h Chief               Inspector Beal,             the    previous m atch order           for the

1988 semi-final           was      studied and as this was a tota l l y successful

operation,       it formed the basis                   of the     1989 semi-final.            Briefs were

prepared with Chief S up er i n t e n d e n t Beal,                    these were all         dis c u s s e d     in

detail     with S u pe ri nt en de nt Mu r r a y and a p p r o v e d by Chief

Su pe ri nt en de nt Duckenfield.

Basically,       the serials were the same as for the                            1988 semi-final             with

the following m a in            changes.           I will      deal w ith these         brie f l y as       I am

aware    that Chief           Inspector Beal will                be dealing with the           changes          in

minute     detail       in his      report.

Three    Inspectors who acted as                     liaison officers          to sector       commanders

were    d is p e n s e d wit h as they were               under      employed.        One   reserve serial

sta t i o n e d at South S t a nd /S pi on Kop was                   d i spensed with as       it was

superfluous        to requirements.                  S u p e r v i s i o n of mobile    units was       reduced

by two     Inspectors         as    in practice           they    could only be w ith one unit at

a time.       Serials         1 and 2 were           increased by two Police C o n s t a b l e s and

one Police S e r geant             r e s p e c t i v e 1y .

Serials     11 and       12    (North Stand)            were     dec r e a s e d as their mai n task for-

ensuring      that s u pporters             did not use the P e n istone Roa d N o r t h egress

did not     require       the manning a f f o r d e d            in 1988.      Serial       '15 was

dec r e a s e d by one Sergeant,                leaving       one Sergeant       s upervising         one serial.

Furthe r    serials       on the outskirts                of the ground        patrols were           reduced

from, one Sergeant             and 10 Police C on s t a b l e s          to one S e r geant and eight

Constables.         None       of these serials were                  directly    involved with access

or egress       from the football                stad i u m and       it was    considered by all               that

these    extra two Police C o nstables                        per serial    were a d ditional          to

requi r e m e n t s .

Better     use was made            of resources and at Phase                   III,    four   serials        from
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          R264

within the ground,,                that was       serials,       2, 8,   20 and 21, were          to assist

the track serial              to    prevent any          pitch    invasion at the end of the match

Also,     during       the    1988 semi          final,    all    serials    d e p loyed outside          the

ground were          on stan d b y for           refreshments at C l aywheels Lane                throughout

the d u r ation of the match.                     The y were      some quarter        of a mile away

•from the ground and were too far away to deploy                                 in the ground at

short     notice.         This year,            following    an idea      put forward by

Su pe ri nt en de nt Murray,            from 2.45         p.m.    on the day of the s e m i ~ f i n a l , a

P olice     coach was         sta t i o n e d    in L e p pings Lane      near to the ground and a

further Police            coach was sta t i o n e d         in P e nistone Roa d near           to gate

S t at i o n throughout            the match,       five    serials      i.e.    five Ser g e a n t s and 40

total    success.     However,        just because      the     1988 semi-final          had been a

success    earnest     c o n s ideration was made when            preparing       the    1989 s e m i ­

final and every effort was made to                  improve      on an a l r e a d y successful

o p e rat ion from the      previous year.

The Operational       Order was a p p r o v e d and       circulated on 6 April                1989 to

lot of N ot ti n g h a m Forest             fans a r r i v i n g    early.       No e v i dence       of alcohol

Liverpool         side,    still    no visible            evidence      of alcohol.

At 2.45      p.m.     in the v i c i nity of the gym n a s i u m and Police Roo m area                                I

was aware         that there were a number                   of prisoners         on the       cell    buses and

that    the Police R o o m were              busy but        I spoke with         Inspector Barker,                who

did not      report any         problems          other    than busy,        but this was            to be

expected.          E ve r y t h i n g was    still       going     to plan.       About       this    time       I was

aware    of a mess a g e        from Control             that    there were       problems at Leppings

Lane and that           further manpower was                 required.         About        this time

problems with           radio    reception.              I recall Police Serge a n t G o d d a r d ’s

(Control)         voice was      having a          ' w a r b l i n g ’ effect.      I thought my            radio

battery was         faulty,      othfer officers were                expe r i e n c i n g   difficulty,

obvious a radio            fault,     not my        particular         radio.       I got the         impression

that Control          were    receiving           calls,     but officers         outside were             having

diffi c u l t y    in receiving Control.

It was a p p a r e n t     by the tone            of Police Sergeant G o d d a r d ’s voice                  that

urgent a s s i s ta nc e was         required at L e p pings Lane.                    I returned to the

g y nmasium an d        informed Control              that      there were a large number                   of    ’D ’

D i v i si on officers        on standby who were a v ailable                     for deployment.                 I

got    from Control          that officers were                 required at the track,                L e p pings

Lane    end,      West S t a n d and        'A'    gate.

I grouped the serials t ogether and as the Sergeant in charge left the

              j n rn unable         to say       if Control            received rny messages.                    All     the above

//            officers were             deplo y e d at 2.50                  p.m.    It was       obvious        from Control          that

               they     required further manpower                            to the Leppings Lane                 end.       I do    recall

               some     radio message about                      the gates          being    opened and that                people were

               on the track.              At that              stage    I got       the    impression from the gymnasium

               that     there was a pitch                      invasion.         I then      regrouped           *.E* D i v i s i o n Crime

               S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit,             who    I think       came    into the ground from

               P en i s t o n e Roa d end.                I spoke       to him and he went onto the                        track.      At

               this     stage w h i c h was               now a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 .10      p.m.     as    I recall,         it just

               still        seemed as though there had been trouble at                                       the Leppi n g s Lane

               end and that there                     had been a pitch               invasion.

               I then went            down onto            the track          between the N orth S tand and the Hop.

               There were a lot of officers                             in front          of the L e p pings Lane             terraces

               and obviously a number                          of fans       in front       of them.         The N o t t i n g h a m

Forest    fans    on the Kop were         chanting and        I got the         i mpression at that

stage    that a large         number   of fans were        going       onto the    pitch at

L eppings Lane       end and that there was              going    to be severe         public

disorder.        At that stage         I feared that       fans may get to the Police

R oom and atte m p t     to    release    the    prisoners.        At this       stage also         I

could hear over         the    radio that fans were          trapped at the Leppings Lane

end and that medical            care was    required.        A m b u l a n c e m e n were    arriving

and   I a s s i s t e d wit h getting medical           care a n d a mbulances         down onto          the

track.     The    crowd was      continually hostile             and    I was aware         of about         10

to 12 Police        dogs and handlers           being    on standby       near to the         rear       of the

K o p/ No rt h Stand    entrance.        Then a number       of injured and dead were

brought    from the      track    up to the K o p / N o r t h Stand        exit on stretchers

and hoarding        boards.

At first    it seemed as         if there were          just a few,       six or so,         dead or

injured and then         people    came    running       off the track with dozens.                     At

this stage w hich was           probably about 3 .20         p.m.      Superintendent          Bates

arrived,    he came      into the g y m n a s i u m wit h me,          the tables and         chairs

for the meals were            cleared and bodies were             placed on the         floor       in the

gymnasium.        Injured      people were       taken to the far end of the

gymnasium.       Many Police Officers were                bewil d e r e d and some were

crying.     As bodies were         being    placed.on the floor,                friends were with

some and they were; hysterical.                 Two Liverpool          males,     one with a dark

m o u sta che was    drunk and shouting at the Police,                    he was    r e strained by

D et e c t i v e S e r g e a n t S mith and another C.I.D.         officer.        He was wanting

to fight and was o b v i ou sl y         in drink and shock.              The    bodies      kept       being

brought    in fast and         I was asking Control          for a doctor          to ensure            that

they were    dead.      There was nothing           to suggest          that any of the         bodies

were alive,       but   I was    conscous       they had not been c e rtififed as dead.

The   bodies were       covered with the table             cloths       p r eviously    laid out for

the meals.        A doctor with a beard a t t e n d e d after about 30 minutes                            and
                                                                                                        PAGE

certified the dead.              I recall Det e c t i v e S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M c K a y    in the

g ym nasium and a rr an ge me nt s were           getting      in hand for the bodies                   to be

number ed and an officer a ll oc a t e d to each of them.                         Outside         the

gy m n a s i u m there were      numerous       bodies and       injured      people     lying      on the

ground near       to the       cell    buses.     St.    J o h n ’s A m bulance     personnel,

Police Officers          and    civilians were          in attendance.          There were about

six young St.       J o h n ’s personnel         who were all        under     14 or     13 years         of

age,    who were    very dist r e s s e d near          to the Police Room.              I got these

sat    in the    cab part       of a cell       bus and a P o l i c e m a n    from    * 8 2 ’ was

detailed to       look after          them,

I remained       in the v i c inity of the g y m n a s i u m for the              next     hour     or so.

Inspector Charles was             detailed to start making                records      of the       bodies

and several       C.I.D.       officers       came to assist.

About 4.30       p.m.    I saw Chief          Inspector Beal       and toether we grouped all

the    remaining officers who were not                   involved with bodies              or other

duties    together       in the N orth Stnd.             A short     de-brief       took    place

telling Se r g e a n t s   to hand their          de-~brief     sheets      in at that        location

before    being    s tood down by Control               from the ground.           Arrangements

were made       via messgae       switch for a message              to be relayed to all

Police Stations         and over        local    radio    that no Police Offic e r s               had been

injured    in the       incident.

About 4.30       p.m.    I saw Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mole       in unif o r m at the

ground,    he then took          control      of events.        Many officers          throughout          the

next    12 hours    or so expressed             comment     that    it was     reassuring          to see

Chief S u p e ri nt en de nt Mole.

At 6    p.m.    I returned to the gym n a s i u m and a s s isted with superv i s i o n

of the C a s u a l t y B u r e a u forms.

T h roughout     the evening          I was    involved with        liaising wit h the

relatives and social             workers and arr a n g e m e n t s      for    extra telephones                to

be    placed    in the gym n a s i u m for the use of              relatives.

At 3.30 a.m.        on Sunday,            16 April       1989,     I left the gym n a s i u m after                 the

last    body had been          removed and           returned to duty at               11 a.m.        the    same

been    in deep shock          since       the event and           in particular, 'six of my Area

W h en L iverpool       a t te nd ed      the s e m i - f i n a 1 at H i l l s b o r o u g h    last year,          a

large    number.of       fans were           the worse        for drink and they were                   even

u r inating     on the upper             concourse       of the N o r t h Stand,           instead of

bothering       to use     the toilets.              As such,       urine was        running        out     of the

upper    concourse       onto      the enclosure            outside       the Police R oom and

Officers       from the gym n a s i u m to deal wit h this                     problem.

In the    planning       stages,          up until       the day of the event and up until

2.45    p.m.    a p p r o x i m a t e l y on 15 April         1 9 8 9 ? everything was            going      to pla

and was showing          to be success              in every way.

            after,      together w i th fact,         that some         public   houses     in the Wadsley

            Mew Years Eve,            one   can draw ones own           conclusions as to whether

            Liverpool          fans were a r r iving      late,    the worse       for drink    or not.

            As   I was        not at the Leppings Lane            end    prior   to the b u i ld-up of fans,     1

            am unable          to   comment   on how or why        the disaster       happened.

            a ll oc a t e d    to bodes,      I did not    p h ysically assist        the    removal   of any

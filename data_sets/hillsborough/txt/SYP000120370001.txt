/fft/er briefing by Inspector White all officers of serial                              14 took up

positions at turnstiles* A to G„ PC                     100S Wild and myself and PC            1278

Lang and P€ 3232 Burton took up positions at turnstiles A and B.

When the turnstiles opened there were not many fans outside the

ground and prior to entering the ground were subject to a search and

were then subject to a further search once inside the ground.                                  Due to

this double searching of fans I anticipated that there would be some

objections or adverse                   comment    regarding   this but neither were

forthcoming at this time.                                                                               '

As the morning                   progressed and the number of fans increased I saw

several                   fans attempt to gain entry to the ground via turnstiles A and                          ;

B , only to be told by the turnstile operator that they were at the

wrong turnstile.                    They then had to force their way back towards the

other turnstiles                   on Lappings Lane end.       Around -1.00pm (1300)         the        !

number of fans outside the ground had greatly increased and we then                                            .

had to be more selective in our searching.  Around 2.30prn (1430) a                                            !

turnstiles A to G?                   they were    instructed to get down and were ejected                        j

from the ground by other officers.                                                                               I
                                                                                                             '   1
At this time there were several                     hundred people hanging around the

area of the turnstiles and due to the amount of fans now entering

the ground were asked to move from that area to allow fans in.

Several                   people who had entered the ground complained that people at                            ,

the back of the crowd4 we re pushing towards the front,                             and that the

Police should be aware of this.

At this I looked through the turnstiles towards Leppings Lane,

although my view was                   restricted I could see officers on foot and on

horseback who appeared to be attempting to control                         the surge towards

the turnstiles.

People were now struggling to enter the ground and in fact were being

pushed into the wall and turnstile eptrance                    itself.      Many fans were

now complaining that someone would be injured,                    and all officers at

the turnstiles should go outside.                 All     fans were    informed that

officers    inside had a task to perform and that officers outside would

be doing everything        possible to alleviate the problem.

Around 2.40pm I saw that several             fans had again c 1 imbed the outer

wall and were on top of the turnstile entrance roof,                        they were

instructed to get down.           This they flatly refused to do,                   I saw two

youths on the roof showing their tickets to Police officers they were

again instructed to get off the roof,                   but again refused.

By now many fans had congregated around the turnstiles and several

officers including myself were being surrounded by fans who were

being abusive towards us because they had been subjected to the c i

outside the turnstiles.           Fans were now being allowed into the

without the ticket stubs being torn off                    (this I presumed was to allow

quicker entry)      and these were being passed to fans on the roof who in

turn began to throw them over the wall                    to fans awaiting entry.

It had now got to the stage where sear chi ng was                     impossible due to the

amount of fans congregating             inside the turnstile area and together

with several      other officers we attempted to clear the area.                        This was

met with verbal      hostility towards the Police and many fans appeared

to be losing their t e m p e r s ,

I formed the opinion that before too                long a Police officer would be

physically assaulted,        and due to the fact that only serial                    14 was

deployed in that area,         had an officer been assaulted then assistance

would have been very limited and the situation got out of hand.

Thankfully this did not occur.

the '           Whilst speaking with several              fans I was approac he d by a

man who stated that he was a Merseyside Police officer,                         he said that
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 R39S

something had to be done outside or people would be injured.                    He

appreciated the pressure we were under but something had to be done

and f a s t .

I informed him that the officers            outside the ground would he doing

everything       possible-    At this he    left and went     into the ground

without formally identifying himself to me.

Fans were still       congregating round the area inside the turnstiles and

I made several       request for them to move away to allow people to get

through the turnstiles as this           in itself was creating a problem for

fans entering the ground,          I saw    fans   climbing   over the    turnstile and

entering 2 at a time but was unable to prevent                this due to the number

of fans around the turnstiles.             These   people just disappeared      into

the c r ow d .

Shortly before 3.00pm         (1300)   the main exit gate situated near to y

turnstile G suddenly opened and fans began to surge                into the grounds

several officers from the serial            ran towards the gate and I joined

them in an effort to close the gate            (I was of the opinion that the

gate had been forced open by fans)             but this was    impossible.

As the fans5 surged into the ground,           many chanting as they ran,        I

turned #nd saw a gap in the centre of the fans and people moving to

the left and right.          People were screaming and shouting,           I went to

that area with other officers and found that people were on the floor

having tripped or been pushed over            in the rush to get     into the

ground.     These    people were quickly put on their feet and: moved away

to the side walls away from the rush.              Not one person complained to

me about being       injured.

The majority of the fans went towards the tunnel               leading to the

central enclosure but some did go to the South side of the West stand

Eventually the gates were         closed,    some fans were still        coming through

the turnstiles but the numbers outside were greatly reduced.
Mo3t of the fans had gone into the, stand and the rear was almost

clear with just- a few fans milling around.

Serial   14 was then deployed onto the pitch after a report of a pitrh

invasion.     Access to the pitch was gained via the gate      leading fforn

the South side of the West stand into the South stand and walking

down through the seated area.      Whilst walking down the South stand I

could see several fans climbing over the perimeter      fence onto the

track area and there were a large number of fans already on the

pitch.     There were a large number of Police officers and stewards in

the area of the centre enclosures assisting fans to get out via the

emergency exit gates or over the perimeter fence.

Some officers had climbed the perimeter fence in an effort to afjsist

people over the fence.     I went over to the perimeter fence coverinf

the central    south enclosure and saw that people had been crushed

against the perimeter wall and fence,      I would estimate that about 40

to 30 bodies were laid up against the wall on top of one another.

Some who were    in a standing position up against the fence were unable

to move,    being trapped by the   lower half of their body.     Some were

still breathing but it was apparent that many were dead.

The area around the emergency exit gate of the centre south enclosure

was congested with people trying to get out and Police officers

attempting to get inside to rescue the      injured,

I looked towards the centre north enclosure and saw that         part of the

perimeter fence had been pulled away,      allowing fans greater egress

onto the pitch.     I then climbed the fence of the centre south

enclosure and began to sway on the fence hoping that this would give

way and afford greater entry into the enclosure.       The fence did not

give way and I climbed down onto the track.       I could see PS 1341

Crawford was still on the fence assisting a youth over,        who had

caught his clothing on the top of the fence and was in a precarious
position.        I movfed over to assist PS Crawford and as I did so the

youth became free arjd dropped onto the track.          At that point the top

part of one of a crush barrier was thrown from the centre south                  pt

enclosure towards the pitch,         it was about 5 inch in diameter,   7 feet

long and was bent.

It hit the top of the perimeter fence, at the side of PS Crawford,

and began to fall towards the track          I ducked to avoid it hitting me

and caught       it with my left hand.    I managed to keep hold of it and it

did not strike any persons,         I then removed the item onto the pitch to

avoid any person falling over it.          By now many injured and dead had

been removed from the enclosure and were being attended to by St.

John Ambulance brigade,         some fans had torn down advertising boardings

and were using these as make shift stretchers to remove people from

t he pit e h .

I then saw Chief Superintendent Nesbit near the emergency exit gate,

he was instructing officers to form a line either side of the gate to ,

allow for quicker evacuation of the          injured and dead.

I formed one of the         1 ines and assisted in the evacuation,.' handling

many bodies none of which I tan describe.

After all the injured and dead had been removed from the enclosures

and pitch I remained in the area and joined several           other officers

from our serial,         w{? were instructed by PS Crawford to remain at that

location until he had established the whereabouts of all officers

from the s e r i a l .

Several fans were going         round and shaking officers hands,   thanking

them for what they had done.

A message was then passed over the          public address system by police

control     stating that the match had been abandoned,       and that fans

would be allowed to leave once emergency services had cleared away

from the ground.          When the fans were allowed to leave serial    14 was
         deployed as escort for Liverpool    fans,   and they were escorted along

         Leppings Lane to Peni stone Road.    Once the fans had cleared we

         returned to the ground for de-briefing.

         Eventually the majority of the serial were released from the ground

         and returned to Barns ley,   go i ng off duty at 8.00 pm (2000).

wall and were on top of the turnstile entrance roof,           they were

instructed to get down.     This    they flatly refused to do.      I saw two

youths on the roof showing their tickets to Police officers              they

were again instructed to get off the roof,          but again refused.

the amount of fans congregating inside        the turnstile    area and

together with several other officers we attempted to clear           the

area.    This was met with verbal hostility towards         the Police and

many fans appeared to be losing their tempers.

I formed the opinion that before too long a Police officer would be

physically assaulted,    and due to the fact that only serial        14 was

deployed in that area,    had an officer been assaulted then

assistance would have been very limited and the situation got out

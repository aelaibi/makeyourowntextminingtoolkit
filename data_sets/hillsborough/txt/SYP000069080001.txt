a b o u t 20 rnins.        before       finding          one    in R o c k l e y Rd.         After       parking            the

car/we wa l k e d to the               ground about 5 -1 0 m i n s .                  As we w a l k e d to the

  rarund 1 saw Police                 motor    cyclists           but there were             no groups          of     people

  eing .e s c orted by Police.                  Between           parking         the     car    I saw a few

supporters          drinking          but    no-one was          drunk,,          we got        tpj   tp e gro u n d a t

about        2.30pm    < 1430) .        There       were       crowds      of     people               "■>/ turns t i l e s so

we stood at           the back whilst               we    sorted         out whi ch/g/ses to’
                                                                                            v -§o through.

Two    of the       lads had got             terrace        tickets                       and myself         had stand

tickets.           The signs about             the       turnstiles          were a bit           confusing          because

they showed Home and Awa y                     supporters.                After      we    had found         the     correct

t u r nstile       we started          to make       our way towards                 them.        There was          no

o r d e r l y queuing and no-one                was       trying         to o r g anise a n y .         There        was      the

odd one          or two    police       officers          about       near      to the      turnstiles          but         they

were more          i n terested        in stopping             people      from      climbing         over    the wall.

Wh i l e     we were wait i n g         to go       through the            turns t i l e s      there was          some

jostling,          in fact,       it was more             than that,            we were      getting         crushed,,

P e o p l e were      shouting         "sort    this        o u t ” ,,    Kids    were      crying.          It took

about        10 fftins. to get          t h r o u g h the turnstile.

I did        not see any         gates       open    other       than the         turnstiles.

Once       inside     the ground we            found the             seats      quite      easily.        A steward

checked my ticket                at    the    bottom of the               stairs      to the North S t a n d and

w hen we         had got    into       the    stand they were                checked again by a steward.

I took my seat at about                      2.43pm       (1445).          The      players       h a d n ’t come           out

onto       the    pitch,    so    I went and got a cup of tea.                              People a r o u n d were

compla i n i n g about           the    lack    of       o r g a n i s a t i o n outside        the gr o u n d and            the

lack       of Police       generally.           I was          sat    in the N o rZ 'h Stand             near      to the

                     that        it was       because       there was           too     many in the           centre pens,,          I    saw a

                     there was a lot of                  people         on the      track       behind    the goals and              people

w hen    I went       to them         but    no-one        was a t t e m p t i n g       to do anything.              After

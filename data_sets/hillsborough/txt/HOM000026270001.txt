Dear Mr John

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


I am writing to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 12 January
to Professor L Maunder in which you raise several matters.  I
know that Professor Maunder has written personally to you about
the invitation to address a seminar on 15 March.

You mention your conversations with both Professor Maunder and me
about awareness of "The Handbook of Sports and Recreational
Building Design" and I am grateful to you for the additional
information contained in your letter.  I had, as you know,
already established that the Institution of Structural Engineers
(and in particular its ad hoc committee on appraisal of sports
grounds) was aware of the existence of this publication, but
appreciate your confirmation of the position.

                                        Yours sincerely

Dear Prof. Maunder

The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Enquiry

It was very pleasant to speak to you by telephone this week.
I confirm our interest in considering you for the seminar which
we are proposing to hold jointly w ith the RIBA and at the RIBA
on the subject of "Stadia after Hillsborough".

The present date we have in mind is March 15, but there is some
thought that this may change.

I want to take up the point which we discussed and which had
also been raised with me by Mr Sweet. You were both telling me
about the lack of awareness of our 4 volume publication
"The Handbook of Sports and Recreational Building Design". I
would like to give you the following c o m m e n t s :

a)  This book was published in 1981, has had excellent sales
figures and is generally regarded as an essential reference in
the field of facilities for sport.

b)  All our bibliographies and references constantly give the
name of this book and it is available of course at the RIBA.

c)  Any desk study of relevant information would surely have
turned up this book. Any consultation with the Information
Centre at the Sports Council in London or its regional offices
would have produced the same r e s u l t .

d)  It is not correct to say that the Chairman of the Committee
on the Appraisal of Sports Grounds of the Institution of
Structural Engineers was not aware of this book. It is in fact
referred to in the draft of the publication by the ISE and

                             -2-



and indeed diagrams have been reproduced from this book in the
draft. I have been discussing w ith the ISE the permission to
reproduce such material.

I look forward to hearing from you. If you need to know more
about the seminar pro g r a m I will be happy to advise you.

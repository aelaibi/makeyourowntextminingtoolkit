Dear Mr Turney

HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY
I am writing to acknowledge your letter of 4 August providing a
copy of the Interim Inquiry Report with the accompanying circular
and press releases.

Quite clearly, consultation could not be arranged in advance on
this occasion and I am less than certain how productive it would
have been in any event.

I was, however, interested in the Home Office press release where
it irefers to supervision of safety certificates and in
particular, a new authority with powers to supervise the way in
which local authorities carry out their responsibilities for the
safety of sports grounds.

As far as I can see, there is no particular reference to this in
the report itself and I should be most grateful if you could
provide some supporting information about the nature of the tasks
of this authority and how it expects to operate.

I look forward to further information as soon as you can provide
it.

Yours sincerely




  T h ii m atter tt M n fl < M t wMh by   Mr M D Watson                     MJ

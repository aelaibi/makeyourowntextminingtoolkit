                          states:


1.   I am a Control Assistant and have been with SYMAS for 11

     months.    I have always been based at Fairfield as a Control
     Assistant.

2.   On the Thursday and Friday I was at work from 0900 to 1730.
     Saturday was my day off.

3.   I was driving home from town when I heard on the radio that

     something was happening at Hillsborough but I d i d n 11 know

     what.     I got home at about 1515.     Control called me at

     about 1530. and                asked me to come to Control as
     there had been a major incident.      I arrived at Control at

     about 1600.    There wasn't anyone there to designate where I
     was to go so I just found a vacant phone and started taking

     calls.    There were about 12 people in Control room by this
     time and others in the Major Incident room.

4.   I was mainly handling calls from the press and emergency

     calls to do with the Hillsborough incident.     We would take

     calls, fill out a ticket which had the location explanation,

     name of patient, name of caller, telephone number and time

     that the call was received.    I would then pass the ticket to

     the Control Officer and he would allocate it to a crew.
5.   I worked until 2110 when everything seemed to be calming

     down.    Up to then I worked solidly except for making a drink

     for everyone at around 2015.        There were mostly calls

     coming in from the press and we had to open a switchboard to

     deal with them.    I made no statement to them but simply put
     them through the Public Relations Officer.
     opened the switchboard at about 1630.

             Our duties at the Station commenced at                      10.00 am.

             Fans started arriving on various service trains.                         In the main they

             were good humoured and friendly.

             Some had been drinking and several                    cans were   confiscated.              Many of the

             fans when asked stated they did not have tickets for the match and

             several              did not have enough money to purchase tickets had they been

S u f iw W '^carrying SO people.          All were good humoured.            The supporters were

                 i ve red to   the      pp'ijn^s J_ane^end of the ground at approx. IS. jx i i dday^

             The bus then      returned to Midland Station arriving at               approx 1.5 pm.

             Few fans were arriving at this time.

             At approx 2.20 pm.         I accompanied a bus to Hillsborough arriving at

             about 2.45 p m .     This bus was only half full.             I saw that a large

             crowd was waiting to enter the ground in Leppings L ane and apart

             from the lateness       I could see no apparent trouble.

             I went via Vere Road and entered the groui^df at Penistone Road North

             entranee and reported to Insp. SewEll § £ the gym na siu m.                  I was

             instructed to gather my serial togeNfner and then to stand by.

             I left the gymnasium and instructed those officers                    in my serial who

             were   present    to wait for me near              to the track at thecorner of the

             Spion Hop and North Stand whilst I gathered the rest                     of the men who

             were accompanying other buses.

    iVv^     Whilst here, at about 3.10 pm I saw a Police Officer                    run onto the
S A
   i\\       pitch and speak to the re feree.              At this I instructed what men I had

             to go to the Leppings Lane end where                 it was obvious there was some

             problem.
  m
             On arrival    I deployed to the North Stand side jsf jthe terrace near lo.

         ^ the access gate.     I could see that people ^Tre 1/rying to --------------
                                                                        get through

             this gate onto the pitch.             Many appeartrff to b^^jpgurec and distraught

             and with other people I tried to attend to any person I could assist.

             At this time I had no idea there were any dead and I was concentrating

             on helping the injured people around me.

             3! slowly made my way towards the goal and it was only at this stage

             that I realised the situation was far more serious than it appeared.

             I continued to generally assist where                 possible and spent some time

             making sure that any person in need of assistance was getting                        it.

At some time I was instructed with/ot              r Officers to form a cordon

across the pitch at the half way 1i

During this time many fans were wandering a b o u t . Some were being

helped many were helping / h e r e they could.           Some were crying,        some

screaming.      I saw several,     obviously drunk,      shouting recriminations

and accusations at various people,            other fans, Police, St Johns and

ste war ds .

I remember looking at a clock at this time.               It was 4.5 pm.

At about 4.30 pm.      I was instructed to go to Penistone Road North w i t h

my serial.

On arrival     I pointed out to an inspector that many fans were making

there way to Wads 1ey Bridge to join there transport and were

unaccompanied.       I was then instructed to take my s e r i a / to Wads ley

B ridge and supervise these fans.

On arrival at Wads 1ey Bridge           we were at this time/the jB'fi1o 1 i ce

present at this 1ocation and            we engaged in th^/s u v i s i A n   of ljaa-dTng

buses.    We were later joined          by other Off LiferC^nd eventually         returned

to the Midland Sta tio n on one of the b u s e s .

I later was     informed that some of th* Officers from my Serial                 had been

allocated duties regarding the identification and disposal of bodies

they had accompanied f r o m ' \ ^ j / o u n d .

I retired from duty at 7.0 pm.

Dear Geraint John,


     In   Italy the legislation is from       Government and it
establishes   a minimun area for standing       and for seating
spectators as 0.48 m. x 0.60 m . , and so the maximun density of
3.5 spectators mq.

     I look forward to seeing you during the Seminar in London.

     I have no new information about Seminar in Rome.

    Yours sincerely.                                                                          >

 ful examples of stadia redevelopment in the UK and world wide.

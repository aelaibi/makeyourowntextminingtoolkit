Dear Sir
                roS4-3
Councillor John C Wright,                           Boston
              was present at the fixture between Liverpool
FC and Nottingham Forest FC last Saturday.  He was a witness
to the tragic circumstances.

Councillor Wright has made a press statement to the local
paper in Boston as follows

    "I deplore the fact that the press and TV are blaming
     the Police for the people that died at that match.

     The fault in my opinion lay in the fact that 2000
     fans without tickets, climbing the fencing and walls
     and blocking turnstiles, knowing that in the past that
     to relieve pressure the Police have opened the gates.
     The fans used this to gain entry without tickets at all
     ticket matches."

Councillor Wright has advised me the officers of the South
Yorkshire Police had a difficult job trying to control a
crowd of people determined to do what they wished and
ignoring all Police advice and supervision.  He concludes
the Police were magnificent.

Councillor Wright is prepared to be interviewed by your
officers if you so wish.

Yours faithfully

I,    STUART           ROWLAND THORPE of
                   WILL SAY as FOLLOWS:


I    was         born or                               I am employed as          a      fork lift
truck        driver          by                                             I have          been     a
steward           for 22 years at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club                                and
for        the    last           15 years have been Chief Steward                for     the West
Stand.


I     am        in overall         charge of the stewards and gate           men        at         the
West       Stand.                Mr Albert    Marsh is the Assistant Chief             Steward
and        is normally responsible for the gate men at B and C                                   gates
and        the      stewards          who are positioned at        the      bottom          of     the
stairs leading to                    the West Stand seated area.            In    the        seated
area        there are six gangways known by the letters U, V, W, X, Y
and        Z.There is a steward                    for each gangway.       Normally,             there
are        26     staff           in total in attendance at the West              Stand          area
excluding              the         turnstile         operators   for whom I            am          not
responsible.                This arrangement has remained for about the                           last
three y e a r s .


It     is normal for stewards and gate men to turn up at least two
hours           before a         match, but for an important match it                   may         be
necessary to attend four hours before the kick-off.


I     am responsible for paying                      the stewards and gatemen. When the
stewards           and gatemen arrive                they hand over their passes and                 I
also        take a ticket from their booklet.                    I keep the jackets                 in
a     cupboard              in    the snack bar at the rear of             the    West           Stand
seated           area.           Before      the     end of a match       the stewards             and
gatemen           hand back their jackets and I provide them with                                their
passes           and        their     payment for the match.          I    have a        radio to
enable           me to           keep in contact with Doug Lock, the Club                         Security
Officer.               If         there      is any crowd trouble or injuries                     inthe
crowd           I would radio Doug Lock to inform him of the                           situation.
                                                  -    2   -




I     would        also         obtain     the assistance of              the   nearest       Police
Officer.              If       there     are insufficient numbers of                stewards,            I
would also contact Doug Lock by radio.


For     FA Cup matches, stewards and gatemen roust be in attendance
at least four hours before the kick-off.


Before        the commencement of each season, the stewards and                                    gate
men     attend             a    meeting at      Hillsborough.              Registration          takes
place        when          the stewards and gatemen are provided with                           passes
containing                 their photographs.           Briefing also takes place                  with
regard        to           evacuation      procedures, ticket              systems,       and       each
steward               or       gateman    is    issued         with   a    document       known         as
"Instructions                   for    Match Day Staff". Representatives from                          the
Fire        Brigade             and    Police    are present to            take    part       in       the
briefing.


The     evacuation                procedures      are          important    particularly           with
regard           to        any fire and we are informed as to the                      code        which
will        be        broadcasted         over the public             address     system.           This
briefing              has only occurred in recent seasons and no                          doubt          is
as a result of the Bradford fire disaster.


We     are told what to do in the event of an evacuation and                                           also
where        the           fire extinguishers are kept in the                     Ground.          I     do
brief        the stewards under my control on a regular basis                                   as       to
the     positions of the fire extinguishers in the West Stand.                                            I
do     not        do this for every match, but it is done on                            a     regular
basis        and certainly before any big match.


The task of the stewards is to direct spectators to their seats
and         to assist them where possible together with complying with
the         evacuation            procedure.          The gatemen are           responsible             for
ensuring              that       the gates are manned at all times to allow                             the
Police           and        other officials access to the ground, to open                               the
    gates     in       the       event of an emergency, and to                  open    the        gates
    shortly before the end of a match.
                                                     -   3   -




Both         the        gatemen        and       stewards         are   not    responsible              for
controlling                 crowds     inside the ground or for dealing with                            any
problems           of        crowd violence or misbehaviour.                    The       Police        are
responsible for such matters.


On     match days either Albert or myself picks up the                                     keys        from
the     main           office        area       to check whether B            and     C    gates        are
unlocked.               N ormally we find that the gates are unlocked.                                  The
caretaker              is                        and he goes round in the                 morning        to
unlock the gates to the ground. I normally take up position                                              to
the right hand side of the seated area near the fire escape                                              if
of     course I am not walking around the West                                Stand       supervising
and dealing with any problems that may arise.


Before           the        match    is over, I am responsible                  for       paying        the
stewards           and once the match is over I am also responsible                                     for
ensuring           that the West Stand is clear of any                         supporters. About
ten     minutes before the end of the match the gates are                                        opened.
It     is not normal to keep the away fans behind for a period                                           of
time        as     often happens at many other grounds.                             The West Stand
has     for        the last few years been used only for away                               fans        and
the     access              ways     leading to the West Stand area do                      not        lead
directly           to        other     access      ways serving other               parts        of     the
ground.


I now turn to my involvement in the events which took place                                              on
15th        April 1989 at Hillsborough.                          I left work at about 10                am,
having           worked        since        6   am doing overtime. I             walked          to     the
ground           which took about 20 minutes.                       I picked up my radio                and
made        my     way        to the West Stand.                 I was told at      the     previous
match        by Doug Lock that ten temporary stewards were                                  reporting
to     me for the FA Cup semi-final.                             He also told me that all the
stewards           had to arrive for the semi-final by                         11 am and I told
my stewards this at the previous match.


I     was        told by the Chief Steward in the North Stand                               by        radio
                                                   -   4   -




that    two Liverpool stewards were arriving and that 7 or 8 more
would    be        coming.          The two stewards are known                 as         the
                and       attended the ground for the semi-final held                                  the
previous       year.           It     is    also common practice               for        the
                to       travel       with the Liverpool           supporters              attending
awaymatches,               and      they     were obviously         well       known            to     the
Liverpool          supporters.             During the 1988 semi final, the
                   had     stewarded         the       terrace    with     about           6         other
Liverpool stewards.


My     intention was to do the same this year.                           The
duly turned up and we chatted together for about 10 minutes.                                             I
know    them         both quite well and we are on very friendly                                 terms.
After about 10 minutes another 7 or 8 Liverpool stewards joined
us.     At that time I was standing with the                                     at the bottom
of     the steps nearest to C gate.                        These stewards asked if                    they
could     also steward the stand, but I explained that my stewards
had     already been allocated to the stewarding of the stand, and
that     they        (the Liverpool stewards) were needed to look                                    after
the     terraces          as     before.         I realised that all            the        Liverpool
stewards        would have prefered to work the stands, but I am sure
that they accepted the position and realised why I would not be
prepared to send my stewards onto the terraces.


I     arranged        for       six    of the temporary            stewards          to        take     up
position        with an experienced steward from each of the gangways
to     the     seated area.                The                          told me that a                 lot
of     fans were coming from Liverpool without tickets.                                    They also
said     that they thought there was going to be a lot of trouble.
At     the     previous year's semi-final held at                        Hillsborough,                 the
Grand        National          was held the same day              and a large             number        of
Liverpool            supporters            had    attended       that    event.           The        Grand
National was not held on the same day this year.


As     the     stewards and gate men arrived, I issued the                                 steward's
jackets.           At about 11.30 am, a police inspector, whom I know by
sight        but     do     not       know by name, asked           me    to     assemble              the
                                                -   5   -




stewards           from       the   seated area.            I do know that         this        police
inspector           is     nicknamed        Captain         Birdseye owing         to       his     big
beard.           He took the names of the two stewards who would be                                     on
the     fire        escapes. He told the stewards that if there was                                 any
trouble          they must fetch a police officer; they were not to get
involved.            He also explained that there was a different colour
ticket        to     the       seats     compared to          the     standing         area.        The
inspector showed them the two types of ticket.


I     did     mention          to the police inspector that at                    the       previous
year's        semi-final a number of police officers had stood in the
gangways           which prevented the stewards from carrying out                                  their
duties        ie.        to    keep the gangways clear.                   He    confirmed           that
police        officers would not be standing in the gangways.                                  I     did
ask     the                              to stay with me on the stand because                            I
and     my own stewards had already experienced problems and                                        alot
of     abuse from the Liverpool supporters going into this                                     stand.
Until       t h e s t a r t e d                             to help us the Liverpool fans
had     refused           to    let us follow our usual practice                       of    tearing
corners          off      the tickets as they enter the stands (to                           prevent
the practice of tickets being thrown down to fans bel o w) .                                        Once
t h e I w e r e                standing with us, we had no further problems in
persuading             the fans from allowing us to tear the corners                                off.
This all took place at about 2.15 pm.


At     about        2.40 pm Malcolm Bain, one of the gatemen to C                                  gate,
told        me     that more Liverpool stewards were trying to come                                     in,
but      he      had       stopped them.       I said that was fair enough                         as     I
suspected           they        simply    wanted to get in to                  watch    the        game.
Apart         from       the                            \ I never         saw     any       Liverpool
stewards again after about 2.40 pm.


Everthing           went smoothly until about 2.30 pm.                          From my position
 at     the rear of the seated area at that time I was able to look
 down       upon         the turnstiles behind the West Stand.                         I could          see
 the     build up of supporters outside.                           I went to the stewards by
 the     two        sets       of   steps    leading          to    the    seated        area.          One
                                                      -   6    -




complained                 that there were no police nearby.                       I asked a senior
officer,           I        do       not know who, to arrange for police to                              be     in
attendance                 by       these    steps.       He       arranged       for        four        police
officers           to           be positioned at the bottom of each door                             leading
to     the stairs.                  At about 2.45 pm I noticed supporters climbing
over     the turnstiles.                     I saw the officers at the bottom of                               the
right        hand steps (ie those nearest C gate) going over to                                               stop
the     supporters,                   and they then proceeded to eject a number                                 of
them through C Gate.


At     2.50        pm           C    Gate   was opened and              there     was        a     surge        of
supporters              who          gained entry through the gate.                     I        shouted        to
the     stewards at the bottom of the right hand steps to shut the
Gates        to those steps and to only let in those who showed                                               seat
tickets.               I        could see that the stewards were suffering a                                   lot
of     verbal              abuse       in    the seated area.             I     went        over     to        the
stewards           in the seated area including my two sons who were                                            in
V and W gangways.


I     then     went to the bottom of the right hand steps. It was                                               at
that     point              that       C    Gate was opened again                and     there           was     a
massive; influx                      of supporters.           I do not believe              that         anyone
could        have stopped them.                  I said to the stewards                      at both sets
of     steps           that          they must ensure the gates to the                           steps     were
kept        shut.               I had asked for these gates to be                       provided              some
five     to six years ago as I explained at that time the                                            problem
of     those with tickets for the standing area attempting to gain
access        to           the seated area.           The police agreed with                       the        idea
and the Club very soon afterwards installed the gates.


The     police              at the turnstiles were knocked to one side. I                                      did
not     hear           any request or order for the gate to be opened,                                         nor
did     I     see           who       opened    the gate.           I   went      upstairs           to        the
stewards to make sure that they were allright.


One     police officer told me that I should tell the stewards                                                  to
discard        their jackets as otherwise the stewards could expect a
                                              -    7   -




lot     of     abuse. The swearing was much worse than usual and                         the
police        officers were being subjected to a great deal of abuse.
There        were    two to three officers for each turnstile                     for    the
terraced            area     and    I remember there       were about      20    police
officers            in     total in position behind these turnstiles.                   This
is quite normal for a big match.


I     went     off to tell the stewards in the seated area to                         remove
their        jackets.       This was at about kick-off time.               I told       them
to     roll     up the jackets and put them in their pockets.                         Albert
Marsh        went    off to tell some of the stewards and                  gatemen       the
same.


I     remember       going back to the bottom of the right hand                       steps.
Albert        Marsh was present.         Two of the stewards said they                  were
going        to go onto the pitch as there was a lot of trouble.                          At
this stage none of us really knew what was happening.


After the game was stopped, my son came over to me and                             brought
along a Liverpool supporter.                      The Liverpool supporter said that
his brother was on the               pitch.        He was crying.    I took him         down
to     thepitch and noticed the chaos.                     There    were       police     and
supporters           on     the pitch.    Some of my stewards went down                 onto
the pitch to try and help.


I     went     back to C Gate and noticed people                   being   brought        out
through        the        central   tunnel either injured            or    on    ambulance
stretchers.              Liverpool supporters were shouting and swearing as
they     made        their     way out through this tunnel.                I    went     back
upstairs to the seated area.


There        were        about seven or eight youths, about 18 -                 20     years
old,     pilfering the snack bar.                   The girls in the snack bar were
involved         in taking water onto the pitch.               I told those            youths
to     clear        off.     However, they carried on and in the end I                    had
to      fetch       a police officer.             They then disappeared.         When     the
officer         went,       they came back and told me they were                 going     to
                                                 -    8    -




"get    me".            I ran down the stairs and told the                    police         officer
what had happened.


The     stewards then came down from the seated area as they                                       were
very         frightened.             Some   of       the        supporters    had      taken        the
stewards'           jackets          from my cupboard in the snack bar                   which        I
discovered              later.       I went back up the stairs, but noticed that
the     gang of youths had gone.                     It was hard to see from the back
of     the        stand       what    was happening below.               There        were        still
supporters              in    the     seated area.             Many were drunk.         This        was
easy     to see as some were walking on seats and falling.off.                                        I
have never seen such drunkenness or bad behaviour before.


I     have        attended 13 semi-finals and this is the worst                              I     have
seen for people being drunk.


I     took my radio back to the club control room as I was advised
to     do so by a police officer.                     The radio meant that I could be
easily        identified as being an official of Sheffield                              Wednesday
Football Club.


When     I        was        at the bottom of the right hand                  steps     and        just
before        I     took the radio back, Doug Lock had spoken to                              me     by
radio        to     check that the stewards and gatemen                       were      allright.
On     returning              from the club control room,I went back                         to     the
seated        area           which was more or less empty              by then.          However,
pilfering           was still taking place although by a different group
of people.


I     went        back downstairs.          I told my younger son to go home                         so
that     he        could        tell my wife that we were allright.                      By        this
stage        someone           had    heard on the radio that                there     were        five
reported           dead.         I    sent my other son home shortly                   later.         I
also     arranged              for the temporary stewards to go                  home.           About
4.50     pm I went down to the pitch to see if I could do anything
to help.

It    was         still chaotic.        By this stage about              one-third            of    my
stewards          had      gone home.     I felt helpless and was                     stunned       by
what was happening around me.


The     police shortly later started to leave the ground through B
Gate.         I     asked a police officer if it was allright for me                                 to
go     home.        He told me that there was nothing that could be done
and     the       West      Stand    was empty.            I   told    all      the     remaining
stewards they could go home.


I     must        mention that at about 3.05 pm I realised                         that       people
were     starting to climb over the fences, but I did not                                  realise
how     serious the situation was.                     It has never          happened         before
that such numbers have entered through C Gate.


At     last        years       semi final, I saw Police on                the      terraces.           I
cannot        remember         how   many.        They were           underneath        the        West
stand.        I     noticed      these Police Officers as I leant                       over        the
front        of     the     seated    area.       These Police           Officers         were       in
position           well     before    kick off and indeed               were       in     position
shortly           after     the turnstiles opened at mid day.                      I     also       saw
three        or     four Police Officers at the entrance to the                            tunnel.
There        were       also     Police Officers checking fans as                       they       came
through           the     turnstiles. All the pens were open for                         the       1988
semi final.


I     witnessed the Police Officers at the entrance to the                                     tunnel
stopping           fans     from gaining access to the centre pens.                             This
occurred           at     about 2.50 pm.          The Police shut the doors to                      the
tunnel,           the     Police were then directing the fans to                         the       wing
pens     or        the South West and North West pens.                       The       doors       were
kept         closed for about 10 minutes.                      I saw the doors closed and
opened by Police.


The     Police were not letting any fans down the tunnel even when
the     doors were opened again.                   The Police at the doors went                      to
the end of the tunnel to join the rest of the officers who were
                                                -    10    -




deployed           on the terrace side of the tunnel.                  I could see           this
as     I was chatting to the gatemen on C gate.                        I also saw Police
turning       back fans who tried to go down the tunnel.                         The Police
only allowed fans back in who had been to the toilets.


I    then went on my rounds to check that all the other                               stewards
were     alright.               I did not go back again to see if               the     Police
Officers I have described were still in position.                             There were a
number        of        Police Officers by the snack bar to the South                        West
corner.            There        was no barrier to prevent access to the                     South
West     corner.            Nor     were     there        Police on   the     gate     to     the
partition          wall         which was open, but I did deploy a steward                     on
that     gate. At last years semi final there were the same number
of stewards as this years semi final.


It     is important to note that the Police accept                          responsibility
for     the        terraces.        I have never deployed Sheffield                  Wednesday
stewards           on     the     terraces     as I could not expect            any     of     my
stewards           tr     run the risk of injury or the threat                  of      injury
and     the        Police have made it clear that they                  are     responsible
for     the terraces.              The Police system I have described for last
years     semi           final     is    also similar to that          used     for     league
matches.            However, I have never seen Police Officers shut                           the
doors     to the tunnel.                I know that I have seen Police                Officers
at     league matches in positions at the entrance and to the rear
of     the tunnel, as I have often chatted to them on occasion                                 by
walking through the tunnel.


The     system is different in the sense that the Police                              normally
seal     off the South West pen by putting metal barriers in place
near     the        snack bar.          A number of Police Officers, about 4                   in
number,        are put in position around the barriers.                        The gate        to
the     partition           wall is kept shut, and Police Officers are                        put
behind it.              The fans are then channeled into the centre pens.


The     ground Police Inspector then tells me when he is about                                 to
remove        the        barrier        to the South West pen so as to               warn     the
                                               -   11   -




stewards        in case of any rush by fans for the steps leading                                up
to     the seated area.             The Police on the entrance to the                      tunnel
and     the     gate     to the partition wall then direct fans                          to     the
South     West        pen.      Occasionally at big league games                    the South
West     pen     fills up.          On those occasions, the ground                      Inspector
would     then        tell me that he was about to open the                        North       West
pen.


Very     often fans would come up to me to say they could not                                   see
from     the        South    West pen.        I would then speak to                the     ground
Inspector           to request that he open the North West pen. He                            would
listen        but he did not always open the gate immediately.                                 Very
often     he decided to wait to see if more fans were coming                                   into
that area of the ground.


This     ground        Inspector         is   the same          Police     Officer        I    have
described with a beard.                  Normally he was positioned in the area
behind        the     turnstiles.         He has been the ground Inspector                       for
the Leppings Lane area for the last 3 seasons.


Because         of this practice I have always accepted the Police had
responsibility              for ensuring the pens were not over crowded.                              I
should        mention        that    when the fans were             channeled           into     the
centre pens           and then perhaps to the South West pen, and                              then
onto      the       North     West pen if large numbers                  attended,        it     was
normal        for     only      the staircase nearest to B gate to                       be     left
open.         The     away      fans who had seat tickets                 could     then        gain
access        through turnstiles 11-16 and those standing could                                 gain
access        through        turnstiles A-G.            However, the other              staircase
was     never         locked.       It    was kept shut            and     6     stewards       were
allocated            to the bottom of the staircase.                     It was necessary to
man the staircase in the event of                           any emergency.


 I did ask the ground Inspector to                          open the South West and North
West      pens        depending upon the situation at a number of                             league
 games.         He     would      often reply to the effect that it                      was     his
 responsibility              to     make      such      decisions,         and     it    was      my

      responsibility to look after the seated area.


      This       is the third season the West stand including the                             terrace
      has       been allocated for away fans only.                       Before that, it was of
      course allocated between home and away fans.                           Again, the Police
       adopted        a    similar system of channeling fans into                     the      centre
      pens,       and      when full to direct fans into the South West                        pens.
       Prior to the West stand being allocated for away fans, the away
       fans      gained      access      to     the centre pens and               South     West    pen
       together with             about   one       third of        the    seated     area     through
       turnstiles          A-G.     Turnstiles 11-16 were for home fans..taking up
       the      remainder of the West stand.                      That system was in operation
       for      something like 3 or 4 seasons and the only material change
       was      the       erection of the partition wall.                  This     prevented        any
       mixing of home and away fans behind the West stand.


       Prior      to these developments and the introduction of the                                pens,
       the      West stand was an area for home and away fans where                                there
      .4 * 0   attempts made to segregate fans.                      However, since 1966 the**-*
        has     never been         to    my knowledge             stewards   deployed         on     the
        terraces.          The    Police       have always deployed Officers                  on     the
        terraces          and on the front and rear of the tunnel.                        The numbers
        have of course varied.


        I      must emphasise that whatever the police request me to do,                               I
        do.       I   remember on 15th April that there were a                        lot     of     new
        officers as normally the same faces can be recognised.                                On this
        occasion I did not recognise many of the officers.

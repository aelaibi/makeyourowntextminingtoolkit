                     LIVERPOOL                               25th April,   1989


                     Dear

                     Detailed below, for your information is a statement
                     from            who is known to the Probation Service,
                     who was at Hillborough on Saturday, 15th April, 1989;


                     "My account  of the events of Hillsborough on Saturday
                     15th April, 1989"..........


                     "At 11.15 a.m. I boarded the coach at Picton Clock Tower,
                     Wavertree, with                 The Journey was rather
                     boring becasue or tailbacks and traffic jams on the M6.
                     As we aproached Sheffield we were stopped about 2 miles
                     away from the ground by Police.   The Police boarded the coach
                     and quickly searched for any drink on the coach.   The coach then
                     carried on towards the ground.

                     At about 2.15 p.m., the coach parked about g mile away
                     from the ground.        Myself and       walked quickly towards
                     the ground.        As I remember, there was a lot of latecomers
                     behind us.        After a while we reached the ground and
                     left me becasue he had a stand ticket.        As I lo ok e d ------
                     towards the Leppings Lane Turnstiles, there was about
                     one - two thousand people queuing there, so I joined
                     them.        As I looked around in the disorganised queue,
                     I noticed only about 4 policemen (one of them mounted
                     on a horse) controlling the crowd.        The crown was getting
                     very impatient as the time was about 2.35 p.m.         Eventually,
                     I managed to force my way in through a turnstile, where the
                     steward took my ticket and then returned the stub.
                     I then slowly walked the tunnel leading towards         the terrace.
                     When I actually got on to the terrace the time was about
                     2.40 p-iin. The terrace was capacity then, so I positioned
                     myself to the left of the goal in front of the bar, so I
                     w o u l d n ’t get crushed.  The crush got worse and I was pushed
                     and I banged my right knee on the bar.        Then at about 2.50 p.m.
                     people started to panic near the front.



                                                                                   cont/.

The game was kicked off, as soon as it was, people
started to climb over the railings at the front.   The
crush now was extremely bad.  Then I heard from someone
that the gates outside had been opened.  A fan who was already
on the pitch then ran on and tugged Steve Nicol and pointed
behind the goal.  The referee then stopped the gam as policemen
and women tried to ease the crush.  Then I seen what appeared
to be someone dead or very badly injured being passed over
the railings.  But there was panic everywhere so I stayed
where I was for about 5 mins until it was calmer.   I then
ran to the left of the goal and helped rip down the fence.

As I got out of the fence on to the pitch, I looked around
and to my horror, I seen dead, dying and injured people
everywhere.    People crying and panicking as the police
did e-veiything they could behind the goal.

Then I offered my hand in help behind the goal, but was
told bluntly by a Police officer to "Go away son, leave this
to us".  Go and help the injured"         I then angered by his
reply, tore down advertising boards with other fans
to use as stretchers I then walked around the ground
dazed and after no more could be done, walked towards
the coaches and phoned home from a shop opposite our coach.
I then boarded the coach and founq             Then after
a quick count, in which only 2 was missing, we returned
home shocked and numb with d a z e .........."

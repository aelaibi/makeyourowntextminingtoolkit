 Dear Telfer


 HILLSBOROUGH: HOME OFFICE EVIDENCE TO TAYLOR INQUIRY

 In David Mould's absence on annual leave I enclose a copy of the HO
 draft evidence to be put before the Taylor Inquiry.  Our evidence on
 policing/hooliganism which has been drawn up separately is attached
 for your information.

 Our time scale for submission of the evidence is very short.  If you
 or copy recipients have any comments on the factual content would
 you please let me know as soon as possible and in any event no later
 than 4.00 pm on Friday 2 June.


                                       Yours sincerely




                                       ALAN BROWN

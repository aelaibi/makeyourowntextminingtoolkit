HILLSBOROUGH : fOLLOW-UP ACTION - LORD CAMPBELL OF CRAY

You reminded us recently that Lord Ferrers was anxious that the
point raised by Lord Campbell of Cray in the Lords debate on
17 April should be looked into. My understanding is that he does
not propose to write to Lord Campbell.

2.   Lord Campbell's point was whether all appropriate action had
been taken on the recommendations of the Wheatley Inquiry set up
after the Ibrox Park accident in 1971. The short answer is that
action has been taken.

3.   Lord Wheatley recommended a system of safety licensing for
sports grounds. The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 reflected
closely the Inquiry's recommendations. The system of designation
under the 1975 Act requiring safety certificates has been
extended to those categories of sports grounds recommended by
Wheatley with the exception of sports grounds which can
accommodate less than 10,000 spectators but which have
"structural accommodation such as stands for spectators".
However, stands able to accommodate at least 500 spectators under
cover are subject to safety certification under Part III of the
Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 which came
into effect as from 1 January 1989.

4.   The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds is founded largely on
the Technical Support Group of the Wheatley Inquiry and forms the
non-statutory guidelines towards safety standards.

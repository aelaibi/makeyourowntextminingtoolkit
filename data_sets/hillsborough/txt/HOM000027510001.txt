NOTE OF DISCUSSION WITH MR PENDRY AT 11.40am ON 20 NOVEMBER



Mr Pendry said that the All Party Football Committee were annoyed
that Mr Carlisle had embroiled Lord Justice Taylor in controversy
about the Football Spectators Bill.   The Committee considered
that the meeting had been private, and had therefore declined the
requests they had received from the press to talk about it.  In
                               w u W.
meeting Lord Justice Taylor s vtew to have as broad a range of
opinion presented as possible, Mr Hughes and Mr Carlisle had been
brought in, and the officers of the Committee were themselves
annoyed that only those two members had been quoted.    Mr Pendry
thought that the meeting had been even handed, that Lord Justice
Taylor had asked penetrating questions, but that he had given no
indication of the views he would form about the Bill.    Officers
of the Committee had been entirely happy with the way it had been
conducted.   Mr Pendry said that he would be putting out a
statement to that effect in the course of the day.     I said that
on the part of the Inquiry there would be no objection to that.

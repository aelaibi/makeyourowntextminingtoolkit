  1 ,-                   »   of                   Liverpool      dob
 will say as follows:

         On    15th April,
                     1989, I went to Hillsboro Stadium in Sheffield                      ;'
                   T.o
 for the FA Cup^final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest

 which was due to start at 3 pm that day.

         I had a ticket.      I still have the stub at home.

         I arrived from Sheffield by minibus at about 12.30 p.m.           I had

 gone up in the bus with 10 other friends.

         I did not drink any alcohol in the minibus on the way up.

         The rest of my friends went to a pub near the ground.           I went to

 see a friend of mine in Sheffield, his name is |                          1.    i Cant

 recall his address at the moment.            I met him in another pub.         I cant

remember the' name of the pub.            I had one pint of shandy in the pup.

 I normally drink beer but I was very thirsty,             it was quite a warm

afternoon.          I had arrived at the pub at 1.30 and I left at about

10 past 2.          I got to the ground at about 2.20 with my friend

                my friend                and his brother          was there also.
              lives at                 , Seaforth and         lives at
              Bootle.

     I was making for the Leppings Lane end of the ground.               We all had

tickets and when we got there it was very busy outside the ground

    There was a big crowd there.           It took me until about 2. S8 or
                                                                            (t TS)
to reach the turnstiles.          It was very crowded outside the turnstiles.

    Everyone seemed to be fighting to get in.             You certainly couldn't

get out if you wanted to.          I    was frightened.    I had been in crushes

like this outside the Anfield ground in Liverpool but things were

always a bit more organised and it tended to be in a queue

    It was certainly reasonable in my opinion that something should
have been done so as to relieve the congestion.     I think perhaps the

kick off could have been delayed.
   Eventually I managed to get through the turnstile.       I gave the valid
                                                                     /




part of the ticket in and kept the stub.    Once through I was tht>n

separated from my mates who were still outside somewhere in the

crush.
   I was then in an open yard between the turnstile and the bac k of

the stand itself.
   A shutter gate was to my right and over to my left was the stand

with the tunnel beneath leading to the centre of the Leppings Lane

terraces.    I diant go in right away because I was looking for my

mate.    Suddenly I looked back towards the shutter gate and I saw that

it was open.     Prior to this it was shut when I emerged from the

turnstile.     I saw that people were rushing through and made for the

tunnel to the centre of the terraces.     There was certainly no cordon

across-the front of the tunnel.
   I just watched and then I saw the gates being pulled across,          perhaps

not shut completely.     I am not really sure.   It stopped the people

coming through.     I think either, a policeman or a steward closed the

gates,   I couldnt really see for all the people that were coming

through.     I just saw the tops of the gates closing.     I then spoke            j


to one of the stewards who was near to the gate.        He had fair hair           j
and a moustache.     He was aged about 23 and had a slim to medium build,          j
He was about 5' 8" tall.     I said to him that the other end of the ground!

should have been given to the Liverpool supporters because there was               ,

a larger capacity crowd.     It was my understanding,    and I told him this,|

 that there would be more Liverpool supporters at the match than                   J

Nottingham Forest supporters.     I understand that on average Nottingham          j
 Forest home gates are about 19,000 whereas Liverpool home gates are               j
 about 38,000.    The steward agreed with me and said that Sheffield               j
Wednesday Football Club had said this themselves to the Police but

in organising the game,                    the Police would not agree to this.

     I was still looking for my mates in the area between the turnstiles

and the stand.             The next thing I knew the blue                               shutter gates were 6pen

again.          This    time they were wide open and thousands of                                 people,   it

seemed like,            came through and all made for the tunnel. The tunnel

was directly            opposite the shutter gates.

      Iwas carried by the crowd into the ^ u n n e l ^                                  I suppose I could have

stopped but Ithought that the g a t e * * * b^en forced open by the fans

and I thought that if I waited in the area near to the gate,                                          I might

„et arrested b'f'thTpSTiJe for breaking in—                                        4 so I went on m      to the

                                                                      o C  & ^> ____

the crowd.
      When I got to the end of the tunnel,                                  I noticed that the end of a

barrier stopped in the middle of the end of the tunnel.                                            It ran from

 the end Q f the tunnel down the terraces right down to the pitch.                                            There

were also two small barriers on this main barrier which were at right

 angles to this barrier,                     almost at the top directly opposite the mouth

 of the tunnel into the terraces.                                   I was crushed against one of these

 barriers,          the one to the left of the central barrier.                                  People were

 pressing in behind me.                       I just couldnt move.                      I thought I was going

 to die.           Certainly I was trapped.                          Eventually after I think about 8

 minutes,          I got out and managed to squeeze under the barrier.                                   I managed

 to move down the terraces diagonally to my left.                                           I was climbing

 around people.               I could see that some people were dead on the terraces

 but still crushed up against the barrier.                                        I coula see and hear people

  saying theLord's prayer                          all over the place.                   Eventually I got to a

  narrow gate           at the front and I was pulled out by a steward and a

  policeman.            I moved away from the small gate o^n to t h e j ^ c h ^ d                                I
                     , lD                        the dead and injured. 4 The^ tried to pull down
  saw fans trying to neip
 advertising boards as makeshift stretchers.        I recall that this was

 about 3.30 pm.     Then I saw the Police trying to stop people pulling

 the advertising boards down, it was quite ridiculous.         I saw no ,fans

 attacking other policemen or people as has been suggested in the

 press.     I saw a few arguments on the pitch between rival fans.      This

 was nothing serious.     I think the Nottingham Forest fans thought that'

 the Liverpool fans had invaded the pitch and it was some time before

 the rival fans realised what had happened,        I think that these arguments

 arose in ignorance of the facts.

      I found the whole thing very distressing.

      I came home and I went     to Walton Hospital the next day and received

treatment for bruised ribs and a sprained ankle.         I suffered night­

mares for about a week and severe depression ever since.          I didnt know

what to do about myself and I spent the first week going to Anfield
               >



football ground each day.          I couldnt even talk to one of the social

workers'■who called to see       me about what Ihad seen.   I found it impos­

sible to shrug it off.

      I am presently unemployed.     I am married with one daughter aged

3\.     My wife does not work.

      I would like my statement to be submitted to the Government Public

Enquiry so as to assist in the investigation of the circumstances of

this incident.

      There are two sketches attached to this statement.      The first-sketch

shows the approximate position of the turnstile, the shutter gate and

the entrance to the tunnel.        The second sketch shows the approximate

position of the first barrier against which I was trapped once I

arrived on the terraced.

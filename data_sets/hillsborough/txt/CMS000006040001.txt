Line t o takje


5,   Assuming that the point raised by Lord Harris                   of Greenwich
is   as   predicted,   Lord   Ferrers       is    recommended        to take     the

following line:


      "I have considerable sympathy for the arguments advanced by
      the noble   lord,   Lord    Harris    of    Greenwich.        Few    problems
      have arisen    in respect     of the       licenses granted         at sports
      around,    especially   for       executive       boxes.       It   may   not,
      therefore, be unreasonable for the time between licenses to
      be extended.     However, your Lordships will be aware of the
      considerable pressures both upon your Lordships'                     time and
      upon time   in another place,         and       it is most unlikely that
      the   Government    would    be   able     to    find   an   opportunity    to
       introduce the primary legislation which would be required
       in order to make a change.".

LIQUOR LICENSING WITHIN SPORTS GROUNDS

We spoke on the telephone this rooming when you advised me that
Lord Harris                of Greenwich         was     likely    to    raise          the        question       of
licensing;of executive boxes at sports grounds during the debate
on the A d d r e s s .


2.       it    is         likely        that    Lord    Harris's        concern              is     about       the
                    !

frequency with which                      licenses      need to        be    renewed.               Under       the
Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol Etc) Act 1985,                                           licenses have
to   be      rent*-.-'          every    five    months.         There       has       been         increasing
pressure Recently for this interval to be extended.                                               The Football
League ha$ been coordinating lobbying.                               The argument put forward
is broadly that there                      is an unnecessarily high administrative
burden placed on the applying organisations, and for that matter
on     the     magistrates'              courts       which    are      required              to     hear       the
a pp li c a t i o n s .


3.      This Iargument is reasonable.                         I understand from the police
that therej has been very little trouble in relation to licensing
at sports grounds,                 especially in the executive boxes.                                Although
we have thus far not invited Ministers to take a view.                                                I doubt
that      we            would    urge     them     to     oppose       a       relaxation             of        the
requirements to apply for relicensing every five months to, say,
every 12 nionths.


4.      That;would,               however,      require primary              legislation,              and we
                ;

could advance no case                     for priority         in a crowded parliamentary
timetable.               On the other hand, were an MP suitably placed in the

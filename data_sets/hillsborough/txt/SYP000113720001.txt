              On Saturday          15 A p r i 1 1989,         I was        on duty       in company wit h other

the o f f icers w i t h me were                  being a p p r o a c h e d         by L i verpool         supporters

asking      directions          to    public ho u s e s a n d off                  licences.          The m a i n public

the     city and a l o n g Wads ley Lane                   seeking              licensed premises.               It was

a p p a r e n t at this        early stage that               the m a j o r i t y of s u p p o r t e r s           had

already       been d r i n k i n g       quite      heavily.         As time           prog r e s s e d more

supporters arrived                  in the area,           the m a j o r i t y of w h i c h were walking

round w i t h       cans a n d bottles              of    beer a n d            bottles     of wine.         We were

c o n t i n u a l l y being a s k e d for d i r e c t i o n s          to         licensed       premises.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y   1.45      p.m.      I was    jo i n e d by S u p e r i n t e n dent M a r s h a l l ,

he was      the senior          officer          in charge        of the area.                 Mr.    M a r shall        wished

to see all          my o f f i c e r s     on their        respe c t i v e         points.         W i t h this      in

d i r e c t i o n of the H i l l s b o r o u g h         precinct.              After we had w a l k e d a short

distance,          a radio m e s s a g e was             received      to the effect                 that a , d w e l l i n g

urinating          in the g a r d e n and being abusive.                            A Police         vehi c l e was sent

to the      location.           Mr.      Marshall         said    that he knew the are a and that he

was    only a short            d i s t a n c e a w a y to w h e r e         the     incident was            occurring.

serving.         They numbered approximately                      five or six            persons,          although

the off      licence       itself       is of the        corner       shop type.              A lady who

a p p e a r e d to be the         owner or the          person      in charge,           e n q u i r e d about my

to persons         under    18 years          of age.       I must add that at that                        time       inside

an d outside        the    premises        I did not see a n y               person who a p p e a r e d              to be

under    18 y e a r s     of age       d r i nking    intoxicants.                 However,     some       of who m

monitoring         all    persons       they were        selling        intoxicants            to,    I left the

premises an d          rejoined Superintendent                  Marshall.             We mad e       our way back

to the j u n c t i o n of W a d s l e y Lane an d liiddlewood Road,                            at w h i c h         point

w h i c h was    quickly        resolved.         The P o l i c e O f f i c e r s       in that are a were

continually advising                suppo r t e r s     not to get           drunk,      to    leave their

drinks w i t h the         threat       that     they w o u l d     not be a l l o w e d        into the

ground.         The a m o u n t   of    cans a n d bottles            left         in the a r e a was enormous.

                 few minutes,              but got        no    response.           I can remember             the P o l i c e Officer

her giving m o u t h             to m o u t h    r e s u s c i t a t i o n to a number        of    people,

ex a m i n i n g    injuries a n d also             reass u r i n g    other s u p p o r t e r s who a p p e a r e d

to be distraught.                   I have no        idea who         this     lady was,       but she

certainly did a m a r v e l l o u s               job an d her s e r v i c e s wer e m u c h a p p r e c i a t e d

by all       those     present.



I noticed an               ambulance         pull   up at the          gate,    so    I w e n t towards         that,

at this time               the    radio      traffic was       constant.          I    s h o u t e d my    call

sign,      'India 10*,              but had noa c k n o w l e d g e m e n t ,     everyone         was    talking          at

once,      so      I waited         for a lull          and s h o u t e d up requesting a call                  for

doctors         to a t t e n d at      the      rear of the L e p p i n g s        Lane      stand.        I don't

know     if this was             r e c eived or not         because        of the      radio traffic,               I

couldn't           tell,     I just     hoped that          they had         heard my m e s s a g e and were

acting       on it.          I also         shou t e d up for air           to be brought to the                rear of

the L e p p i n g s Lane            end stand.           1 went       to the ambulance, called                  a

instructions were                   being    passed on to the amb u l a n c e drivers,                 which                in

A f t e r all      the     i n j u r e d had been         removed,          I can remember       s t a n d i n g by

the gate w h e n the                crowd s t a r t e d to leave the stand.                  I was      taking              a

br e ather and als o                at the same time              s t o p p i n g any of the crowd         coming

through        the    gate so they w o u l d n ' t             see    the     bodies.     One Liverpool

supporter           s tood    in front       of me and s t a r t e d shouting at                 the     crowd to

use the        other entrance,              he was        trying      to help and maybe            letting off

steam.         E v e n t u a l l y we    closed the gate,               but not before a number                     of

supporters           had d e l i b e r a t e l y    tried to         push by to have a look at the

bodies.            I then went          and joined a           cordon of officers            s i t u a t e d at the

entrance           to the L e p p i n g s Lane end             of the ground.            At this      tpoint            I

the whole of the L i v e r p o o l                 supporters         left the ground,           m a n y of them

wer e    very angry,           they were           calling      us    "Murdering bastards*              and         ’

suppose you           lot are        h appy now."            There was a continuous                torrent           of

ab u s e a n d threats m ade              by the         crowd as       they    passed by.         To their

credit all           the     officers       s tood up to this constant abuse and made                                   no

comments           back.     I believe        had a n y        one    of these o f f icers        lost his

It w o u l d a p p e a r    that    he had gone again,              but they      c o n t i n u e d and

a l t h o u g h the y o u t h was        blue,   he e v e n t u a l l y a p p e a r e d to be breathing.

I told them to keep                looking a fter         him an d that        I w o u l d get an

placed him          into the ambulance,             he was       still     breathing,       but he         looked

very    ill and was          still       quite   blue.



I c o ntinued o r g a n i s i n g        stretchers       as the a m b u l a n c e s   arrived.           On one

gate and a p o l i c e m a n brought a doctor                    to me,     he was a tall man,                  quite

young.      By this         time we had a number              of    injured persons           pro pped up

along    the outer wall,                bodies were also           being    put a s hort        distance

E ND OF R E P O R T
Inspector A Humphries - A3 Sub-Division, Mexborough




On Saturday 15 April 1989 > I was on duty in company with other officers involved
in duties at the FC Cup semi-final football match at Hillsborough, Sheffield
between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forest Football Club.

At 9.45 am that date, I attended the main briefing at Hillsborough Stadium with my
four serials, which consisted of four sergeants and twenty two PC's. The serials
under my command numbered 22 to 25 inclusive. Our duties to be performed on the
day were public order patrols along Middlewood Road, Sheffield from Crofton Avenue
to Bradfield Road, this area being designated Sub-Sector 10. After a short break
for a packed meal I briefed my men regarding their specific duties. Special
attention was to be paid to all shop premises along the route and to any public
houses in the vicinity, I also instructed the officers re car parking facilities
in the area.

At approximately 11.05 am, I walked with my serials to their respective points.
The four serials in my command were spread over a distance of approximately one
and half miles. At approximately 12.30 pm I returned to the junction of
Middlewood Road and Wadsley Lane, men from serials 22 and 23 were in that
location, this covered a shopping area with a number of fast food shops which were
attracting Liverpool supporters. It was obvious that this was the busiest point
in my sector so I remained there. I added a further 2 officers from serial 24 to
this area for that reason. From the outset, myself and the officers with me were
being approached by Liverpool supporters asking directions to public houses and
off licences. The main public house in the area was closed so many supporters
wandered off towards the city and along Wadsley Lane seeking licensed premises.
It was apparent at this early stage that the majority of supporters had already
been drinking quite heavily. As time progressed more supporters arrived in the
area, the majority of which were walking round with cans and bottles of beer and
bottles of wine. We were continually being asked for directions to licensed
premises.

At approximately 1.45 pm, I was joined by Superintendent Marshall, he was the
senior officer in charge of the area. Mr Marshall wished to see all my officers
on their respective points. With this in mind, together we started to walk along
Middlewood Road in the direction of the Hillsborough precinct. After we had
walked a short distance, a radio message was received to the effect that a
dwelling house holder on Wadsley Lane was experiencing difficulties with drunken
supporters. It was alleged that the supporters were urinating in the garden and
being abusive. A police vehicle was sent to the location. Mr Marshall said that
he knew the area and that he was only a short distance away to where the incident
was occurring. We therefore turned round, walked back along Middlewood Road and
up along Wadsley Lane. We walked some considerable distance, but found no trace
of the incident. However, during this walk we did, in fact, walk by an off
licence, I am unable to say this off licence's exact location, but it was off
Wadsley Lane. Outside these premises were a number of Liverpool supporters, some
of whom were stood and some of whom were sat on the frontage of the off licence.
They were all drinking from cans of beer and bottles of beer and wine. The off
licence itself was full of customers, all of which appeared to be Liverpool
supporters. I walked into the off licence and was immediately surprised at the
amount of staff who appeared to be serving. These numbered approximately five or

                                                                             C o n t 'd

six persons, although the off licence itself is of the corner shop type. A lady
who appeared to be the owner or the person in charge, enquired about my visit. I
merely enquired into her and her staffs' well being, but also reminded them
regarding the law relating to selling intoxicants to persons under 18 years of
age. I must add that at that time inside and outside the premises I did not see
any person who appeared to be under 18 years of age drinking intoxicants.
However, some of whom appeared to be border line cases. After being assured that
they were monitoring all persons they were selling intoxicants to, I left the
premises and rejoined Superintendent Marshall. We made our way back to the
junction of Wadsley Lane and Middlewood Road, at which point Superintendent
Marshall departed and walked off towards the Hillsborough Football Ground itself.
I remained in that location. The stream of supporters continued up and down these
roads, there was a small amount of trouble in the Kentucky Fried Chicken premises,
which was quickly resolved. The police officers in that area were continually
advising supporters not to get drunk, to leave their drinks with the threat that
they would not be allowed into the ground. The amount of cans and bottles left in
the area was enormous.

At this point I must say that the hundreds and hundreds of supporters I saw who
were drinking intoxicants or obviously had been drinking intoxicants were not
disorderly or incapable, but I can say that they were all in drink.

At approximately 2.40 pm to 2.45 pm, the volume of supporters started to increase.
At a time when one would have expected a decrease as kick-offtime approached,
they were coming from the Wadsley Lane area, all or most still carrying cans and
bottles of intoxicants.   My opinion of this wasthat because the majority of
licensed premises in the area were closed, they had travelled greater distances to
obtain their drink and were returning late. A short time later, although I could
just see the Leppings Lane end of the ground in the distance, I could not see the
turnstiles or gates. I started to hear radio messages from Superintendent
Marshall regarding a build up of supporters at that end of the ground. These
radio messages started to increase and at one stage I can remember someone saying
they had a hundred men on standby in the gym and they were asked to attend. Also
Mounted Branch officers said they were attending. The radio traffic increased
with Mr Marshall then starting to say that there was a serious crush and he
requested that the game be delayed for 15 mintues and that this should be put out
over the loud speaker system at the ground. He originally asked for this to be
done and then demanded for it to be done, but the reply came back negative. As
previously stated I could see the Leppings Lane end of the ground, but not the
gates or turnstiles. The area looking from a distance appeared to be extremely
congested with supporters. I then noticed an officer who I believed to be
Mr Marshall, certainly with gold braid on his hat, standing on the top of a police
vehicle positioned in the middle of this crowd looking towards the gate area. I
then heard Mr Marshall over the radio ask that a gate be opened to relieve the
crush, this request was queried by the control. Mr Marshall again asked for the
gate to be opened, saying the situation was becoming serious. I cannot remember a
reply to this request, but then Mr Marshall then demanded that the gate be opened,
saying that if   it wasn't opened    someone would be seriously injured oreven killed.
I can remember   the reply came back over the radio, similar to, "IN THAT CASE
OKAY," or, "IN   THAT CASE YES." I can remember it was about this time that I heard
the crowd in the stadium roar. I immediatetly assumed that the teams had entered
the pitch. I realised from the radio messages that a crush was taking place and
slowly moved down the hill towards the ground. I was expecting to be summoned
with my men, but wasn't called. Around this time there was a small disturbance
between supporters further down the hill, towards the ground itself, so I again
moved nearer to the ground in response to this incident. This turned out to be a
small skermish, which broke up before officers could arrive and the persons
concerned ran off along a road to the right.

                                                                              Cont'd

Shortly after this a call came over the radio saying 'Everybody to the ground',
owing to the fact that only myself and the sergeants in charge of the serials had
a radio I turned and waved to all the officers in sight and shouted to them. As a
result of this we all ran down the hill over a small bridge and turned right into
the Leppings Lane end of the ground. Radio traffic appeared to be constant at
this time, so I had no means of communication with my serial situated in the
distance. After turning right into the Leppings Lane end of the ground, as I
entered this area Superintendent Marshall asked me and some of my men to close a
barred gate to stop any further supporters entering. We quickly closed this gate
and were immediately confronted by a group of angry supporters showing their
tickets and demanding entry. At this time I had no idea of what had occurred in
the stand behind me, so I started calming these fans down.  I can remember saying,
"THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF A CRUSH, GIVE US A FEW MINUTES WHILST IT'S SORTED OUT THEN
WE WILL LET YOU IN. WE ARE ONLY DOING THIS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD." To their credit
these supporters, who numbered maybe thirty or more, stood back and waited.

A short time later Mr Marshall approached us and just said, "GO IN THERE AND HELP
THEM OUT WITH THE INJURED," indicating the stand at the Leppings Lane end. Along
with other officers from the gate I then ran across a large concrete area directly
behind the Leppings Lane end stand (West Stand). As I did so I noticed there were
a few supporters coming from a tunnel under the stand, they were shouting and
swearing, saying, "YOU’D BETTER GET IN THERE YOU BASTARDS," and "WHAT ARE YOU
FUCKING DOING OUT HERE, YOU'RE NEEDED IN THERE," and similar other comments.     I
ran through this tunnel with a number of officers, there were some supporters
walking through and some standing.   I noticed police officers were carrying
someone through, I thought it was a youth, I could see he was injured, but I was
sure he was alive as he was being brought out the tunnel.    I then ran through the
tunnel into the terraced area.   In front of me I could see policemen at the
perimeter fence passing an injured or dead person through a hole in that fence.
There was a large group of police officers on the pitch side of the fence, so many
that the only thing I saw of the pitch area was the top of the goalposts and an
ambulance.  I had no idea what was happening on the pitch.    I immediately noticed
a pile of bodies towards the right hand corner of the terrace. The first thing
that struck me was that all the faces of these people were blue.     I made my way
towards this area of the terrace. At this time I also noticed a metal barrier
which appeared to be bent over and twisted.   I noticed one policeman who I don ’t
know struggling to get someone off the ground.    I immediately went to help him and
we carried a youth back up the terrace and through the tunneleventually lying him
down on the concrete area   at the back of the tunnel. This youth was blue and
showing no signs of life.    We started giving him mouth to mouth resuscitation, we
did this for a few minutes, but got no response.    I can remember the police
officer with me saying, "I THINK HE'S DEAD BOSS, I THINK HE'S DEAD." We therefore
covered his face and ran back into the tunnel and back on to the terraces. As I
did so, quite a number of people injured and some who appeared to be lifeless were
being carried out by police officers.   Regarding the youth we carried out, the
only description I can give is that he was a white youth wearing blue denim jeans
and a light coloured T shirt or jumper, this we pulled up to cover his face,
before retreating back into the tunnel. When I arrived back on to the terraced
area, I found two policemen giving mouth to mouth resuscitation to a youth on the
terrace floor, they were having difficulty getting his head back with the steps,
so I told them to carry him away.   I assisted them in carrying this youth back
through the tunnel and onto the concrete area. All this time I      had noticed that
some of supporters, still   standing on the terrace, were shouting and swearing at
us accusing us of being responsible, calling us killers and murderers.     I left the
two officers giving this youth mouth to mouth resuscitation and once again
returned to the terraced area. On this occasion I noticed that the supporters
above us, in the stand, many of them were shouting and swearing and waving their
fists at us, some were even spitting at u s . I can’t remember how many times I
went back on to the terraced area, but eventually it cleared.    I can remember

                                                                               Cont’d

    entering the concrete area and looking around me. It appeared to be covered with
    people laid out. I looked around and everywhere I looked I could see policemen
    and policewomen bent down with these people, giving mouth to mouth resuscitation
    or talking to them. At one point a middle aged lady approached me and said that
    she was a nurse and asked if she could help. This lady quickly became involved, I
    saw her giving mouth to mouth resuscitation to a number of people, examining
    injuries and also reassuring other supporters who appeared to be distraught. I
    have no idea who this lady was, but she certainly did a marvellous job and her
    services were much appreciated by all those present.

    I noticed an amublance pull up at     the gate, so I went towards that, at this time
    the radio traffic was constant. I shouted my call sign, 'India 10', but had no
    acknowledgement, everyone was talking at once, so I waited for a lull and shouted
    up requesting a call for doctors to attend at the rear of the Leppings Lane stand.
    I don't know if this was received or not because of the radio traffic, I couldn't
    tell, I just hoped that they had heard my message and were acting on it. I also
    shouted up for air to be brought to the rear of the Leppings Lane end stand. I
    went to the ambulance, called a couple of police officers nearby and we helped the
    ambulance men wheel the stretches out and pick up some of the injured youths who
    were quickly despatched. Unfortunately after this had gone, it seemed ages before
    another arrived, I suppose it wasn't that long, but it appeared so at the time. I
    can remember a police woman who I don't know, ask me for a stretcher urgently.
    She and a St Johns Ambulanceman had a youth on the floor, she was giving him mouth
    to mouth and the ambulanceman was thumping his chest. I can remember they said
    they he had gone once and that they had brought him round. It would appear that
    he had gone again, but they continued and although the youth was blue, he
    eventually appeared to be breathing. I told them to keep looking after him and
    that I $ould get an ambulance. I went towards the gate and to my right, near the
    roadway, I could see a fire engine. I shouted to a police officer whom I
    recognised from A2 Sub-Division, I instructed him to go to the fire engine and try
    and obtain breathing apparatus, but when he arrived all the firemen had left the
    engine. An ambulance came almost immediately, so I commandeered a stretcher and
    brought   that to the policewoman. We lifted the youth on to the stretcher and
    placed him into the ambulance, he was still breathing, but he looked very illand
    was still quite blue.

    I continued organising stretchers as the ambulances arrived. On one occasion,
    after I had been to the concrete area, I returned to the gate and a policeman
    brought   a doctor to me, he was a  tall man, quite young. By this time we had a
    number of injured persons propped up along the outer wall, bodies were also being
    put a short distance away. An Inspector and a serial of policemen, mainly from A2
    Sub-Division, were standing in a line covering the bodies from view. The doctor
    walked along, pointed out supporters and was saying, "THIS MAN MUST BE NEXT IN THE
    AMBULANCE, THIS ONE IS DEAD, THIS ONE IS INJURED BUT CAN WAIT." I can remember
    instructing Sergeant Lomas and some of the other officers present to follow the
    doctor's instructions regarding priority for ambulances, this was complied with.
    As the frequency of ambulance arrivals increased we eventually moved all the
    injured parties and bodies from the concrete area at the rear of the stand. I
    personally thought the doctor did a fine job, he appeared to be quick and
    methodical in diagnosing injuries and death. His instructions were being passed
    on to the ambulance drivers, which in turn were related to the hospital staff.

    After all the injured had been removed, I can remember standing by the gate when
    the crowd started to leave the stand. I was taking a breather and also at the
    same time stopping any of the crowd coming through the gate so they wouldn't see
    the bodies. One Liverpool supporter stood in front of me and started shouting at
    the crowd to use the other entrance, he was trying to help and maybe letting off
    steam. Eventually we closed the gate, but not before a number of supporters

                                                                                  Cont'd

had deliberately tried to push by to have a look at the bodies.   I then went and
joined a cordon of officers situated at the entrance to the Leppings Lane end of
the ground. At this point I joined up with some of my other serials, we stood in
a line whilst the whole of the Liverpool supporters left the grounfl, many of them
were very angry, they were calling us 'MURDERING BASTARDS' and 'KILLERS'.   I can
remember one shouted, "THIRTY SCOUSERS DEAD, I SUPPOSE YOU LOT ARE HAPPY NOW."
There was a continuous torrent of abuse and threats made by the crowd as they
passed by. To their credit all the officers stood up to this constant abuse and
made no comments back.  I believe had any one of these officers lost his nerve or
lost their heads, or reacted in any way, there would have been a riot.

        The attached report refers to my recollection of the events surrounding the
        incident at the Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield on Saturday 15 April 1 9 8 9 .
        I have received a pro-forma document from Chief Superintendent Wain requesting
        specific details, most of these are fully covered within the content of the
        report. However, items six to ten I would like to cover separately:

        Item 6 - What was the mood of the fans; as previously stated, prior to the start
        of the match, the majority of fans I saw were in drink although I must say they
        were not abusive ordisorderly.

        Item 7 ~ Actions of     stewards; I cansay that at no timethroughout the entire
        incident, in which I was involved, did I notice any stewards whatsoever.

        Item 8 - Breakdown in radio transmissions; as previously stated, the problem with
        transmissions was that the radio traffic was constant and on many occasions there
        appeared to be more than one person talking at once.

        Item 9 ~ I have attempted to describe the body of theyouth withwhich I was
        personally involved, although I did assist with and see quite a number of other
        bodies. I am unable to assist any further with any form of identification of
        these people, but I can say that I cannot recollect seeing the bodies of any women
        or children.

        Item 10 - I can remember feeling extremely sad for the persons who had died and
        those injured in the incident. I was also shocked and amazed at the conduct of
        some of the supporters during and after the incident. I can understand some of
        their behaviour, through bereavement or maybe shock, but many of them I feel were
        just jumping on the bandwagon and maybe trying to lay blame on others for their
        own actions. There was one particular point that I could not understand, after
        entering the Leppings Lane end of the ground, behind the west stand, as previously
        mentioned a large concrete area, this area could have safely accommodated a very
        large number of supporters and yet on the face of it everyone seems to have
        entered or tried to have entered the tunnel leading to the small terraced area.

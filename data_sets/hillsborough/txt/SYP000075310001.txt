supporters               drinking             alcohol.

We     arrived           in S h e f f i e l d         at    about         1.00      pm to        1.20        pm      ( 1 3 0 0 — 1320)     a n d we

The/e         were       no    queues           to    the     turnstiles,                but     there w e r e /              f         people

standing            around          by    turnstiles?               e verything              seemed          so/riormal.

At     no     time       during          th e    day       did    I see a n y            fig ht ing / disorder                     or

At     th e      entrance           directly            outside           the      turnstiles             I did         not       see a n y

When        we     had      gone     past        th e      turnstiles              we     could       see      the      Umnel           so we

just        headed          straight            for     the      tunnel,           at    th e    end      of w m c h          we    could       see

I saw         no    gates        open         other        than     the      turnstiles,                and         I witnessed           no

     I put       my    so n     on a       crash          barrier            directly          behind         the       left        hand       goal

     post,       about         halfway          down.            We    then        decided         to    go    down        the       front        to     get

     a better          view.

     When    having            passed         the       turnstiles               in the a r e a          outside           the       terracing

     down    the       tunnel           end     on      the      terracing,              I did         not    notice           any Police

     Control          or S t e w a r d s ,         but      I wasn't              looking         out    for       them.            We    stoj

     against          the      front       wall         and      everything              was      perfect;           thereat y J ^ o u t f i v e

     minutes          to    three        (1455)           I saw        the       start       of    the U*Tverpooj^tearn                        come      out

     onto    the       pitch and              then        the      crowd          came     down/m            t o p of      us.           It w a s      like

     a wall        coming         down        on you,            it j ust J ^ p t d o m i n g                and     c omi ng.            From       the

     first       surge         down we were                 just       crushed against                   the       fence.

     Eventually,               I had       to      let      go/f            my    s o n as     I seemed            to     be     choking          him,

     and    du e      to    the      pressure             of     the        crowd,       I yjot        separated           from          hirn,

     There       was       a Police           Officer stood                      directly         in f r o n t       of    us.           He w a s

     he    should          have      got      the       gate       opened          or    got      on    his     r a dio        to    try and           sort

     something             out,      but      he     d i d n ’t.

     After       about         f i ve    minutes            I got           back    to my         son,       so ,$fiere m u s t             have       been

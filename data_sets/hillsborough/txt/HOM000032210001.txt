        Dear Sir

        I refer to previous correspondence and in particular my letters o f 24th April, 28th April, 1“ May
        and 6th May. I should be grateful if you would supply me with a copy o f the statements
        referred to therein as a matter o f urgency.

        Further, the index o f the documentation previously supplied and entitled “Officer Reports
        Master Number Form1', begins at R94. It would appear therefore that I am still missing
        statements R1 to R93. Could you please provide me with a copy o f the same.

        Also, I am still awaiting a response to my letter o f 7'h May.

        Finally, could you please ascertain from South Yorkshire Police what the abbreviations
        “Q.O.R” and “F I .O ” stand for.

        I thank you for your assistance.

        Yours faithfully

Dear Sir
                                             HTLLSBOROUGH


         After the stewards employed by Sheffield Wednesday Football
 Club at the West Stand and terrace end of the ground had given
 evidence to his Lordship's Inquiry, they requested to meet with
 our clients, the Football Supporters Association, to discuss the
 question of stewarding generally with particular reference to
 Hillsborough.              Since that meeting the stewards have formed
 themselves into a committee and have intimated to our clients that
 the stewards will be seeking to join our client's organisation and
 liaise with the South Yorkshire Branch of our client's
 organisation on future matters relating to their role at Sheffield
 Wednesday.

          However, the stewards' Committee has, in the meantime, drawn
  up a submission of its own which it would wish to submit to his
  Lordship through the auspices of our client.                          Accordingly, we
  enclose herewith 3 copies of the submission that has been sent to
  us and we should be grateful if you could place it before the
  tribunal for their consideration.

           Whilst we appreciate that many of the matter raised in the
  submission may be pertinent to Part 2 of his Lordship's Inquiry,
   it may well be that some of the points ought to be considered
   prior to an interim report being made by the Inquiry in the event
   that his Lordship feels that any of the submissions can be taken

              HTLLSBOROUGH WEST STAMP STEWARDS' COMMITTEE
              flTTBMISSION TO THE FSA REPORT TO THE INQUIRY


Background

Since the Hillsborough Football Disaster the club stewards in the
west stand used by away supporters have organised themselves into a
representative committee.


The committee was formed because the stewards wanted to find a
collective way of expressing their concerns about matters to do
with organisation at the ground, some of which they have tried to
express through the existing channels of communication with the
club in some cases over many years.


The stewards feel that the points have broader relevance for clubs
up and down the country, not just in Hillsborough.


The areas of the stewards concern broadly fell into the following
categories:   (1) communication/liaison between clubs, police and
stewards (2) security (3) ground organisation (4) recruitment,
training and organisation of stewards.

1.   communication/Liaison Between Club. Police and Stewards


     A proper consultation/liaison system needs to be recognised
     between the clubs, stewards and police.      Currently in
     Hillsborough the only 'system7 in operation is that the
     stewards feed any points they want to bring up with the club
     through each stand's chief steward.      This system is not
     adequate and     there is no way of checking whether matters of
     concern have been fed and picked up through the system.         How
     can 3 or 4 chief stewards possibly be expected to represent
      600 stewards.    They would need to be supervised.


      It is recommended that regular liaison meetings are set up
      with the three parties in question and that matters of concerr
      raised at such meeting are properly followed up with
      appropriate action.
                                         Document No.   2   CONT’D



                          - 2 -



ipjjg stewards feel that e.g. crowd direction at the ground
could have been better tackled had such liaison meeting been
taking place regularly before the ill-fated match in April.


Currently the stewards are treated as a casual, unorganised
workforce with no particular specialist knowledge to offer in
the management of a ground.   Yet they are the workers in the
front line in contact with spectators and have through that
contact a lot of experts and first hand observations to offer.
It seems a great waste not to recognise the potential value
for more efficient management of a ground and club that the
stewards can offer providing proper liaison exists.


Security

There is a need for security patrolling inside the ground
during matches - this is currently not done in Hillsborough.
A private security firm operates outside the ground area, but
the stewards feel that an 'in-house'    operation by the club
with a security team trained specifically to work in that one
location would be a better solution.


Around organisation


First and foremost it is felt that section pen fences - both
in the terraces and in seats only areas must be taken down.
This is the only way that a safe flow of spectators can be
guaranteed.

Secondly, signposting should be much clearer.     As an example
 it should be possible to have signs in different colours to
 different parts of the ground with tickets of the same colour
 as the sign indicating the correct area.   For the colourblind
 it should be possible to print on the ticket and the sign in

More stewards and at different points in the away stand are
needed.   This   is particularly necessary during league and
other large games.    Stewards should be placed at terraces and
at gates to direct spectators to the correct area.        Away
supporters should be accompanied by specially trained stewards
from their own club, this could be done by setting up a rota
of experienced stewards at each club and the club should
organise and pay for their transport to away games.        An
example of the value of "Home Ground" stewards at an away
match was    seen at the disaster match, when the ground was
eventually being emptied of fans the exit went smoothly as
soon as the two Liverpool stewards present at the Leppings
Lane end spoke to the fans in their own accent and language.


There should also be a police officer at every decent size
gate at the ground.

Lockable 'hot line# telephones should be installed at
strategic points at the ground.    These should have a direct
link to the ground office and to the police control.          Stewards
should have a pass key to these phones as should any other
personnel at the ground that might have to resort to emergency
measures to alert other relevant personnel.


 There should also be several aid points at strategic places
 around the ground.   These should be easily accessible and
 well equipped (see later for training).


 There should be adequate small change at every turnstile,
 currently they often run out of change and fans are left
 waiting till more money is brought in.    If security is the
 reason for not holding much change, then security rather than
 leaving fans frustrated should be increased at turnstiles (see
 also security above).

 Facilities at the ground for both fans and stewards should be
 improved.   There is very little on offer for away fans at the
 moment and the stewards do not even have an office or secure


                                                                 10

area where they could leave their belongings.      Fans have
difficulty in getting programmes because of the sales
organisation being patchy - proper kiosks for programme sales
should be made available.


There should be fullest possible consultation with the
stewards - and fans - to ensure that facilities are improved
appropriately to suit the users needs.


Recruitment. Training and Organisation of Stewards


A proper and appropriate system of management needs to be
introduced into the stewarding of grounds.     This should
incxude proper interviewing of stewards prior to appointment.
It should also include a longer period of "apprenticeship" as
it appears was the case a few years ago.     Then it was
necessary for a new steward to observe his peers for half a
season before he was allowed to become a fully-fledged member
of staff.


The current "system" is based on stewards good will, at times
patronage in recruiting and the fact that all stewards are
club fans anyway, so somehow in all that casually they must
have the ground's interests at heart.    This is not a good
enough way to keep a very large, albeit casual, workforce
going.


Proper training, if necessary by apprenticeship with
experienced stewards should follow proper recruitment
procedures.    Training must include first aid procedures with
the club covering stewards insurance cost for such a purpose.
Currently some have training, some don not and none of the
training is through the club all those with first aid training
have clearly received it elsewhere.


All stewards must have proper identification at all grounds
and should be organised in smaller groups with more chief
stewards.     This way it would be easier to organise

consultation with groups of stewards as well.     The chief
stewards should be representative of the stewards; and in any
case the stewards should have the right to independent
representation of their interests in any consultations with
club management.


Conclusion


It is a sad reflection on the current situation in clubs that
we as stewards may now finally be listened to because 95
people have lost their lives and countless others have been
injured and psychologically scarred for life.


Many of these points we have attempted to make over the years,
it is not because we want an axe to grind, we are all football
fans ourselves - we love the game but we also want to make
sure that it is a safe game that can be enjoyed by all in the
community, regardless of their age, sex, race or any other
thing.


We feel however that the only way to ensure that goal is by
all those with the interest of the great game at heart working
together.    We want to start our bit here and now.

as perimeter fencing, crowd control and public safety were
fully   discussed   at   the   post-season Police  football
Conferences held during May and June, 1989 covering all
divisions of the Football League.

The listed Appendices being copies of working documents
previously circulated to Chief Constables have been sent

                            POLICING FOOTBALL - ACPO POLICY



DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL POLICY IN THE POLICING OF FOffHRAT.T.




1.       At a meeting of the ACPO General Purposes Committee on 1st

June,   1979,    it was         resolved    to    form    a    Standing Working Group to

assess the problems relating to football hooliganism.                               The Group was

constituted      to    include      representatives           from     other    organisations,

members of ACPO and anyone within the Police Service with special

expertise or knowledge            in this matter.             Its purpose was to examine

issues of national importance.




2.       During       the    life   of     the    Working      Group     it    considered             the

generality      of    policing       football       and       formulated       some       Notes        of

Guidance on policing which related particularly to arrangements                                       for

travelling      supporters,       their    arrival       and departure at grounds                     and

information about their movement through the transit system.                                      This

guidance was eventually formulated and made available to officers in

a document called "The Public Order Guide” .                          The Group met on six

occasions before it was             allowed to lapse.               There still remained an

arrangement     for    meetings      to    be    held    on    an    ad hoc     basis       between

interested parties and Mr. Anderton,                    the Chief Constable of Greater

Manchester,     was    appointed to        act    as     Liaison      Officer       and   to     be    a

depository      for   information         about    special      events        and    a    reference

point on difficulties that might arise.                       The Working Group also set

up a system whereby each Police Force hosting a football ground was

3.       At a meeting of the General Purposes Committee on the 3rd

November,       1983,    in     the    face     of     continued          problems      at   football

grounds and indeed at other sporting events,                               the whole matter was

discussed      again     and    it     was     decided       to    resuscitate        the    football

hooliganism      group    but     extend       its     terms      of      reference    so    that   all

matters concerned with hooliganism in sport could be considered.                                     To

this end the General Purposes Committee approved the constitution of

a Standing Sub-Committee on                   "Hooliganism in             Sport".      Mr.   Anderton

has   since that time acted as Chairman.                          The Terms of         Reference of

the Sub-Committee included a requirement to act as a reference point

in respect of special problems relating to sporting fixtures, mainly

in England and Wales but also with an eye to Scotland and to events

in    Europe.      The        early     business        of     the     Sub-Committee         included

consideration of the initial                  C.C.T.V.       systemsset up in England

Scotland    and       consideration           of     problems in          relation     to    alcohol,

particularly on public service vehicles.



4.       The     reconvened          Sub-Committee           on   Hooliganism          at    Sporting

Events met for the first time on the 13th November, 1984 and it has

met on a total of twelve occasions since.                            Early on its agenda was

the question of guidance offered to police officers.                                   It was felt

this needed to be reviewed in the light of then recent events and

the    Secretary        was     asked     to       undertake         an     examination       of    the

guidance.       The     new     document       was     prepared           and   approved      by    the
                                                                                  Document No. 3


Sub-Committee          on    the   23rd     February,      1987   when    it was     decided     to

issue it as a stand-alone document which should be made available to

all officers with a responsibility for supervising football games.

The document subsequently received the endorsement of ACPO Council

and   by    October         1987   had     been    circulated      to    all    Police     Forces.

THE HOOLIGANISM PROBLEM




5.         To    compass      a    topic    of    this    complexity     completely        and   in

detail is clearly not possible within the terms of this submission.

Nonetheless a number of points need to be made which relate both to

current strategies and to ways forward.



6.         First of all it has to be said that football hooliganism is

almost a worldwide phenomenon                    and has plagued the            game in Englandat

least since the mid-sixties.                      It is difficult to            guage the extentas

no real     index of the problem exists                    (arrests     are    a very    doubtful

indicator).        Nonetheless the police view is that by the mid to late

seventies it was endemic with police officers subjected to spitting,

abuse and assault so often that it became "normal".                              Indeed by the

turn of the decade police officers were surprised if they did not

have to skirmish to preserve some                    kind of control            over events.



7.         More        organised     andforceful          policing       checked     the    worst

excesses        and in due course legislation altfd technology have all in

their turn added to the plethora of controls which in recent years

have restrained football’s belligerents.                      Despite these improvements

policemen        are    in    no    doubt    that    at    many matches        the   balance     of
                                                                                                ^Document No.          3   CONT’D


             control     is   a    fine    one    and     at    the      margins    hooligan         gangs     still

             venture     on    a     deliberate        course      of     affray.       The     nagging      strain

             associated       with    this      violent        fringe     does    much    to     colour      police

             perceptions of crowd control.




             8.         It is probably fair to say that traditional policing methods

             for handling football were largely consistent with policing methods

"I           for    handling       large     crowds     in      general.         During       the     1960’s,    as
J
             problems    with football           crowds      became      notorious,       policing        methods

             became     increasingly       defensive         and    a good       deal    more       co-ordination

         ^   between Police Forces developed.                   Over the last two             decades policing

             football has become a specialist area and policing strategies have

             been based upon a presumption that violence between rival spectators

             is probable wherever they have the opportunity to intermingle.

             9.        Analysing policing tactics,                  certainly over the earlier part

J            of these years,         allows      the contention that substantially what                         has

    1        been     developed      is    an    all    encompassing         pattern      of     "policing       by
    I

             containment".         There are three fundamental aspects to this approach:-

 )
J
             (a)       The development of information concerning crowds                               in transit

                       and plans to intervene and escort at every turn;




             (b)       A commitment to segregation of "home" and "away"                               supporters

                       both    in    transit,      through         the    turn-stiles,         whilst     in    the
-J
                       ground and at their departure;




             (c)       The    construction        of    containment        fencing within            grounds    to

                       control the movement of supporters.




                                                                 -4-
                                                                                           Document No. 3          CONT’D


10.        The general            strategy of       "policing         by      containment"         is    near

universal       and routine to police,                  ordinary supporters and hooligans

alike.      In the great majority of                    cases       it    operates         with    relative

ease     and,    perhaps      paradoxically,            allows decent spectators to                       feel

secure     within       their       own    controlled           environment.               It     has    been

successful       over       the    years    for    most    fixtures            in marshalling great

numbers of football spectators within grounds more or less trouble

free, despite undertones of aggression at the fringes.



11.        On the negative side its disadvantages are that, it tends to

encourage        an     antagonistic        and     tribalist            attitude          between       rival

groups     and to some degree provides a framework for the "war games”

of determined hooligan gangs.                     Equally, whilst we may have contained

the    problem,        in    reality we       require a veritable army of policemen

 every weekend to hold sway between hostile groups apparently bent on

 violence.           The sheer      size of the police commitment is daunting and

 has progressively raised the question of how the problem of violence

 might be       removed rather than merely controlled.                                (This observation

 has to be set aside the general case that any large crowd needs some

 measure        of     direction      and     control          in     the      interests          of    public

 safety).        Hence over the last four years,                          at least         at   the     policy

 level,     we       have   been     doing much more             to      study       the   phenomenon         of

 hooliganism and to try complementary strategies designed to reduce

 the problem itself.



 12.        This       more       searching       examination            of   hooliganism          has    been

 based in part upon close observation and in part upon the work of

 intelligence          operations         which have       done       much      to    reveal the inner

 workings        of    hooligan gangs.             In    the    event         this    work has          put   in
                                                                                     | Document No.      5   CONT’D


question a number of basic propositions.                           Policing by containment in

a sense has been policing               "en-masse".           Faced with           crowds    of   many

thousands     it   has    seemed       impossible        to    concentrate          on    individual

offenders and police officers have planned to exercise crowd control

over    large groups      at "arms       length".        This tends           to have       sustained

the    presumption       that    football    crowds           by     their    very       nature    are

volatile and combustible and that whenever rival groups clash sparks

of violence are inevitable.              The more we have become involved in the

close analysis of hooliganism the more this presumption has been put

in question.



13.       The alternative thesis of football hooliganism has much more

to do with concentrating police attention upon determined criminal

hooligans.      Very     often it seems these people have no other interest

than    violence,       they     are    organised        in        gangs     and    carry     through

pre-determined plans to fight and cause damage wherever they can do

so with impunity.             In reality few clashes are in fact spontaneous,

they are almost always arranged even if that is not evident at the

time.     The numbers involved vary from 10's to 100's.                              They are part

of a culture with a hierarchy of command,                            a mythology of motives,

and     the   outline    of     national    organisation.              Football      provides      for

them a magnificent opportunity - the nature of the game is one of

physical      confrontation;       support       is    often partisan in the extreme;

ill     constructed       stadia       provide    an     accommodating             platform;      vast

crowds provide both the atmosphere and the cover behind which they

can manoeuvre; and the fixture list organises                              a calendar       for their

 criminal encounters.

                                                                                I Document No.           3



14.       It would       be    wrong    to    describe these hooligan groups                      as a

"tiny minority" as the football industry is want to do.                               Regardless

they are a minority and some explanation of how they can create such

a destructive level of nuisance is required.                           Equally it has         to be

explained why      some fixtures,            indeed the majority of fixtures, pass

off without any          apparent      trouble.          Football      crowds   can    be    broken

down into at least three broad groups.                        Firstly, there are those who

are keen supporters, who attend regularly,                           who will be      represented

within a wide age range and who are in every respect co-operative,

and behave fairly and reasonably.                   Many of these people will be *in

seated    areas,    family      paddocks        and      be    season    ticket     holders.         A

second broad group who fill the popular terraces will be vociferous

in    their   support     of    their    own    club,         acquiescent     towards       the    ill

behaved and indifferent to police                   strategies.          A third broad group

of    largely    young male volatile supporters will be noisy,                           actively

involved in demonstrating allegiance to their own club as well                                      as

belligerence towards the opposition.                      Whilst generally passive they

are sufficiently ill-humoured that if the opportunity for disorder

is    presented    they will        join     the    throng.          The determined hooligan

groups    who    represent      a   special        stratum      of    this   last   element        can

therefore,      and this       is really the point,              rely upon a good deal of

tacit support in the event of disorder.



15.       The      hooligan         groups      are       constantly         surveilling           the

environment        for     opportunities            to        generate       confrontation          in

situations that will carry the uncommitted with them.                               In addition

our    present    understanding         leads      to    the view that they pick their

fixtures and that the hooligan effort is selectively targetted.
                                                                                            Document No.          3



16.          On this alternate thesis it is not surprising that "policing

by containment" has not                   found an answer to the problem even though

it has generally held it in check.                        The hooligan may be arrested on

occasions but         the determined nature of his activities is likely to

remain undiscovered.                   For these      reasons we have been concentrating

in     recent       times       much     more    on    the     development             of    surveillance,

intelligence and evidence gathering.                          This is a developing phase and

might       be   termed     "pre-emptive          policing".             Many     of    the    initiatives

described later in this evidence are designed to sharpen and target

the police approach to this aspect of the problem.




17.          A further matter needs                to be examined here and that is the

connection between public safety and hooliganism.                                      These    issues are

often       seemingly       at    variance.        Containment fencing for example may

also        prevent        rapid        evacuation.            Equally          however,            lack     of

containment,         will allow hooligan groups to storm the opposition and

create       a   scenario        within    which       there       are wild        surges,          panic   and

massively        dangerous         crowd        pressures.          In    short        public       order    is

intrinsically linked with safety.                       Those charged with handling large

crowds      know     that    the greatest danger               lies       in the        sheer weight of

numbers and that any signs of undue urgency or even panic can create

shock waves in one part of the crowd felt with tremendous intensity

at another.          This       is clearly likely             to    be    compounded           on    terraces

where       there     is    a     deliberate          incline.           Public        disorder       is    the

occurrence most likely to generate                       frantic crowd movement.                       Herein

lies an awesome truth.                   Where     large crowds are concerned the sheer

irrational momentum of sudden movement can never be wholly guarded

against.         Every step can be taken to provide a safe environment but

if    the    facilities          are    misused       there    can       be   no       guarantees.          Put
                                                                                               Document No.       3   CONT’



    another way any large crowd in a confined space generates potential

    dangers, so long as that crowd is reasonably orderly that danger is

    minimal but there can be no absolute protection, by engineering or

    policing,         if large numbers              in the    crowd      are       determined         to    behave

    irresponsibly.




    18.         Fortunately           the     great       majority           of     regular          supporters

    recognise the obvious dangers                     and    are       cautious,         particularly         when

    entering       and     leaving      sports       stadia.       The hooligan is as ever the

1   bizarre exception and in this                     category we would have to put those
J
    who    seek       to   enter      an     all    ticket      stadium without               tickets.        This

    unfortunately           is    not       uncommon      and     as     a    strategy          must       involve

    something of a mass attempt to stand any chance of success.




    19.         These      paragraphs         are    an   attempt        to       characterise         football

    hooliganism at its present stage, however the situation is almost by

J   its    very       nature     ever       changing.        Overall         there       is    probably       less

    hooliganism by volume but where it occurs it is often more serious.

J   Two     aspects        of    control      have    done      much     to       change       the    nature    of

    hooliganism.           The legislation which prevented the general                                supply of

    alcohol      to    fans      in   transit        and the universality of C.C.T.V.                        have

    made    a    major      impact.          Taken    together         the     effect         has    been    that

    displays of wild aggression from hoardes of drunken supporters are

    much    less      frequent.         The    hooligan has            moved       out    of    the    camera's

    range    and      in    a word,        there has been "displacement" away from the

    terraces to the darker confines of the stadium or to other venues

    such as public houses and the transit system.

20.          The    evidence       from   our   intelligence       operations    indicates     a

good deal        of violence occurs away              from   football    grounds     on    other

than    match       days    and    seemingly having nothing to do with football

other than that allegiance to a football team is the reason behind

the gang's association.               This may be a consequential development or

it may simply be that we are only just learning of how these things

occur.       A     further      inference    drawn from intelligence operations               is

that the hooligans are much more selective in their affairs.                                They

do not attend every match with a plan for disorder, rather they pick

particular         fixtures       which   represent     in   their    distorted      mythology

special      challenge or consequence.                On these occasions they may well

contact      beforehand         others    who   are    similarly     minded    and   even    the

opposition.



21.          Whilst much of the worst of the problem relates to hooligan

gangs    this       is    not   the   only phenomenon.         Earlier    in paragraph        14

reference was made to a "third estate" of supporters who were always

capable of wholesale misbehaviour if circumstances are favourable to

that end.          Containment policing is designed to keep this in check

and is usually effective in doing so.                        It should    be    said however

that policing "big occasions"                   is especially trying because that is

exactly when the atmosphere is likely to be so heightened that this

volatile section of the crowd will misbehave.                          It is the sense of

occasion associated with "semi-finals" and "finals" or with end of

season       clashes         which       determine     championships,         promotion      and

relegations which induces an atmosphere of challenge and expectation

and often drunkenness to boot.                   In these circumstances policing can

be    much    more       difficult    but   usually     achieveable      all   other      things




                                                     -10-
                                                                                            Document No.        3



being equal.              It takes, however, very little to change the balance.

A violent incident occurring,                      a late train,             inadequate          turn-stiles,

supporters       in numbers without                    tickets       - all these things can upset

the best of plans and given the numbers involved reduce policing to

a desparate effort to maintain order.




22.        It       is    recognised        that       safety        is the main concern of this

enquiry       and        the    attention        given        to     the    hooliganism           problem      is

purposefully presented in this context.                                Skirmishes in public houses

away     from the ground will                     not of themselves put largenumbers                         in a

football      crowd at risk.               But disorder in and amongst                        a large crowd

is unquestionably dangerous.                       If crowds          are orderly and responsive

the only real danger, providing spectator limits are maintained,                                              is

from     fire.       If        they   are not,         then     no    matter           what the        policing

arrangements             and    given      the    outdated         nature        of    most major        sports

stadia, there is a potential for danger if not disaster.

23.        As       previously          mentioned         the        original          ACPO      guidance     on

policing      football           included        the    setting       up of a national                 index of

football      liaison           officers.        Their        purpose       was       and   is    to    develop

"match     information"               to   assist        both      the     match       commander        in   his

planning and to provide                    information to his opposite number in the

event    of     an       away game.        This        index is maintained at New Scotland

Yard and published                annually.            Throughout          the    1970's      this     was   the
                                                                                      Document No.            3



basis of the intelligence system.                          It was effective to a degree and

provided       information         about          numbers    of     travelling             supporters         and

their    mode      of    transport.           It was consistent with the                         strategy of

"containment policing" in that it provided the basis for control and

segregation, escorts and the rest.




24.           In 1985 the sub-committee determined to examine and revise

this intelligence              system recognising that                   it   lacked        precision         and

formality.         As    a result of that examination the system of passing

information between liaison officers was standardised and an effort

made     to    make      the     information          available          more        comprehensive.               A

proforma was            produced       so    that    information           would       be    stored         on    a

common        basis     and     the     system       required        that       a    match        information

summary be prepared at the conclusion of each game                                          to    record      the

details       of   the match,          viz.,       number     of     travelling supporters,                   the

accuracy of the information supplied, details of coaches and trains,

details       of   arrests,       details of any incidents etc.                             A copy of the

report would            be    retained by           the    Force     hosting          the    match          and   a

further        copy      sent     to        the    Force      from       whom        the    away       support

originated.           On this basis over time each liaison officer would have

a file of reference for all encounters during preceding seasons as

well    as a file on the performance                        of     his    supporters             at   all    away

games.         This      system       works       effectively        and      match        commanders         and

liaison officers report it is much more effective than it used to be.



25.           Whilst these arrangements were being put into effect we were

at     the     same     time    examining more              closely      the        distinction between

"match information" and "intelligence".                            Whilst match information is

in     some     degree        intelligence,          in     real     terms          intelligence        should
                                                                                                   Document No.         3



relate to the identity, the known associations,                                           the known strategies

and,    if        possible,         the    actual         plans of          those         involved in football

violence.           Recognising            that     most       liaison           officers      were        not    in    a

position to develop much of                            this sort of information we have over

the last two years made                      additional            recommendations.                 In particular

we     have       recommended             that      for       each        club       there     is     an       approved

"intelligence officer" who                         should         seek     to     develop          a portfolio         of

intelligence             in     real       terms.            It      is     recognised,             however,       that

developing intelligence                     involves          a different              approach       to       policing

football than simply managing each game.                                         It is entirely dependent

upon the progressive development of new skills through observation,

surveillance,             undercover             operations,              targetted          use     of     C.C.T.V.,

intelligence gathering,                     active        policies          of      arrest     and       the    use    of

travelling          away       "spotters".               Whilst           such       an     approach        has    been

recommended          by       the    ACPO     Sub-Committee                the      costs     and     professional

difficulties have to be taken into account and many Forces have not

felt     at       this    stage        that        justification               has        existed     for       such    a

commitment.              Equally       the       development              of     the      skills     necessary         to

build up intelligence takes time and,                                 whilst we have been involved

in    explanation             and    training,          practices           are      not     yet    in     step    with

theory.



National Football Intelligence Unit



26.           In     an       effort        to     give        some        coherence          to      intelligence

gathering and because by its very nature intelligence of this kind

needs     a       wide    purview,           the       ACPO    have        presented          the     case       for   a

nationally          organised             intelligence            unit.          Hooligan          gangs       operate

across        a    wide       area     and       may    of     course          be      involved      in        criminal
                                                                            Document No.        3        CONT’D



    escapades in any town between their point of departure and the venue

    of the fixture.        Furthermore, in recent times there is good evidence

    that     they   will    often    plan    criminal       violence        which    has     nothing

    whatever    to do with      football.       There       is   a   need    to     overview    such

    events    to identify patterns          and recognise what is behind seemingly

    unconnected events.



    27.        Equally we have argued that as there has been much public

    concern about the conduct of English spectators abroad, particularly

    those following the national side, there is a need for some central
j
    point to retain, gather and disseminate intelligence concerning fans

    who travel      abroad and cause trouble.               At    present     no     local   Police

    Force has any real stake in this matter.



    28.        For all     these reasons the development of a National Football

    Intelligence Unit is seen as of critical                     importance and at present

    negotiations     with     the   Home    Office    are    well    in hand for it to be

    funded by Common Police Services (Appendix B refers).

    29.        In 1983     in conjunction with the Football Trust, who provided

    the finance,      an experiment was undertaken to examine the usefulness

    of C.C.T.V.      in dealing with hooliganism.                 Rudimentary systems were

    set up in Manchester, Edinburgh and Birmingham.                     One of the problems

    which always exists         in developing ACPO           (i.e.    national)       initiatives

    is the lack of a central staff to evaluate and formulate policy.                                It

    was therefore difficult to evaluate properly these experiments but

    in 1985 an approach was made to the Trust to extend these facilities

                                                                                                             32
                                                                        Document No.      3    CONT’D



in First and Second Division grounds.                     About this   time as a result

of the problems            at Luton,    Birmingham,       Bradford and Heysel the call

for C.C.T.V. became a clamour.                Very obligingly the Football Trust

made    considerable         funds    available    and over the last few years some

sort of system has been made available to all League clubs.




30.          Because of the considerable expenditure there was                 an urgent

need    to    be    more    precise    in   the whole area of C.C.T.V.             A review

organised by the sub-committee reported that systems were generally

inadequate         as    far as their specifications went and that operators

were untrained and operations lacked strategy.                    In short,    simply to

put in C.C.T.V.            was no answer at all.           We needed to know what we

expected of the equipment, what the best configuration of equipment

might    be,       operators     needed to be properly trained           (to this end a

whole new area of expertise had to be developed)                       and it had to be

allied to an intelligence system.                   Protracted negotiations with the

Home Office took place and eventually a technical committee was set

up staffed by officers and support staff with knowledge in this area

from    various         Forces   and with    the    permanent   expert    advice    of   Mr.

Andrew Ford,            seconded from the Scientific, Research and Development

Branch of the Home Office.              This committee has worked in conjunction

with the Football Trust and given professional advice to all Police

Forces providing C.C.T.V. coverage.                 It has also developed advice on

new equipment and proper specifications.



31.          Over    the last two years training courses set up in Greater

Manchester have trained almost 200 operators nationally and training

is    ongoing.          Additionally a training and awareness video has been

put together and made available to all Police Forces.

32.       Whilst we have made great strides                           in this      area the present

lack    of     wholehearted         development          on     the   intelligence         front        still

means    that    the      real potential          is not entirely                fulfilled.        Equally

there    remains         something of a debate as to the best use of C.C.T.V.

For evidence and intelligence gathering different specifications may

be desirable            than those for crowd control and safety.                               Accordingly

the sub-committee has now set up a working party to examine the best

advice on the use of C.C.T.V. for crowd control.                                  On 29th July 1988,

following presentations by the Secretary to "football                                      conferences"

and to the ACPO national conference, a paper was circulated by the

Chairman       to       Chief     Constables        outlining          the       related        strategies

recommended by the sub-committee in relation to the use of C.C.T.V.

and intelligence operations.                  These are attached at Appendix C.



Football Conferences



33.       The difficulty of disseminating national policy has                                      always

been accute.             In the area of football policing there is a greater

need for consistent policy and communication with other Forces                                          than

in      almost        any        other     area     of        policing.           The     reasons        are

self-evident.             Almost         uniquely      we     are      always       policing        events

involving some level of participation with other Police Forces.                                           In

a word we are policing a crowd and hooligans                               from another Division

or another Police Force.



34.       In     1986       in    an     effort     to      improve       liaison        and     increase

consistency         a    system was         set   up     to     provide      a   conference        at    the

season's        end      for      the     match     commanders          and      their     intelligence

officers for each Division of the Football League.

35.        At each of these conferences                    the ACPO guidance on policing

football      is    an     agenda       item     and   commanders         are    requested           for   any

views    as   to     its       update.      Copies       are    also      issued        to    all     people

attending      the       conferences.           The    conferences have provided a forum

for wide-ranging              debate,     the     exchange      of    professional            information

and new ideas and the emergence of concerns for consideration by the

ACPO sub-committee.                 A copy of the minutes of those                      conferences         is

Liaison with other bodies



36.        Over         the    last     four     years    we    have      sought    to        improve      and

facilitate our liaison with other bodies and institutions that have

a role in dealing with the football problem.                                The Secretary of the

Sub Committee is in frequent contact with the Football Association,

the     Football League,             the Professional Footballers'                  Association and

the     Referees        and     Linesmen       Association.          On    all     of        these    fronts

relationships           are     good and generally a high level of co-operation

exists.



37.        As far as the Football Association is concerned recent areas

of    co-operation            include     close    attention         to   international             fixtures

(the Football Association in part funded the intelligence operations

undertaken         by    British        police    officers       in West        Germany during the

European       Cup)           and   a    substantial           agreement        over         handling      of

misbehaviour on the field of play.




                                                         -17-

                                                                                                                   35

38.           There    are many matters of mutual concern between the police

and     the    Football       League,       in   particular    problems       concerning      the

scheduling of fixtures.




39.       In     the    general       context    match commanders are         inevitably          in

weekly if not daily contact with the secretaries of Football League

clubs     and in        the     great       majority of     cases    the    relationship          on

practical matters is first class..                   At the level of policy the ACPO

Sub    Committee       through its Secretary deals with current issues                        and

the    Police     Service       has    no    difficulty     in making      known    its   views.

Whilst there is no absolute coincidence of view on every issue,                                   in

general there is a spirit of co-operation.



40.           It should be mentioned too that                 the    Secretary     of   the   Sub

Committee       is ex-officio a trustee of the Football Trust.                          Over the

last few years the Trust have endorsed a number of spending schemes

to assist policing, most particularly in the area of closed circuit

television.



PROBLEM AREAS



Old Grounds



41.           Many football grounds are over 100 years                     old and many more

were     built at       a    time when it was sensible              for the stadium to            be

close     athand        to    their     support.     Consequently many           stadia   have

outgrown the sites on which they were built and rise ominously from

the door-steps of terraced housing which presses                            almost up to the

turn-stiles.            There     is        inadequate     parking    space      and    crowding



                                                    -18-

                                                                                                          36
                                                                                   Document No.            3        CONT’D


    problems     are       compounded        by     narrow      streets.           It     is     extremely

    difficult        to      sustain        free     routes         for      emergency           vehicles.

    Immediately after a game the ground is often isolated for up to an

    hour by the        sheer volume of people making their way to car parks,

    trains, coaches and the rest.                  Whereas much is made of large sums of

    money involved in transfer fees, most of this money is often no more

    than    credit     balances        circulated         within      the     League,           in     effect

    exchanging       funds    from     the    wealthy        clubs    to     the    poorer       clubs         in

    return for better players.               Either way few clubs have had the money

    if they have had the wish to do much to substantially improve the

    structural quality of grounds.                   Many are primitive in                 the        extreme

    often    with    wholly        inadequate       toilets     and       refreshment          facilities,

    often with uncovered areas of terracing and usually comprising in a

    main     stand    a    warren      of    passages        and     rooms    which       are        at    best

    inadequate.        Although      some     of    the   major      clubs     have       some       part      of

    their facilities at an excellent standard, they all retain primitive

J   enclosures       for     the    less     articulate         members       of        their        support.

    Football    stadia have been tinkered with over many years,                                  few were
1
J   actually designed to be what they                     are      now.      Radial      and     perimeter

    barriers have been imposed on an inadequate                            infrastructure.                Often

    the     alignment      between      turn-stiles,          facilities        and       terracing            is

    completely distorted.             In short, crowd supervision within the ground

    and outside at turn-stiles usually consists in making the best of a

    bad job.



    42.        A point that should be made here is that on most occasions

    the bulk of the crowds are home                   supporters and go to exactly                          the

    same place in the ground every match.                       They know their way and they

        know    the      problems.       "Semi-finals"           played     at    neutral    grounds,

        however,      are     entirely    made    up       of     away    supporters    where        this

        directional sense is usually wholly absent.                       Thus it may be that on

        these occasions the design failings of old football grounds are most

j       likely to surface.




        Capacities and Safety Certificates



        43.        The      safety    certification         process       involves     the    general

        presumption that segregated parts of the grounds will be safe for a

        given capacity.         If the structure has failings then the capacity is
i
i       reduced until        things are improved.            There are however difficulties

        with this arrangement           particularly where           the    area    in question       is

J       terracing.       If it is a large area but nonetheless sub-divided then

        there   can be over-         crowding    in    some      parts    balanced by       spaces    in
j
        others.       Seating of course would determine distribution on an even
]
j       basis, terracing certainly does not.


I
\
J       44.        One solution would be to make the segregated areas                         smaller

1       so that, provided turn-stiles, facilities and terracing are properly

        aligned,      capacities     in a given       segment       would    be    sufficiently      low

        that    over-crowding        should   not be       a problem.        The difficulty with
-j

        this proposal is that in the event of                     fire or structural         collapse

        there should be "expansion room" for the crowd to escape.



w       45.        In short the disadvantage of wide open terraces is that the

]       crowd can concentrate, the advantage is that it provides expansion

        room.     This    is a fine balance and probably needs greater research.

    J   Unquestionably however more seating would improve the distribution.

46.           Policing         arrangements         ideally       would      allow        officers

sufficient           access       to     the   crowd     so      that    they     could     act   to

"distribute" overcrowding and/or remove troublemakers.                              There should

be gangways and access points well enough stewarded to allow passage

and there should be secure corridors as well giving protected access

to critical           areas.      In general however it is in the very nature of

terracing        that        if   the    crowd    is     large     gangways       are     extremely

difficult to maintain.



47./          Not to labour the point,              if grounds were being constructed

afresh well designed control mechanisms could produce configurations

which would allow a much safer management of the crowd.                                 As has been

indicated         the        alignment     between       queueing        areas,     turn-stiles,

facilities        and spectator areas            is critical.           There is a balance to

be achieved between confining sections of the ground so that undue

concentration           is    avoided on the one hand,             and allowing sufficient

expansion room for safety on the                       other.     In    reality     few    football

stadia         are     even       moderately      well     designed.         The        containment

arrangements have all been disjointedly fastened on to a basically

inadequate structure.



48.           A question that needs to be addressed here is the relevance

of     "all    seater"       stadia.      Historically it has been tried with very

disappointing           results.         Coventry was a noteable example and to an

extent        other    clubs      have    greatly   increased       their   seating       capacity

only     to     find    spectators        reluctant to use         seats or worse eager to

misuse them.            There are a number of considerations which are to be

taken into account.                Firstly,      if seating is provided the area has

really to be covered.                  People may stand in the            rain but they will
not    sit    in the      rain.     Secondly,     there   is a good deal of consumer

resistance.         Many spectators simply want to stand in the traditional

way which they associate with "atmosphere".                      Thirdly of course there

is the question of cost and,                on    some grounds,        the risk of         reduced

capacities.




49.          None    of     these      matters    are     fundamental         and    given        the

over-riding importance of safety and the obvious benefits in terms

of    distributing        spectators      and making the stadium more manageable

all    seater       stadia    should      without    question         be    the     aim.     As     a

practical matter however it would probably be desirable to develop a

rolling programme requiring club management to progressively reduce

the    capacity      of     standing      areas   and increase         the availability           of

seating.       This would         allow    spectators     to   gradually          adjust   and    be

more    realistic      from the club's point of view.                      Ibrox is perhaps a

powerful example of what can be achieved.



50.          As a final word on capacities              the ACPO guidance includes a

recommendation that the Police Control Box should have the facility

to monitor turn-stile readings.                   This is available in some                grounds

but    not    many    and    it   is   probably     timely     that    safety       certificates

require some system of monitoring accessible to the Police Control

Box.



51.          The issue of Safety Certificates is fundamental to the whole

question of ground safety and to Policing.
52.        Safety       certificates        are    generally        complex         and     subject     of

detailed     scrutiny.          In   most        cases,    a    Safety     Committee          involving

Police,     Fire         Service,     Local         Authority        and,           sometimes,        Club

Secretary,    work together to determine                       specifications.            Whilst this

is good practice,          its weakness is           that we have no                guarantee of the

real expertise of those involved.                    After a tragedy,                in which so many

young lives have been lost, we really have to ask ourselves whether

the guidance        in the      "Green Code" is sufficient.                     The point is made

again that there is a need for greater research into safety problems

and     greater     investment       in     the     training        of    those       who     make    the

decisions.



53.        A final point of concern,                 in respect of            Certification,            is

that    some grounds       are now owned by Local Authorities who are also

the Certifying Authority.               This appears to be wrong in principle.



Late Arrivals and Banned Spectators



54.        A common problem           for    police concerns              the    late       arrival    of

fans.     If a train is late or perhaps a motorway blocked,                                 it can     be

that    several     hundred      spectators         will    arrive       at     the    ground     after

"kick off"        and,    particularly if it is a critical                          fixture, will be

clamorous     to    gain     entry.         There     is    an     argument          that    in   these

circumstances       the     "kick off" might be delayed.                       The problem is of

course    that     on    this   basis     kick      off     times    will       inevitably        slide

further     and    further      back.       To    date     there    has       not    really been        a

convention about this although it is always open tomatch commanders

to propose a delay to the referee.

        55.      A further problem relates to people who for no good reason

        are late to reach the             turn-stiles.             It was ACPO's       fear that if an

        absolute ban on alcohol was enforced at grounds, and if indeed local

        hostelries were closed, the effect would simply be to delay arrival
T

j       as fans went further afield to find "watering holes".                               Guardedly it

        may be said this isgenerally the case.                       If fans        know no alcohol              is
 |I
J
        available    some    are        more     likely to be latearriving.              One answer              to

        this problem lies in timing critical fixtures so that alcohol is not
]
        available     anyway,       for    example         morning    or    mid-day     kick     offs.           It

]       remains an open question as to whether the general 3 p.m. "kick-off"

        time is really appropriate.

        56.      A    related      issue       is    the    efficient       manning    of   turn-stiles.

        Over many years match commanders have complained about                                   not    enough

        turn-stiles    being       open     or      not    being    open    early     enough.          As    with

        stewarding     turn-stile         operatives         are    often    casual    labour      and        not
 •i
-j      entirely     reliable.             These      matters        have been raised          with         Club

    i
        Secretaries and, certainly for major fixtures,                         should not now occur
J       too often.     There is however a further problem at turn-stiles about
-•I
    I
        which less     is   known       than     should be.          The    intelligence         operations

        referred      to     previously             suggest         that     turn-stile          fraud           is

        wide-spread.        This          clearly     is     a   seriousmatter if        borne         out       as

        capacities     could       be    exceeded         without    police     or    management being

        aware.     Some means of auditing                  turn-stile       operations      is    necessary

        and it is proposed to enter discussions with the League to discuss

        this issue.

57.          As a sanction against troublesome                     supporters        the F.A.       have

insisted       that    for     some    clubs,    Leeds         United    being   the        best   known

example,       away     fixtures        should       be    "all    ticket".         Only      approved

supporters         of the Leeds        Club with Supporters Club Card are allowed

to    buy    tickets.         This    system    has       in    fairness    done       something      to

moderate       the    reputation       of     Leeds    but      largely    by transferring the

problem.       ACPO did not support the scheme in principle although they

agreed to stand by it.                 In fact, on the day, many match commanders

faced with a mob outside the ground and insufficient resources                                        to

Police      in and out, simply let them in without tickets.                                 This was a

regrettable reality but underlines the difficulties                              associated with

"all ticket" fixtures.                No doubt long term and short term solutions

are in conflict here,                and no doubt         resolve       in favour of the            long

term should be best practice, but it is only fair to record that on

many occasions match commanders have acceded to the mob at the gate

and let in fans without tickets.




58.          One     other    group    of     banned      supporters       should      be    mentioned

namely those subject to "exclusion orders".                             Suffice it to say that

although many          hooligans were excluded under the provisions of the

Public       Order     Act,    1986     the    Courts      imposed       bans    for      such     short

periods      that the exclusion scheme became wholly discredited in the

eyes    of     the    Police    Service.        Short      term    exclusion        is    simply    not

enforceable and certainly no deterrent.




Touts



59.          The ACPO Sub Committee has                   for sometime       registered concern

with     the    Home    Office        about    the     problem      of     ticket        touts.     The



                                                      -25-

                                                                                                             43
                                                                              Document No.         3    CONT’D



difficulties they present are principally two fold: firstly, because

they will       sell    tickets       to anyone,     they are likely            to    disturb     the

segregation arrangements               (away supporters           for example will         be sold

tickets for the home sections of the ground ) } secondly, because they

guarantee       the availability of tickets on the day,                        they effectively

encourage       people      without     tickets     to     attend    all       ticket    fixtures.

There    is     no   particular        offence     in     relation      to    ticket    touts    and

commonly the police resort to arresting them either for obstruction

or suspicion of forged tickets.                   Regrettably the ACPO were not able

to produce factual evidence of a problem to satisfy the Home Office

of a need for legislation but the difficulty lies in knowing exactly

what    would    constitute          such   evidence      other    than       the    judgement    of

police    officers       on    the    scene.      There    undoubtedly         remains    a clear

need for an offence             making      it   illegal    to     trade      tickets    for    "all

ticket" fixtures on match days.                   There may need to be some exemption

allowing the club to do so with the approval of the Police.



Communicationa




60.       The Police Service has                 long struggled with the problems of

communications         on     major    sporting     occasions,       the      difficulties       are

commonplace in the Service.                 Principally the problem relates to the

high level of ambient background noise associated with a large crowd

and technical gadgets such as ear pieces have not really compensated

successfully.          In addition,         when large numbers of men are deployed

there is often a problem of providing enough channels                               to avoid the

system   being       overloaded.        Many     forces    are    not    in    a position        for

example to provide a dedicated command channel.

                                                                                                            44

61.        Regardless,         good communications are                    of    absolute        importance

and    two     issues          are     probably of        great       assistance.               Land      line

telephones     at       key    points      connecting         to    the     Match        Control    are         of

critical     importance         and     secondly good C.C.T.V.                   systems will          allow

the   Control       to       survey problems themselves                   reducing        the     need      for

reports back.




62.       Problems of communications                    are simply technical however and

with a sufficient level of investment should be surmountable.                                          It is

perhaps     the     case        that       investment         in     this       area      should       be        a

responsibility          of     the     football club          and     more          clearly       addressed

within Safety Certificates.



63.       One aspect which is vital                     is the siting and facilities of

Control     Posts.        They       should      be    specified          to    give       an     all-round

perspective        of    the    grounds,         allow    C.C.T.V.         monitoring,          have      good

radio and telephone             links,      sufficient room for liaison with                           other

services,    accommodate maps,               plans and emergency systems and so on.

Few are     really        adequate      and      in our       view    if       they      fall   short       the

global capacity of the ground should be restricted to 10,000.



64.Communication          with       the              crowd    is     another            issue.      It         is

recommended good practice to have the ability to override the public

address system at any time in the interests of public safety.                                            This

should be a rehearsed practice understood by both police and those

who   operate       the       system.       It    is     probably valid             to    recommend         the

training      of        the     professional           broadcaster             to      present      police

messages.     It is suggested in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

     that portable public address                            systems      be    at    hand     to     speak       to       the

     crowd.        Police experience is a little ambivalent in                                   this area.            They

     can be useful but in serious situations they tend to be ineffective.



     Intelligence




     65.           Paragraphs         23    -     28    refer          to      developments in the                police

     intelligence          system          but    under        the     heading         of     "Problems"          it        is

     reasonable to record some of the difficulties police have                                                   in this

3    direction.           First of all with 43 separate Police Forces in England

     and Wales it is always difficult to obtain consistency of practice.

     Equally       up     to    the    present          there       has     been     no     efficient        means          of

     enhancing          the      system          and         enforcing         standard         practice.                  The

     development          of     the       National           Football         Intelligence               Unit    should

     improve the situation but there is                                probably a need for the                    Police

     Service to make a greater commitment in this area.

     Costs




     66.           The cost of policing football is enormous.                                   Appendix E sets

     out some details of what is involved.                                On balance football clubs pay

     approximately 30% of the total cost (of which 30% is subsidised by

     the Football Trust).                  It has been recognised of course that much of

     the    policing       effort          is    directed       towards         the crowds on the public

     highways       making       their       ways       to    and    from       the        fixture.        By    common

     practice these officers                     form a reserve during the game usually on

     duty     in    the    grounds          but     uncharged          for.          The    whole     business             of

     charging       football          clubs      has     been       considered         and     re-considered               by

     Police    Forces          over    the       last    few     years.          There        are     a    number          of

difficulties.             There    is some disparity between Police Forces as to

the    rate    at which charges               are made.       The number         of     hours   charged

varies and is bound to both because tours of duty may be longer for

large crowds and major fixtures and/or because officers may have to

travel long distances to                  the grounds.        There is                some    ambiguity asto

what constitutes "ground                  duties".       If the physical perimeter of the

stadium is the dividing line then officers engaged in the duties of

turn-stile supervision (searching and queuing) would not be                                     charged

for.     Police opinion is that such duties should usually be regarded

as ground duties.




67.       There       is       another    area    of     difference       in     that    some     forces

charge    for    specific          numbers on a match by match basis                         and others

charge according to a formula rating matches as "high",                                  "medium" and

"low" priority, gauged over the season.




68.        From the club's point of view there is a feeling that police

charges continue to soar                  and    that     they    have    no     control      over    the

numbers       that    the      Chief     Constables determine are                required.        Whilst

this    is true in reality                they probably          do    not fare    badly      from     an

equitable       point       of    view    but    this observation takes no account                     of

their     ability         to     pay     or   otherwise.          Clearly      many       clubs      face

recurrent difficulties in meeting their creditors.




69.       At a practical level there is sometimes a reluctance by the

police locally to police additional fixtures even where there is a

willingness          to    pay    because       income    from        football     is    usually     not

directly available to the match commander as                             "overtime".          In short

internal budgeting arrangements for Police Forces where private cost

charges     are    involved       sometimes        present       difficulties         for      match

commanders.




70.       Whilst it is the case that Police Forces are bound to police

what is there rather than what they would like to police,                             the burden

of    policing    football    often     falls      most       heavily   on    those        that    are

anyway hard pressed and at particularly busy times.                                If any broad,

new view is to be taken about policing football some consideration

should be given to the difficulty Police Forces                             face    in providing

the manpower given that under the present (legal) arrangements only

a relatively small percentage of costs                    are recoverable.             Whilst it

can be    argued that crowdsin public places are a natural part of the

police    responsibility it can          also be         argued      that    football       crowds

have become a very special problem and that perhaps some other way

of    funding    police   commitments        out    of    football      revenue       should       be

considered.       An   alternative      to    present          arrangements         might    be    to

raise a levy on persons attending football grounds akin to the old

"aviation security levy” at airports.                    If this proposal was properly

evaluated a means         might    be   found      of    more    adequately         recompensing

police efforts.



Stewarding




71.       This seemingly innocuous heading in fact raises one of the

most contentious issues which has probably never been satisfactorily

resolved.       On the face of it a football stadium is privately owned

and the proprietors have a responsibility to conduct and manage the

ground    when    spectators      are    present         in    the   interests        of    public

safety.        Stewards are largely their agents to                         this effect.            In most

circumstances this would be a fairly unequivocable proposition.                                           The

debate however surrounds the role of the police                                  and the police are

only     there    because         stewards     cannot handle            football crowds without

the back-up of law enforcement officers.                          An acquiescent crowd could

well    be managed by stewards                 alone but a crowd which has                        time and

again     demonstrated            an    eagerness      to    fight          on     a    mass      scale    if

unsupervised          by    police,      simply      cannot       be    controlled           by    stewards

alone.     Because of this, whatever the theory,                             the practice          in most

football grounds            is that the police control ingress and egress

determine what parts of the stadium will be kept clear and where the

divisions        between     groups of spectators will                      lie.       Usually this is

routine and stewards carry out an ancillary role in accordance with

the police plan.             The question is therefore raised who is in charge

of     crowd     control          and   where       does    responsibility                 lie    for     the

management of fans?




72.        Mr.     Justice Popplewell's              final    report at paragraphs 4.13 -

4.19     discussed         this    issue.       Indeed      Mr.    Justice             Popplewell       took

evidence       from    the    Chairman        and    Secretary         of    the Sub-Committee on

this point and his observations very much reflect this.                                           In brief

the    final      report     resolved         that    the    police         presence        is    there    to

assist     enforcement            of    law   and    order        but       that       a    primary       and

continuing obligation lay upon the proprietors to manage the crowd.

Mr. Justice Popplewell noted that in the event of emergency, police

inevitably take de facto responsibility for organising the crowd but

added this in no way lessened the obligations of the proprietor.




                                                                                                                    49
                                                                                     Document No.             3



73.          Whilst Mr. Justice Popplewell's remarks are a wise and fair

summary       of   the       situation          current    reflection             does        raise    further

questions.          Whilst          legal       responsibilities              may        lie      with        the

proprietor the "de facto responsibility" which falls upon the police

in the event of an emergency is conditioned in its effectiveness by

what    has    gone     on    before        - otherwise          the       Service       is    very much a

"hostage to fortune".



74.          In particular           if     capacity       control         and     packing        is    not       a

police function,             which commonly           (although not entirely) it is not,

then handling the aftermath is a tall order.                                 Equally if the Police

exercise priority             (which they always do) in marshalling segregation

of     the    crowd,      and       through        their        control       post,           C.C.T.V.       and

communications          dominate          the    means     of    crowd        control,          they   cannot

simply       say   it   is    at     bottom       a   matter         for    the     Club.        Most       Club

Secretaries        if    asked       would       simply        say     "the       police       control      the

match".       Whatever        the    legal       niceties       this       often     seems       to    be   the

reality.       Yet because police control                      is only partial in the sense

that    stewards,        turn-stile          staff     and      the        rest    have        considerable

duties, there are grey areas.




75.          The    Safety          Certificate           is     supposed           to        resolve       the

difficulties in part by laying down safe tolerances such that in an

emergency the ground and the men that run it, can cope.                                           The stark

reality may be however that a good many football grounds are simply

not safe enough in an emergency if they are at or near capacity -

given the present nature of football crowds.                                Of course, most of the
                                                                                      ^Document No.              3    CONT’D



time    "capacities"          are     not      reached         and    the     problems          do    not     show.

But,   in the last analysis,                   safety is always a calculated compromise

and as practical men safety committees ask for what is possible.



76.        It may be that the ambiguous position of the police is part

of the problem - that is acknowledging the club's responsibility for

safety on the one hand, whilst routinely assuming all those tasks of

stewarding which             the     stewards           cannot       do,     either        because       of    the

truculence       of     supporters            or    the     limited         talents    of       the     stewards

themselves, on the other.                     It has to be said that the present lack

of clarity in these arrangements can lead to something of a 'dogs

dinner'.        In some clubs the police actively control the stewards,                                         in

others     the        stewards        are          quite       independent          and,        despite       some

improvements,          standards         of    stewarding           vary     considerably with many

being too old or simply unreliable.                                 The Secretary is normally the

"safety         officer"        but           he        will        have      many         other        weighty

responsibilities on match days.




77.        It     may     be       better          to      acknowledge         that        if    trouble        is

anticipated        or    if     crowd          control         is    going     to     test        the       ground

capacities       then,       in the interests of public                       safety,        police         should

take   control        over     the       stewards          through         their    supervisory             chain.

Stewards would continue to have a vital role in the strategy but two

issues would follow:               first if "packing"                 and "gangway” control were

on    occasion     a    police        responsibility,                the    police     might         require     a

different        standard           of        performance             from         stewards;           secondly

co-ordination         between        the      organisers            and    police     would       have to be

clear and formal.

78.        It     is        necessary        to         re-iterate           some        observations           on

stewarding.        They        are at best casual workers                         (usually working one

day   in    two       weeks),        they     are       probably           not    people        who     have     a

supervisory        role      in    ordinary        life       and are not always equipped or

used to giving directions or                      facing obstruction,                   many    are        retired

people, and pay is not so attractive as to guarantee commitment.




79.        In the best circumstances                      there       should be a well qualified

Safety     Officer,         someone     other       than        the     Club      Secretary,           a    Chief

Steward,        Sector      Supervisors           and    well     trained,          carefully          selected

Stewards.        All this is presently recommended.                              To make it a reality

it would need to be a more carefully worded condition of the safety

certificate        with      mandatory         inspection             by     members       of    a      "Safety

Committee"       which       includes        the    police.            The       Chief    Steward          should

report     to    the     Match       Commander          and     maintain         liaison        with       Police

Control     and,       on    occasions        the        Match        Commander         should       have     the

authority to direct the Chief Steward.                            The Safety Committee                     should

regularly        inspect          stewards        and     any     failings          should       result        in

sanctions.




80.        Regardless          the    police       h&ve        over    the       last    few    years        been

concerned        to      encourage          clubs         to     improve           the     standards           of

stewarding.        Our guidance includes close liaison with stewards as is

recommended       in     the      "Guide     to    Safety at Sports Grounds".                          We also

recommend       police       take     an    active        role        in    training        stewards          and

recently the Sub-Committee produced a training video which has been

circulated both to Police Forces and Football Clubs.

81.        Whilst there          is general       improvement the            situation is           still

rather patchy.           As stated earlier, many stewards are too old or more

interested        in    watching       the     game     than     fulfilling          their       proper

function.        In particular stewards               rarely can intervene effectively

in the face of           troublesome         supporters.        There    has       however      been   a

marked improvement in the conduct and organisation of fire stewards

and the manning of exit doors is probably constant.



Training




82.        As    a     very     practical       business       which     is     routine        to    the

Sub-Division which hosts the ground, policing football as a skill is

generally "picked up" by all                  ranks who        are     new    to   it.     For      many

"specialists"          such as mounted,          motor cyclists,         support groups, and

the like it is a fundamental part of their duties learned within the

context     of    on-going       events.       Recognising       that        support     from    other

Divisions       is often necessary,            good briefing is both                essential        and

general.        The ACPO Sub-Committee recently issued a training video to

all Forces on "briefing" for football.




83.        Specialist         Training       Courses      for     C.C.T.V.         operators         and

Intelligence Officers are hosted by Greater Manchester Police.




84.        Whilst it is inevitable that much will have to be learned in

the   doing      the     question       of    more     specialist        training        for     match

Commanders       is     an    issue     which     needs    to     be    considered.             Safety

certification,          crowd     movement       and      safety,       communications,              the

intelligence           system,        C.C.T.V.        strategy,        evidence          gathering,




                                                                                                               53
                                                                               I Document No.         3



membership         schemes        and    the     rest,        are     now    all     difficult       and

specialist         subjects.           Furthermore,          the    need     for    consistency       of

practice has been underlined several                          times    in this       submission      and

training is the most likely vehicle to achieve it.




85.      The       case    of a match Commander's                  training course cannot be

separated from the               need    for more          research    and    evaluation.        Taken

together      the    possibility          of     a    developing       package      of    operational

practice      is    most        attractive.          The     subject    may    be     ideal    for    a

"Carousel" course at the National Police College.



The Football Spectator Bill




86.        Police         views    on    this        matter    have     been       made   reasonably

clear.     Compulsory membership imposes the likelihood of considerable

resource costs to achieve enforcement but holds out some prospect of

greater crowd discipline.                 The ACPO have been more concerned as to

the detail than the principle and have sought to emphasise that the

most careful consideration must be given to issues like the capacity

of the    "agency"         to prevent fraud; the expertise of the "agency" to

manage the process              so that it is effective;               and the       robustness of

the   technology          and    the    regime       at turn-stiles.          The ACPO views on

these    matters      are       well    set    out      in    the     attached      correspondence

(Appendix F).




87.      It    is    the resolution of these                  issues which will determine

the balance of advantage between the amount of police time invested

to make the         scheme viable as against any noticeable improvement in

crowd behaviour.
CONCLUSIONS




88.          Over the last few years the ACPO has done much to highlight

best practice            and co-ordinate a nationally consistent approach.                                  It

is of course             the   responsibility of individual Chief                          Constables       to

interpret national guidance within their own domain.                                       On balance we

have fared well in relation to the development of match information

and liaison between forces and other agencies and we are probably on

the    brink       of        major     improvements         on    the     "intelligence"              front.

National guidance              is reasonably sound but probably limited by lack

of    systematic         research         into    crowd     safety      issues    -        in     particular

police    concern with hooliganism sometimes narrows vision on safety

matters.          Whilst        there      is    a    conference        system        to     spread     best

practice      there is probably now a training need for Commanders.                                         So

complex and technical has                     the policing       of     football       become        that   a

rethink      on     the       preparation        of   match      Commanders       is        probably    now

imperative         but       must    be    linked     with    more      research           into    managing

crowds.




89.        Two     issues        cast     a     shadow over these general observations:

the   poor     quality         and    inappropriate          location     of     so    many        football

grounds; and the vexed question of "who's in charge".




90.       Each          of     these      matters      is     intractable.             The        wholesale

relocation of football grounds is not possible but some substantial

things       can        be     done       within      the     existing         framework.             Three

opportunities in particular may be pursued:




                                                       -37-

                                                                                                                 55
                                                                                   Document No.           3   CONT’


(a)       critical    fixtures       test grounds much              beyond        a normal        game,

           special    games        should       only    be     played       at         grounds     with

           excellent facilities           (and the League            and F.A. may           need     to

           identify and improve some key venues);




(b)       the process of certification needs to be placed on an annual

          basis     and    safety       committees       need       more    guidance         on     the

          "whole"     concept      of    safety      in grounds,           i.e.    not     just    the

          physical tolerances of structures but configuration and the

          relationship       of    space      and    crowd     behaviour          as     a process.

          Overall capacities may well need to be reduced;



(c)       a programme       to    provide     seating,        eventually          to    cover     most

          spectator       sections of the stadium,              needs       to be implemented

          universally.




91.       As to the question of             "responsibility"          the matter of civil

liability should not cause us to resile from hard decisions if they

are    necessary.     Dual       responsibility         for    safety       is     a    recipe     for

confusion.    The Police are always going to seize the initiative in a

crisis; crowd control is always going to be inextricably linked to

criminal hooliganism; the Police are never going to accept direction

from    stewards;     stewarding         will       never     (at     least        not      in

foreseeable    future)      be    able   to     cope    without      some law enforcement

back-up; and finally Police do "own" most of the means of control.

In these circumstances            the Police must accept a leading role and,

despite   the requirements         and civil         liabilities       of    football        clubs,




                                                 -38-

                                                                                                               56
themselves           take    on       supervision      of    the    overall       conduct          of       events

wherever crowd safety is an issue.                          This responsibility itself turns

upon:




(a)       greater           research       to         provide       a   professional              corpus        of

           knowledge;




(b)        the better training of match Commanders;




(c)        through the            safety certificate process,                   the improvement                of

           the       means       of    control       particularly        communications,                control

           posts, C.C.T.V., etc.




92.       Despite          all    these    things          safety       will     always          be     in    the

balance       if     crowd    behaviour         is    unreasonable,        those           who by violent

design disturb the equilibrium of large crowds so as to unleash the

terrible pressures which great numbers can so precipitately create,

carry an awesome             responsibility - as do the Police                             and     Courts      in

properly bringing them to book!




93.       As a final observation                     but perhaps of ultimate significance

is the matter of compliance.                         Whilst      the Police       Service             has    gone

some    way    to     establish a code of best practice                          (which has            focused

primarily       on    the    public       disorder         aspects),      safety matters                remain

largely       localised          in    concept       and    in   application.              The     Guide       to

Safety    at       Sports     Grounds      is merely         a guide       and        in    no     dimension

mandatory.           Many    "certifying"            authorities        have     just        one      club     to

consider       and    no     real      comparative         yardstick.          This    submission            has
                                                                      Document No.      3   CONT’D



several times raised the question of research and training but these

developments alone are not a guarantee of performance.                It is beyond

the immediate scope of this document to outline the actual structure

which would establish and empower such a body, but it is considered

that there      is a need for a Safety Inspectorate which would have a

wide if not national purview,           and would be both the repository of

knowledge and the purveyor of best practice on all matters affecting

ground     safety.    Such   a   body   may    need   to   be   multi-disciplinary

(involving      the   Police,    Fire   and    Ambulance   Services    as   well   as

structural engineers and a representative from football).                   It would

not   replace    the certification process but inspect and support its

affairs.

                               FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM
               POLICING FOOTBALL
               Introduction
1
J        1.1   This document has been compiled for the purpose of providing
               general advice to officers given the responsibility of arranging
-i             operational police planning for sporting occasions. The level
1              and degree of advance planning must necessarily depend to a large
               extent on the particular fixture and the amount of trouble that
               may reasonably be expected as a result of intelligence gathered
               by the police.
               Intelligence
         1.2   Intelligence concerning the likelihood of crowd disturbance or
     .         hooliganism occurring will necessarily be obtained from a variety
1
     f         of sources and should be interpreted through experience and
               common sense. It is recognised that the degree of advance
               planning for a particular game depends upon both the interest in
               the fixture and the amount of trouble anticipated, based upon
”]             intelligence available to the police. Aside from the importance
j              of the fixture in terms of league position or 'cup' prospects,
               football matches are often used by hooligans to celebrate
—i             previous encounters with particular sets of fans.          It is
 I             therefore particularly important to be aware of the history of
               that fixture.
         1.3   The prime source of football intelligence is the Police National
               Intelligence System which is based on the network of Police
               Liaison Officers (see paragraphs 2.1 to 2.11 et. seq.).
               Summaries completed by police officers of the home club Force are
               forwarded to the visiting club's liaison officer, making
               available intelligence about fans behaviour at both home and away
               fixtures. This information will be collated and made available
     ^         for future matches involving that club.
     y   1.4   The summary includes details of those arrested, charged or
               ejected and complaints of misbehaviour both inside and outside
               the ground, including public houses, railway/coach stations and
               other places where football supporters gather. This allows for
               regular offenders to be identified and targeted, resulting in a
               systematic build-up of intelligence. To ensure the maximum
               benefit of such intelligence it is essential that the match
               summary is completed accurately and comprehensively, and
               forwarded promptly to the Police Force concerned.
         1.5   Misbehaviour by football supporters whilst travelling on trains,
               London Underground, or ferries, or whilst on British Rail
               property is collated by British Transport Police as part of a
               national intelligence system operated by that Force. This
               information is available to Force liaison officers through their
               British Transport Police counterparts (see paragraphs 2.13 to
               2.20 et. seq.).
     I   1.6   Sources of intelligence may be summarised as follows:-

                                                                                       63
                                                        Document




       (a)     Match summaries compiled by the 'home' club will provide
                a record of the same fixture on previous occasions.
       (b)     Intelligence from the liaison officer associated with the
                visiting club.
       (c)     Analysis of C.C.T.V. coverage to identify group leaders
                and observe the 'tactics' of the hooligans.
       (d)     'Spotters' supplied by the police associated with the
                visiting club.
       (e)     The football clubs (home and away).
       (f)     Travel agents, coach operators, British Transport Police,
                supporters' clubs.
       (g)     The development of Intelligence will take Into account
                the history of the fixture, the anticipated size of the
                crowd, importance of result to either club, strengthof
                'away' following, absence of other games in the area,
               whether or not a 'derby' fixture, press coverage.
       Pre-Match Planning
1.7    Depending on the fixture football matches will involve the use of
       various branches of the Force (the mounted, traffic, special
       constabulary, etc.).      It is important that the officer
       responsible for policing the match determines the pre-match
       planning in the light of the intelligence at hand. In many cases
       an officer will be delegated the planning task and 1t is
       recommended that as a routine the planning officer, Intelligence
       officer and the officer in charge of policing the match conferto
       analyse 'Intelligence' and determine tactics.
       Use of 'Away' Officers (Spotters)
1.8    The use of 'spotters' from the Force area from which fans are
        travelling to 'away' games may be of benefit, but there are
        difficulties, particularly if the officers travel with the
        supporters. A distinction has to be drawn between, on the one
        hand, routine 'spotters' who seek to provide regular intelligence
        to the 'home' Force and, on the other, covert intelligence
        gathering.
1.9    In the former case it is recommended that arrangements be made
        beforehand with the 'home' police; that the officers do not
        travel with the visiting supporters as police officers; that they
        report to and liaise with the 'home' police to assist with
        Intelligence. Whenever possible their role should be solely to
        provide Intelligence and not to be directly Involved in the
        policing.
1.10   In the latter case (covert operations) it 1s important that a
       means of contact be established prior to the game and that the
        officers handling the communications, and the officer 1n charge
        of the game, know exactly what arrangements have been made.


                                                                            64

Briefing
Officers should receive a full briefing prior to taking up their
duties which should include after match arrangements and clear
instructions as to booking off. Where practicable such briefings
should be carried out on site. In large scale police operations
the operational commander should brief all officers not below the
rank of Inspector, and Inspectors should be responsible for
briefing officers of the rank of Sergeant and Constable.
In accordance with the 'Popplewell' recommendations the briefing
must include evacuation procedures and the duties and
responsibilities of stewards should be brought to the attention
of police officers (see Duties of Stewards - paragraph 3.1 et.
seq.).
Briefing cards may prove advantageous, particularly when officers
are unfamiliar with the routines of policing football. Where
officers are unfamiliar they should be provided with a map of the
ground and its immediate environs identifying 'home1 and 'away'
sections of the ground and the numbers or letters used by the
club, so that they can answer questions for supporters.
Briefing should pay particular attention to policy and practice
as to searching, arrest and ejection and officers must know where
to take prisoners. Intelligence as to likely offenders and
common practices of disturbance should be carefully outlined.
Supervisors in particular need to know the ground commanders
'public order strategy'.
Copies of evacuation procedures and any briefing cards or other
information passed out in documentary form during briefing should
be available within the 'police control'.
Ground regulations, which have national application, should be
brought to notice as follows:-
                         6R0UNP REGULATIONS

        with Ground Regulations and with the Rules and
        Regulations of The Football Association and The Football
        League or whose presence on the ground is or could
        reasonably be construed as constituting a source of
        danger, nuisance or annoyance to other spectators.
Away Supporters
Intelligence officers should provide clear Instructions to coach
operators as to routes and parking facilities. Car and coach
parks should be clearly signed and a police presence maintained
to ensure security and prevent Interference. The presence of
police at such locations may also enable the early gathering of
intelligence on the numbers and behaviour of v1siting supporters.
It may be prudent for police to escort supporters from coach
parks to the sports stadium 1n order to ensure that they do not
become the subject of, nor engage 1n, hooliganism. Similarly,
railway stations should be monitored by police and supporters
escorted to the stadium where the match 1s to be played. Close
liaison with British Transport Police 1s recommended. Most fans
are familiar with escort arrangements and where possible police
should stick to routines which become familiar.
After a match coaches leaving the area may require a police
escort until they are away from trouble.
Flashpoints
Special attention should be given to any public house or other
unofficial assembly point, and to the routes taken 1n general by
supporters where confrontation between rival fans may occur.
Also attention should be given to waste ground and derelict
property along any such routes where missiles or offensive
weapons may be gathered by hooligans. Bridges have often been
used by hooligans and should be monitored.
Stadim Searches
Before spectators are admitted Into the stadium a physical search
should be made of the ground and terraces by the officer 1n
charge of policing the game to ensure that all fences and gates
are sufficiently secure and that no objects which may be used as
offensive weapons or missiles are to hand. There should be an
arrangement with the club for an official to be available when
the inspection 1s carried out to put right anything which 1s
amiss.
Entry Into the Ground
Approaches to the ground are themselves flashpoints and need to
be well monitored. Careful planning to co-ordinate as far as
possible the routes taken by different groups of supporters to
relevant turnstiles may reduce the opportunity of conflict.
                                              Document No.   3   CONT’D



Clear marking of turnstiles is essential and all officers on
football duties should be briefed as to the segregation
arrangements.
The searching of spectators depends on circumstances. The terms
of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act afford a right of search
only where there are grounds to suspect an offence is being
committed, and the suspicion must relate directly to the person
searched. The Codes of Practice, however, exempt the need to
make customary records If in the circumstances It 1s not
practicable to do so. Ground regulations reserve the right of
the club to decline adnisslon to any person who refuses to be
searched by a police officer, and this may allow for routine
searching on entry to grounds, but police officers need to know
the limits of this provision. Refusal to be searched may entail
a refusal to allow entry.
Within the limitations officers should seek to prevent supporters
entering the ground with weapons, missiles, flag poles etc.
Drunkenness is recognised as a major cause of hooliganism and
supporters may attempt to enter sports grounds whilst In a
drunken condition or carrying alcohol. Where the conditions of
the Sporting Events' (Control of Alcohol Etc.) Act, 1985, apply
the provisions should be enforced. The main conditions are as
fol1ows:-
(a)     Section 2(1la) and (lb) - It Is an offence for any
        person to have intoxicating liquor or an 'article' to
        which this section applies in his possession during a
        designated event in the viewing area or while
        entering/trying to enter a ground during an event.
(b)     Section 2(2) - It Is an offence to be drunk In a ground
        during a designated event or while entering/trying to
        enter the ground.
'Article' means any article capable of causing injury to a person
struck by it being:-
(a)     a bottle, can or other portable container (Including such
        an article when crushed or broken) which
        (I)   is for holding any drink, and
        (II) is of a kind which, when empty, 1s normally
             discarded, or returned to, or left to be recovered
             by, the supplier, or
(b)    part of an article falling within (a) above.
It does not apply to anything that is for holding any medicinal
product (Medicines' Act, 1968).
The Public Order Act, 1986, makes it an offence to be 1n
possession of distress flares, fog signals, fireworks, pellets
and capsules intended to be used as fun»1gators or for testing
pipes at a football match. Contained within the same Act are the
offences of affray, violent disorder, disorderly conduct and
threatening behaviour.
Exclusion Orders
The Public Order Act, 1986, also gives the courts power to make
an exclusion order to prevent a person convicted of certain
offences attending a football match. The court can make an order
of conviction where
(a)    The person has been convicted of an offence which fulfils
       one or more of the following condltions:-
        (i)         The offence was committed during any period
                   relevant to a prescribed football match while the
                   accused was at, or entering or leaving or trying
                   to enter or leave, the ground concerned.
       (ii)         The offence was committed going to or    from a
                   match and:-
                   (1)      involved the use of threat of violence
                             by the accused to another person;
                   (2)      involved the use of threat of violence
                             towards property;
                   (3)      was committed under Section 5 of the
                             Act.
       (iii)       The offence was committed under Section 1(3) or 4
                   or 1A(3) or (4), Sporting Events' (Control of
                   Alcohol Etc.) Act, 1985. These are the offences
                   of possessing alcohol travelling to or from a
                   football match.
(b)     No exclusion order may be made unless the court is
        satisfied that making such an order In relation to the
        accused would help to prevent violence or disorder at or
        in connection with prescribed football matches.
(c)     An exclusion order may only be made in addition to a
        sentence, probation order or discharge, following
        conviction, i.e. It does not apply to person brought
        before the court to be bound over under Section 115,
        Magistrates' Court Act, 1980.
        If these conditions are satisfied, the court may make an
        order "prohibiting him from entering any premises for the
        purpose of attending any prescribed football match
        there."
A crucial factor in the enforcement of orders is the availability
of photographs of those subject to them. Section 35 of the Act,
makes provision for the court, on application of the prosecution,
toorder a photograph to be taken. However, where possible,
persons arrested for any offence which might result In the
imposition of an order should be photographed at the time of
                                             Document No,   3      CONT’D


charging. Photographs taken at this time are likely to be of
more value for subsequent identification purposes than those
taken at or following a court appearance.
Photographs which should conform to the following specifications
should be affixed to each police copy of an exclusion order
(a)    Standard passport size 2" x 2".
(b)    To be in colour.
(c)    To be in single aspect three quarterprofile orfull face.
(d)    Polaroid photographs are NOT recommended for thispurpose.
Photographs held for the purpose of enforcing exclusion orders
are for police officers only and must not be circulated to any
other person.
Wherever an order Is made, copies, together with photographs
should be forwarded to the Chief Officer of Police for the area
where the offender lives and to the Chief Officer of Police for
the area(s) in which any club he is known to support is situated.
It Is recommended that any photographic negative also be
forwarded to the latter.
Circulation of information relating to Exclusion Orders is
incorporated into the football match intelligence system.
Football Liaison Officers will maintain schedules, together with
photographs of those subject to orders who are known to support
their club. Prior to each match, complete schedules should be
forwarded to the away team liaison officer. Schedules should be
returned after each match, together with the completed football
match summary form.
These schedules and photographs will be of particular importance
to those officers operating C.C.T.V. equipment. When scanning
crowds during the course of the game or when viewing videos of
disorder after the event, operators will be able to check the
crowd against the photographs.
Where weight of numbers of those subject to orders makes the
supplying of full schedules impracticable, circulation should be
restricted to targetted hard core offenders.
Liaison officers will need to maintain several schedules of
orders to cater for midweek games, late returns, etc.,
Where an individual first came to notice after 31.12.80, as
indicated by his C.R.O. number, suffix Information relating to
exclusion orders will be maintained on the P.N.C. within the
subjects convictions file.
In certain circumstances, c"fences which might lead to the
Imposition of exclusion orders are not reportable to the N.I.B.
Therefore, where an Individual has no P.N.C. record, or first
came to notice prior to 1.1.81 or where there is any other reason
          to believe an individual is subject to an exclusion order, a
          check should be made with his home Force.
          N.B.   Where an order has been in force for a period of 12
                 months, application can be made to the court for the
                 termination of the order. Details of Termination Orders
                 will not be shown on the P.N.C.
Entrance to the Ground
1.40     Stadium entrances must be signed to Indicate clearly the stands
          and terraces to be used by home and visiting supporters.
1.41     Officers with local knowledge should be posted to turnstiles to
          prevent supporters entering a section of the stadium allocated to
          supporters of the opposing team.       When possible, the same
          officers should be regularly used at locations considered to be
          of particular importance, e.g. main entrance, points of potential
          trouble etc.
1.42     It Is emphasised that effective turnstile policing is the key to
          prevention of disorder inside the ground. Officers should be
          encouraged to talk to those waiting to enter In order to identify
          non-local accents, drunks, etc.
1.43     Queues forming at turnstiles should be closely monitored by
          police and stewards. It is recommended that mounted officers,
          where available, are used for this purpose. There Is often
          frustration at turnstiles If queues remain after the game has
          started. Orderly control will minimise the risks.
1.44     All ticket matches also need turnstile control as supporters in
          possession of tickets for a particular section of the ground may
          seek to gain entry to another section of the ground, which could
          result in some sections of the ground exceeding the limit
          specified In the safety certificate. Where limits are critical
          police should make arrangements to monitor turnstile counts.
1.45     High interest 'all ticket' fixtures have the effect of generating
          a black market in tickets and 'touting'. This will likely
          undermine segregation. It is therefore recommended that some
          section of the ground be set apart to accommodate Identified fans
          who support one side and have tickets for opposing supporters'
          area. If circumstances warrant it 'ticket touts' should be
          arrested, and efforts made to discover where the tickets came
          from. For all ticket games every effort must be made to tighten
          up the sales procedure to assist segregation policy, preferably
          by restricting sale of tickets to those attending home fixtures
          and selling tickets within the 'home! enclosures.
          T e w Managers, Referees and Llnesaen
1.46     All officials concerned In controlling the game should be aware
          of the police action that will be taken If there Is any Invasion
          of the playing pitch, or serious disorder occurring within the
          crowd. All officials concerned In controlling the game should be
          aware of any planned emergency procedure that may be taken In the
          event of an emergency or bomb threat.
The conduct of players on the field can have a marked impact on
crowd behaviour.     Particularly where the fixture is judged
volatile the club should be encouraged to arrange for players to
leave the tunnel together and to shake hands at the end of the
game. They may also be reminded of the importance of good
behaviour on the pitch. It rests with the match commander to
take up with the club any misbehaviour by players.
Entertainment
The club should be encouraged to provide some form of
entertainment to take place during the half hour preceding kick
off, for example bands, displays and recorded music. A good
'announcer' using the public address system can establish a
rapport with the crowd and influence behaviour. Thought should
be given to liaising with 'announcers! to make suitable
interventions if appropriate. This means may be used to advise
'away' supporters as to arrangements for their leaving the
ground, changed travel instructions etc.
Crowd Distributions
It is emphasised that stewards should ensure that all sections of
terraces and stands are filled to capacity before allowing access
to further sections where possible. This will require monitoring
turnstile totalisers and the use of public address systems in
some instances. This operation is greatly assisted by the
compartmentalisation of grounds, each compartment being filled in
sequence.
Segregation
Home and visiting supporters should be segregated inside the
stadium by means of segregation fencing and/or sterile zones, and
steps should be taken to impose segregation before they enter and
after they leave the stadium. Each section of the stadium
designated for the use of particular supporters should have its
own toilet and refreshment facilities. Barriers and doors should
be provided so as to segregate home and visiting supporters and
thus avoid confrontation at entrances/exits. Experience has
shown that policing segregated areas is best achieved by placing
officers 'inside' the segregation if this is possible.
Stewards
Good liaison between stewards and police should be established.
(See Duties of Stewards - paragraph 14.1 et. seq.) The officer
in charge of the match should make periodic inspections of
stewarding standards and report results to the club's management.
The police control must be able to contact the Chief Steward and
Head Fire Steward at all times.
Disposition of Manpower
Where no pitch perimeter fence exists a presence may be required
by police and stewards in order to Isolate the playing area. In
such circumstances police officers should take up standing
positions away from and facing the crowd when Incidents occur to
arouse the crowd. Where fencing has been erected police officers
and stewards must have keys for the gates and a universal locking
system should be used. Pitch perimeter gates should remain
unlocked and manned at all times the public have access to the
ground.
All bars, refreshment and toilet areas should be policed in order
to prevent hooliganism occurring.
At the conclusion of the match consideration should also be given
to deploying police in appropriate areas to minimise a sudden
stampede or pushing within the crowd in their endeavour to leave
the stadium quickly.
Police Reserves
A number of police officers should generally be held in reserve
in order to deal with spontaneous incidents occurring inside, or
immediately outside the stadium.
Persons Arrested or Ejected F m the Ground
Ejection is an option which can be used where behaviour is poor,
but falls short of an actual offence (e.g. contravention of
ground regulations). However, ejection should not be used as an
alternative to arrest; where there is sufficient evidence the
offender should be arrested and charged.
It is recommended, where possible, that in violent situations
police officers in groups should enter the affected section of
the stadium from above the Incident, making arrests where
necessary, and then making their way onto the perimeter of the
pitch. Officers should not enter from the perimeter if this can
be avoided. Arrest operations should be planned and controlled
to avoid officers being isolated or overwhelmed.
A standard procedure should be adopted with regard to arrests and
ejections. Prisoners should be taken to a forward reception
point where details are recorded (including ejections), and
prisoners photographed together with arresting officer.
Persons ejected from the ground or supporters who are not
admitted for whatever reason should be carefully policed.
Experience indicates that such persons often gain further entry
to the ground either at half time or Immediately before the end
of the match, and provoke confrontation.
In the event of a football match generating a large number of
arrests, it is worth considering bailing prisoners to special
courts in order that Magistrates may be fully aware of all the
circumstances appertaining to the events of that game. Early
liaison with the Crown Prosecution Service is advisable to inform
them of the Intention to hold special courts, in order that they
can be fully acquainted with the background facts.

       Contingency Planning
1.61   Pre-determined plans should be available to control such
       contingencies as serious disorder, pitch incursion and locked out
       spectators. Because of the great divergence in ground and crowd
       factors these plans must be ground specific. However, these
       plans must take into consideration the 'Popplewell'
       recommendations with regard to the transmission of coded messages
       over the public address system, the availability of emergency
       telephones and a facility for the police to intercept the public
       address system.
       Emergency Evacuation
1.62   Stewards must be familiar with the action to be taken in the
       event of an evacuation of the whole or part of the stadium.
       Police should assist in the rapid evacuation of a stadium in such
       circumstances. Stadia should have a universal locking system and
       all stewards should be in possession of keys for the exit gates.
       They should wear a distinctive tabard or other means of easy
       identification.     I t must   be made clear to both the club
       management and to the individual stewards that they must not
       leave their post without being relieved. It 1s essential that
       exit gates can be opened without delay in the event of an
       emergency. Simulated emergency evacuation exercises for the
       staff employed by the club must be held at least twice each
       season to test the emergency evacuation procedure. The crowd
       will not be involved but depending upon circumstances it could be
       an advantage to explain to the crowd that an emergency evacuation
       exercise is taking place. Experience has revealed that in an
       actual evacuation it is essential to monitor exit doors when the
       crowd has left the stadium to prevent them wandering back into
       the stadium before the reason for the evacuation has been
       completed.
       Retention of Visiting Supporters
1.63   In some circumstances the officer in charge may decide to hold
       the visiting supporters 1n the ground until he considers it
       appropriate to release them. If such a tactic is employed then
       the situation will be greatly eased 1f the v1siting fans are kept
       informed.
       Early Re-Deployment of Police Officers
1.64   Police officers should be deployed outside the ground, 1n key
       positions, early enough to be seen 1n these positions by the
       crowd as it leaves the ground. This gives an appearance of good
       order and police control. At critical points the use of police
       officers 1n groups under the command of a sergeant should be
       considered. The effective after-match deployment of police
       officers 1s dependent on the pre-match briefing and allocation of
       tasks.
       Vehicular and Pedestrian Traffic
1.65   At the end of the game early dispersal of supporters 1s clearly
       beneficial. Most Police Forces will develop a traffic control

                                                                        74
                                            Document No.   3   CONT’D


plan to facilitate this. Particular attention should be given to
routes used by 'away! supporters. Supporters who are not local
must always be able to find coaches where they got off them and
generally it is good practice to convoy and escort coaches away
from the general area. Many grounds are in heavily built-up
areas of old industrial towns and it is extremely difficult to
move police resources in the immediate aftermath - it is
therefore essential to detail traffic and public order duties
beforehand.
Bus, Railway and Main Line Stations
Foot patrol and mounted officers (in liaison with British
Transport Police) should be used to control queues and prevent
rowdyism occurring. Large groups of supporters should generally
be escorted on to the station and, where necessary, British
Transport Police may wish to consider travelling with supporters
until they are dispersed.
De-Briefing of Senior Officers
In the event of inadequacies being exposed 1n the police
operation, at the conclusion of the match there should be a
de-briefing of supervisory officers.

VISITING SUPPORTERS TRAVELLING BY COACH AND RAIL
COMMUNICATION OF INTELLIGENCE
The following information is set out for the particular advice of
Force (football) liaison officers and for those officers either
preparing or controlling police operational planning for
footbal1.
Since Force liaison officers were appointed for each club in the
football league in 1975, the procedure for gathering and
communicating intelligence about the numbers of visiting
supporters travelling by coach and rail has been developed and
refined. In the light of experience the following procedures are
recommended to Improve the quality and reliability of this
Intelligence:-
Actlon to be Taken by Hoae Liaison Officers
At least 21 days before the match the home team Force liaison
officer should correspond with his opposite number for the
visiting team giving information on the following Unes:-
(a)    Suggested routes for supporters travelling by road.
(b)    Off street parking facilities that will be available for
        coaches/cars near to the stadium.
(c)    Areas suitable for street parking near to the stadium.
(d)    Location of railway station and distance from trie ground,
        also arrangements for journeys from the station to the
        ground.
(e)    Advice to coach operators:-
       (i)    location of coach parking with route and plan;
       (ii)   arrive no earlier than one hour before scheduled
               kick off time;
       (Hi)   depart within half an hour of the final whistle;
      (iv)    do not stop      within    ten    miles   of    their
               destlnation;
      (v)     avoid stopping for refreshment at any place where
               intoxicating liquor is available.
(f)    Advice to visiting supporters:-
      (1)     plan of the ground and its environs showing
               visitors entrance and enclosures;
      (1i)    enter stadium only through designated visitors
               turnstiles;
                                            Document No.   3    CONT’D



       (iii)   supporters will not be allowed on to the ground
                carrying articles which could be construed as
                offensive weapons.
(g)    Obtain from British Transport Police:-
       (i)     number of trains carrying visiting supporters;
       (ii)    times of arrival and departures;
       (iii)   number of supporters expected on each train,
                details of the actual number to be confirmed on
                the day;
       (iv)    a breakdown of the number expected to travel by
               charter train, special train or scheduled
                services.
        NOTE: British Transport Police usually pass this
        information either by telephone or teleprinter two or
        three days before the game, and update as necessary.
Action to be Taken by 'Away Tea*! Liaison Officers
Liaison officers should establish and maintain close liaison with
the local supporters club and coach operators who carry football
supporters to away matches.
Forward to coach operators the information received from the home
club liaison officers about suggested routes, parking
arrangements, plan of the ground and environs, etc., requesting
details of the number of coaches and the approximate number of
supporters travelling to the away game.
Forward to the supporters club the information received from the
home club liaison officers requesting information about:-
(a)    the number of coaches and supporters travelling by road;
(b)    the number of supporters travelling by chartered or
        special trains.
Confirm with the British Transport Police the number of
supporters expected to travel by charter trains, special trains
or scheduled services.
Advise the home club liaison officer 1n writing of the
intelligence collated from the above sources, includlng:-
(a)    the name of the coach firms, the details of coaches and
        the approximate number of supporters;
(b)    any intelligence on the number of supporters travelling
        by traln;
(c)     information about the behaviour of the supporters at
        other away matches, and information as to the known
        'tactics' of troublemakers and if considered relevant
        details of likely offenders.
NOTE: The most accurate and up-to-date information may not be
available until the day before the game or even later and liaison
officers should contact their opposite number by telephone where
necessary.
Post Match De-Briefing on the Quality and Accuracy of the
Intelligence Provided
It is essential that home club liaison officers advise, as a
matter of course, their opposite number about the accuracy of
intelligence provided by way of the football match summary form
including:-
(a)    the estimated number of visiting supporters;
(b)    the estimated number who travelled by coach;
(c)    the estimated number who travelled by train;
(d)    details of any Incidents before, during or after        the
       match;
(e)    details of visiting supporters arrested/ejected;
(f)    registered numbers of any mini-buses (or transitvans)
       seen in the vicinity of the ground, in order that the
       names and addresses of the keepers or operators can be
       ascertained for future intelligence purposes.
The importance of the accurate completion and prompt return of
the football match summary forms is again stressed.
Consideration should also be given to the forwarding of C.C.T.V.
tapes containing intelligence about visiting supporters to the
Police Force concerned.
It is important that supervising officers encourage officers to
submit any relevant intelligence to Football Liaison Officers in
order to positively assist 1n the gathering of Intelligence.
Information to Police Force Through        Whose   Area   Visiting
Supporters are Expected to Travel
It may be necessary for information to be supplied to the Force
through whose area large numbers of supporters travel or on whose
area notorious 'crossroads' or 'watering holes' are situated.
This assumes a more urgent aspect if there has been trouble at
the ground; or if there is a history of violence between
supporters likely to meet en-route to their respective away
fixtures. Reports of such problems should be passed to the
football liaison officers of the clubs Involved by the Force in
whose area the incident occurred.

Travel by British Rail - Liaison with British Transport Police
British Transport Police policy is to segregate football
supporters from ordinary passengers as far as practicable. To
achieve this, pricing and other policies have been introduced in
an attempt to encourage supporters to travel in the following
order of preference
(a) Charter Trains or Carriages
These trains are iiot normally accompanied by British Transport
Police. The chartering club MUST arrange for Insurance and
stewards, and accept responsibility for any damage which may
occur on the train.
(b) British Rail Sponsored Trains
These are special trains used for the exclusive carriage of
football fans and which should always have a British Transport
Police escort.
(c) Schedule Services
Encouragement being given to organised party travel. Such trains
are policed on an as required' basis.

 DUTIES OF STEWARDS
The Effect of Safety Certificates Issued Under the Safety at
Sports Grounds Act, 1975
A level of control is provided by the Safety at Sports Grounds'
Act, 1975, at those grounds which are required to be certified.
The Local Authority, before issuing a Safety Certificate, is
required to consult the Chief Officer of Police regarding the
terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.
Whilst police do not directly control the employment of stewards
at football grounds, it should be accepted that there is a
responsibility, within the wider context of public safety, to
exert influence to ensure that the arrangements made by the
management of the ground are adequate in this respect. It is
most important that stewards are sufficient in number, suitably
deployed, well trained and capable mentally and physically of
carrying out their routine and emergency functions. It is
recommended that the police regularly inspect stewarding
arrangements to determine they are in accord with certification.
Identification and Supervision
Persons employed as stewards at football grounds should be
clearly identifiable, wearing coloured tabards. They should at
all times be under the direct control of supervisors whose
identities should be made known to the police officers on duty at
the ground and who should be in contact with the Police Control.
Stewards should be distributed throughout the ground in
accordance with a detailed pre-arranged schedule, agreed between
the police and management of the ground.
Their duties may be divided into four main categories:-
(a)     controlling or directing members of the public who are
        entering or leaving the football ground;
(b)    patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, e.g.
        raising alarms, extinguishing fire, etc.;
(c)    manning entrances, exits and other strategic points,
        particularly exit doors, and gates which are not
       continuously open whilst the ground is in use;
(d)    undertaking specific duties relating to emergency and
       evacuation procedures.
In accordance with the 'Popplewell' recommendations all stewards
should:-
(a)    be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency
       relating to fire or evacuation;
(b)    be given written instructions about the action to be
       taken in cases of emergency;
 (c)     receive practical instruction and training appropriate to
         their responsibility;
 (d)     not be employed as a steward unless they have been so
         instructed and trained;
 (e)     be adequate in number, physically and mentally capable of
         performing their duties,         effectively deployed,
         effectively supervised and readily identifiable.
 Emergency Procedures - Stewards Role
Formal emergency procedures at each ground require joint
consultation between police, the management of the ground, fire,
ambulance and other services.
It is essential that stewards and their supervisors are fully
aware of the part they have toplay in the plans which are
produced. The management of the ground should ensure that
written instructions concerning the action to be taken in the
event of an emergency are made readily available to all staff and
stewards and, in particular, thatall the staff and stewards
should receive practical instruction and training appropriate to
their responsibilities in the event of an emergency. Exercises
for the staff and stewards should be carried out regularly to
ensure the smooth operation of the procedure for dealing with an
emergency.
A record should be kept by the club authorities containing
details of the training and instruction given and the exercises
held, and should include the following matters
(a)    date and time of the instruction or exercise;
(b)    duration;
(c)    name of the person giving the instructions;
(d)    names of the persons receiving the instructions;
(e)    nature of instruction or exercise.
Consideration should be given to the inclusion of these
conditions in any safety, or special safety certificate.
After initial practical instruction all members of staff and
stewards should receive verbal instruction, given by a competent
person, at least once in every period of three months at regular
intervals. Stewards should be given briefing cards relevant to
particular points.

 POLICING FACILITIES AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS
 There are marked differences in the facilities provided by clubs
 and it must remain a matter for local negotiation between police
 and clubs as to the standard of facilities, bearing in mind
 average attendance and a need for police presence.          It is
 recommended that General Safety Certificates are reviewed on an
 annual basis in an effort to achieve continuing improvement.
 Prisoner Reception Point Mithln the Ground
It is considered essential that a prisoner reception point should
be available at the ground. The office should be sited, if
possible, so that there is adequate access for the unobtrusive
removal of prisoners. There should be either a G.P.O. telephone
line or a direct line to the nearest police station. Ideally the
police accommodation should have two detention rooms to separate
 home and away supporters.
Parading and Briefing
It is desirable that police officers to be deployed in the ground
are briefed on site. This can usually be done under cover in
most grounds. A standardised form of stadium grid reference used
by police and club personnel will facilitate briefing and
evacuation.
Control Rooa
It is desirable, and in some cases essential, that a control room
is provided to oversee police operations in the ground.
Provision should be made for a base station to control the U.H.F.
police radio. It should have a direct access to the ground
public address system and either a G.P.O. or direct telephone
line to the local police station, and the police office within
the ground. ^The room should be of adequate size to accommodate
C.C.T.V. monitors and ancillary equipment. It is desirable to be
able to operate, in addition, high intensity lighting systems
from the police control which may be switched on when there Is
trouble or emergency.
The control room should be sited to give an over view of the
ground and to allow the match police commander ready access from
the touch line'.
The costs of the provision of the police office and control room
and facilities should be borne by the club. The police generally
provide radio communication and additional items such as loud
haliers and binoculars.
Safety at Sports Grounds' Act, 1975, by providing for
consultation between the local authority and police (Section
3(iii)) on conditions to be Included on safety certificates has
had a clear effect on Improving ground facilities. Full use
should be made of these provisions to ensure adequate police
facilities.
C.C.T.V. AND STILL PHOTOGRAPHY

The guidance offered in this section is intended to assist
Commanders having operational responsibility for policing
football. It is not a definitive work and should be read in
conjunction with the report of the A.C.P.O. Working Party,
entitled, Use of Video and Still Photography.
Introduction
The use of C.C.T.V. and still photography as an aid to the
effective policing of football is a recent development. At the
present time, all First and Second Division football grounds are
provided with static video cameras and recording facilities,
which enable the police to monitor crowd behaviour within and in
the immediate vicinity of stadia.        It is anticipated that
videoing facilities will be extended to all Third and Fourth
Divsion grounds in the near future but not necessarily of the
same type as in the two higher Divisions.
The quality of the equipment and re-production of image presently
available in football grounds is now always compatible with its
adequate presentation before the courts, and its use has resulted
in some confusion between its function in relation to 'command
and control and to evidence gathering. Exoerlence to date
indicates the greatest value lies in developing'a system for the
use of C.C.T.V. and still photography within stadia for the
purposes of intelligence and evidence gathering.
All systems at present in use at football grounds are capable of
being enhanced and developed. When these changes are made it
should be ensured that the replacement equipment is of sufficient
standard that the quality of recording is such as to be
acceptable for use as evidence in court.
Accepting the need for identification and evidence gathering for
prosecution to be the primary function of the system, the
following points are worthy of consideration in the use of
development of existing and anticipated facilities.
Technical Considerations
(a)   At the time of installation, consideration should be given
      to the siting of cameras and cables so as to prevent
      interference or damage.
(b)   As good video recording requires gocd light and as most
      football fixtures are played during winter months, the
      need for adequate lighting within and around football
      stadia Is essential to eliminate areas of darkness which
      may be used as cover for disorderly behaviour. Fans are
      increasingly aware that such behaviour is monitored by
      C.C.T.V. and they will attempt to evade detection by
      seeking whatever cover is available. It is therefore
      important tha' cameras are sited in such a way as to
      minimise blind spots and that facilities are provided to
      increase lighting Intensities in stands, etc. The siting
      of video cameras should take account of sloping roofs, to
                    enable recording at the rear of stands. This Droblem can

                 often vulnerable. Consideration should be given to takina
                 protective measures to increase security.

                distracted by activities within the ground.

               their actions in dealing with disorderly behaviour within
               the stadium will also be recorded on C.C.T.V.
       (b)     Consideration should be given to the preparation of a
               ground specific video, to be used in briefing officers who
               may not be familiar with the stadium.
       (c)     It Is important whenever possible to use the same
               personnel in police ground control room operations. They

incidents concerned to establish (1) the evidence for
their arrest and (2) whether the offender has committed
any further acts not witnessed by the arresting officer.
Intelligence Gathering
Away fans arriving at grounds may be videoed as they come
through turnstiles, get off buses or leave railway
stations. This helps with identification and the tracing
of those responsible for causing trouble. It also makes
the fans aware that they are on record.
When grounds are full, the crowd may be filmed all round,
so that if trouble starts, identification will be
assisted. It will also make the crowd aware that they are
on record. To assist this procedure, it is always useful
to have identification marks around the ground so that the
fans' location within the stadium can be pin-pointed with
accuracy.
Some clubs have followings from areas of the country many
miles from their home base.       Therefore, when It is
necessary to Identify persons from the crowd, photographs
and video recordings should be circulated to Forces who
have supporters! clubs of that particular football club In
their area.
Each Force should compile sets of photographs and/or
videos of Its own clubs hooligans and either li) forward
on such compilation to each Force that is likely to host
the club during the forthcoming season, or (11) one such
compilation be taken to each away game by officers
travelling with the club's supporters.
Each host Force should supply the visiting team's home
Force with photographs and video recordings of the
visiting team s supporters, If their conduct is such as to
warrant this. This will keep Forces aware of how their
own club's supporters behave away from home.
Some clubs have a section of supporters who are notorious
for hooligan behaviour.      It would assist In future
investigations into serious disorder at other grounds if
the host Forces of these clubs prepared video recordings
and photographs of their hooligan element and established
the identity of those involved. Then by comparing this
recording and the photographs with those of the incident
under investigation, identification should be greatly
assisted.
Known hooligans should be targetted and followed In video.
This requires local officers operating the video who can
be assisted by officers from the visiting team's home
Force.
Identified fans displaying consistently aggressive
behaviour, not amounting to a chargeable offence on a
single occasion, but who can be Identified on other video

        (ii) Known hoiligan gang strategies including methods of ambush, weapons
             used, methods of secreting prohibited articles.

       (ill) A public 'phone-in' facility for citizens having information for the

                   (iv) To receive local intelligence reports.

                    (v) Liaision with National Membership Schema.

                        In light of the provisions of the Data Protection Act, it would be
                        advisable if a condition of membership of the scheme was agreement that
                        the members' details would be made available on request by Police for
                        the purposes of crime prevention or the investigation of crime.

        It is proposed that the Police staff be seconded from their home Forces to the Hnma
        Office for duty in the N.F.I.U.

        A provisional structure might be as follows:
        Superintendent
               Officer in Charge of the Unit. In the early years of this Unit he will be
               responsible far ensuring that the Unit is sourxHy structured ana financed. He
J              will have an important role visiting and liaising with other Police Fbrces to
               establish a national football intelligence network.

                 It may be possible eventually far this post to be shared part time with other
                 Home Office funded posts based at New Scotland Yard.

        It is essential that nationally recognised and standardised fonnats are adopted far
        the recording of all information and intelligence of interest to the N.F.I.U.

       This will enable the local Farce football intelligence systems to mirror the national
       requirement and allow far efficient information exchange.

       The systems adopted should also be such that they may be readily transposed onto
       computer, since it is clear that computerisation of the information will greatly
               the evaluative process.
        Die manual documentation system will require seme wider consultation before agreement
        to ensure that indices are complementary and meet the necessary requirements.

        A decision to pursue this course would undoubtedly speed the process of
        implementation.
        At a local Force level, it is unlikely that computerised intelligence systems would
      — be necessary, except in the case of those Forces responsible far a large number of
      *^football clubs.

        Enquiry will need to be      with the Metropolitan Police regarding reimbursement far
        the use of the facility but any such cost would be oily a fraction of that incurred
        through purchase of a new system.
        In      H m to the computer, the provision of a FAX facility would clearly be
                    far the accurate and quick transmission of information. It is
        particularly valuable in relation to receipt of information fran abroad where
        langiiayx difficulties can create opportunity far mistakes and misinterpretation.

PROPOSALS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION/PROSECUTION
   OF HOOLIGAN GANGS AND THE RAISING OF
BEHAVIOURAL THRESHOLDS AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS
                                                          Document No. 3




INTRODUCTION


           The end of season play-offs and more starkly the gross
misconduct of English so-called football fans in Europe, have once again
thrust "football hooliganism" centre stage. Whilst media coverage no doubt
plays a part in adrenal1sing the hooligans it is nonetheless unmistakeable
that regardless of police endeavour and the range of initiatives from
Government and the football institutions, the ranks of the sport's
miscreants remain undiminished and their brazen aggression undaunted.


          It is true that the game itself has heavy responsibilities and
must do more to close its doors to undesirables. Much has yet to be
discussed and tested to examine     vtys   to make exclusion (of either
hooligans in particular or      ‘away   support' in general) effective.
Certainly the problems are      considerable; how do the administrators
determine genuine idientity?; does any scheme for exclusion begin by
including and authenticating exactly all those who eventually should be
excluded; how is identity     determined at the turnstiles where many
thousands will crush to gain admission, at say up to 90 gatew**ys? what is
to be the ruling on multiple membership?, what about 'derby games' and
will segregation be affected? These are just a few of the many questions
to be answered.   Certainly the attempts to legislate for exclusion to
date, the exclusion orders under Section 30, Public Order Act, 1986, have
proved a dismal failure. Courts have sometimes been reluctant to Impose
bans and, where they have, the bans have been of so short aduration as to
make them irrelevant. This is an issue which clearly needs addressing - a
complex legal power, on the face of it the utmost legal sanction against
the football hooligan, that in some cases for example results In banning
him from games for three months from the last game of the season (there
                                                           Document No.      3




are several examples) is little short of laughable.


           Aside from these issues it is also clear that hooliganism in
football is not as separable and distinct as is so often made out.
Aggressive masculinity, if not channelled elsewhere, is regrettably more
evident as criminal rowdyism and assault in our daily lives than certainly
it ought to be. Whatever the reasons, Ill-mannered, aggressive, violent
group behaviour, wholly outside the expectations of reasonable people is
now commonplace. Football is not the only stage, albeit one of the most
convenient, for this kind of disorder. There is it seems a common dynamic
which policeman have recognised for a long time and which it seems the
rest of society is coming to realise - simply the desire for violence and
an unbridled contempt for decent standards and law enforcement.


           Consequently a specific strategy against football hooliganism,
whilst wholly appropriate, is not sufficient. To the general public this
tide of eruptive street mauling is far more alarming and destructive of a
sense of well-being than minor property crime. When and wherever It occurs
it has to be recognised as a priority by Police and Courts alike.
Ironically disorder as such does not register in national crime statistics
and traditionally, perhaps because of the way evidence has been presented
(it is notoriously difficult in verbal testimony to recreate the
circumstances of disorder), the courts have all too often dealt with the
violent and the troublesome with leniency, seemingly content that the
trouble is past.


           Recent events in Germany have illustrated to both public and
indeed the affrayers themselves the sheer extent of disruption of which
they are capable.    What is particularly ominous is the concerted and
                                                           Document No.    3         CONT’D




planned nature of their debauch. Trouble          is neither spontaneous       nor
sporadic, it is organised and defiant.


           Whatever longer term measures in respect of the regulation of
football become appropriate (and of course they are under active
consideration) a strategy of law enforcement which gives a real sense of
priority has got to be professionally determined and resolved upon. It is
surely timely to question whether, with all the considerable resources we
already deploy, we cannot make them more directly effective so thatthose
who challenge the rule of law can state their case       in thecourts.


PROGRESS TO DATE


           During the last three years, the ACPO Sub-Comnlttee on
Hooliganism in Sport has developed a comprehensive guidance document on
the policing of football; CCTV systems have been introduced universally;
a national intelligence system has been developed; conferences are now
organised annually for Match Commanders and their Intelligence officers;
liaison with the F.A., the League, Government departments, the Traffic
Commissioners, and other agencies Is now well structured. A great deal of
co-ordination and co-operation has been achieved but to be critical, in
two areas at least, we have not achieved as much as may be possible. CCTV
systems were introduced with necessary haste and we have paid the price.
Generally they are not technically capable of effective evidence gathering
and in most cases the operators are untrained in technique and their
efforts unco-ordinated.   Intelligence gathering, whilst now standard in
form, provides an excellent match information system, as to travelling,
numbers, mode of transport, train times, coach operators and so on. It
does not provide much by way of "Intel!Igence".
            There are probably two possible overall strategies for dealing
 with football hooliganism which in a sense are complementary. The first
 is 'containment' and the second 'exclusion'. The idea of containment is
 preventive and pre-emptive.     It is largely embodied in the document
 referred to above and entails the supervision of crowds at every turn,
 from their point of departure, through the transit system, to the match
 and on to their return. It involves active police supervision, segregation
 of opposing fans and absolute control at football grounds. It Is fair to
 say that we have largely achieved this although inevitably on occasions
 the line is breached.   Exclusion involves either regulatory methods of
dissuading travelling support and keeping malefactors out of football
grounds, or the active prosecution of criminal behaviour to the extent
that it is brought under reasonable control. Regulatory methods remain
something of an enigma and may at best be only part of the answer.
Assertive enforcment is an option which we have begun to explore by way of
covert operations but is capable of considerable extension in a variety of
tactical responses.


           In short we have achieved containment, itself a considerable
feat, but the cost is a regular and massive police presence to keep the
still overtly belligerent mobs in check.     Current understanding of the
deliberate and criminal aspects of hooliganism suggests that we can do
much more to target hooligan gangs and enforce the law against them.

BEHAVIOURAL THRESHOLDS


          Paradoxically, because they are protected by the Police, one of
the consequences of containment is that rival groups tend to be corralled
together so that they can demonstrate their allegience and aggression
towards each other without restraint. Equally and regrettably we have come
to accept and condone very low standards of behaviour particularly in the
obscene chantings and ritual taunting of hooligan groups.


           Also, whilst it is often argued that since the Introduction of
CCTV most of the violence is outside the ground, the trouble which occurs
in the transport system or City Centres often stems directly from the
allegience demonstrated on the terraces.


           Aside from the issue of targetting hooligan groups there is a
need to raise the thresholds of acceptable behaviour at football grounds
in general terms. We cannot expect anything other than trouble If
contained supporters are allowed to scream hostilities at each other week
in and week out with impugnlty.


INTELLIGENCE


           As we have said there is a distinction between 'match
information' and 'intelligence'.   The match information system is based
upon local Football Liaison officers who have a responsibility for
individual clubs. Match reports on every game are retained locally and
circulated to the away Force, who in turn build up a record of their
club's supporters away from home. Football Liaison Officers are able to
forecast fairly accurately general match information as to crowd numbers,
modes of travel and the general demeanour of fans and so on.
Intelligence, more particularly, may be defined as the Identification of
football hooligans, their associations and strategies and knowledge of
their immediate plans.
              At the present time the existing Football Liaison Officers are
neither equipped nor trained to develop this latter kind of intelligence
to any significant degree.       Put in stark terms, and despite the great
number of police officers regularly deployed to football grounds, we have
to ask the following questions.:


           Are the vociferous groups readily identifiable on the terraces
regularly made up of the same people?


              Do they assemble in the same place each week?


              Do we know their identities?


              Do we routinely identify their presence and movements?


              Are they involved in trouble at away games together?


              Where else do they associate and what else are they involved in
as a group?


           Are they the same people who for example waylay other fans
outsideCity Centre Stations later in the night?


              In most cases, the answer to all these questions Is that we
simply do not know.Ironically, on the basis of the kind of Intelligence
which has come from                     all over the country, It is clear
that almost certainly organised gangs assemble routinely to cany forward
their own strategy for riot and disorder.
             Undoubtedly effective policing depends on intelligence and
there is a strong case for the appointment of Intelligence officers
complementing the Football Liaison officers scheme (for smaller 'Clubs' it
may of course be the same person as the Football Liaison Officer), who
should be trained in 'Anacapa' techniques.         Their role should be to
develop a portfolio of known hooligans and gangs, and to co-ordinate
operational activities so as to enhance Intelligence gathering.




              observation by "spotters"; questioning of arrested persons;
analysis of CCTV recordings; enquiries pursuant of targetting and arrest
and so on.     Once a genuine intelligence operation is in place with the
support and commitment of senior management, the means of intelligence
gathering are capable of definite elaboration.


A STRATEGY FOR INTELLIGENCE AMD CCTV


             The potential for gathering evidence and intelligence by
optical means is enormous and largely untapped.      During the last twelve
months, under the auspices of ACPO, we have developed a training course
for operations which is now nationally available. Whilst training in
technique is vital, it is however not sufficient. Match Commanders need
to develop a complete strategy with a suggested three objectives in mind:


(1)          the development of intelligence about home and aw^y groups;
            ^ targetting of known hooligan gangs and the development of
 evidence against them;


 (iii)      the general raising of behavioural thresholds by assertive
 enforcement against unacceptable behaviour.


           A comprehensive strategy would involve the following stages.


^               appointment of an Intelligence Officer rsponsible for
directing the optical evidence gathering team and co-ordinating
intelligence matters.


(b)        On match days, the appointment of a “Director" to be
responsible for the optical evidence gathering team and specifically
directing them when and where to film.


           The development and enhancement of equipment for optical
evidence gathering. Existing fixed CCTV systems need to be brought up to
their original specifications and the far more effective portable systems
used in support. Likewise, still photography should also be considered as
complementary to other systems.    (Conscious of the deficiences in the
existing CCTV systems, a Technical Coranittee by ACPO has been set up to
advise on all future expenditure of monies from the Football Trust and a
member of SRDB has been made available for twelve months to act as an
advisor to the Committee and to Forces on their existing installations).


(d)        An arrest strategy needs to bt determined and designated arrest
teams deployed if appropriate. For example, if a dozen youths are filmed
chanting obscenely for long periods and perhaps at several games, they
should be identified to the arrest team and there should be a plan to
apprehend them by say 'filter cordon' at the end of the game.


(e)        The Intelligence Officer should routinely scrutinise all video
and film records after the game, regardless of the outcome, and if
necessary develop follow-up enquiries.


           A follow-up enquiry team to identify target hooligans and
collate additional information should be part of the strategy.


           The training courses held to date have been evaluated and
re-designed, and the 6.M.P. have taken on the responsibility of making
places available for both operators and intelligence officers throughout
England and Wales. This is likely to be an ongoing coonitment.

           DEVELOPMENT IM CCTV


(a)        BACKGROUND


           The Football Trust is a non-profit making organisation which is
represented by Trustees from all areas of football as well as from the
Police, local Government and the Football Pools companies. The Trust is
totally financed by annual contributions from the Pools companies.


           In 1981 the Trust funded the purchase and installation of the
first purpose-built (football) closed circuit television system(CCTV) at
the ground of Aston Villa F.C. in Birmingham.


           The success of that system prompted CCTV pilot schemes at
 football grounds in Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh.


            Following these pilot schemes the Trust undertook a programme
which was ultimately aimed at installing CCTV systems at every Football
League ground in England and Scotland.


           To date the Football Trust has comnitted two million pounds to
that programme. CCTV systems are now in operation at every ground in the
leading two divisions of the Football League and in the Scottish Premier
Division. Progress is being made in the remaining divisions where 81
systems are now operating.


(b)        PROBLEMS


           Unfortunately these systems were introduced before any
effective evaluation could be undertaken, largely because of the priority
which government afforded the subject of football hooliganism.              Some
experience was at hand based on the prototype schemes in Birmingham,
Manchester and Edinburgh, and after consultation, a paper offering general
advice as to the requirement was circulatdd. SRDB did liaise with mentors
of the ACPO Sub-Committee, but at that time they were not prepared to
endorse anything other than monochrome systems.       The Service wanted
colour.


           Based upon the views of match commanders obtained at the
national annual conferences, organised by ACPO, the observatons of the
many officers who have been through the training courses and evaluation by
the members of the ACPO Working Party on CCTV and still   pho tog rap hy,   the
following deficiencies are general across all systems:-
                                                               Document No.   3     CONT
                                                                                           3




       (a)          The requirement was never fully laid down and was usually
      ambiguous.      No clear distinction was made between the "evidence and
      intelligence gathering role" on the one hand and the "command and control"
      function on the other.

■"5
J     (b)          The configuration of existing systems reflects this ambiguity.
i     The compromise usually entails that neither function is adequately
■J
      fulfilled.


      (c)        The evidence and intelligence gathering role should have clear
      priority whereas it is often secondary.


      (d)             technical efficiency of the systems, particularly in
      relation to the effectiveness of remote control systems is poor.


      (e)          Almost the entire investment is in fixed CCTV systems whereas
      current information suggests that complementary CCTV/portable TV. still
      photography systems are likely to be the most effective.


      (f)       Aside from those who have benefitted from experimental training
      courses conducted by the G.M.P. for Forces in the North of England, few
      operators have received much training of a technical nature or, more
      importantly, in technique.


      (g)          Few Forces have evolved any strategy in relation to the
      development of intelligence or arrests, or in the post-match analysis of
      films and the potential of the system remains unrealised.


                                                                                     114
It is a sobering thought, that despite the injection of two million pounds
by the Football Trust into CCTV systems throughout the Football League
little has been achieved. As indicated fundamental errors have been made
either in the equipment purchased, its sighting, its maintenance, its
operational use, the role that was being required of the equipment or a
combination of several or all of these problem areas.


           It has been argued that the very existence of CCTV systems in
grounds provides a deterrent effect to hooliganism. Whilst true that
effect is only likely to continue if positive results are seen to come
from the use of these systems. If the equipment is not used, or is
operationally ineffective its limitations will eventually become known and
the preventive aspect will quickly fade.


(c)        TECHNICAL COHHTTEE


           As a result of the above problems, the Football Trust has
established a Technical Committee to advise it on the technical and
operational aspects of all applications for new systems and the
enhancement of existing systems.


           It is anticipated that the Technical Comnittee will meet to
examine a number of applications at a time and may well be able to resolve
some applications on this basis.   In other cases, it would be beneficial
for ground visits to be made to give advice and to evaluate the
performance of contractors. Ideally, these visits should include someone
with the expertise o^


                        rom the S.R.D.B. has played a significant role in
 reviewing the existing CCTV systems installed in football grounds, and has
 been instrumental in determining the most appropriate options and
possibilities for the future. Because of his considerable investment in
this programme he now has a complete knolwedge of practical police
requirements.    It is largely because of his insistence upon examining
alternative systems that we are now recommending much greater use of
portable cameras as the primary evidence gathering source.


           The new procedure also offers a system of accountability which
is currently lacking.


           This revised procedure has been endorsed by both the Football
Trust and the ACPO Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events and
Chief Constables are to be asked to nominate a liaison officer.

           FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.


           As to the future, the most demanding issue is the sheer growth
which can be anticipated in the use of all kinds of photographic means for
intelligence and evidence gathering.


           Aside from the substantial football progranme there is now a
major extension of photographic usage in situations of public disorder.
Equally, in policing major demonstrations and confrontations, and in
surveilling areas of high crime there is a marked uptake. Experience In
the courts has been dramatically positive. Confronted with this kind of
evidence defendants have been far more likely to plead   g u ilt y ;   far more
likely to be convicted and far more likely to be sufficiently sentenced.
             With       all     these    things        in mind,       the ACPO Sub-Committee on

Hooliganism         at        Sporting       Events      extended       its    work       in    football

videoing      and        a    Working       Party      was   set up       to examine       the legal,

technical,        professional and practical                    issues and      to develop codes

of best practice               and advice        on usage.         This     report    is now almost

complete      and recommends a wide                    and general usage of photographic

means in all aspects of police work.




             It    seems       inevitable that ever greater demands will be made

to evaluate new equipment and examine or modify kit for specialist

purposes.               This     is   particularly so as the state of the art is

changing,     such that           there is now much greater versatility both in

terms of equipment and techniques.



PRIORITY




             On     a    weekly       basis      for    most    of     the year,      thousands of

policemen     perform sometimes hazardous duty                         throughout England and

Wales.       Only some 30% of the cost of police manpower is recoverable

and the real burden in terms of lost opportunity for other kinds

of policing is immense.                 The Service has achieved an enormous amount

and     in   most       cases     successfully          contains       these    public         sporting

occasions,        but    it has       to be      said that almost always there remains

a sinister potential for savage crowd violence.                                 A great deal is

being    done       to        develop       intelligence        and    attack    the      organising

elements,     but        we    can    never      be     satisfied      so    long    as    routinely

offensive     and        belligerent         behaviour         on the terraces         is manifest

and blatent.            The effective use of CCTV taken far beyond what we

have achieved           to date,        allows    for the possibility of the conduct

being    eliminated.            For these reasons,              support in all respects for

the   programme          deserves       a    high      priority.        If, admittedly over a

period of some years, a sea-change can be
                                                               J Document   No. 3        CONT’D



        effected in crowd behaviour the savings for the Police Service would be
        enormous.     If we do not make full use of this oppotunity it is likely we
        will spend the next decade assembling ever larger numbers of men to stand
        on guard between an assembly of troublesome hordes.

        CONCLUSIONS

        these issues. Such equipment is capable of producing compelling evidence
        in the Courts and it will be the life blood of most intelligence
        operations. Targetting the hard core gangs has got to be central to our
        purposes. Equally, effective use of CCTV offers the means to do something
        about general thresholds of behaviour and enforce better standards on the
        terracing.


                    Containment is preventive but costly.        At the worst It
        maintains the peace whilst paradoxically providing the   very   environment In
        which hooligan gangs prosper. We are dealing with organised criminality
        which is ongoing, not single events, albeit of unpleasant frequency and a
        real strategy of enforcement, based on Intelligence and backed by the
        professional use of technical evidence gathering means, is the logical
        next step.

                                                                                          1 1 8

Safety Evacuation

The need for the annual Inspection of grounds covered by safety certificates
had been strongly recommended by the Sub-Committee, this had been endorsed by
Mr. Justice Popplewell in his final report. There was also a need for an
"expert" in each force who was fully aware of the provisions of the Home
Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds,(Green Guide) to advise during the
certification process. Mr. Phillips strongly recommended animal inspection
both as to grounds and stewarding.

Blackburn

Gates have fallen considerably. Early arrivals had caused some difficulties
but the main problem encountered had been with the all ticket rule for Leeds.
It had been necessary to allow entry to ground to 350 unticketed fans at
selected turnstiles.

Mr. Phillips said that the difficulties had been previously identified by
Sub-Committee and it was hoped that the message had now got through that all
ticket matches were only practicable where capacity crowds were anticipated.
Brighton

Questions were asked about the policy of full pitch perimeter fencing.
Mr. Phillips summarised the ACPO view and pointed out where there was good
crowd behaviour perimeter fencing was not mandatory.

Crystal Palace

Ground sharing meant a minimum of 50 matches per season at the club doubled
the commitment of local Police. An encouraging factor was that club favours
were beginning to be worn again.      Derby matches where there was ground
sharing were particularly difficult as each set of supporters considered
themselves to be at home.        There were also stewarding problems and
conflicting arrangements between the Clubs.

most circumstances the police would take control. Mr. Phillips referred the
meeting to the Green Guide Code and evacuation plans and the standard message
for evacuation at sporting events.

              fan behaviour.   However, it was generally agreed that pitch
              invasions should be stopped as they have the potential to
              degenerate to major disorder.

              Evacuation - evacuation exercises were practiced at some
              grounds (Manchester United, Everton, Liverpool) where public
              announcements are made, emergency bells checked and all
              evacuation doors opened and checked by police. This does not
              involve the actual evacuation of the ground, but tests the
              mechanical parts of the system. At most grounds certain police
              officers are issued with universal lock keys.         Leicester
              reported on the electrically operated exit gate system and
              exercises which are practiced there with the fire and ambulance
              services to test call-out times.

      k)      Miscellaneous - many representatives reported pressure from
              clubs to reduce manpower levels. Mr. Phillips pointed out that
              it was a condition of the General Safety Certificate that the
              responsibility to decide on manpower levels was the Chief
              Constable's.

              At one club (Arsenal) ticket sales were allowed immediately
              after a game, this was not recommended as both sets of fans
              mingled whilst trying to purchase these tickets with obvious
              disorder potential.

Safety of Sports Grounds

Mr. Phillips stated that ground commanders should inspect details of the
certificate annually and submit recommendations for work perhaps to be
carried out incrementally so that it doesn't overawe the club.    Safety
requirements varied in accordance with changing patterns of use.

Chief Superintendent Bruce, (Cleveland) stated that they had prepared a
maintenance and good practice schedule which he was willing to supply to
other forces. The meeting approved of the booklet and found it to be a
useful reference.

Closure of Public Houses

It was suggested that where troubleis anticipated at certain venues,
consideration should be given to liaising with breweries upon the closure of
public houses in the immediate vicinity of football grounds.       Licensing
magistrates in York had at the request of the police ordered the closure of
certain public houses where trouble had ensued in the past.

14.   Bans Imposed by the Football Association    League

      Chief Superintendent Stainton (Cumbria) posed the difficulties in
      policing football grounds and fixtures which involve a visiting club
      whose supporters have been banned and arrive on mass. In order to
                                                               Document




           maintain ACPO'S policy of keeping out banned visiting supporters, the
           cost of police resources were high. The repercussions from setting up
           road blocks and keeping out banned spectators upon unsuspecting
           neighbouring police areas, together with allowing the spectators into
           the ground were discussed at length. It was acknowledged there was no
           easy solution to this problem but unless excluded supporters were
           confronted they would continue to travel. It was necessary to have a
           plan to deter and contain them.

1    15-   All Ticket Fixtures Imposed by FA/League
i
           Chief Inspector Richardson (Durham) related experiences of difficulty
           in policing football matches that had been declared ’all ticket* by the
           FA/League without consulting the relevant police force as to whether
           such a restriction could be enforced successfully. Small clubs do not
           apply these restrictions rigidly because of their financial position.
           Therefore he requested that ACPO consult with the authorities on
           subject.

         NOTE OF THE MEETING OF THE FIRST DIVISION FOOTBALL LEAGUE
   POLICE COMMANDERS AND LIAISON OFFICERS HELD AT TALLY HO, BIRMINGHAM,
                        ON TUESDAY 17th JUNE 1986.


      The meeting was chaired by K.Evans Esq., Assistant Chief Constable,
West Midlands Police, J.D.Phlllips Esq., Assistant Chief Constable,
Greater Manchester Police, acted as Secretary.
      Attendance Mas in accordance with the list circulated at the
meeting. All First Division Clubs were represented. Mr. Evans opened the
meeting by welcoming representatives and outlining the history and purpose
of the Conference.
ITEMS FROM SECOND DIVISION CONFERENCE
       Mr. Phillips appraised the Conference of the main points discussed
at the Second Division Conference held at Hendon on 28/29th Nay 1986.
Intel 11w fip
      This topic had generated much discussion. The Football Match
Summary had been well accepted and there was satisfaction with the format.
Regrettably there was great disparity in the standard of information
supplied. There had also been a suggestion for a Central Clearing House
for intelligence and Mr. Phillips sought the views of the Conference on
this matter. The Conference was against this suggestion. There was a
danger that a bureaucracy could be created to collect information which
would be quickly out of date. The need for up to date, precise
information was recognised and it was felt that the current system was the
best method.
CtC.Ljy
      There had been general agreement that the use of CCTV had proved
beneficial in reducing levels of disorder.          Superintendent George
Gallaghan from Huddersfield had given a presentation highlighting the
potential wide use of CCTV for intelligence role at the Second Division
Conference and Mr. Phillips indicated that under the auspices of the
Sub-Comrittee guidance was being established for eventual circulation.
Travelling spotters
      There had been much discussion on the use of travelling spotters
which had been pioneered by Portsmouth and it was apparent that the use of
spotters was becoming widespread. The views of the Conference on the use
of spotters was sought and there was general support for their use. The
problem of costs was recognised although it was suggested that the
effective use of spotters could reduce overall costs in the long term. It
became apparent that there were several versions of the scheme and there
was some concern properly expressed as to whether spotters travelling as
policemen with away fans or simply travelling to liaise with the Home
Office. The British Transport Police were unhappy with the prospect of
police officers other than their own fulfilling a police role on the
railway system. Equally the dangers of officers being recognised and
Isolated by hooligan groups was a dangerous possibility. Nr. Phillips
Indicated that these Issues would be addressed as the existing guidance In
 the Public Order Manual on Football Hooliganism was being up-dated.
 ACPO BUSINESS
       Mr. Phillips then reviewed the business of the ACPO Sub-Committee on
 Hooliganism at Sporting Events.
 Alcohol Act
       Overall the effects of the legislation had been beneficial. The
 legislation had been rushed through so there were def1clences. Amendments
 to the Act 1n the Public Order 8111 will widen Its scope to cover private
 hire mini coaches and were welcomed. Representatives discussed their
 reactions to the legislation and Clubs which were dry and those which were
 controlled stated that there had been an improvement. There was still
 some differences of oplnon as to banning of alcohol but It was so
 acknowledged that the legislation allowed for whatever level of control
 was considered most appropriate.
                                                    _-   •
 C.C.T.V.
        The use of C.C.T.V. had been pioneered through experiments carried
 out at Edinburgh, Manchester and Birmingham. As a result of-these';
^experiments the Sub-Committee had been able to advise both the Football^
^ u s t and the Department of the Environment regarding Its installation and
 Use, ,• There was no standard package as. it was recognised, that systems.,,
 heeded to be ground specific. Mr. Phillips Indicated that whilst we have?
 achieved installation we have properly not yet learnt how to make the best '
 use of. the equipment. He intended to approach the Chairman (Nr.
 to set up a Working Group to look at the. best use of photographic
 equipment and practice to be followed in investigation and 1n evidence,
H— biriihlp cards
      The Sub-Committee had discussed this topic In detail owingito
griat lnterest shown by various parties and.particularly the DepairatiM
Environment. In addition to business carried out within the Sub^lowrtttee
members had been Involved in working groups and meetings with numerous
other; bodies which had generally reached the same conclusion. 'Total
schemes" were not feasible but that inclusive or family schemes should be
encouraged. Mr. Justice Popplewell had come to this view 1n his final
report.
      There were several reasons why total sqhemes had been seen as.
unworkable bet the main difficulty from the, Police point of view w*s: the:.v;
problem of |ftember certification and the confidentiality of poyce1**
Information. Only the Police were In a position to provide intel}ig|n«tX
to the system which they clearly could/lot do and without 1ntel
comprehensive sscheme would not exclude trouble-causers. As
the key purpose of a membership scheme without accurate Intelligence; It
would not be viable.
M i c e Charges
      This matter Is      currently the subject of a review.
Sub-Comnlttee as a need   had been Identified for a move towards7!

 looking at all ways of cutting costs.
       The issue depended in part of the outcome of Harris v Sheffield
 United Football Club which had gone to appeal.
 Safety Evacuation
      The need for the annual inspection of grounds covered by safety
certificates had been strongly recommended by the Sub-Committee, this had
been endorsed by Mr. Justice Popplewell In his final report. There was
also a need for an “expert" In each force who was fully aware of the
provisions of the Hone Office Guide to Safety at Sports Ground (Green
Guide) to advise during the certification process. Mr. Phillips strongly
recommended annual inspection both as to grounds and stewarding.

REVIEW OF CROUD BEHAVIOUR

      Mr. Phillips appraised the Conference of the arrest figures which
showed a decrease of about 501. It was acknowledged that arrest figures
were not an accurate gauge of disorder and the Conference were asked for
their views. There was a general opinion that post Heysel there had been
a down turn 1n trouble but that by the end of the season there were the
beginnings of the old hostilities. Mr. Evans felt that the Police would
need to continue In a very firm approach to policing before we can be
confident there was any 'sea change1.
Behaviour inside ground.
      It was generally felt that the Improvement Inside the ground was
attributable to the Alcohol legislation and the widespread use of
C.C.T.V.and the general nood following the tragedies of the previous
season.    Although the Newcastle representative pointed out that the
alcohol legislation had played no part in the Improvement in the levels of
behaviour Inside St. James's Park as the Ground had been totally 'dry' for
some years. They saw the reduction in arrests as directly attributable to
a large reduction In the numbers of visiting suoporters.               The
representative from Manchester City spoke of the use of a 'No Mans' land
which they had been able to operate at the ground. This had the effect of
maintaining a gap of at least 35 yards between home and away supporters
and had played a significant role In the reduction of disorder although 1t
was recognised that such a tactic could only be used when crowds were less
than capacity.

Behaviour outside grounds and away from stadiii.

        It was felt that the standard of behaviour outside stadiums had
Improved In line with that Inside there was an Increasing awareness of
trouble away from the ground with incidents such as ambushing visiting
supporters transport.      Another area which was on the increase were
Incidents at crossoverpoints such as motorway service areas where
different sets of supporters met. The representative from Nottingham
suggested more could be done by the away Force by acting on intelligence
before supporters left for away grounds. He cited one partcularIncident

                       This matter was discussed briefly but it was felt that so far as
                 relates to Football there were no particular problems.

information was made available it would enable liaison officers to provide
better intelligence for subsequent matches.
HOOLIGANISM ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT.
      Ian McGregor, Assistant Chief Constable, Operations, B.T.P. gave
video presentation on the BTP in relation to football outlining their
intelligence role both nationally and for games played abroad. He
emphasized that British Rail was a commercial organisation whose main aim
was to operate at a profit. The co-ordinating role of British Transport
Police and their willingness to provide what have proved to be excellent
intelligence was outlined In some detail. Mr. Evans thanked the British
Transport Police for their assistance to Forces and encouraged greater
exchange of Information at a local level.
RETROSPECTIVE ARRESTS.
      The Conference then reviewed a presentation on the incidents at
Birmingham and Heysal from Deteclve Inspector Ross, West Midlands Police
and Detective Chief Inspector Wright, Merseyside Police, outlining the
methods used to detect offenders at the two Incidents. It was apparent
that video evidence had been used to good effect and had resulted in
numerous convictions in the use at the Birmingham incident. The Heysal
Inquiry was not yet complete.
      There were several points of good practice which come to notice as a
result of the enquiries.
      Mr. Phillips indicated that the lessons learnt by the Merseyside and
West Midlands Police would be beneficial to all and that they would be
consulted by the Working Group previously referred to when a package was
put together.
SPORTING EVENTS (CONTROL OF ALCOHOL) ACT
      The legislation had been Identified earlier as having a beneficial
effect on levels of disorder. Members views were sought on practices In
relation to the Act. Some members felt very, strongly that there should
be a total ban even to the extent that agreement should be sought of
retail outlets outside grounds not to supply alcohol on matchday. The
majority however favoured control. It was pointed out that If alcohol is
banned Inside the ground people drink outside and do not go Into the
ground until the last minute. Where there Is no alcohol In the vicinity
of the ground fans will go aw*y from the ground even to the extent In
certain circumstances of drinking In another Force area and so becoming a
potential problem for a Force who has no responsibility for policing the
football match. Mr. Phillips said that It was for precisely these reasons
that the ACPO had favoured control as opposed to bans. He also pointed
out that there was no evidence based on arrest figures that a total ban
was more beneficial than control.
LUTON TOWN ICMBERS SOCME
      Chief Superintendent Spalding of the Bedfordshire Police outlined
the proposed Members Plan to be Introduced at Luton Town for the season
1986/87. The scheme 1s designed to ban aw*y support and has the backing
of the Bedfordshire Police. The system 1s to be computerised and will
allow members only to attend together glth a limited number of accredited
                                                    Document No.   3       CONT’O



guests. To facilitate the system the capacity had been reduced to 14,000
and crowd segregation was impossible. The catchment area for membership
application had been clearly defined and any applicant from outside that
area would have to provide proof that he was a supporter of Luton Town.
In addition any members who did not attend on a regular basis would be
identified by the computer and membership would be withdrawn.
      It was anticipated that the club would have approximately 30,000
members by the start of the season. The Club were determined that the
scheme would succeed to the extent that they were willing to play all F.A.
Cup games in the future away from home. The assistance of all Liaison
Officers was requested In getting the message across to other Clubs and
supporters clubs that they would not gain admission at Luton.
      Mr. Evans thanked Mr. Spalding for his presentation and said that
all parties would watch the experiment with great interest.
ANY OTHER BUSINESS
Political activity in football
                                     Metropolitan Police addressed the
Conference on this topic. Following the tragedies of the previous season
the media had attempted to connect various political factions with
disorder at Football Matches. His enquiries with the relevant department
in his force revealed that there was no evidence of National Front or
British Movement involvement in Football. Members concurred with this
view. There may be members of various political organisations who attend
football matches but there had been no orchestrated effort to cause
disorder.
Transport Bill
      Mr. Phillips spoke on the effects of the Transport Bill the
provisions of which will come Into effect In October 1986.            The
Metropolitan Forces would be affected and the indications are that
football specials would cease to operate because they are not cost
effective. The problems this could cause are obvious and in Greater
Manchester there were urgent talks going on in an effort to preserve some
type of service.

Mr. Evans closed the meeting and thanked delegates for their attendance.
On behalf of all who had attended Mr. Phillips thanked Mr. Evans and the
West Midlands Police for their hospitality.
  NOTES OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE SECONO DIVISION FOOTBALL LEAGUE POLICE
    COMANDERS AND LIAISON OFFICERS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE PEEL CENTRE
              HENDON, ON WEDNESDAY 28th NAY and 29th NAY 1986


      The meeting was chaired by J.S.Evans,Esq., Deputy Chief Constable,
Surrey Constabulary, J.D.Phillips Esq., Assistant Chief Constable,
Operations, Greater Manchester Police acted as Secretary and was assisted
by Chief Superintendent Harrison, Hampshire Constabulary.
      Attendance was in accordance with the 11st circulated at the
meeting, the only club not represented, being West Bromwich Albion. Mr.
Evans opened the meeting with a welcome to all representatives and
reviewed the timetable.
CLUB REPORTS.
      The evening session was confined to input by Divisional Commanders
and Liaison Officers in respect of the individual clubs:-
BARNSLEY
No problems,       there had been reduced    attendances, resulting 1n
reduced arrests and ejections. This was attributed to CCTV
and no alcohol, the ground being "dry".
SHEFFIELD UNITED
Problems were encountered when police advice on routes for coaches for
away support was not followed. It was considered that a closer liaison was
required with Traffic Commissioners in respect of routes and timing and a
possible prohibition of attendance at the ground prior to one hour before
kick-off. It was suggested that the Commissioners be asked to consider
the inclusion of a clause 1n a licence for the notification of any
conveyance of supporter to football league matches.
(Mr. Phillips on behalf of the Sub-Committee on Hooliganism undertook to
consider this issue but in light of the Transport Act felt there was
little that could now be done)
BLACKBURN
Gates have fallen considerably. Early arrivals had caused some
difficulties but the main problem encountered had been with the all
ticket rule for Leeds.It had been necessary to allow entry to ground
to 350 unticketed fans at selected turnstiles.
      Mr. Phillips said that the difficulties had been previously
Identified by the Sub-Committee and 1t was hoped that the message had now
got through that all ticket matches were only practicable where capacity
crowds were anticipated.
BRADFORD
Problems had arisen for Bradford with no home ground and having to play at
Leeds and Huddersfield which resulted 1n additional problems for the
police with three sets of supporters. They are now at Ordsall, Bradford
until 1988, when    it   is   hoped   that   Valley   Parade   will   have   been
re-furbished.

Another issue of interest raised was the position when the local authority
were the issuing authority and certificate holder.
BRIGHTON
A 'Spotter Squad1 which was introduced last season appears to
have reduced problems both at home and away games.
Comment was made on the standard of behaviour by players and officials of
clubs, and it was suggested that cautioning of players by the Police for
bad behaviour be introduced as a policy. It was recognised that problems
may arise arise if the Police prosecute. Examples were quoted of visiting
bench being cautioned three times in one match. This topic was extended
to cover match officials and concern was expressed at the major variations
in attitudes to discipline.
Questions'were asked about the policy of full pitch perimeter fencing.
Mr. Phillips summarised the ACPO view and pointed out where there was good
crowd behaviour perimeter fencing was not mandatory.
CARLISLE
A problem had occurred when young programme sellers had been
robbed when outside the ground. It was recommended that programmes be
sold only within the confines of the ground.
 Sponsorship under the emblem of the 'Sun Wheelers' (British National
Party) at Hull had been received which allowed-advertising in the Club
programme before the connection was discovered.
Racist chanting appeared to be general amongst visiting supporters.
Intelligence reports had not suggested there was any racist activity
(although press comment did). If there was racist chanting it should be
commented on in the Intelligence Report.
Obscene chanting was still a problem and it was suggested that CCTV and
the 'Spotter System' could assist in identification.
CHARLTON ATHLETIC
CRYSTAL PALACE
Ground sharing meant a minimum of 50 matches per season at the club and
doubled the commitment of local Police. An encouraging factor was that
club favours were beginning to be worn again. Derby matches where there
was ground sharing were particularly difficult as each set of supporters
considered themselves to be at home. There were also stewarding problems
and conflicting arrangements between the Clubs.
It was accepted there was a need for discussions with the FA on ground
sharing schemes, both present and proposed.
Mr. Phillips recommended a “re-cert1f1cation" of grounds, current or
contemplating ground sharing schemes, to clarify usage.
                                               Document No.   3    CONT’D




An additional problem raised in discussion was 'third force' elements, BTP
and local forces required detailed intelligence concerning identifiable
groups (ostensibly not of either club) visiting games.
HILLMALL
There is a culture of violence associated with the Club. They have a
measure of organisation with their own printed visiting cards and revel in
an unholy reputation.
Troublemakers attempt to ambush coaches, or travel in vehicles alongside
and cause damage. One fan boarded a visiting coach, threw bricks along
the corridors injuring passengers. Ambushes were well planned and
constant escorting is necessary. Recently at a match with a gate of
5,000, 450 police officers were deployed and there were still problems. A
new ploy to draw police officers 1n, is mock fights and the lighting of
fires. Police officers therefore arenever 1n less than pairs and remain^
in line of eight.                                                         ^8
In discussion BTP commended the package deal for rail, bus and match
ticket distribution, which in the case of Mlllwall appears to reduce
aggravation.
FULHAM
No problems.
WIMBLEDON
No problems.
DERBY
DLF - DERBY LUNATIC FRINGE had caused some problems and the clubs still
enjoyed good support.. Some problems had been encountered with special
trains, and escorting fans to and from the ground due to the distance^
between the station and the ground.                                    ^
GRIMSBY
No major problems.
HUOOERSFIELD
No problems, Arrests had been considerably reduced. There had been
extensive use of CCTV for Intelligence purposes.
HULL
There had been noticeably less problems in Division Two than 1n Division
Three. The use of spotters and CCTV was advocated.
IPSHICH
Gates and arrests were down* Problems had only been encountered on a 'one
off1 game with 200 away fans.
A proposal was made that Justices of the Peace be taken to the games to
                                     -3-

 see the problems at f i r s t hand.
 HIDOLESBOROUGH
Now relegated to the Third Division. Intelligence has identified 200
trouble makers, instances have occurred where they have travelled to
ground two weeks prior to games to obtain tickets for the opposing
enclosures.
NORWICH
Ground is completely dry. Problems have occurred in seated areas where
fans have avoided segregation. Another area of concern were matches on
Bank Holiday week-ends, when fans were inclined to stay overnight. The
'Spotter System' was used and recommended.
OLDHAM
No major problems. All ticket arrangements with Leeds had not been
successful. Also "Away fans" had avoided segregation by getting in seated
areas.
PLYMOUTH
Newly Promoted - There was a problem in identifying coach operators who
carry supporters to away matches because of the extremelywide catchment
area.
PORTSMOUTH
The Conference discussed the intercept tactics used when HI11wall played
at Portsmouth. Visting supporters had been stopped from approaching
Portsmouth by intercepting them on the M3. No H U 1wall fans had gained
access. These tactics require good liaison with B.T.P. Both Hr. Evans
and Hr. Phillips had some reservations on this as a general strategy which
might create displacement of the problem when turning back large numbers.
There would need to be special circumstances.
READING
No problems.
SHREWSBURY
The use of CCTV was advocated. Video evidence had been used successfully
to obtain convictions. Good liaison with H1ddlesborough,had produced 30
plus arrests on video. On conviction the Magistrates had Imposed fines of
£2,000 plus. There was a "no ejections policy", all offenders being
arrested. Mr. Evans pointed out that if detained persons were subsequently
not charged this differed little from ejection.
STOKE
Both crowds and arrests were reported to be well down. CCTV had been
particularly successful.     The Conference was then informed of the
'Hatchmates System1 which had been operating at Stoke for several years.
The idea was to encourage young people and families to attend matches by
Involving them In pre-match activity. It was anticipated that efforts
                                                      Document No. 3    CONT’D




would be made to widen th e scope of th e system to o th e r clu b s.
SUNDERLAW)
Spotters had been used for specific games and had been successful. Some
alcohol had been available at the grounds and had not caused a problem.          &
The need for a statutory power of search on entry was raised.
WEST BROMWICH ALBIOH
No input.
The meeting was adjourned until 9.00 am. Thursday 29th Hay 1986.

Hr. Phillips opened the second meeting on Thursday 29th Hay 1986, with
a review of the business of the ACPO Sub-Comnittee on Hooliganism at.
Sporting Events.
The main issues discussed were
ALCOHOL ACT
Overall the effects of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985
appear to have been beneficial. Amendments to the Act contained in the
Public Order Bill which widen its scope to cover private hire m1n1-coahces
were welcomed and should be on the statute books for the start of the new
season.
It should also be noted that, as far as arrests indicated, control of
alcohol at grounds had produced the same results as total bans.

CCTV
The use of CCTV had been pioneered through experiments at Edinburgh,
Hanchester and Birmingham and as a result the Sub-Camnlttee had had a^^
major input by way of advice to both the Department of the Environment a n d w
the Football Trust regarding its installation and use. There was no
standard package as it was recognised that each ground had its own special
features and each system had to be ground specific.
The 'Hoolivan1 had produced limited results and the lack of speed in pan
and tilt restricted its value. Whilst it may have had some preventative
effect initially 1t was felt that this had quickly diminished. It was
accepted that it was not designed for football and that its best use in
relation to football was probably at static points such as bus and rail
stations.
IOEMTIFICATIOH CARPS A M SCHBCS
Members of the Sub-Coamrittee had taken part 1n a Football League Working
Group on Membership schemes which had concluded that total membership
schemes were feasible. Th^s had confirmed the previously held ACPO view.
It had also been noted that although in his Interim report Nr. Justice
Popplewell had recommended such schemes the final report reconwnded 'sow
form' of membership schemes. This fell Into line with the ACPO view that
Inclusive or family club schemes should be encouraged.
                                        - 5 -
There were several reasons why total schemes had been seen as unworkable
but the most serious difficulty had been the problem of member
verification. Only the Police were in a position to verify the bona-fides
of applicants and determine who, because of convictions say, should be
excluded, but clearly such information was held confidentially.
It was noted that Luton Town are to introduce a total scheme for the
1986/87 season and this would be watched with interest.
SEARCHIMG
The Sub-Committee had frequently and consistently voiced their disquiet at
the lack of a statutory power to search. They had been supported in their
stance by Mr. Justice Popplewell in his final report although the
Government had as yet taken no action in respect of this recommendation.
Whilst the Football League had Included searching as a condition of entry
in its Ground Regulations legal opinion was that Ground Regulations would
give little protection in law to the officers..
In addition to problems at grounds the lack of a power to search fans 1n
transit or at Railway Stations also caused difficulties.
POLICE CHARGES
This matter is currently the subject of a review by the Sub-Committee as a
need had been identified for a move towards a common approach in respect
of charges. It had been recognised that Football Clubs do talk to each
other and in times of financial hardship were looking at all ways of
cutting costs.
The issue depended 1n part on the outcome of Harris -v- Sheffield United
F.C. which had gone to appeal.
SAFETY EVACUATION
The need for the annual Inspection of grounds covered by safety
certificates had been strongly recommended by the Sub-Committee, this had
been endorsed by Mr. Justice Popplewell in his final report. There was
also a need for an "expert" in each force who was fully aware of the
provisions of the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Green
Guide) to advise during the certification process. Mr. Phillips strongly
recommended annual Inspection both as to grounds and stewarding.
A video film of the Bradford fire was shown at this stage. At the
conclusion Mr. Evans expressed the condolences of all the officers
present.
USE OF CCTV
Superintendent Callaghan gave an update on the use of CCTV 1n West
Yorkshire indicating that there had been noticeably fewer problems during
the season.     Troublemakers had been banned as a result of video
Identification and many troublemakers had been identified at away grounds.
He then made several suggestions as points of good practice 1n the use of
CCTV.
1)Crowds should be filmed even If there 1s no trouble.
This helps to form a pattern.
                                                  Document No.   3   CONT’D




2)For evidential purposes record all cameras simultaneously.

3)Take s t i l l photographs inside the ground.

4)Identification marks in grounds assist with exact locations.
5)Disguise is now being used to avoid detection by video including
fancy dress, face painting and multi-clothes swapping.
6)The lack of a retrospective power of arrest for Section 5 Public
Order Act was a difficulty. The Sub Committee had pressed for this to be
included in the Public Order 8111 and were supported by Popplewell but
without success.
7)Cons1der showing arresting officer the tape before he completes
his evidence.
8)L1ght1ng at the rear of stands with flash facility, controlled
by the officer in charge 1n the Police Control Box can be put
on, and at times stops crowd reaction or disorder.

Mr. Callaghan also said that research was required on tape cleaning for
incidental purposes there was a need for a tape exchange system.
Mr. Phillips said the amended section 1n the ACPO guidelines would include
guidance and CCTV and hoped to get together the best Information on
evidential use of film.
SEARCHING TACTICS
Chief Superintendent Bruce, Cleveland Constabulary spoke on police
tactics, re searching. The system in Cleveland relies on accurate
intelligence to Institute stop check points to search for weapons in
vehicles etc., There was an urgent need for a statutory power to search
awayfron grounds. Mr. Bruce then appraised the conference of the Publlc^^
Order Intelligence Unit in Cleveland developed during the Miners' dispute,w
of one Inspector, two Sergeants and six Constables. Much use has been
made of graphic displays.
SCHEDULING OF FIXTURES
Chief Inspector Fitzsimmons, West Yorkshire, Introduced the topic of
scheduling of fixtures. Re-schedul1ng of fixtures at short notice had
caused problems. Some certificates did not Include the provision of at
least 28 days notice as per the following.
(I) "At least 28 days before a Specified Activity takes place(or
      such shorter time as the Chief Constable may require) the
      Holder shall notify the Chief Constable of the Specified
      Activity;"
(II) The holder shall make an agreement on his behalf and on behalf
     of the occupier of the premises under S15 Police Act 1964 to
     secure the attendance at the Specified Activity of such number
     of police officers as is 1n the opinion of the Chief Constable
      sufficient to ensure decent and orderly behaviour at the
       Specified Activity.
                                                    Document No.    3     CONT’O




         Mr. Phillips said that similar provisions had been included
      in        G.M.P.         certificates   and i t   was recommended that all
      c e r t i f i c a t e s pay attention to this point.

GROUND REGULATIONS
Superintendent Dawes, Hampshire Constabulary addressed the conference on
standardisation of ground regulations. It would be beneficial if ground
regulations could be standardised allowing the possibility of ejecting for
any infringement. Home fans appear to accept control but visiting
supporters objected to the local ground rules. If the regulations were
standardised all would know what to expect.
Mr. Evans said that common rules for the League had been achieved the
problem had been that there was no uniformity of enforcement. There was
often a case for ejecting people who had contravened ground regulations
but whose behaviour had fallen short of an actual offence. Such action
could often prevent the spread of trouble. He recommended officers be made
aware of ground regulations through briefings.
INTELLIGENCE FORM - CENTRAL CLEARING HOUSE
Superintendent Stuart, South Yorkshire, then spoke on the intelligence
form and the possibility of a central clearing house. The ACPO form was
effective if properly completed, But honesty was needed with the
Interchange of information at liaison officer level. If the intelligence
was inaccurate the result was either a waste or a shortage of manpower.
He then     identified the problems of "crossroads", specially in the
Yorkshire   area, where the travelling fans meet at service and other areas,
resulting   in disorder.
A general   discussion ensued on the intelligence system.

A member referred to the use of CS gas sprays which he had discovered by
chance and which a clearing house would have identified. Mr. Phillips
said the idea of a Central Clearing House had been looked at but basically
1t was only the receiving Force who required day to day intelligence (i.e.
numbers, modes of travel). The ACPO requirement is for such unusual
incidents to be reported to the Sub-Committee, for discussion and
dlsemmination by them to all interested parties.

Concern was expressed at long delays in the despatch of P°st match
sunwaries. The need for prompt completion and dispatch was highlighted.
It was emphasized that the quality of pre-match intelligence was often
dependant on accurate recent post match intelligence. There was also a
need for close co-operation between liaison officers.
USE OF SPOTTERS
Chief Superintendent Harrison, Hampshire updated the meeting on the
'Spotters System as used at Portsmouth. Travelling Spotters had been used
at 13 of the 24 away matches played by Portsmouth and they have been able
to provide accurate pre-match intelligence to identify problems In areas
other than the ground. There were now six clubs 1n the second Division
and two 1n the First operating a spotter system.
                                                                  Document No.     3




The problem of costs was raised and it was suggested that the system could
be cost effective if the pre-match intelligence enabled the correct level
of policing.
Mr. Evans whilst supportive of the principle said there could be other
difficulties as he was aware of Chief Constables constraints in allowing
officers to travel. There followed a general discussion on this item
which concluded that there was a need for guidelines on the use of                                      '    r.

spotters. Mr. Phillips said that he would look at the matter further.

that British Rail was a commercial organisation. He also outlined the
intelligence role of the B.T.P both nationally and for games played abroad
on the question of travelling by spotters in uniform. He was of the
opinion that this could result in some conflict and felt only BTP officers
should be in uniform on trains.
Mr. McGregor thanked A8 and all forces for their co-operation.

Mr. Evans then opened the meeting for general debate.               Points raised were

       The meeting was chaired by J.S. Evans Esq., Deputy Chief Constable,
Surrey Constabulary and J.D. Phillips Esq., Assistant Chief Constable,
Greater Manchester Police performed the duties of Secretary.



      Attendance was in accordance with the attached list.          All clubs 1n
the First Division were represented at the meeting.



1. Opening Address




       Mr. Evans opened the meeting and welcomed all present.          He asked
representatives,     when making their seasonal reports,         to include the
followlng:-


       (a)      membership schemes


       (b)      intelligence


       (c)      C.C.T.V.

         (d)     spotters


         (e)     problems


         (f)     any changes to be recommended


2. Liaison Officer Reports


        Contributions were made on behalf of all clubs on the 1986/7 season,
the main points of interest being as follows:-


      (a)Nembershlp Schemes - progress achieved in the required preparation
        of membership schemes varied from a full scheme in force all last
        season (Luton) to no start made (Tottenham, Coventry and Arsenal).


        Luton,     who have a no away supporters policy,        and a 100% home
        membership scheme,      reported being able to reduce manpower levels
        at games four times during the season to an eventual figure of 41
         (inside and outside the ground).        However,   membership cards did
        fall into the wrong hands and 1t was agreed that photographs were
        essential on such cards to assist in this problem.Some clubs
        had set up schemes which complied with League guidelines(Manchester
        United,     Everton,    Leicester)   whilst others were in negotiation
        with the 'Appeals Group' set up by the Football League (Aston
        Vi 11 a, Li verpool).


(b)      Intelligence - 1t was generally agreed that Intelligence fell Into
        two distinct types:-
                                                 Document No.   3      CONT




(i)   match information,   such as the number of coaches and

spectators expected to travel and, the history and

importance of the fixtu re.



(ii) intelligence about known trouble causers and, their
plans and methods.


In all cases match information was found to be excellent but many
representatives found the latter type of intelligence to be
insufficient (Norwich, West Ham, Derby, Nottingham Forest,
Sheffield Wednesday, Coventry, Aston Villa).       Because the police
had become more effective in policing within grounds, 1t was felt
that some of the problems had been displaced and were occurring
away from grounds whilst 'fans' were 1n transit.      It was generally
agreed that this area of Intelligence also required increased
attention.

C.C.T.V. - generally agreed to have had a positive effect on
reducing crowd disorder within grounds. However, problems with
the systems installed In grounds were Identified - not enough for
identifications (Newcastle), cameras wear out quickly (Oxford),
only black and white (Tottenham, Nottingham Forest).       It was
suggested that Installed systems could be supplemented by the
'Evidence Gathering Cameras' (Southampton), or hand held video
camera and still cameras (Arsenal, Tottenham).       One club
(Leicester) used the city centre cameras, Installed for monitoring
traffic flows,       1n connection with the movement of football
supporters through the city.          This had received much local
publicity and was accepted.     Another club (Nottingham Forest) had
                                                Document No.     3        CONT’D



sought to use this facility, but had been refused permission.


Spotters - the use of spotters, both overt and covert, was
welcomed by almost all representatives.      It was agreed that
spotters should not be sent without the authority of the ground
commander of the host club, but Increased use was seen as having
a positive effect on policing disorder.      'Please send me your
spotters, I would love to accommodate them1 (Arsenal). 'Covert
operations have resulted in a 100% manning reduction at matches'
(West Ham).


Pitch Invasions - seen as a problem by some clubs (Coventry,
Charlton, Q.P.R.)   and not by others (Arsenal, Watford, West Ham)
who do not have any pitch perimeter fencing.     After discussion, it
was agreed that whether perimeter fencing should or should not be
installed was a local decision to be made after considering the
ground conditions and the experience of fan behaviour.         However,
it was generally agreed that pitch Invasions should be stopped as
they has the potential to degenerate to major disorder.


Evacuation - evacuation exercises were practiced at some grounds
(Manchester United, Everton, Liverpool) where public announcements
are made, emergency bells checked and all evacuation doors opened
and checked by police. This does not Involve the actual evacuation
of the ground, but tests the mechanical parts of the system.          At
most grounds certain police officers are Issued with universal lock
keys.   Leicester reported on the electrically operated exit gate
system and exercises which are practiced there with the fire and
ambulance services to test call-out times.
                                                 Document No. 3      CONT’D




Fixture Problems - one ground (Aston Villa) was selected to host a
cup semi-final when this was inappropriate because of extended
roadworks, but there was no consultation with the police prior to
the decision.   Mr. Phillips explained that the League had agreed
to consult the police on all matters affecting them. If the League
were not complying with this agreement then he should be informed
of the circumstances and he would take up the matter with them.     A
number of clubs had postponed games at short notice, leaving the
police with the problem of officers working rest days unnecessarily.
It was felt that costs resulting from short notice cancellations
should be billed to the club.


Miscellaneous - many representatives reported pressure from clubs
to reduce manpower levels.      Mr. Phillips pointed out that it was a
condition of the General Safety Certificate that the responsibility
to decide on manpower levels was the Chief Constable's.


Although searching was undertaken by officers at every game (Q.P.R.)
the fans were becoming more devious in hiding weapons on their
person.   Some clubs use metal detectors (Chelsea, West Ham) and
weapons have been found dumped outside the grounds.


At one club (Arsenal) ticket sales were allowed immediately after a
game, this was not recommended as both sets of fans mingled whilst
trying to purchase these tickets with obvious disorder potential.



A.C.P.O. Update On Current Events
                                                       Document No. 3       CONT’D




       Mr. Phillips suggested that the past season appeared to have been a
better season than we had experienced for some time.     However, it was
difficult to judge and arrest statistics were not to be regarded as an index
of the problem - they may merely reflect a change in the acceptable
behaviour threshold.     Policing football is becoming more effective as
C.C.T.V. and better intelligence start to pay off.     Organised football
hooliganism is still there, using football as a scenario for a kind of war
game and developing strategies to out-manoevre the police.      Atmosphere was
the critical factor and perhaps the next stage was to stop concerted
offensive chanting and posturing and break up the hooligan groups.          The
problem of football is fundamentally a criminal problem and therefore one
for the police.

(a)     Finance - Mr. Phillips described this as an "iceberg" issue as the
        enormous cost continued to rise - particularly in Regulation 26 and
        27 overtime.   Whatever the circumstances only a small part would be
        recovered from clubs and then , in most forces, this did not
        translate directly into funds available to be spent on overtime.


        The financial issue was of growing concern to Police, Police
        Authorities and no doubt auditors.     There was little police control
        over fixtures and programmes and we were being asked to police
        football to higher levels out of existing resources.                The
        opportunity cost of not doing routine policing and depleted night
          shifts was becoming unsupportable.


(b)    Intelligence - Mr. Phillips pointed out that at the Second
       Division Conference the representatives held strong views about the
                                              Document No. 3      CONT’D



importance of increasing the level and content of intelligence. He
agreed that there were two levels of intelligence and that the
second level was an area in need of considerable expansion.      The
problems had spread from the grounds, sometimes into city centres
many miles from the clubs involved, and often police commanders
were unaware of the problems their team's supporters were creating
whilst away from home.   There were strong arguments for a National
Football Intelligence Cell as the football hooligan is involved 1n
much more than just football disorder.


Spotters - There had been a very enthusiastic response from the
Second Division Conference for the use of spotters.       However, as
they were of more use to the host Force, he felt that reciprocity
was only fair.    The practice was discussed 1n line with document
"Policing Football".

C.C.T.V.- Mr. Phillips argued that the primary use of C.C.T.V.
inside grounds was for evidence and Intelligence gathering.      In
this regard 1t was better to cover the critical 25°/0 of the ground
effectively than to try to cover all the ground and finish up with
poor   quality   recordings,        insufficient   for evidence and
intelligence purposes.   He pointed out that the Football Trust may
have money available for the enhancement of existing systems and
that he would write 1n this respect.       The use of video recording
was to be extended to Third and Fourth Division Clubs.             All
representatives from both conferences found that C.C.T.V. had had a
marked impact on crowd behaviour.
                                                Document No. 3         CONT’D




 Police Costs - A synopsis of methods of costing had been circulated
 to all Forces.    This matter was being further discussed by
 A.C.P.O..     Such problems as cancelled fixtures,       short notice
 games and play-offs were discussed.


 Documents - two recent documents had been circulated:*


(i) "Directory of Coach Operators", which will shortly be updated.
     Proprietors had been made aware of the regulations and if
     operators were not adhering to them, evidence of this should
     be forwarded to Mr. Phillips when he would take the matter up
     with the Traffic Commissioners.


(ii) "Policing Football", (guidance on policing) was circulated and
     will be included in the “mini” Public Order Manual in due
     course.
     It will be subjected to annual review and views on the document
     were requested.


Power of Search - Mr. Phillips explained that there were no routine
powers under P.A.C.E. and that the legal opinion he had obtained was
that the widely accepted 'power1 under the Ground Regulations would
give little protection in law.   He explained that the Home Office
had been pressed on the point but suggested that if there was a
problem in this respect the police should provide evidence of It.
In effect, until our practice was successfully challenged, nothing
further could be done.
(h)    Permanent Correspondents - Each country in the E.E.C. had now
      appointed a "permanent correspondent" to advise the appropriate
       police contact of any club in his country involved overseas.



4. Exclusion Orders

       Inspector Harrison, Greater Manchester Police, gave details of the
legislation and procedure to be adopted in recording and retrieving current
exclusion orders and the process of termination of such orders.       Details
of this procedure will be circulated.



5. C.C.T.V.

       At last year's Football Conference, Mr. Phillips indicated that he
would approach Mr. Anderton (Chairman of the Hooliganism at Sporting Events
Sub-Committee),   with a view to establishing a Working Party into the
Police Use of Video Evidence.   Members of that Working Party were present
to answer any questions from those present, they also showed a video
explaining their work and produced a written section in the A.C.P.0.
Document 'Policing'.

       Detective Inspector Ross, West Midlands Police, gave a presentation
of his enquiry Into the public disorder during the Birmingham -v- Leeds
match on the 11th, may, 1985.
                                                          I Document No.   3     q q   N T




                              (S.R.D.B.) asked for feedback on the C.C.T.V.
systems installed in the various grounds to help him ascertain a standard
to compare other systems with.          The early advice offered by S.R.D.B.,
although supported on technical grounds by                    was not considered
practical       by ground commanders.    He also asked for the    impressions   of
those present of the hoolivan.      The reaction was almost totally negative
and several (West Midlands, Metropolitan, Greater Manchester) advised
            that they had forwarded evaluation reports to the S.R.D.B. about
the hoolivan.



6. Membership Schemes


       Mr. Phillips highlighted some of the problems connected with
membership schemes - the casual supporter;             closely located teams;
checking applicants;      multiple memberships;     multiple applications using
different names;      turnstile checking;     derby games.       The Police had
expressed concern as to the viability of the 100°/o schemes in many areas
and the 50°/o scheme had now been agreed.         This may not be without merit
and if the clubs take up the spirit of the scheme it could help to create a
better atmosphere in grounds.       Whether it works or not, is out of the
hands of the police, but it should be given every support.           The present
scheme does not apply to away support (a management consultancy firm is
examining such a scheme at the moment)        and so in 12 months the whole
system may have to be revised.     Mr. Phillips pointed out that 14 points of
guidance for membership schemes had been circulated to Forces from Greater
Manchester Police, but because of the general lack of knowledge of this
displayed by the representatives, further copies were distributed at the
meeting.      Mr. Phillips argued that photographs on the membership cards
                                                        I Document No. 3      CONT’D




were essen tia l    and i f   Forces were finding that membership schemes were

being     set   up without    photographs or contrary to the other points of

guidance then he would write to the Department of the Environment pointing

out that the system needed tightening up.



       Mr.         (F.8 Division, Home Office) suggested that the police
should be aware of the possibility of the Football League using their
response, if too negative, as an excuse for not complying with membership
schemes.



          He also warned that Home Office legal opinion was that some
conditions in General Safety Certificates were 'ultra vires' and that such
conditions should be directly related to safety.



7. Intelligence Gathering


          Chief Inspector Hoskins and Sergeant          (Metropolitan) explained
their system of intelligence gathering through covert teams attached to the
various London football clubs ('Own Goal').           They claimed considerable
success both in retrospective arrests for offences committed and for
anticipating and preventing disorder.

           Detective Sergeant          (West Midlands) explained a similar system
 used in his Force and again was able to claim a great success 1n both
 areas,

           These Inputs were received with much enthuslasa by the conference
                                                          Document No.    3
                                                                              CONT’D


and there was a good deal of in te rest and discussion.



8. Travelling Fans

       Inspector Temporal, British Transport Police, gave a synopsis of
the season,   stressing the increasing use of video recording at railway
stations and showed a video tape to stress the point.



9. Conclusions

       Hr. Evans summarised the main points which had emerged during the
       conference.

       (a)    Most ground commanders agreed that the Information
              about, and identification of, travelling hoollgaris
              supplied by away spotters, provided an invaluable
              aid to the policing of matches.        Many examples were
              quoted of spotters being able to identify their own
              club's hooligan element resulting 1n either arrests
              for offences already committed or preventative police
              action.      It was agreed that the following points were
              Important


              (1)       increased use of spotters;


              (11)      as the use of spotters Is primarily of value to
                        the host Force (I.e. not the Force supplying the
                        spotters) there Is a need for reciprocity if the
                                           Document No.   3



        system is to succeed;


(iii)   ground commanders of the host force must be
         informed prior to the match and consent to the
        attendance of away spotters.



There are two levels of intelligence:-


(i)     match information such as numbers attending,
        vehicles to be used etc., and


(ii)    hooligan Intelligence, known trouble makers
        attending, weapons carried, flash points In
        transit, plans for violence etc.


It was agreed that the provision of (1) was excellent,
but (11) was Insufficient.      Because of the displacement
effect of the more effective policing of grounds, there
was a tendency for trouble to be caused by fans 1n transit,
often in towns or areas far from the natural route between
the two clubs.   To collate, evaluate and disseminate this
nationwide Intelligence 1t was generally suggested that a
National Intelligence Cell was required.      It may also act
as a clearing house for exclusion orders.
                                                       Document No. 3       C0NT



        (c)   The increase in use of               throughout the country
              has produced a corresponding increase in the amount of level
                   intelligence.    Such operations are the only consistent
              source of this intelligence, but without a central clearing
              house (National Intelligence Cell) much of this valuable
              intelligence may be lost or underutilised.



        (d)   Most C.C.T.V. operators at football grounds had only the
              skills obtained by frequent use of the equipment.    They did
              not have the skills or knowledge necessary to obtain good
              evidential coverage if disorder should occur.   A training
              course was required to redirect the attention of these
              operators away from overall pictures of crowds towards
              objective intelligence gathering in normal c1rcumstances
              and evidence gathering and identifications in circumstances
              of public disorder.



        (e)   The annual conferences for the First and Second Divisions
              were warmly supported and it was agreed that they should be
              continued.    There was also a strong recommendation from
              those present that a similar facility should be afforded the

        The meeting was chaired by J.O. Phillips Esq., Assistant Chief
Constable, Greater Manchester Police and Chief Inspector Appleby of
Greater Manchester Police performed the duties of Secretary.

        Attendance was in accordance with the list circulated at the
                                                    /

meeting. The only club not represented was Brighton (relegated from
Division 2), however both Manchester City (relegated to Division 2) and
Bournemouth (pronoted to Division 2) had representatives at the neetlng.

1. Opening Address

        Mr. Phillips opened the meeting and welcoaed all present. He asked
the Club Liaison Officers, when making their contribution, to include the
following polnts:-

(a)     the method used for calculating police costs payable by the club;

(b)     the effectiveness of the present intelligence system;

(c)     any problems caused by the new play-off system.

2. Liaison Officer Reports

        All Club Liaison Officers present reported on their experiences of
the 1986/7 season, the main points of interest being as follows:-

(a)    Police Charges - the methods of fixing police charges were as
       various as the number of Police Forces involved. Some clubs use a
       seasonally agreed formula (Grimsby), a periodically agreed manpower
       level (Stoke) or an attendance figure ratio (West Broarich Albion).
       A number of others categorise matches dependent on the opposition
       and charge accordingly. One club (Derby) has Its policing bills
       payed ty the local authority and another (Ml11wall) also receives
                                               Document No. 3     CONT'D




considerable financial assistance from its own authority. Two
clubs (Sheffield United and Portsmouth) have declined to pay for
police duties for some time, but in the former case the High Court
have found them liable.

No matter what system of calculating the charges was adopted it was
generally agreed that these charges went nowhere near to reflecting
the actual costs of the police presence at football matches, and
(bearing in mind the parlous financial state of some football
clubs) a move towards a more accurate charging system should be
initiated.

Intelligence - Chief Inspector Hoskins (Metropolitan) made the
point that there are two levels of football intelligence, (1)
number of coaches/supporters attending from visiting club and (11)
anticipation of trouble in transit, city centres, particular public
houses, etc. It was generally agreed that the content and accuracy
of (i) above was very good except in the instance of specific and
known clubs (Leeds, Portsmouth, Millwall) where the. hooligan
element refuse to conform to agreed routes and coach proprietors.
These 'fans' usually travel by transit vans, 'rebel' coaches or by
rail, entering or leaving the train some distance from where they
would be monitored by police. The actions of this element fall
into (il) above and It is in this area that the available
intelligence was not considered to be of sufficient quantity and
quality.

Spotters - both overt and covert systems received a very positive
response from all those present. Many examples were cited where
overt spotters had quietened an unruly visiting group of fans just
by their observed presence, and similarly many examples of trouble
prevented by information supplied by covert spotters were given.
It was not an uncommon experience for Forces using covert spotters
to be able to reduce manpower at matches as they were already Mare
of the possibility of disorder and where It was likely to occur.

C.C.T.V. - almost all liaison officers commented favourably on the
effects of their C.C.T.V. system on the roudy element within their
                                                Document No.   3




grounds. Many instances of arrests supported by video evidence
were given, but the most striking effects on crowd behaviour were
seen at those grounds where C.C.T.V. had most recently been
installed (Ipswich, Bradford, Blackburn, Plymouth, Grimsby),
indicating a possible 'honeymoon' effect. A number of clubs
(Ml11wall, Derby, Huddersfield, Leeds, Oldham and Birmingham)
forward video recordings of their own known hooligans to clubs they
are visiting. This was seen as especially helpful.

In contrast, the 'hoolivan' received a negative response, except as
a visible deterrent in areas known for disorder, such as city
centres.

Plqr-offs - the officers representing clubs Involved In the new
p1*y-off system of promotion and relegation had found the games
required special policing because of the emotive Implications of
the results. All the games had to be treated as top gradefixtures
with the consequent police manpower and financial Implications.
Mr. Phillips pointed out that this system of play-offs had been
organised without any consultation with the police and as the
Football League received 50K of the gate receipts, It m*y be that
the full costs of policing these fixtures should be borne by the
League.

Two clubs (Crystal Palace, Birmingham) had experienced further
problems with the play-offs. Neither club was directly involved,
but both their grounds had been selected for the 'finals'. At
Crystal Palace no consultations had taken place with the police and
the game had been arranged for a Friday night, a night that Is
never used for games because of joint car parking arrangements with
a local supermarket. At Birmingham the ticket allocation was split
50:50, giving 12,500 to both Leeds and Charlton fans, although
Leeds alone requested 30,000.

All ticket matches - the stipulation of an all ticket match does
not help policing unless a capacity crowd attends. Often tickets
are obtained by one team's fans for areas reserved for the other
team's fans with the consequent policing problems. To reduce this
                                              Document No.   3   CONT’D




problem it is essential to police the ticket sales at both outlets.
For the first game of the season, 2/3,000 Leeds supporters arrived
at the Blackburn ground without tickets and because of the public
disorder potential were allowed in. This set the tone for the
season for these fans and they frequently       arrived ataw*y grounds
in large numbers without money or tickets In an attempt to force
the police ground commander into allowing them admittance. The
meeting agreed that this was a difficult situation to resolve, but
felt that a firm stand should be taken and entry refused, the
consequent problems outside the ground being resolved by prior
planning. The police must be seen to 'win' In these situations.

Late kick-offs - another situation where supporters were seen to be
forcing the police into taking action against their better
judgement. It has become increasingly apparent that large numbers
of spectators are arriving extremely late at the groud, this may be
related to the restricted access to alcohol In grounds and the
prohibition on taking alcohol Into grounds.        Because of the
potential for disorder amongst those waiting entry, police ground
conunders have       occasionally requested that the kick-off be
delayed. It was the opinion of the meeting that this pressure
should not be acceded to In future, the police should not be
dictated to by supporters.

Turnstile searching - there was no pattern adopted by Forces in
searching at turnstiles, some did it routinely at every match,
whilst others did it at specific matches and yet others hardly at
all. There was some confusion as to what powers the police had for
conducting such searches and Mr. Phillips explained that there were
none under P.A.C.E. and that In his opinion, the widely accepted
'power* under the Ground Regulations would give little protection
In law. He explained that the Home Office had been pressed for a
ruling but refused to be drawn, suggesting that If there was a
problem in this respect the police should provide evidence of It.

(i)    Miscellaneous:

       Crystal Palace and Reading use dedicated staff at football matches
       and the former has a special overtime allocation for policing
       football.

       Stoke had the problem of fans hiring vans from firms many "lies
       away to travel to aw*y games, thus avoiding the Intelligence
       system.

       South Yorkshire had problems with fans In transit using Ml
       services, but pointed out that vehicles turned back must be
       pci iced.

       Portsmouth warn the players, referee and officials before the game
       that any misbehaviour on the pitch will result In that player being
       arrested or ejected, either at half or full time. West Bromwich
       Albion do the same but would only take action after the match.

       Birmingham had found that hooligans were now paying for the most
       expensive seats where policing was at Its lightest.

       Ipswich insist on a stewards' handbook.

       Reading had a membership scheme operated by a magnetic card to open
       gates. However, technical problems and lack of publicity «ade it
       difficult to work.

       Bradford found that the hooligans had studied police tactics and
       realised that after the police horses followed the crowd, no more
       police officers were about. They then re-appeared and created
       disorder.

3. Exclusion Orders

        Inspector Harrison, Greater Manchester Police, gave details of the
legislation and procedure to be adopted In recording and retrieving current
                                                                           Document No.      3        CONT’D^

4. A.C.P.O. Document 'Policing Football1

        Mr. Philips explained that the section in the A.C.P.O. Public Order
Manual headed 'Football Hooliganism' had been re-written, and that 1t was
M s intention that this document should be updated annually. All present
were given a copy of the re-wrltten section for their perusal.

5. C.C.T.V.

        At last year's Football Conferences, Mr. Phillips Indicated that he
would approach Mr. Anderton (Chairman of the Hooliganism at Sporting Events
Sub-Committee), with a view to establishing a Working Party into the Police
Use of Video Evidence. Members of that Working Party were present to
answer any questions from those present, they also showed a video
explaining their work and produced a written section 1n the A.C.P.O.
Document 'Policing Football'.

Detective Inspector Ross, West Midlands Police, gave a presentation of his
enquiry into the public disorder during the Birmingham -v- Leeds match on
the 11th May, 1985.

6. Wewbership S d w e s

        Mr. Phillips explained that the Government and Football League had
                                                                                                           fi
agreed a 50% of capacity membership scheme without consulting the police.
However, all schemes must be ground specific and each club had been asked
to submit their proposed plan to the Football League after consultation
                                                                                                           tP
with the local police. Some clubs were proposing to go ahead without
photographs on the membership cards, which would only mean that a
legitimate card has entered the ground, not necessarily a legitimate
carrier. Police Forces should pressure clubs insisting on membership cards
with photographs.      To assist the membership scheme, the Football                                       I
Association had agreed to change its rules regarding the allocation of
tickets for F.A. Cup ties. Until the schemes had been produced and had
been seen In use next season,little more could be said, but the situation
                                                                              Document No.       3        CONT




 r e q u i r e d c a r e f u l m onitoring to avoid u n e n forc e ab le schemes being f o i s t e d on
p o l i c e and s p e c t a t o r s a t th e s t a r t of next season.


7. Travelling Fans

        Inspector Temporal, British Transport Police, gave a synopsis of
the season, stressing the 1nreas1ng use of video recording at railway
stations, and showing a video tape to stress the point.

8. Intelligence Gathering

           Superintendent McCrone and Chief Inspector Hoskins (Metropolitan)
 explained their system of intelligence gathering _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ They claimed
 considerable success both 1n retrospective arrests for offences committed
 and for anticipating and preventing disorder.

         Chief Inspector Garrett, West Midlands Police, explained a similar
 system used in his Force and again was able to claim great success In both
 areas.

         Throughout the meeting the use of spotters                     was
 identified as an area of considerable benefit, and an area of expansion 1n
 most Forces. For example, at          the use of                  together
                                                persons being arrested for
              and woundlngs. At            the same combination resulted 1n
 24 persons being charged with

 9. Conclusions

         Mr. Phil!1ps explained that the use of
                     was 1n order as long as they plugged into crime
 operations taking place and were not involved 1n creating such operations.
 He agreed that there were two levels of Intelligence and It was the second
 level, that of                                                    based on
 football clubs, which required expanding. This Intelligence was mainly
 concerned with                                                      at the
 grounds. To record, disseminate and process this national Intelligence, he
fe lt   th e re was a s tro n g argument f o r a n a tio n a l c e n tr e .   There was s tro n g
agreement from th e m eeting f o r t h i s s u g g e s tio n .


        Since the inception of P.A.C.E., Mr. Phillips suggested,
interrogation evidence had to be replaced by 'caught in the act1 evidence,
which was ideally suited to C.C.T.V. He accepted the distinction between
recognition (picking out somebody you already know) and Identification
(picking out somebody only previously seen once and for a short time), and
agreed that we should concentrate on recognitions from video recordings of
disorder at football.

        There was a strongly identfied need from members of the meeting for
training of C.C.T.V. operators. Mr. Phillips thought that the Working
Party might look at this area and come up with a training package.

        Mr. Phillips asked the meeting whether they had found it useful and
whether it should be continued. There was a strong positive reaction to
both enquiries, the only criticism being that their own Inputs had taken
too long.

        Mr. Phillips closed the meeting and thanked all those present for
their attendance and participation.

                     HELD AT R.A.F. CARDINGTON. BEDFORDSHIRE
                    ON WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY 1ST/2ND JUNE. 1988


The meeting was chaired by J.S. Evans Esq., Deputy Chief Constable, Surrey
Constabulary and Assistant Chief Constable J.D. Phillips, Greater Manchester
Police, performed the duties of Secretary.


The only club not represented was West Ham United.    Watford, Portmouth and
Chelsea (relegated from Division 1). However, Middlesbrough, Aston Villa and
Millwall (promoted to Division 1) had representatives at the meeting.

1.     Opening Address


      Mr. Evans opened the meeting, welcomed all present and introduced Chief
      Constable A. Dyer, Bedfordshire Constabulary.


      Mr. Dyer welcomed everyone to the meeting.        He emphasised the need to
       critically examine the current method of policing football matches and
      expressed his disappointment in the lack of support and evidence given to
       the Luton Scheme which had been successful in diminishing the hooliganism
      element in the ground and in the town on match days at Luton, and asked
       for officers at the meeting to carefully consider whether the present
      method of policing football matches was right.         He conveyed his good
      wishes and hoped it would be a good meeting.


      Mr. Evans thanked Mr. Dyer for his warm welcome.     He stated that the past
      season had been uncontraversial apart from the play-offs at the end of the
      season and the result of the trials of the covert operations in London.
      This presented a need for the police to address the way the hooliganism
      problem associated with football was policed, and gave an outline of the
      programme agenda which appeared to answer this point.


2.    Update of the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee Meetings on HooHtran-inm at
      Sporting Events


      Mr. Phillips related to the minutes of the last meeting.    The first point
      concerned an examination of the membership scheme and alternatives like
      the Luton scheme.
                                                      Document No.    3   CONT’D~


                                                                                    r
He referred to____________ of the research group at Leicester University
studying these methods and pointed out the merits and disadvantages of the
alternatives to the present system. He pointed out that the problems of
football hooliganism did not only relate to this country, but to other
European countries and even in China and Russia.


Mr. Phillips then expanded upon the options to policing football, i.e.,
continued containment and its cost; a far greater level of enforcement and
attacking target hooligans and gangs through intelligence methods, rather:
than accept and condone the present standard of belligerance; the Luton
Scheme with exclusion of away supporters.       Other points being considered
by the Sub-Committee were the membership schemes; reciprocal membership
schemes; and covert operations discussed in more detail later on in the
meeting.   Mr. Phillips stated the Sub-Committee was preparing a document
on best practice in covert operations and the introduction of a National
Football Intelligence Unit which was presented later on in the meeting.
Mr. Phillips briefly outlined the progress of the working party on
C.C.T.V., hand-held video and still photography and highlighted the
practical legal issues.    Photographic evidence gave dramatic results in
court and this was an area to be studied.         He mentioned policing the
European   Championships   and    B.T.P.’s   involvement   as   the   British
correspondent to the TREVI organisation; the Sir Norman Chester Centre for
football research which was largely funded by the Football Trust had
circulated a questionnaire which was supported by          the A.C.P.O. Sub-
Committee, concerning a membership scheme.       Mr. Phillips then expanded
upon the work of the Football Trust and in particular in relation to
transport problems in which the Trust were willing to help the police.    He
asked that Chief Officers should write to him if they had problems in this
respect.


Coach Operators


Inspector Provoost (G.M.P.) gave a brief overview of the structure of the
Traffic Commissioners and a resume of a sequence of events that led to the
publication   of   the A.C.P.O.   conditions,   circulated by   the Traffic
Commissioners as a guideline to coach operators and later questioned the
effectiveness of the guidelines.                                                I
                                                          Document No.     3       CONT’D



He stressed the importance of co-ordinating the responses from football
commanders on the problems of causing coach operators to comply with the
guidelines, in order that a concerted effort could be made to bring this
to the attention of the Traffic Commissioners who may then provide
effective enforcement against rogue coach operators.


Match Information and Intelligence


Mr. Phillips outlined the problems associated with football hooliganism
which related to "gang tactics" and "strategies” and questioned how well
the police knew unruly elements that attended football matches on a
regular basis.    He emphasised the need to form an intelligence system and
identify the hooligans.       This could be done by using C.C.T.V. systems
effectively with trained operators, and surveillance teams.           He questioned
whether it was sufficient to rely solely on a match information officer
and stated that the hooligans needed to be photographed and identified.
Intelligence was about knowing the structure plans, tactics, and identity
of the organised gangs who were creating a serious problem.


The point was raised that the problem does not often occur with the home
team supporters on their own ground or town, but whilst at away venues and
enroute to and from these venues.


The   use   of   spotters   was   mentioned   but   Mr.    Phillips      queried    the
effectiveness of this if an intelligence system was not fully established.


Covert Policing


Inspector   Exton    (G.M.P.),    highlighted   the
associated with             policing and stressed the necessity of
                                       Also how essential
programme was throughout the operation, and especially after the operation



He related the hooligans perception of the police and how they obtained
operational information from police officers at numerous football matches,
and how they assessed the weaknesses of police operations under the
protection of relative annonymity.
                                                        Document No.    3     CONT’D




Inspector Exton also emphasised the number of crimes committed by football
hooligans which were not related to football by the police because the
time and location of the crime was outside match times.         Some incidents
exposed the vulnerability of police officers, poor communications and a
lack of interest of individual officers.                                            1
A video presentation showed an incident of a pre-arranged battle between
Manchester United and City factions some distance away from the football
match at half-time, which confirmed the organisation of hooligan gangs to           I
promote violence.


C o n s t a b l e t h e n gave a slide presentation on a hooligan gang who had      1
recorded their acts of violence and other crimes with photographs and
newspaper cuttings which had been siezed by the police.                The slides
depicted the gang engaged in "battle", photographing their victims, and
mixing with police officers.       He also showed illustrations of how the
hooligans   concealed   their   weapons   emphasising   the vigilance       to be
undertaken by    police officers     conducting   searches,   particularly at
turnstiles.


Mr. Evans summarised on the importance of good match briefings with visual          «
aids and hard core intelligence.    The merits of using police Officers of a
particular standard for football matches and of using where possible, the
same officers in specific posts and areas of football grounds.


Superintendent Martin (Metropolitan), apprised the meeting on the position
of the recent covert operations in the Metropolitan Police area and
reassured the meeting that covert operations would continue.


C.C.T.V. Operator*s Training Course


Chief Inspector Ross (West Midlands), gave a brief outline of the course
curriculum and explained the evidence gathering techniques taught on the
C.C.T.V. and hand-held video operator's course and the area of conflict
that is likely to occur when the ground commanders require the cameras for
purposes other than evidence gathering.        He pointed out that trained
camera operators were to focus upon a certain area until they were                  I
satisfied they had recorded sufficient evidence. Ground commanders must
appreciate that incidents could not be captured in every part of                    I
ground at any one time and that it was better to record at least one                /I:

C.C.T.V. Operational Systems


Mr. Phillips gave a brief resume of the history of the installation of
C.C.T.V. and the inadequacies of the present fixed systems outlining         the
dangers of adding to these systems without expert technical advice.           He
recommended the portable video camera equipment which was on view and
stated it would accomplish the pictures required for evidence that the
fixed systems failed to produce. The portable camera would not replace '
the fixed systems but complement them.


He explained that the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee were in the process of^rf
recommending to the Football Trust the formation of a technical committee
which would give advice on the best practical methods of enhancing
existing C.C.T.V. systems efficiently and economically.             Mr. Phillips
stated that it wasn't enough to rely upon improved video equipment and
trained operators.        He suggested a strategy should be adopted by ground
commanders in setting roles and training staff.          He emphasised the need
for a C.C.T.V.     team with a director,         (where possible the football
intelligence officer) a camera operator and a photographer for still
pictures. The team should be used in conjunction with an arrest strategy
by deploying an arrest team and a follow-up enquiry team for post match
analysis. The arrest strategy would be dependent upon the video evidence
and other related matters.


Mr. Phillips added it was necessary to sustain a reasonable level of
successful prosecution from video evidence to prevent the credibility of
C.C.T.V. diminishing.


Membership Scheme and Peat Marwick Report


Mr. Phillips gave a brief resumg of the membership scheme and of the Peat
Marwick Report of which the main recommendations in the report had been
circulated.   He stated the main difficulty was the configuration of the
football grounds and also that reciprocal schemes meant that grounds had
to be divided into segments which each required toilets, refreshment bars
and other facilities which were not always available.


An open discussion on this subject then took place on the problems
encountered by various ground commanders.       The points discussed were lack
of   consistency     in     the   schemes;   financial   implications;
                                                      Document No. 3     CONT’D




requirement; computerised turnstiles; logistical problems, suspension of
the scheme for major games; no interest from the clubs; the Luton Scheme;
introduction legislative measures and cost effectiveness.


Referees' Guidelines Violence On The Field


Mr. Phillips gave a brief summary upon the circulated paper containing the
guidelines which have subsequently been ratified by the.A.C.P.O.-Council.
The guidelines were produced as a result of a meeting with representatives
from the Football Association, Professional Footballers' Association and
the Referees and Linesmen Association in which concern was expressed as to
the different practices and standards adopted by various ground commanders
and   that    police officers   needed   to be   cognizant of    the Football
Association's disciplinary system.       Mr. Phillips said he had pointed out
to the Football Association that the police would not allow any other body
to have the right to decide to investigate criminal matters at football
grounds in England and Wales.


The guidelines were welcomed as a measure of uniformity of police action.


Issues Relating to A.C.P.O. Document 'Policing Football'


Mr.   Evans invited members at the meeting for their comments upon any of
the   items in thePolicing Football booklet and added that there would be
an update on the C.C.T.V. section incorporating the availability of
training courses.


Photographs


The question as to the authority for the police to take photographs of
persons ejected from football grounds was raised.      It was suggested that
such authority could be incorporated in the club's ground regulations.


Spotters


Mr.   Evans statedthere was a mixed response to this aspect and advised
that they should only be used with the ground commanders approval.        He
believed the system had merit.
                                                    Document No. 3     CONT’t)



Briefing


Mr. Evans stated that there was a need to remind officers of their common |j
courtesies as complaints are made about the attitude of some officers.
Suggested that a plan of the ground and immediate vicinity should be         l|
available. Perhaps a laminated card with a plan of the ground on one side 3
and the ground regulations on the other.


Exclusion Orders


Problems were occurring, particularly in London where photographs were not
a requirement on the Court order.   It was suggested that where possible*
photographs should be taken at arrest centres which would obviate the
requirement at court.


A recommendation be made for a minimum of 6 copies of the photograph to be
taken for distribution.


The meeting agreed that the exclusion orders should be for a minimum of
one season for them to be effective.


Derbyshire and West Midlands stated they had meetings with the magistrates
and Crown Prosecuting Solicitors reminding them of their powers under the
Act.


Debriefings


Mr. Evans pointed out that debriefings with supervisors was vitally
important in order to improve upon policing operations.


Coach Operators


Chief Inspector Jordan, (Metropolitan - Millwall), suggested the role of
the Traffic Commissioners should be included.
                                                       Document No. 3      CONT’D




Safety of Sports Grounds


Mr. Phillips stated that ground commanders should inspect details of the
certificate annually and submit recommendations for work perhaps to be
carried out incrementally so that it doesn't overawe the club.          Safety
requirements varied in accordance with changing patterns of use.


Chief Superintendent Bruce, (Cleveland) stated that they had prepared a
maintenance and good practice schedule which he was willing to supply to         V
other forces. The meeting approved of the booklet and found it to be a
useful reference.


The Football Supporters' Associations Suggestions


Inspector Hammond    (Greater Manchester)   informed    the meeting of the
suggestions the Football Supporters' Association had referred to concern
about the policing of travelling supporters in respect of retention of the
away supporters after a match, and how it affected those who had to maifo
their own way unescorted back to cars and vans parked away from a ground.
Also a method of providing a liaison with the local police at the football
ground.   These points were left for an open discussion.     It was concluded
that travellers should write to the clubs for identified parking places
near to the ground and for the association to appoint a liaison officer
and identify that person with a tabard or armband.


Open Forum


Discussions took place on the problems of the membership schemes and the
Luton Scheme and also the cost of policing football matches and the
charges made to football clubs.


Difficulties in respect of charges to football clubs were related by Chief
Superintendent Holford (Nottinghamshire), who were aware of some clubs
seeking legal advice concerning the levels of policing at matches.        West
Midlands stated they were to impose increased charges to each of the six
clubs in the force area.    Chief Superintendent Newlands (Metropolitan -
Arsenal), stated they had reduced costs as a result of ground improvements
which reflected on a reduction in manpower to police the ground.        Also a
vast increase in the number of stewards would replace policing at the
ground, whilst a police contingent remained on standby.            Derbyshire
                                                Document No. 3     CONT’ D




explained their membership scheme and the positive effect on reducing
manpower. Mr. Phillips concluded that he would appreciate any ideas which
could be suggested to football clubs for them to take the initiative in
reducing hooliganism at the grounds.
                                                                             I
Intercept


Inspector Payne, Northamptonshire, explained the 'Intercept' operation
                                                                             I
they had introduced at the Motorway Service areas and the motorway
junctions throughout Northamptonshire in response to the trouble they had
experienced with football supporters enroute to other destinations and
                                                                             i
advised other forces of the information they required and also of the
benefits that could be reciprocated (telephone P.C.


Mr. Evans suggested the operation should be included in the 'Policing
Football' booklet.


European Championships


Inspector Temporal, (B.T.P.), gave an update on the current position of
the championships and the policing operations.


Mr. Evans closed the meeting by conveying his appreciation to those
present for their attendance and participation and looked forward to the
meeting next year.

                     2ND DIVISION FOOTBALL LEAGUE
                POLICE COMMANDERS AND LIAISON OFFICERS
                    HELD AT THE GREATER MANCHESTER
          POLICE TRAINING SCHOOL. SEDGLEY PARK. PRESTWTCH
               ON WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY 8TH/9TH JUNE. 1088.



The   meeting was        Chaired    by     J.D.    Phillips      Esq.,    Assistant         Chief
Constable,      Greater     Manchester         Police      and      Inspector         Hammond,
Greater      Manchester    Police         performed     the     duties     of    Secretary.


All the football clubs in the                     second   division       for   the    forth­
coming season were represented.



OPENING ADDRESS


Mr. Phillips opened the meeting and welcomed all present.                    Copies of the
following papers were distributed and later referred to in the meeting:
Recommendations     of     the     Peat     Marwick     Report;     Police      Involvement
concerning Player Behaviour; CCTV Operators/Intelligence Officers Course
Curriculum; Requirement for a National Football Intelligence Unit and
A.C.P.O. Public Order Guide Policing Football.


UPDATE OF THE A.C.P.O. SUB-COMMITTEE MEETINGS ON HOOLIGANISM AT SPORTTNfi
EVENTS


Mr. Phillips related to the minutes of the last meeting in which the
membership scheme and various alternatives such as the Luton scheme had
been researched by John Williams at Leicester University.                       He pointed
out the problems of football hooliganism did not only occur in this
country, but also in other European countries, China and Russia.


Mr. Phillips stated the Sub-Committee was preparing a document on best
practice in covert operations and the introduction of a National
Football Intelligence Unit.              He outlined the progress of the CCTV
Operations    and   Intelligence         Officers     Course     and     highlighted        the
practical legal issues.          Photographic evidence gave dramatic results in
court and this was an area to be expanded.                     The Sir Norman Chester
                                                                         Document No.     3       CONT’D


 Centre for football research which was largely funded by the Football
 Trust had circulated a questionnaire which was supported by the A.C.P.O.
 Sub-Committee, concerning the membership scheme.      Mr. Phillips then
 expanded upon the work of the Football Trust, and in particular in
 relation to the transportation of fans, with which the Trust were
 willing to help the police. He asked that Chief Officers should write
 to him if they had problems in this respect.


COACH OPERATORS
                                                                                        . . .     .    '   ..


Inspector Provoost (Greater Manchester) gave a brief overview of the
structure of the Traffic Commissioners and a resume of a sequence of
events    that      led    to     the publication          of    the A.C.P.O.         conditions,
circulated     by    theTraffic Commissioners               as      aguideline        to coach
operators and later             questionedthe effectivenessof the guidelines.


He stressed the importance of co-ordinating the responses from football
commanders on the problems of causing coach operators to comply with the
guidelines, in order that a concerted effort could be made to bring this
to the attention of the Traffic Commissioners who may then provide
effective enforcement against rogue coach operators.

MATCH INFORMATION AND INTELLIGENCE


Mr. Phillips outlined the distinction between 'match information' and
'intelligence'.           The match information had reached a good standard.
This was based on match reports and liaison officers ability to forecast
crowd    numbers,     modes       of   travel   and    the demeanour of               fans      etc.
Intelligence        was         relativelypoor,       it        should        focus     upon the
identification of football hooligans, their associations, strategies and
plans.    Mr. Phillips pointed out the problems associated with football
hooliganism which          related     to   "gang tactics" and              "strategies"        and
questioned how well the police knew unruly elements that attended
football matches on a regular basis.              He emphasised the need to form an
intelligence system and identify the hooligans.                      This could be done by
using CCTV systems effectively with trained operators, and surveillance
teams.    He questioned whether it was sufficient to rely solely upon a
football liaison officer and stated that the hooligans needed to be
                                                   Document No.   3    CONT’D



photographed and identified.    Problems with hooligans seldom occurred
with the home team supporters in the home ground, but in the vicinity of
the ground and at away venues and also enroute to and from away venues.

CCTV OPERATORS AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS COURSE


Chief Inspector Ross (West Midlands) expounded on the course curriculum
and the development of the course, explaining the evidence gathering
techniques to be learned using the hand held video camera and CCTV
systems.   He commented on the likely areas of conflict between the
ground commanders requirements in respect of deployment and that of the
intelligence officer in respect of evidence gathering.     Chief Inspector
Ross pointed out that operators were trained to focus upon a certain
area until they were satisfied they had recorded sufficient evidence.
Ground commanders must appreciate that incidents could not be captured
in every part of the ground at any one time and that it was better to
record at least one incident with good evidence.    If the evidence was
good, but insufficient for an immediate arrest, then a strategy should
be set out to record a sequence of incidents committed by the same
people on different occasions in order to substantiate an arrest and be
in a position to present the evidence before the court.


Chief Inspector Ross then presented a video recording which illustrated
a comparison of video recording by untrained and trained operators which
emphasised the benefit of training.   Another video presentation showed
how the action of certain people in the ground could be monitored and
used as evidence, also identifying targets at close range with a
portable video camera which could either be hand held or mounted on a
tripod in a selected part of the football ground.         He stressed the
importance of training officers to analyse video tapes and photographs
after each match to detect various incidents and to establish the
identification of the perpetrators.

Inspector    Exton   (Greater Manchester)   highlighted    the problems
                                                          the necessity of

                               the operation, and especially afterwards
before the [



Inspector Exton conveyed the hooligans perception of the police and how
they obtained operational information from police officers at numerous
football matches and how they assessed the weakness of police operations
under the protection and guise of relative annoymity.


Inspector Exton remarked on the number of crimes committed by football
hooligans which the police failed to relate to football, because of the
time and location of the incident occurring outside the stadiums and
often before and after match times.          Some incidents exposed the
vulnerability of police officers, poor communications and a lack of
interest of individual officers.


A video presentation showed an incident of a pre-arranged battle between
Manchester United and City factions some distance away from the football
match at half-time, which confirmed the organisation of hooligan gangs
to promote violence.


QUALITY AND ASSESSMENT OF CCTV SYSTEMS


            (S.R.D.B.) gave a video presentation which illustrated the
faults and deficiencies of CCTV installations at 55 football grounds in
England and Wales.     This was a result of a questionnaire sent to each
respective police force at the request of A.C.P.O. in order to ascertain
the effectiveness of CCTV systems at each football ground.           The faults
included interference from radio transmission, damaged film, worn film,
dirty lens, poor maintenance, and inadequate lens.        Only one recording
was suitable for evidence gathering purposes.    69% were barely adequate
for command and control purposes and in most cases they were of little
value.


            suggested a number of ways to improve the existing systems.
The most important thing was to have the cameras properly and regularly
serviced.    A number of cameras needed to be remounted and resited and
                                                 Document No, 3      CONT’D


the majority required larger lens.   He emphasised the importance of the
care of video tapes, correct storage and a limit on maximum usage.       He
stated that an answer to the problem, would be to use the portable video
camera on display, for evidence gathering purposes and outlined the
added advantages of the camera.


Mr. Phillips gave a brief resume of the history of the installation of
CCTV and the reasons for the inadequacies of the present fixed systems
for evidence gathering purposes and the Football Trust’s disappointment
in the systems being used for command and control.     He pointed out the
dangers of adding to these systems without expert technical advice,
despite many claims that police forces were satisfied with what they
had.   He recommended the portable video camea equipment which was on
view and stated it would accomplish the pictures required for evidence
that the fixed systems were incapable of producing.          However the
portable camera would not replace the CCTV installation, but complement
them.


Mr. Phillips informed the conference that the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee
were in the process of recommending to the Football Trust the formation
of a technical committee which would give expert advice on the best
practical methods of enhancing existing CCTV systems efficiently and
economically at individual grounds and also the equipment required at
grounds where CCTV systems had not been installed.


REFEREES GUIDELINES VIOLENCE ON THE FTEI.D


Mr. Phillips gave a brief summary of the document 'Police Involvement
with Regard to Player Behaviour on the Field of Play' which has
subsequently been ratified by the A.C.P.O. Council.   The guidelines were
produced as a result of a meeting with representatives from the Football
Association,   the Professional Footballers Association,    the Football
League and the Association of Football League Referees and Linesmen in
which concern was expressed as to the different practices and standards
adopted by various ground commanders and that police officers needed to
be cognizant of the Football Association's disciplinary system.      Mr.
Phillips said he had pointed out to the Football Association that the
police would not allow any other body to have the right to decide to
investigate criminal matters at football grounds in England and Wales.

 C.C.T.V OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS


 Mr. Phillips reiterated the importance of using trained operators for
 gathering evidence and identifying target hooligans.     However it wasn't
 enough to rely upon improved video equipment and trained operators.     He
 suggested a strategy should be adopted by ground commanders in setting
 roles and training staff.     He emphasised the need for a C.C.T.V team
 with a director, where possible the football intelligence officer, a
 camera operator and a photographer for still pictures.    The team should
 be used in conjunction with an arrest strategy by developing an arrest
 team and a follow up enquiry team for post match analysis.     The arrest
strategy would be dependent upon the video evidence and other related
matters.     Mr. Phillips related to a video film depicting belligerant
behaviour and offensive language where a female and a girl left the
ground because of the intollerable behaviour of nearby supporters.    This
kind of evidence could be recorded on video and taken to court.      It was
no longer necessary for us to accept a higher threshold of bad
behaviour.     If we set standards, we can arrange a suitable arrest
strategy.   Post match analysis was the key to tackling the growing
problem of unacceptable behaviour.


Mr. Phillips concluded it was necessary to sustain a reasonable level of
successful prosecution from video evidence to prevent the credibility of
CCTV deminishing.


Members of the Working Party answered questions appertaining to the use
of CCTV and portable video cameras for evidence gathering.
Mr. Phillips informed the conference of the working party preparing a
report into the police use of CCTV and still photography in which the
Director of Public Prosecutions had been consulted in respect of the
presentation of best evidence.


Mr. Phillips also informed the meeting of the functions of the proposed
Technical Committee of the Football Trust and stated that future
applications for CCTV enhancement should be made by the police on behalf
of the clubs through the Technical Committee who will give advice and if
necessary visit the grounds.
                                                      Document No.    3


 It was suggested that the Football Summary reports include whether
 arrests involved the use of CCTV in order to assess the effectiveness of
 CCTV.


 Problems were being encountered in the reciprocation of video recordings
 for the police of the visiting football club.            The introduction of
intelligence officers would probably alleviate this problem.


Video    recordings    and   video    printer   photographs   to     assist    with
identification of targets and incidents at railway stations were
available from the British Transport Police.


          suggested monochrome cameras were more effective in low light
level video recordings. The Kodakchrome B 3200 film was good for covert
photography in low light.


The conference was made aware of the vulnerability of the camera
operators when the hooligans realised they were being filmed.                 Where
this was the case, it was suggested that the recommended portable video
camera kit could be mounted on a tripod in a safe area of the ground.
The kit was capable of presenting sufficient pictures for identification
of any part of a football ground if positioned in the centre line area.
If necessary negotiations should be made with football clubs to provide
a platform in one of the stands where the camera kit could be set up.
In many cases hard wiring could be laid from this point to the police
control room.


Mr. Phillips informed the conference that the Crown Prosecution Service
advised officers to look at a video recording a number of times before
writing notes in their pocketbook if this was practicable.

OPERATION 'RED CARD*


Chief Superintendent Mills (West Midlands) gave a brief account of the
reason for establishing a covert policing operation.          He pointed out
that    there was no evidence        to identify any particular political
affiliation.   Operation 'Red Card' was staffed with C.I.D. officers
because of the intelligence on the crime that was identified with
football hooliganism.        The operation began in January,          1987, and
concluded in October, 1987, when 183 officers were engaged in arrests
                                                              7
                                               Document No.   J    CONT’D



and search of premises. The offences consisted of conspiracy to commit
affrays, public order offences and woundings. He stated lessons were
learned and two similar operations had been conducted since ’Red Card'.
Incidents had occurred at football matches in the City of Birmingham
that did not involve Birmingham City Football Club but did however have
a historical     link which resulted in the Birmingham fans becoming
involved in a planned operation to attack the other clubs supporters
where serious wounding occurred.       As a result of the intelligence
system, in one particular case, an arrest was made within 24 hours of
the incident and a youth related to the 'Red Card' operation was now
serving a term of life in youth custody.


Detective Sergeant ______ (West Midlands) gave a commentary on a video.
film which was an extract of the evidence used for Operation 'Red Card'.
He concurred the necessity of having trained camera operators and
pointed out a member of the Birmingham 'Zulu Warriors' using a camera
during an incident in the City Centre, when Watford played Tottenham at
Villa Park.     He also explained how the gang organised and planned the
event.      Also a scene depicted the hooligan element in the football
ground staging a mock fight to draw an officer into an ambush.


__________ stated that tKe media were made aware of the 'Red Card'
operation and full coverage was given resulting in a lot of publicity
which unfortunately boosted the morale of the 'warriors'.     Consequently
the media were embargoed for the Wolverhampton operation, with the
result of the Wolves hooligans being extremely disappointed in not
getting the same publicity.


Constable          (Greater Manchester) gave a slide presentation on a
hooligan gang who had recorded their acts of violence and other crimes
with photographs and newspaper cuttings which had been siezed by the
police.     The slides depicted the gang engaged in battle, photographing
their victims and also their members mixing with police officers during
football match operations.    There were also slides illustrating how the
hooligans conceal their weapons, particularly with the knowledge that
most officers use gloves when conducting searches at turnstiles.
Mr. Phillips added that this particular gang lived in Greater Manchester
and affilliated themselves to Leeds Football Club in particular and
visited other clubs as well and conducted many incidents in places
unconnected with football events and subjected the public to street
terror.


THE FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS' ASSOCIATION SUGGESTIONS


Inspector Hammond    (Greater Manchester) informed the meeting of the
suggestions the Football Supporters' Association had referred to
concerning the policing of travelling supporters in respect of retention
of away supporters after a match, and how it affected those who had to
make their own way unescorted back to cars and vans parked away from a
ground.    Also a method of providing a liaison system with the police at
the football ground.   These points were left for an open discussion.   It
was concluded that travellers should write to the clubs for identified
parking places near to the ground and for the association to appoint a
liaison officer, identifying that person with a tabard or armband. The
club should be made aware of the supporters suggestions and that extra
stewards be on hand to deal with enquiries and the liaison officer.     It
was also acknowledged that police officers should be properly briefed
and familiar with the vicinity of the club.


MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES


Superintendent Jolly (Suffolk) related an incident concerning policing
the Ipswich -v- Millwall game where public service vehicles and mini
buses were stopped and searched on the A12 and A45 in pursuance of the
Sporting Events    (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985-      Difficulties were
experienced concerning the interpretation of the Act in respect of the
adaption of transit vans carrying 8 or more passengers.         There were
inconsistencies in various Magistrates decisions.


Superintendent Stuart (South Yorkshire) related a similar case in which
the Crown Prosecution Service withdrew the case.     Two doubtful issues
arose.    Whether the vehicle was carrying passengers for hire or reward,
and the interpretation implied with regard to adaption.     It was agreed
that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be consulted.

Motorway     Interception.    Chief   Inspector   Hogg   (Northamptonshire)
explained the ’intercept' operation they had introduced at the Motorway
Service areas and junctions throughout the county in response to the
trouble they had experienced with football supporters enroute to and
from other venues and asked other forces to forward information on coach
and private transport routes.     He enlightened the conference upon the
benefits that could be reciprocated from this operation each match day.

MEMBERSHIP SCHEMES/PEAT MARWICK REPORT


Mr. Phillips gave a brief resume upon the situation of the Membership
Scheme by referring to the Luton Scheme, the conclusion of a research
study conducted by]                at Leicester University and the present
membership schemes.    He stated the main difficulty was the configuration
of the football grounds and also the reciprocal scheme meant that
grounds had to be divided into segments which each required toilets,
refreshment bars amongst many other facilities which were not always
available.


An open discussion on this subject then took place on the problems
encountered by various ground commanders.      The points discussed were
lack of consistency in the schemes; financial implications; minimum
requirement; computerised turnstiles; logistical problems; suspension of
the scheme for major games; no interest from the clubs; the Luton
Scheme; introduction of legislative measures and cost effectiveness.

OPEN FORUM


Exclusion Orders


The Conference was in agreement that Exclusion Orders issued for 3
months were relatively ineffective.


Difficulty had been experienced in obtaining photographs.    Mr. Phillips
stated that he would approach the Football League with a request for the
provision of photographing persons ejected from the football grounds to
be included in the football clubs ground rules.
Play-Offs


Concern was expressed at the minimal amount of notice given to police
forces concerning match play-offs.


Assistant Chief Constable Elliott (West Midlands) stated problems had
occurred in policing the play-offs matches at Walsall and asked that
this subject should be broached at the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee meeting in
September.


Closure of Public Houses


It was suggested that where trouble is anticipated at certain venues,
consideration should be given to liaising with breweries upon the
closure of public houses in the immediate vicinity of football grounds.
Licensing magistrates in York had at the request of the police ordered
the closure of certain public houses where trouble had ensued in the
past.
                                                                          *



Mr. Phillips very briefly reiterated the main points of the conference.


Mr. Elliott remarked on the conference being very stimulating and of
enormous value and conveyed his appreciation on behalf of all in
attendance for a successful meeting.       Mr. Phillips expressed his
appreciation to all those in attendance and for their participation, and
closed the conference.

UPM1E OF THE A.C.P.O. SDB-COMTITEE MEETINGS ON HOOLIGANISM AT SPORTING
EVERTS                                                              —
Mr. Phillips informed the meeting of the current situation concerning
the Membership Scheme, the Luton Scheme and the area of research
undertaken by ___________ at Leicester University.


He stated that the Sub-Committee had been commissioned with preparing a
document on best practice in covert operations and the introduction of a
National Football Intelligence Unit.            He briefly explained the reason
for the development of a C.C.T.V. Operators and Intelligence Officers
Course and of the future courses to be held in Manchester.              Mr. Phillips
informed the meeting of the Football Trust’s function and of the areas
in which they were willing to assist the police.


OOACB OPERATORS
Inspector Provoost (Greater Manchester) gave a brief overview of the
structure of the Traffic Commissioners and a resume of a sequence of
events    that   led   to   the   publication    of   the    A.C.P.O.   conditions,
circulated by       the Traffic Commissioners         as    a guideline   to coach
operators and later, questioned the effectiveness of the guidelines.


He stressed the importance of co-ordinating the responses from football
commanders on the problems and features of coach operators to comply
with the guidelines, in order that a concerted effort could be made to
bring this to the attention of the Traffic Commissioners, who may then
provide effective enforcement against rogue coach operators.

         POLICING
1
I


    He related the hooligans perception of the police and how they obtained
    operational    information   from police officers   at numerous   football
    matches, and how they assessed the weaknesses of police operations under
    the protection of relative annonymity.
J
    Sergeant          emphasised the number of crimes committed by football
    hooligans which in the past have not been related to football by the
    police, because      the time and location of the crime was outside match
    times.      Some incidents and tactics at football grounds exposed the
    vulnerability of the police and poor communications.    In some instances,
1   a distinct lack of interest by individual officers was evident.
J
    Sergeant        gave an example of the value of having a good football
    intelligence system and how essential it was for it to link up to a
    national network.    He also gave a brief account of operation ’Red Card’
    together with a video presentation of the operation and an extract of
    the video evidence which emphasised the importance of having trained
    camera operators.


    FOOTBALL RELATED INCIDENTS
    Constable           (Greater Manchester) gave a commentary on a slide
    presentation concerning a hooligan gang in the Greater Manchester area
    who affiliate themselves mainly to Leeds United and to a lesser extent
    Liverpool and other clubs in the Football League.      Some of the crimes
    were unrelated to football.    The majority of slides had been reproduced

     xaaples of concealment of capons on the body which were undetectable
 when police officers executed body searches wearing gloves, particularly
 at turnstiles.


 BATCH INFORMATION AND INTELLIGENCE
 Mr. Phillips outlined the distinction between 'match information’ and
 -intelligence'.          The match information had reached a good standard.
     is was based on match reports and liaison officers ability to forecast
 crowd       numbers,   modes   of travel and          the demeanour     of     fans          etc
Intelligence        was     relatively     poor,     it   should   focus            upon          the
identification of football hooligans, their "associations", "strategies"
and plans.         Mr. Phillips pointed out            the problems associated with
football hooliganism which related to "gang tactics" and "strategies"
and questioned how well the police knew unruly elements that attended
football matches on a regular basis.               He emphasised the need to form an
intelligence system and identify the hooligans.               This could be done by
using CCTV systems effectively with trained operators, and surveillance
teams.       He questioned whether it was sufficient to rely solely upon a
football liaison officer and stressed                  the hooligans needed to be
Photographed and identified.             Problems with hooligans seldom occurred
with the home team supporters in the home ground, but often in the
vicinity of the ground and at away venues and also en route to and from
away venues. An intelligence officer could be trained to analyse video
recordings, identify targets and administer f o ll ow ,m    I                   P I   A f l
CCTV OPERATORS AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS COURSE
Chief Inspector Ross (West Midlands) expounded on the C.C.T.V operators
and intelligence officers course curriculum and the development of the
course, explaining the evidence gathering techniques to be learned using
the hand held video camera and C.C.T.V. systems.        He commented on the
likely areas of conflict between the ground commanders requirements in
respect of deployment and those of the intelligence officer in respect
of evidence gathering.     Chief Inspector Ross pointed out that operators
were trained to focus upon a certain area until they were satisfied they
had recorded sufficient evidence.       Ground commanders must appreciate
that incidents could not be captured in every part of the ground at any
one time and that it was better to record at least one incident with
good evidence.       If the evidence was good, but insufficient for an
immediate arrest, then a strategy should be set out to record a sequence
of incidents committed by the same people on different occasions in
order to substantiate an arrest and be in a position to present the
evidence before the court.


Chief Inspector Ross then presented a video recording which illustrated
a comparison of video recording by untrained and trained operators which
emphasised the benefit of training.     Another video presentation showed
how the action of certain people in the ground could be monitored and
used as evidence,     also identifying targets at close range with a
portable video camera which could either be hand held or mounted on a
tripod in a selected part of the football ground.          He stressed the
importance of training officers to analyse video tapes and photographs
after each match to detect various incidents and to establish the
identification of the perpetrators.


QUALITY AND ASSESSMENT OF CCTV SYST0B
           S.R.D.B.) gave a video presentation which illustrated the
faults and deficiencies of CCTV installations at   55   football grounds in
England and Wales.     This was a result of a questionnaire sent to each
 respective police force at the request of A.C.P.O. in order to ascertain
 the effectiveness of CCTV systems at each football ground.            The faults
 included interference from radio transmission, damaged film, worn film,
dirty lens, poor maintenance, and inadequate lens.            Only one recording
was suitable for evidence gathering purposes.            69% were barely adequate
for command and control purposes which would complement the existing
system and in most cases they were of little value.


            suggested a number of ways to improve the existing systems.
The most important thing was to have the cameras properly and regularly
serviced.       A number of cameras needed to be remounted and resited
the majority required larger lens.          He emphasised the importance of the
care of video tapes, correct storage and a limit on maximum usage.             He
stated that an answer to the problem, would be to use the portable video
camera     on   display,   for   evidence    gathering    purposes   which   would
complement the existing system and outlined the added advantages of the
camera.


CCTV QPtRATML SYSTEM
Mr. Phillips gave a brief resume of the history of the installation of
CCTV and the reasons for the inadequacies of the present fixed systems
for evidence gathering purposes and the Football Trust's disappointment
in the systems being used for command and control.           He pointed out the
dangers of adding to these systems without expert technical advice,
despite many claims that police forces were satisfied with what they
had.     He recommended the portable video camera equipment which was on
view and stated it would accomplish the pictures required for evidence
that the fixed systems were incapable of producing.                  However the
portable camera would not replace the CCTV installation, but complement
them.


Mr. Phillips informed the conference that the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee
were in the process of recommending to the Football Trust the formation
of a technical committee which would give expert advice on the best
                                                         Document No. 3



practical methods of enhancing existing CCTV systems efficiently and
economically at individual grounds and also the equipment required at
grounds where CCTV systems had not been installed.


Mr. Phillips reiterated the importance of using trained operators for
gathering evidence and identifying target hooligans.     It wasn't enough
to rely upon improved video equipment and trained operators.              He
suggested a strategy should be adopted by ground commanders in setting
roles and training staff.    He emphasised the need for a C.C.T.V team
with a director, (where possible the football intelligence officer) a
camera operator and a photographer for still pictures.    The team should
be used in conjunction with an arrest strategy by deploying an arrest
team and a follow up enquiry team for post match analysis.     The arrest
strategy would be dependent upon the video evidence and other related
matters.     Mr. Phillips related to a video film depicting belligerant
behaviour and offensive language where a female and a girl left the
ground because of the intollerable behaviour of nearby supporters.    This
kind of evidence could be recorded on video and taken to court.      It was
no longer necessary for the police to accept a higher threshold of bad
behaviour.     Post match analysis was the key to tackling the growing
problem of unacceptable behaviour.


Mr. Phillips concluded it was necessary to sustain a reasonable level of
successful prosecution from video evidence to prevent the credibility of
CCTV deminishing.


R P M E S GDIDELINES V I M C E OH THE FIELD
Mr. Phillips gave a brief summary upon the circulated paper containing
the guidelines which have subsequently been ratified by the A.C.P.O.
Council.     The guidelines were produced as a result of a meeting with
representatives from the Football Association, Professional Footballers'
Association and the Referees and Linesmen Association in which concern
was expressed as to the different practices and standards adopted by
various ground commanders     and that police officers needed to be
                                                       Document No.    3




cognisant of the Football Association's disciplinary system.               Mr.
Phillips said he had pointed out to the Football Association that the
police would not allow any other body to have the right to decide to
investigate criminal matters at football grounds in England and Wales.

MEMBERSHIP SCHfflE AW) PEAT MAHWICK REPORT
Mr. Phillips gave a brief resume of the membership scheme and of the
Peat Marwick Report of which the main recommendations in the report had
been circulated.   He stated the main difficulty was the configuration of
the football grounds and also the reciprocal schemes meant that grounds
had to be divided into segments which each required toilets, refreshment
bars amongst many other facilities which were not always available.


An open discussion on this subject then took place on the problems
encountered by various ground commanders.     The points discussed were
lack of consistency in the schemes; financial implications; minimum
requirement; computerised turnstiles; logistical problems, suspension of
the scheme for major games; no interest from the clubs; the Luton
Scheme; introduction of legislative measures and cost effectiveness.

T.I.E.V.I.
Superintendent King (BTP) explained the composition and functions of
T.R.E.V.I. of which Assistant Chief Constable W.I. McGregor (BTP) is the
British correspondent.   He gave a brief overview of the information and
intelligence collated and disseminated by British Transport Police
gave an update on the European Championships.


He urged intelligence officers and liaison officers to be aware of
travelling fans and targets in relation to international matches as they
were more difficult to identify, when in the main they attend matches in
London and other countries.   He then gave a video presentation on the
T.R.E.V.I. organisation and B.T.P. involvement.
EXCLUSION OF M Y SOPPORTERS
Chief Superintendent Moore (Devon and Cornwall) related the experience
of   the   exclusion   of   away   supporters    at Torquay   United   and   the
effectiveness and reason for this.       The exclusion of supporters was an
agreement reached with the club in exchange for reduced policing costs.
Although there were a few weaknesses in the system for membership,
overall, the scheme was a success and suggested similar agreements could
be reached with other clubs.


MSS DPOSH) BY M E FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION AID IfiCDE
Chief Superintendent Stainton        (Cumbria)    posed   the difficulties   in
policing football grounds and fixtures which involve a visiting club
whose supporters have been banned and arrive on mass.             In order to
maintain A.C.P.O.’s policy of keeping out banned visiting supporters,
the cost of police resources were high.         The repercussions from setting
up road blocks and keeping out banned spectators upon unsuspecting
neighbouring police areas, together with allowing the spectators into
the ground were discussed at length. It was acknowledged there was no
easy solution to this problem but unless excluded supporters were
confronted they would continue to travel.         It was necessary to have a
plan to deter and contain them.


AU. TICKET FHTORES BPOSH) BY FA/USAGDE
Chief Inspector Richardson (Durham) related experiences of difficulty in
policing football matches that had been declared 'all ticket* by the
FA/League without consulting the relevant police force as to whether
such a restriction could be enforced successfully.         Small clubs do not
apply these restrictions rigidly because of their financial position.
Therefore he requested that A.C.P.O. consult with the authorities on
this subject.
HEPEERSHIP SCHEME - A COMON POLICY
A discussion took place on the effectiveness of the membership schemes
which have been undertaken by the clubs.       It was generally acknowledged
that many of the schemes created more problems than they solved.


D IM M
Superintendent    Finch   (Northamptonshire)      explained   the   motorway
'intercept' operations introduced at the Motorway Service areas and
junctions throughout the county in response to the trouble they had
experienced with football supporters en route to and from other venues
and asked, other forces to forward information on coach and private
transport and enlightened the conference upon the benefits that could be
reciprocated from the operation each match day.       Information should be
forwarded to PC


THHODta BOOTES OF TOAVEHING SUPPORTERS
Superintendent    McGinn related similar problems with        football   fans
stopping off in unsuspecting villages and towns, in a force area that
had no involvement with football, being subjected to hooliganism.         He
requested other forces to notify one another of routes fans are likely
to take when travelling to away fixtures in the form of a pre-warning
system.   Prior warning would allow for police resources to be deployed
effectively.      It was suggested that covert teams could help in this
respect and also whenever the National Unit was in being.


Mr. Phillips in closing the conference asked if those in attendance had
felt the conference was of benefit.
It was concluded that the conference was a success.     However, it was
acknowledged that it would be of greater benefit if separate conferences
could be arranged for the two divisions as there was a lot of business
to discuss and to which more depth could have been given if the
conference had been extended another day.

                                      FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL

1             I write In my capacity as Chairman of the ACPO Sub-Comnlttee on
J       Hooliganism at Sporting Events. You will appreciate that whilst we have
        had sight of the report of the Minister's Working Party for some little
        time, the text of the Bill Itself has only just been made available. I
        thought It right therefore to convene an urgent and special meeting of the
        Sub-Committee so that you could be Informed of the view within ACPO. This
        has been done.
1
j             The comments I make here are still based upon limited consultation
        and I am, therefore, copying this letter to my colleagues. If there are
        other matters that they feel you should be madeaware of I will write to
        you again. For the present, however, you nwy consider It expedient to
        consider our deliberations.
              Comments on the Bill have been sub-divided so as to distinguish the
        general from the particular and to reflect the clear distinction In the
        Bill between Part I and II.

        IN GENERAL

                  The success of the proposals will eventually be judged at two levels.
                  First, there Is the question as to whether this legislation wlll:-

                  (a) progressively remove hooligans from the football grounds and
              (b) deter the allegiance of those who are Involved In trouble and
        violence but do not necessarily attend matches.
              Second, and 1n a sense more fundamentally, the question remains
        whether or not the simple mechanics of processing membership cards through
~1 ^   turnstiles can actually be achieved.
-J

                                                                                                    ?01
                                                                          Document No. 3




              The Police view over a long period of time has been that these
        provisions are, to a great extent, marginal to the problem, If for no other
        reason than they cannot exclude the possibility of fraud by people who are,
        by definition, hellbent upon defeating the system, and because It wl11 take
        a very long time before a significant number of potential hooligans are
        excluded by the scheme. There are some countervailing advantages:
              (I) the deterrent effect may be considerable;
              (II) the Club disciplinary system may well be able to take strong
                        action on the evidence of C.C.T.V. alone;
               (III) the game will be able to exclude many of the very worst
                        offenders.
               Nonetheless, the Police view Is that mary ofthe              1***1 **
        have a lre a d y taken, which are surnnarised In the attached
        having a significant effect and are far more critical to the problem of
        hoollgalnlsm.
               The question, however, which most concerns Police officers plates to
        the efficacy of the technology. The Bill naturally does not detailI how It
1       will work or what Is required of It but. It Is clear that,            t* the
J       robust and virtually trouble-free, It will be cou"ter“P ^ c t i ve’ f
        worst case It could be massively counter-proactive. At tte least each
1       turnstile must have access to a national d^»aKaea *nH "u<t be able *°
        survey that database almost instantaneously.
                                                                     Aston Villa has, i
J        believe over 150 turnstiles. Halifax Town may nave but few but its
         ^rangeier^tsare .tosay the least, basic. Inevitably the syste. has to be
         universal.
J              All our experience to date has been that computer salesmen have
         offered «uch and delivered little. The p°11ce.t“ V                      ed t H T

PART I

      Part I of the Act 1s enabling legislation and to a great extent many
of the Issues which will be crucial to the Police role in the scheme will
be matters of detail which the "administrator" of the schemes will have a
responsibility to draw up. So Important are the working details that the
Police feel there must be an opportunity for the Service to be fully
consulted. It may be appropriate for Section 4 Sub-Section (1) to require
the administrator to consult the Police and Sub-Section (2) of the same
Section to allow for the Secretary of State to take into account any
observations made by the Police. A similar caveat might apply to any
alteration of the scheme.
      Section 5 Sub-Section (5) creates an offence which entails a
reasonable degree of investigation and It could be that many applications
will In some respect be suspect or at least require clarification. The
Police view 1s that the "administrator" of the scheme should have a
responsibility for determining such facts as It 1s possible for him to
establish and that 1t should be open to the "administrator" to lay
Informations 1n respect of offences disclosed.
      Whilst 1t is recognised that the "Relevant Evidence" Schedule 1s
consistent with the provisions of the Exclusion Orders Scheme It Is
considered that this schedule might appropriately Include offences under
Section 91 Criminal Justice Act 1967.
      Section 8 of the Bill refers to conditions which will attach to a
licence to admit spectators. Sub-Section 10 of the same Section makes It an
offence for a "responsible person" to contravene any of the conditions. As
there 1s a possibility that police officers may* in accordance with the
Working Party Report, allow the scheme to be suspended In the Interests of
safety and order, they may stand In difficulty In respect of this
Sub-Section. It 1s therefore suggested that the recommendations In the
Working Party Report viz: Chapter 4 paragraph 27 of the Working Party
Report (regarding allowance for breakdown of machinery and other short term
emergencies beyond the Club's control), be Included In the Bill.

PART II

      It has to be said that the proposals 1n Part II of the Bill were
never discussed by the Working Party and are only loosely related to the
arrangements for controlling spectators envisaged in Part I of the Bill.
The Bill refers only to "reporting agencies' functions"; more pointedly the
somewhat bland question and answer note from the Department of the
Environment suggests that the Police may be a candidate for this role, yet
the detail of the Bill seems to envisage that the Police will play a major
part.
                                                          Document No.   3




      There are two arguments which need to be put with some strength.
Firstly, to take on the responsibilities of being a reporting agency in the
terms outlined in the Bill will be a very considerable task with an
on-going administrative commitment and the potential for considerable
investigative enquiries* The Police have always taken the view that any
provisions must be considered In the context that the Police commitment to
policing football is already very considerable and cannot be Increased
without loss to the quality of service elsewhere. It has also to be noted
that none of these provisions In any way benefits the policing In the areas
for which Chief Constables have a responsibility* If there are to be
benefits, they relate on the one hand to our national reputation, which is
not a matter for local police, and on the other for the policing of towns
In foreign lands. Our first position istherefore that the Service regrets
it cannot support any Police involvement as the -Reporting Agency" or the
deployment of resources undertaken as a result ofthe agency s
respons fbflTETis7- - - - - - - - - - -
       Regardless of the Police role the Reporting Agency seems to have been
conceived from the outset with only the Police In mind. The notions that
reporting will be a local responsibility and that passing Information to
reportees will be a local responsibility Inferthat police stations will be
the point of reference. We are bound to ask, "What other institution will
be open at material times, available in every locality and capable of
 registering convicted criminals?"
       There are many practical difficulties:
(1)     The numbers of people who may be subject to an order of this kind
       could at least equate with those who are excluded under the scheme
       and therefore potentially could be thousands;

(2)    Reportees would be distributed randomly throughout the United
       Kingdom;

 (3)   Some Reporting Agencies might have no more than one or two persons to
       cater for but would have to retain some sort of administration and
       staff preparation to fulfil their responsibilities;

 (4)   Conversely, In other areas, there may be a number of clearly
       undesirable people, who will have to register and report at one time;

 (5)   How will proof of service be established In respect of notification
       of designated games?

 (6)   What sort of enquiries would be necessary to determine deliberate
       failure to comply?

 (7)   What level of enquiry would there be to prove offences against people
       who did not comply?
                                                          Document No.   3




(8)   In the event of English Clubs regaining entry to European competition
      there could be up to thirty designated matches per season.

      On the face of it,1t would seem far more sensible for there to be a
central agency who would receive a record of all restriction orders. There
does not seem to be any merit or purpose In the subject having to report to
a local agency and register any change of address locally. A central
registry could, by use of word processors, Immediately distribute, by post,
notifications and state the location of the agency to whom the subject
should report. Equally a central registry could send notification to the
"agency" who would In due course return a record of reporting or
non-reporting. Further enquiry could be by Immediate summons. For this to
work the onus of providing a current address to the registry and of
receiving documentation would have to lie with the subject.
      In short, If there Is to be such a system It would be much better run
centrally. It Is regrettable that this Issue was not discussed properly
before the Bill was drafted so that this argument might have been
considered, but it Is hopefully not too late to consider amendment.

Dear Colleague,

                   FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL

You will be aware that the Football Spectators Bill which
contains  provisions   relating  to membership schemes is
currently being progressed through Parliament.

At   a  special   meeting  of   the  ACPO  General  Purposes
Sub-Committee on Hooliganism a t Sporting Events, it was
agreed that I write a letter to           at the Home Office
indicating the views of the Committee in response to the kev
elements of the Bill.

A copy of that letter is enclosed for your information.

Should there be any comment or observations you wish'to make
on either the letter or the provisions of the Bill itself I
would appreciate an early response.

Dear
                          FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL
.. „ 1 ,wr1te fn "V capacity as Chairman of the ACPO Sub-ComatttM on
Hooliganism at Sporting events.
      Further to my discussion with Lord Ferrers and In pursuance of
discussions I know you have had with David Phillips X am now In a position
to write to you further about the "agency" role.
      Me have taken into account that the provisions of Part II were In
part at the instigation of ACPO (I had personal discussions with Grahai
Angel and suggested that the Bill should Include some provision to deal
with the problems of hooliganism abroad). He recognise too that the
           can only be effective If they are backed by the sanction of
criminal liability and that therefore, those In breach of the system will
ultimately be subject of police enquiry.
      As a. general rule Chief Constables are reluctant to accept new
policing responsibilities without additional resources and this was a
matter of concern. Equally however we are not convinced that the
alternatives to police responsibility In this area are attractive. On
balance therefore I am prepared to give guarded support to the notion of
the Police service accepting the "agency" role with certain substantial
provisos.
      In the first case, as I know you are well aware. It Is essential that
the arrangements for registration and notification are dealt with centrally
and not at local Police Stations. It Is considered that the a<krin1stration
system should be so geared that the only responsibility at local Police
Stations would be to check-1n reportees and forward a record of their
attendance at material times. It may also be that Chief Constables should
be In a position to Instruct the Central Agency as to which Police Stations
will be available as "reporting" stations. In short the Central Agency
would receive Information In respect of those subject to "orders" direct
from the Courts; the reportee would be responsible for notifying to them
any change of address; the Central Reporting Agency would maintain an Index
and notify reportees of "designated matches"; and the reportae would be
required to present notification documents to a Police Station where
particulars would be recorded and returned to the Central Agency*
      Clearly the funding and organisation of the Central Agency whilst it
would be soae kind of Police responsibility has yet to be determined and i f
It 1s to be a part of the proposed "National Football Intelligence Ui1t"
additional budgettlng will be required 1n due course.
      I m conscious that these Matters are of s o n urgency and you will
realise I have not had the opportunity to consult ay colleagues widely
although the natter has been before the Sub-Conrfttee. Nonetheless In the
drcumtances I feel It appropriate to write In these terns and trust you
will recognise that we have c o w soae way to Meting the requlreMnts of
the B111.
      I hope you realise that this conprarfse would very w c h depend upon
goodwill In ensuring that the conditions to which I have referred can be
accomodated.




                              Yoursyjslncerely,

  I. i Tne policing of processionai footbaii. matches has
  oeen a major poxice commitment over laany years. As the

  a", general resource ot' tne service required to
  maintain order.          EquaLLy as Police tactics and
  precautions nave specialised to deal with the problem
  so perversely the ’tactics' ot the hooligans ^ 4
    aried to tiad ways roumi those controls. Ynis nas had
  Ue eftect of spreading the problem such that in some
  matches policing begins as the fans depart their home
  town aud continue until tney return. The planning o£
  suea games is extensive and wide-ranging, weening to
 .anticipate the problems that may arise witu supporters
    U Ui»a a variety 01 route;} and forms of transport aad
 who nay.be m transit Cor ,00st 01 the day. In tnese
 circumstances tne duration oi tue game at the ground
  tcseit is jusc one aspect of the entire operation.


 t'J ,• T"% di•
              st,rib,^^:io,1 of league sides means tnat
poncing tootbaxi is a problem which hits the Police
service somewhat disproportionately.      Footbaii Clubs
cend to be concentrated in the larger comwrbat Ions
which are anyway hard pressed by Higher rates of crime
and simply tae scale or demand for everyday police
services. Policing football is at least a nine monthly
commitment? heace for some forces tue demands made by
loocoaii materially affect the general Level of
poncing.

1.3    It is of course not the policing of football
crowds but tne hooligans amongst tnera which are the
mam proolem and whilst perhaps obvious it should be
stated tnat ic is hooliganism in -sport not crowds at
sporting events which takes up police time in such
large measure.

 1.4. Hooliganism itself is not too difficult to
Characterize although its causes may be complex and
mucn more duticulc to analyse. Suffice it to say that
the Police deal m realities and for the Poiice tne
tas*. is tairiy clear cut - to maintain order and crowd
saiety by reducing the potential for conflict and
conrrontation.

 1.5. Some aspects of the phenomenon of hooliganism
however warrant discussion because their recognition
has consequences for policing tactics.         Ot most
•■.xgnificance is that the overt acts of violence and
displays or drunken aggression, the obscene chanting
and gesturing by way of challenge to the opposition all
or which we racogaise as footbaii hooLiganism, are
transgressions committed by young males loosely
organised out in common purpose and sheltered by the
cover of a large crowd.

may aavj no wl ia to cause trouble, which is both tae
problem xor trie Police and the opportunity for tne
ol fender.

1.7    It snouid ai*o be said that within the larger
crowd of supporters there are groups, often formed
casually but some with detinite membership and existing                  ...
a> 'unofficial supporters clubs', who clearly are bent                  ,'vf
on trouble and have little interest in cue game.Tnis
has been seen in the way they deliberately get Into cue

I.b     A great deal has beeu done to contain tne          ■             ’>
behaviour o l crowds but tae manner in which violence
has spilled over the barriers ia recent watches
3uo<§*2ts that there is a need to do more than reduce
tiie opportunity Cor coniiict and in positive terms
concentrate policing tactics to remove that sense ot
relative .immunity tue hooligan depends upon by being
part ot a large crowd. It is precisely in these areas
much of the ACPO current thinking is directed and tuis
report will seek to address these matters ia detail.

l.'J Lastly by way ot opening remarks it Ls proper to
make the point that crowd trouble ana crowd safety are *
not issues that can be separated. Whilst the terrible                   ftf
consequences oL the Bradford tire are at tn e frone of
our minds the fatal casualties of the 'Heysel Stadiuo
disaster' were the victims of crowd disorder.      the
segregation of supporters may be necessary in the
interests ot crowd control but terrace violence Like
fire can cause panic which in a crowd can be so
dangerous. Tue proper balance between policing and the
need to be able to evacuate large numbers In an
emergency nas to be our objective.

2.1 Although each Chief Constable has an individual
operational responsibility and whilst a variety of
local considerations may allow for variation there is
nonetheless a good deal of common practice and
co-operation nationally in the Policing of footbaiL.

2.2 Muca of the current practice is based on guidance
to Senior Poiice Officers publisned by the ACPO and ic

2. 11 Some groups of supporters are escorted to "t
from the stadium to limit trie opportunities to
misbehave and to protect them from rival fans.
Arrangements of this kind are almost always made in
respect of train loads.

Flash Points

2.12     Experience of policing football allows the
officer in charge to identifytf lasti points where
confrontation between rival fans may occur.  Equally
the Poiice have to examine routes followed by
supporters and give atteution to any derelict sites
from wiiicn mj.3siies or offensive weapons can be
gathered by hooligans.

Stadium Searches

2.13 Wailat it is a responsibility of the Club and its
stewards to ensure the ground is in good snape before a
game it is common practice for tfie Police also to make
an inspection paying particular attention to any
damaged fencing or litter which can be used as
missiles.

Ofxensive Weapons

2.14     Tnis report will consider later the vexed
question of police searcnes of football supporters.
Regardless it is always a matter of concern for the
Poiice that hooligans may be armed with offensive
weapons and the instances of stabbing and slashing
particularly by tne use of Stanley knives and modelling
wiives, has increased disturbingly in the last year.

        Crowd Distribution - Segregation and Ground Policing

        2. ia Safety certificates under the Safety or Sports
        Ground Act 1975 impose limits on each section of Cue
        ground.lt   i:» a Club responsibility to monitor
        turnstile totalisors and crowd movement around tne
        ground to maintain these limits and customary foe the
        Police to ensure they are adhered to. In co-operation
        with the Clubs the Police have sought to eusure
        facilities allow for the immediate segregation of rival
        supported, as they enter the stadium.          This is
        generally by way of barriers and it is important that
        cacn section of the ground ha? its own refreshment
        facilities, toilets, entrance and exits. Pitch barrier
        fencing is general but not universal.           Current
        experience indicates that it may be desirable at most
        grounds and it remains a matter for Police Forces to
        determine in conjunction with others under the terms of
        tne Safety of Sports Grounds Act.

        2.19 It is common practice for the Police to supervise
        gangways,bars, refreshment areas and toilets.

        2.20    Some officers are deployed in and around the
        ground for the duration of tneir tour of duty and they
        are generally charged to the Club. During tne course
        of tite game the number of officer* inside tne ground is
        increased by those on traffic points and other duties
        outside. Iney generally become a reserve to the ground

Post Match Escort

?. 23 In some circumstances and depending upon safety
considerations the Police Commander may decide co hold
'away supporters' in tne ground until suing of the home
support is clear. Equally arrangements are usually made
to escort certain sections of the crowd to Railway
Stations and Coach Parkfi. It cuere are several coaches
or even large numbers ot coaches it is common practice
to assemble them as a convoy and escort them
c.trough traffic ensuring free flow so they do not
Become a target.

Traffic Arrangements

2.24 For each match there is usually a fairly detailed
traffic plan, seeking co keep some emergency route clear
and facilitating ready clearance of traffic.      Police
ability to manage the traffic problem may be severely
limited by the geographical iayout about the ground.
Many football grounds were built many years ago in the
midst     or a cooplex of narrow streets and terraced
iiousing.
SECTION THREE -RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

3.1.    Recent events marked by tragedy anddisorder have
resulted in much public and political concent        and
debate. Government has urged all those involved with
footbalL and its problems to examine ’new initiatives
and has itself taken urgent legislative .steps. Many of
the suggestions that have been examined are matters
about    which the aCPO and tne Police Service have
already developed views in. the light of experience.

i.o    A British Rail baa on alcohol consumption on
'footoali specials' has had a marked affect out its
success has led those element* against whom it was
directed to seek, other forms of transport, suca as
coaches and se 11:-drive hire vans.       This kind ot
displacement makes policing that much more difficult
with oany more away supporter* arriving at grounds nuca
earlier tnan scheduled and in smaller groups.

3.9   The Criminal Just Lee (Scotland) Act 19»j0. waicn
was 'Craned to tackle "Similar problems is considered to
have had a good measure or success and its terms, under' ..
most conditions., ban aiconoi to supporters on public
transport and at grounds.       Tne cuitooa and ground ' \f,-

extension ol the Act tnrougnout tiie J.K,        was1 not   Sm
considered appropriate oy tno ACPO.

3. lu The Sporting Events (Control ot Alcohol etc..)
Bill picks up most of the relevant provisions oi tne
Scottisn Acc extending the bail ou alcohol consumed by
supporters to trains carrying supporters to and icoin
designated sporting events. (Seif drive hire vans have
not been included.) There are similar restrict tons at     >
grounds as to drunkenness; possession oi' 'controlled
couLainers'; and possession oi alcohol, but exemption
is allowed under strict conditions. The ACPO support
these provisions and the powers of enforcement but
there is some reservation aoouC M o extent of              t"
restriction oi sale at grounds. Private Members boxes,
an important source oi revenue to CLubs and
troubletree.are the only parts ov the grounds currently
licensed which will be excluded from exemption. This
uowever is more a difficulty for the Football Clubs as
cue Police who wouid only be affected if these
conditions result in lost revenue to tne clubs many of
waom already struggle to meet the cost of policing.

3.11    In short excessive drinking is considered a
contributory factor to nooliganlsm and tae new
provisions should assist tae Poiice in controlling the
problem. The detail of the Bill however is questioned
and no doubt such difficulties reflect the speed with
which the legislation has been progressed.
Meabersnip Card acnemes

3.12 A good deal of consideration has oeen given by
the ACPO Sub-Committee on Hooliganism in Sport to the
question of     'membership cards'     and   'membership
schemes'. in simple terms the theory is that entry to
the Football Ground would be restricted to 'ooua**fide
supporters who would have to apply for aembersnip and
who wouid lose it if guilty of misbehaviour.

     enrolmentstage or because of their sub&equent
     behaviour,

      membership cards or cards in false particulars). Also
      chey nave to obtain sufficient information to cancel
      ttie membership of people who should properly be
     excluded.

     3.16 At the present time guidance to the Police Service
     i.rom the Home Office on the disclosure ot confidential
     information wouid certainly prevent tae police from
     being the intelligence source oc any such sclieme run by
     aprivate commercial interest. £tis difficult to say
     wnac other source of information would be available to
     Che operators.

          There are a lot of other questions :-

          a)       Would cancellation apply to those guilty
                   of acts of nooli&aui.sra outside the ground?

          b)       Would cancellation relate to people charged
                   wicii criminal offences or only after a
                   conv iction?

          c)       Would there be a system of appeal? - ia
                   which case wouid policc officers be called
                   upon    co substantiate    tae cau^e     for
                   excfusion.

          d)      Would cancellation follow from breaches of
                  club rules? - it 30 . how would the breach
                  be estaolished and information passed to
                  the operator?

          e)      Would any system be of value uuless it was
                  universal? - tae main problem relates to
                  away support.

        Early Kick- Offs

        3.21     The Football League have considered arranging
        matches with an early kick- off (generally 11.00am)
        witn a view to diminishing, the opportunity for
        supporters to ootain alcohol.     it was been considered
        that a game played at that time would be less likely to
        attract hooligans or to develop tne rowdy atoospuere
        tnat goes with excessive drinking.

        3.22    The proposition seems reasonable and some games
        have been played on this basis. The problem has arisen
        though chat ou some occasions the nooiigan element
        having attended their own fixture have then gone to
        another game being ,>layed in the afternoon with the
        sole intention evidently of causing trouble.

        3.23     Such schemes are therefore supported provided
        tney are arranged in consultation with tiie Police to
        avoid possible clashes oc that kind or other local
        considerations

    CCTV

    3.27 Most of the foregoing issues relate one way or
    another to ways in whicn access to a football ground
    can be limited or controlled.   The development of CCTV
    iia-s as its primary purpose control of behaviour once
    people are inside the stadium, and as they enter or
    leave.                                -

    3.28 A good deal of careful consideration lias already
    been given to this question and in i964 the Football
    Trust    funded   experimental             schemes   in   Greater
    Manchester, the West Midlands, and Edinburgh.               These
    schemes are still in tne process of being evaluated and
    mucn has been learnt.                   In addition the use of
    Individual video cameras at some matches such as the
    fixture between H u d d e r s f i e l d Town and Leeds United has
    shown that excellent evidence capable of persuasive use
1   in the Courts can be obtained.
J
    3.29 T:ie ACPO Sub-Committee on Hooliganism in Sport iias
    been monitoring these developments and as a matter of
    policy has taken the view that the development of CCTV
    for both management information and evidence gathering
    is beneficial and should be pursued.

    3.30 The ACPO's Sub-Committee representative to the
    Foot DalL Trust has attended a number of meetings
    concerning t;ie funding of such scneme3 and at present a
    Working Party has taken on the job of developing a
    specification as a matter of urgency.

         SECTION FOUR - INTELLIGENCE

         4.L Mosc of che foregoing coament relates to issues
         tnac have ouen specifically raised by Government and
         outside agencies.   Prior to tiie recent troubles
         nave focused attention, the ACPO Sub-Committee oit
         initiative of the Chairman had sought to re-examine
         Police Intelligence networtc for dealing with Joo
         nooligani.su. A structure based on local li
         officers is already in being and has proved oi
         vaiue over the years but the Sub Commit tee felt
         the information being red to them needed to be iapro
         and the system of intelligence gathering uiade
         comprehensive.

         4.2 • Since that time all Police Forces have ___
         consulted and the framework, for a new intelligence
         system based on the comprehensive documentation of
         crowd behaviour at eacn match has been drawn up. It is
         anticipated tnat the new intelligence system Kill be
         operating Lrom the commencement ot che coming season.
         SECTION FIVE - POLICE POWERS

         5.1   Tactically the Police have a number of options '>*'
         open co then when dealing wich disorderly behaviour at
         football matches. One option is to eject individuals
         whose conduct may have fallen short of that which
         constitutes a criminal offence but Is nonetneless in
         breach of grouud rules and regulations.

         5.2 Generally speaking however where there is evidence
         ol a substantive offence, offenders are charged.
         Offences of 'assault' ('woundings',' actual bodily
         narm', 'Police Assault'), 'possession of offensive
         weapons' and 'criminal damage' are well established in
         tne criminal law and subject to the quality of evidence
         Police powers to deal with these circumstances are not
         in question.    There are however some difficulties of
         enforcement in respect of Public Order offences and
         recent decisions of the Courts have made Section 5 of
         t.ie Public Order Act 1936 more difficult to prove. It
         is recognised that the old common law offences are
         unwieldy although the preventive powers available to
         the Police for breaches of the peace are valuable in
         some circumstances. However, in the light of Che White
         Paper - “Tne Review of Public Order Law* - there is no
         great merit in arguing current legal interpretation of
         public order offences.    By and large the ACPO gives
         support to the new proposals for offences of Riot;
         Violent Disorder and Affray.    Some of these offences
         have a dear relevance to the prooiea of hooliganism
                                                                 Document No,                               CONT’ D

       to make them efrective.    The problem ot resource and
       finance is dealt with elsewhere (Paragraph 7.1).

      5.5. Customarily supporters have been searcned by
      police for ofiensive weapons or missiles as they have
      thought necessary beiore they enter tne ground.       In
      aiidost ail cases this has     been withconsent and lias
      been largely unchallenged.       however the Police and
      Criminal Evidence Acc I9l>4 has laid down precise
      guidelines regarding police searches which in essence -r-
      require an orrlcer to have reasonable grounds for
      suspecting that he will find stolen or prohibited
      articles before he carriesout a search       and in ail
      cases a written record of the search cause be made and
      handed to the individual concerned.

      5.ft   Ic is tne «riew of the ACPO that routine,
      preventive searches of football supporters are not
      adequately catered for in the PACE Act notwithstanding
      tne proviso in the Act's Codes of Practice w.iicn
      seemingly exeapts from ita provisions searches at
      Spores Grounds with consenc or as a condition of entry.
      The ACPO cake che view chat an 'authorisation' to
      search on tnis basis cannot be recommended because ic
      enjoins a police power too closely to the football
      clubs and could therefore place in jeopardy a
      conscaDie's posicion in law should his action be
      Challenged.

      5.7    As to the enforcement of ’Public Order Law' at
      major sporting evencs tae Police Commander at the scene
      nas always to be aware of practical considerations.
      Every arresc takes one or more officers from the line

Safety Certificates

6.1 Since the Safe cy of ..Sports Grounds Acc
 into force in September 1975. a system of
 been established whicn provides that de^iisna
•stadia .must comply with aii the terms arid Con
a certificate issued by the local authority.     1
 tiie Act has applied to aii first and Second Division
Footbaii League grounds and will ooon oe extended to
 include Third and Fourth Division grounds in the coding
 football season.     The Government has said tnat it
 intends also to extend its provisions to Rugby League
Club ground* sometime in the near future.

o.i An issuing local authority is required to consult
wich the Chief Constable of the area in which the
ground is located regarding the terms and conditions to
be included before any such certificate is issued.
Although Caere is no limit or restriction on tne
conditions whicn a local authoricy may impose on a
safety certificate, tiie Act requires that certificates
contain conditions about numbers of spectators, number
and sizes ot entrances and exits, fire escapes
maintenance and numbers and strength of crush barriers.
6.3   Whilst tne imput into safety certificates i» a
matter for local authorities after consuitation wich
Chief Constables and otner interested parties, the aCPO
has made recommendations to Chief cconstabies that meet
many of the needs of poiice and should be catered for
in safety certificates.

6.4   The following recommendations are published in
ACPO's notes of guidance for senior police officers:-

     (i) It is considered essenciai that a separate
         police office, clearly signposted, shouid
         be available at the ground. The office
         should provide adequate accommodation for
         enquiries and reporting, and tiie processing
         of prisoners. There shouid be a secure
         decention room for che short term
         accommodation of prisoners. The office
         snouid be sited so that there is adequate
         vehicular access tor the unobtrusive reaoval
         of prisoners.

     stewards are sufficient in number, suitably deployed,

     Again there is suostantiai ACPO guidance as follows :~

            Tiie number of stewards employed by the management
            of the ground should be determined in consultation
            with the police and should be based oh the
            requirement dictated by the structural properties
            of the ground in relation to an average crowd for
            a particular fixture.

            One method of indirect control is provided by the
            Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 at those grounds
            whicn are required to be certified.      The Local
            Authority, before issuing a Safety Certificate, is
            required to consult the Chief Officer of Police
            regarding the terms and conditions to be included
            in the Certificate.

            Persons employed as stewards at footoai.1 grounds
            should be clearly identifiable by armbands, coat
            or other distinguishing feature. They should, at
            all times, be under the direct control of
            supervisors whose identities snouid be made known
            to the police officers on duty at the ground.

            Stewards snouid be distributed throughout tiie
            ground in accordance with a detailed pre-arranged
SI          sciieduie, agreed between tne police and management
            of the ground.

            Their duties   may   be   divided   into    four      main
            categories:-
(a) controlling ov directing members of the public
    w.io arc entering or leaving tiie football ground.

(b) patrolling tiie ground to deal with any emergencies
    e.g. raiding alarms, extinguisning tires etc..

(c) manning entrances, exits and other strategic
    points, particularly exit doors, gates and roller
    shutters which are not continuously open whilst
    the ground is in use;

(d)   undertaking specific duties relating to emergency
      and evacuation procedures.

In particular they may have to undertake the foiiowi
duties:-

(a) man any final exit door or gate witich is locked
    during the game and ensure that at least oue
    steward manning any gate has the key to the gate
    continuously on his person during that time.

(b) open these doors or gates to permit evacuation ia
    an emergency, or, in order to clear the ground at
    Lull time, at a time pre-arranged between the
    police and the management ot the ground.

(c) ensure that ail means of entry and exit are kept
    free from obstacles;

(d) ensure tnat mobile sales staff do not position
    equipment so as co obstruct exit routes.

Stewards play a vital part in the maintenance of public
safety standards at football ground and accordingly
must be physically and mentally fit to assume this
responsibility. They should receive training in first
aid and fire fighcing and snouid also be rehearsed in
emergency procedures.


The importance of the provision of formal emergency
procedures at each gro.und cannot be over emphasized.
Joint consultation in this respect should take place
between police, the management of the ground, fire,
ambulance and other services.     It is essential that
stewards and their supervisors are fully cognisant of
tiie part that they have to play in the plans which are
produced. The management of the ground should ensure
tnat written instructions concerning the action to be
taken in tiie event of an emergency are made readily
available to ail staff and stewards and. in particular,
that all the staff and stewards shouid receive
practical instruction and training appropriate to their
responsibilities in the event of an .emergency;t:;:7rt#::>>

emergencies may be classlted as ’Emergency Stewards *.

        Stewards are vital components of the public safety
        system at football grounds.       They should be well
        trained in emergency procedures wnicn should be cleariy
        defined.     Stewards shouLd be adequate in number,
        physically and mentally capable of performing their
        duties, effectively deployed, efficiently supervised
        and    readily    identifiable.       Police  have    a
        responsibility to advise and encourage the management
        of football grounds in the efficient and effective use
        of stewards. -Although their employment is not directly
        controlled by police, indirect control is facilitated,
        in many cases, by means of conditions inserted in
        Safety Certificates.


        6.6 Whilst ACPO guidance is comprenensive perhaps one
        issue needs to be addressed. Tiiere is at present no
        general system of inspection of stewarding and it is
        considered tiiat a condition shouid be written into
        Safety Certificates requiring Police inspection.

        SECTION SEVEJi -THE COST OF POLICING

        7.1 The cost of policing football is perhaps one of the
        most important issues for the ACPO. It can be argued
        that the sport itself shouid foot the bill but this is
        simply not a practical answer.      A good de«*l oi the
        policing of footbali takes place away from the ground
        and there is no basis tor making charges.           The
        financial status of most foocbalL clubs themselves is
        such anyway that any major increase in policing costs
        would make them insolvent.     In stark reality if the
        Police were to insist upon far greater levels of
        policing at gaines(or indeed charge the clubs for ail
        the officers that now attend) the whole structure of
        the professional sport would have to change.
1.2    la fact tiie Police generally charge tne Ciuo fur
those OLiicers designated to ground duties for cue full
inatca.    Ic is usual practice for the officers oil
outride duties to return co the ground during t.ie game
where chey Lorm a subscanciai reserve - these officers
are noc generally charged for.

7.3 Recent enquiry by tsie ACPG Sub Committee isdicates;
tiiac 36 of the 92 Canon League Clubs were tnen
experiencing difticulty in paying police biiis.       21
Clubs at the cius of enquiry were more tuail three
months in arrears and 14 clubs wore tuan o months.

7.4 The legal oaligation to maintain a proper level of
policing is clear and it football clubs sougut to
Continue wich fixtures without policing tiie power under
Section 10 of Safety at Sports Grounds Act could be
invoked to prevent the game taking place.

7.5'Whilst' both tiie Police and Clubs are making every
effort to deal with their financial difficulties tneJ
problem remains.

7.6    Perhaps t;ie greater financial problem for the
Service is die sheer cost or policing football which
cannot be offset against football clubs. As stated
eariier in this report (paragraph 1.2) the burden falls
uuevenly - Appendix A snows distribution of clubs aa
against nose police forces.     It snouid also be said
that if the Police are to cake new initiatives and .seek
for powerful enforcement of new legislation tills will
in its turn translate into policing costs.v

There are presently two possibilities :

eiCner policing football is specially provided for in
Police budgets particularly by way of an increased
provision for overtime; or football is policed by
reducing the levels of policing elsewhere.

7.7      It is tiie view otthe a CPO tnat this problem is
notsatisfactorily resolved and tnat Forces having a
considerable commitment to footbali need special
provision.

SECTION EIGHT - GUIDAMCE TO CHIEF POLICE OFFICERS

6.1 The Association of Chief Police Officers througn
its system of Committees is      involved in examining
critical issues of Policing policy where there is a
need for common standards or where the problems cross
geographical     boundaries.       Whilstoperational
responsibility is encirely i:i tiie hands of the local
Chief Constable guidance formulated by the Association
is generally achieved by consensus and forms the oasis
of much couuaon practice.

               (viii) The ACPO strongly supports the development
                      of CCTV for evidence gathering and
                      providing management information.
                      Evaluation of early schemes has led to
                      modifications and the ACPO is in
                      consultation with tiie Home Office ’SP.DB’
                      and the Football Trust to develop a
                      specification and extend usage.

          9.4 Section Four - Intelligence

               (i)     Intelligence gathering nats been reviewed
                       and refined and a far acre comprehensive
                       and systematic scheme has been designed
                       and will be operative next season.
          9.5 Section Five • Police Powers

               (i)     It is generally Police practice co
                       prefer charges wiiere there is evidence of
                       a substantive offence although 'ejection*
                       may be appropriate in some instances such
                       as breach of ground rules.

     ( i i i )   P o l i c e p o w e r s of s e a r c h remain.a difiiculty
                 and the ACPO ia not convinced that the
                 terms of tne guidance to the Codes under
                 the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1964
                 resolve this issue. Police powers# based
                 on a condition o£ entry a ^ oot considered
                 a s appropriate.


     (iv)        The ACPO look for support in the positive
                  policing of hooliganism in tne coming
                  season and emphasise the need to curb the
                  rowdy and intimidating ^JiatfioUr Trua
                 which the violence springs. It is
                 anticipated that developments in CCTV and
                  Intelligence wilt make a significant
                 contribution.

9.6 Section Six - Safety of Sports Grounds Acc 1973.

     (i)         ACPO guidance on Sacecy Certificates
                 and Stewards is comprehensive and
                 up to date. The Act provides for
                 local conditions in Certificates as
                 necessary, but the ACPO take tue
                 view that routine police inspection of
                 stewariing shouid be a coadicion.

9.7 Section Seven - Tne Cost of Policing.

     (i)         The cost of.policing whicn is chargeable to
                  Football Clubs is only a pare or the total
                  cost. A nuiaber of Football Clubs are
                  finding great difficulty in paying the .
                  Police although it is noted that tnese
                  charges cnanot be avoided and tne Police
                  would have the power to seek the closure of
                  a ground if it was not adequately policed.

     (ii)        The burden of policing football falls
                 heavily on certain forces, particularly
                 those in large connuroations where other
                 pressures are also great. In times of
                 budgetary constraint special provision is
                 necessary.

9.3 Section Eight - ACPO Guidance to Chief Police
                   Officers

                 ACPO guidance is coiaprenensive and subject
                 of current review.

                             Paragraph 11.3 of the Green Guide reads: wherever
                             possible access roads should provide for the
                             parking of emergency vehicles so that exit routes
                             used by crowds are not seriously obstructed.
                            NOTE: Popplewell Report para 3.35 acknowledges that    'Am
                            parked vehicles did not hinder emergency vehicles
                            at the Bradford disaster and accepts that the
                            implementation of such measures in London and other
                            major cities may prove impossible because of
                            1ocation of the ground.
        RECOMMENDATION 5.   Consideration should be given to making it a
                            criminal offence in,England and Wales-to have a
                            smoke bomb or similar device
                                                     . . at >sports
                                                             .I . . grounds.' .
                            It is important to cover in the criminal i
                            devices which "may do no actual damage t
                            panic which they are likely to engender .
                            spectators is very great" and to also cover ...
                            crowds in which panic can cause death and serious
                            injury. Such an offence should therefore include
                            (a) possession at, in or while attempting to gain
                                entry to;
                            (b) any sporting event, public entertainment,
                                publ1c meeting or procession or public
                                gathering;                 -.<•
                            (c) or at such a place, activates or attempts to
                                activate;                                           :
                            (d) any smoke bomb, pyrotechnic device (e.g.
                                thunder-flash, or explosive firework), flare
                                or any similar article;
                            (e) without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.
                            The qualifying phrase (e) excludes people in such a
                            place who have legitimate reasons for possessing
                            such articles (e.g. where fireworks are part of the
                            entertainment). The wider definition of prohibited
                            articles seeks to include all those which can cause
                            panic through fear of a fire or explosion. The
                            provision covering "activating or attempting to
                            activate" covers such cases as those where a person
                            lights a device held by someone else or is seen to
                            light a device but "possession11 cannot be proved.
                            Such an offence would require a specific power to
                            search, seize and arrest; seizure may be a useful
                            alternative to arrest in minor cases where a
                            juvenile or other person commits the offence
                            through inadvertence rather than culpability.

RECOMMENDATION 6.   Those managing sports grounds not covered by safety
                    certificates should give serious consideration,
                    with the assistance of fire authorities to the
                    presence in a ground of suitable fire-fighting
                    equipment.

                    This 1tern is directed at Sports Grounds Management
                    and the Fire Service.
RECOMMENDATION 7.   Stewards at all sports grounds should be trained in
                    firefighting.

                    This recommendation 1s supported by
                    however, It raises an important question concerning
                    whose responsibility It ought to be to train and
                    inspect stewards (See comments on page 11)
RECOMMENDATION 8.   In designated grounds it should be a term of the
                    safety certi f1cates that an adequate f1rst aid room
                    should be provided.

                    This 1s a matter which receives the full support of
                    the ACPO.
RECOMMENDATION 9.   There should be urgent consultation between the
                    Health and Safety Executive and " the Fire
                    Authorities and Local Authorities as to how best to
                    co-ordinate and communicate their inspection and
                    reports.

                    The first point to be made 1- that a safety
                    certificate is issued by the Local Authority for an
                    "indefinite period". Thereafter, the Green Guide
                    recommends that "a detailed inspection of the
                    ground, including all components and installations
                    should be carried out annually to ensure compliance
                    with the guidelines in this Code." (para 4.1).
                    NOTE: The Green Guide is a voluntary code without
                    legal face.
                    Recommendations made by the annual inspection team
                    may be incorporated into existing safety
                    certificates, "if it appears appropriate to the
                    Local Authority so to do." (para 4.1).
                    It is important that those involved in the
                    certification process should also come together to
                    carry out annual Inspections and that the findings
                    of each team member be communicated to the rest in
                    the form of written reports.           Any general
                    observations affecting other team members
                    responsibilities must also be brought to their
                          I Document No.   ^      GONT’D




immediate attention for whatever action is deemed
appropriate.

Police should comment upon matters such as crowd
capacity, stewarding standards and training,
conduct of bars and refreshment areas, turnstile
procedures, egress and ingress and any other
matters affecting safety and crowd control.
The ACPO recommendation 1s that the annual
inspection be reinforced by a system of
re-certification when the Local Authority
conslder written reports.
Stewards In all grounds should not „           trained
in fire precautions and fire fighting           should
also be trained in how best to                      in
evacuation.

Agreed. The general standards of stewards should ®
be a matter reported on annually by the Police (see      ........ .


comment in previous recommendations).
Paragraph 6.14.6 of the Green Guide should be
amended to read "All exit gates should be manned at
all times while the ground Is used by the public
and be capable of being opened Immediately from
inside by anyone in an emergency."

Agreed. The present wording of para 6.14.6 reads
"All exit gates should be manned at all times while
the ground is used by the public so that they can
be opened imrsdiately 1n an emergency."
The Green Guide should be amended to contain a
specific provision in relation to stewards;
i)   that they should be trained and instructed to
     deal with any emergency relating to fire or
     evacuation;
ii) that they should be given written
     instructions about the action to be taken in
     cases of emergency;
iii) that they should receive practical
      instruction and training appropriate to their
      responsibility;
1v) that no-one should be employed as a steward
     unless they have been so Instructed and
    trained; and
v)   that they should be adequate in number,
     physically and mentally capable of performing
     their    duties,     effectively    deployed^

                           effectively     supervised        and       readily
                           identifiable.

                     Agreed. The standards and training of stewards
                     should be specified within safety certificates.
RECOMMENDATION 13.   Building of new permanent stands of combustiable
                     materials should be prohibited as a general rule.

                     Agreed. This is a matter for the football clubs,
                     Local Authorities and the Fire Service.
RECOMMENDATION 14.   Suitable and adequate exits should be provided in
                     all sports grounds.                               /

                     Agreed. The ACPO takes the view that all exit ,
                     gates should be stewarded and not left unattended
                     during sporting events. Consideration should be
                     given to installing standardised locking systems
                     for all exit gates with keys being Issued to
                     stewards and to police officers on duty. This is a
                     common practice at many grounds and works to the
                     satisfaction of all concerned.
RECOMMENDATION 15.   No smoking should take place 1n combustible stands,!
                     that this should be a condition o f ‘entry to the vl
                     ground and that signs to this effect should be
                     prominently displayed.

                     Agreed. The ACPO feel that the responsibility for
                     enforcing this rule should H e with the clubs and
                     their stewards.
RECOHENPATION 16.    Fire Authorities should identify and visit all
                     sports stadia in their areas and should prohibit or
                     restrict the use of any practices which, 1n their
                     view, constitute a risk to spectators because of
                     the inadequacy of the fire precautions.

                     A matter solely for the F1re Service.
RECOMMENDATION 17.   In order to ensure a complete record of Sports
                     grounds a local registration system should be set
                     up.

                     A matter for Local Authorities.
RECOMMENDATION 18.   Consideration should be given as how best to deal
                     with temporary stands and marquees.

                     At designated grounds, notice of proposals to erect

RECOMMENDATION 20.   Urgent consideration should be given to introducing
                     a membership system 1n England and Wales and in the

                     The installation of Closed Circuit Television has
                     been pursued by the ACPO and funds have been made
                     available by the Football Trust to enable
                     installation of equipment at all English first and
                     second division clubs during the 1985-86 Season.
                     (No ACPO policy in Scotland. The subject has

RECOMMENDATION 22.   There should be a specific offence 1n England and
                     Wales of throwing a missile at Sports grounds.

                     In its response to the White Paper Review of Public ®
                     Order Law (Cmnd 9510), the Association of Chief
                     Police Officers strongly recommended that there
                     should be a criminal offence of missile throwing
                     rather than to leave this dangerous practice to be 'M
                     dealt with as "violent behaviour." The example of
                     missiles being thrown at football matches was cited ^

                               as an example of the sort of problem we sought to
                               deal with under such a provision.
                               There is a need for a general law to deal with:
                                     "any person who throws or attempts to
                                     throw a missile of a kind capable of
                                     causing injury with intent to cause
                                     injury or whereby injury is likely to
                                     be caused.”
                               It should be noted that such an offence would
                               require a power of arrest and should be applicable'
                               in any public place as well as sporting arenas and
                               places of public entertainment, for missile
                               throwing has become a serious problem and public
                               disapproval of this dangerous practice should b
                               expressed in specific legislation.
    RECOMMEJffiATION 23:       Football Clubs should review their arrangements for
                               entry and the organisation of their turnstiles.

                               Agreed.    The number, location and control of
                               turnstiles is an important consideration which, if
                               lacking can lead to a build-up of tension which can
                               manifest itself in violence. General guidelines
                               are to be found in the Green Guide para 5.1
                               "Turnstiles should be of such numbers<*as to admit
                               at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are
                               waiting for admission and yet at no faster rate
                               than the arrangements for di stributing spectators
                               within the ground permit."
                               Consideration should be given to including a
                               section on turnstile quality, control and numbers
                               within the terms of safety certificates.
    RECOMMENDATION 24.         Consideration should be given to the design of a
                               standard efficient perimeter fence with proper
                               exits.

m                             This receives the fullest support of the ACPO.
    PROVISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
    1)    I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the Police should be
          given the unfettered right of search before entry to football grounds
          by Statute.
          Searching was also dealt with inthe ACPO response to the White Paper
          as a serious deficiency in the criminal law. There is a clear
          requirement for a workable power to search for offensive weapons and
          other articles intended for causing injury or alarm in connection with
          any large gathering of people where the police suspect that v1
          may occur, such as gang-fights, football matches, seaside hoOl
          demonstrations, etc.

The new complaints procedure and a proper insistence on correct
procedures emphasised by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act have made
it imperative that the police be given proper covering legal authority
and do not have to rely on such nebulous concepts as "implied consent"
or to risk exceeding their powers.
To enforce a provision relating to offensive weapons and other
potentially dangerous articles requires that the police have the
authority to determine whether an individual has any in his possession.^
Some provision has been provided in the Police and Criminal Evidence -:s
Act for a police officer to search someone for a "prohibited" article,
but not "unless he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that he will    ?
find stolen or prohibited articles.1* The Code of Practice makes It
clear that "Reasonable
           "Reasor     suspicion, in contrast to mere suspicion must be
founded on fact."
While such a provision may be just adequate to deal with individuals or
small groups, it 1s not applicable to large groups of people going to a       .
demonstration, entering a football ground, or on their way to the site     •{IfS
of a proposed gang fight. It has been the practice in the past for
police to check gangs of youths en route to events where serious public
disorder is anticipated. That course of action is clearly outlawed by
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. The exception provided in the
Code of Practice for written notes does not affect this issue. The
proviso in the Notes of Guidance (4A) that "Nothing in this code
affects the routine searching of persons entering sports grounds or
other premises ... as a condition of entry" is of very dubious
legality. It would be a foolish police officer who relied on implied
consent to justify a search. Furthermore, such a provision, even if it
was legal, does not apply to crowds en route to football grounds or to
National Front demonstrations, seaside gang fights or violent pickets.
The ingredients of a power to search need to be carefully balanced to
provide appropriate backing for police action with adequate safeguards
for the public. Such a provision could be:
      (a)   Where a police officer of the rank of Superintendent
            or above has reasonable cause to apprehend serious
            public disorder;
      (b)   he may authorise a constable or constables to search
            any person at, going to, attempting to go to or in the
            vicinity of;
      (c) any sporting event, public entertainment, public
           meeting or procession or public gathering where
           serious disorder may occur or is occurring;
      (d)   for any smoke bomb, pyrotechnic device, flare or any
            similar article or any offensive weapon;
      (e)   and seize any such article or weapon.
      (f) Any authority given under this section shall be
           confirmed in writing as soon as practicable.
The aim is to authorise police officers to make selective searches
where a senior police officer has reasonable cause to apprehend serious
public disorder at or in connection with a specific occasion or
location and is prepared to make a written declaration to that effect.
I am minded to recommend that Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act,
1971 should be amended with a view to giving the Fire Authority power
in cases other than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional.
Matter for the Fire Service and Home Office.
Linked to the above I am minded to recommend that consideration should
be given to introducing legislation giving powers for the Fire
Authority to apply to the High Court for an injunction under Section 10
of the Fire Precautions Act.
Matter for the F1re Service and the Home Office.
I am minded to recommend that Section 10 of the Safety at Sports
Grounds Act should be amended in the manner to Section 10 of the Fire
Precautions Act and an application to the High Court for an Injunction
should be an alternative remedy.
This recommendation Is intended to provide Local Authorities with
greater ease of access to the Courts than what Is provided by Section
10 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act under the heading "Emergency
Procedures."
Within this section a Local Authority may apply to a Magistrates Court
to prohibit or restrict admission to a ground where It Is felt there is
an unacceptable risk.

Access to the High Court might well prove expedient 1n an emergency.
I am minded to recommend that the Secretary of State should exercise
his powers to designate all sports grounds, whatever their size, to
include indoor as well as outdoor authorities.
This is a matter for the Department of the Environment.
I am minded to recommend immediate designation of any ground capable of
holding over 5,000 spectators to cover all sports grounds not merely
football grounds.
This is a matter for the Department of the Environment.
I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to
providing the police with additional powers of arrest under the Public
Order Act, 1936.
This recommendation refers specifically to the practical difficulties
facing the police in the advent of CCTV and post-match investigations
of Section 5 Offences highlighted by the cameras. Under the existing
Section 7 of the Public Order Act the Police are empowered to make
arrests where conduct is threatening or insulting but not once the
immediacy of the situation has passed. The Interim Report rightly
notes that police at grounds are unable on many occasions to
immediately arrest the instigators of violence for a number of reasons ^
and consequently these offenders remain free from conviction. A video
recording may well serve to positively Identify one or more culprits
some considerable time after the incidents. It Is therefore necessary
                                              Document No.      3 CONT’D




to extend powers of arrest so that these offenders may be subject to
arrest when positively identified and charged with the most appropriate
offence.    The Association therefore strongly supports Provisional
Recommendation 7 but equally strongly advocates that It should
encompass all public order offences and not just Section 5 Public Order
Act.
I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to creating -i-
a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse at a sports
ground.                                                           r
The ritual of chanting obscenities and racial abuse at football matches3"
is seen as adversely affecting the environment and a factor 1n public ,-,
disorder:
The ACPO feel that whilst there will be difficulties of enforcement
such conduct should be capable of prosecution. If this can be achieved
within the review of Public Order Legislation as a general offence so
much the better.
It is submitted that there Is a gap in the law which:
          (a) prevents the police from being able to
              take action in many cases where
              considerable stress is caused to many
              people, particularly the elderly and
              ethnic minorities;
          (b) falls to provide the police with the       ^
               ability to prevent minor disorder
               escalating into serious disorder, and
          (c) leaves many disorderly and potentially
              dangerous acts outside statutory law.
What is needed, is a summary offence which fits at the bottom of the
range in terms of seriousness and punishment for public order offences.
In terms of sporting events it needs to cover such acts In the stadium
as: running onto the pitch to stop the game at football matches (where
there Is no evidence of a threat of unlawful violence to justify
conviction for Section 5 of the Public Order Act), shouting racial and
personal abuse at other spectators; linking arms with others and
jumping down terraces, shouting words calculated to cause alarm (e.g.
 fire or "it's a bomb"); and outside the stadium as: charging through
shopping centres andalong pavements scattering pedestrians in the
process; shouting racial, obscene or provocative abuse; rushing
entrances to the ground, railway platforms, shops and other premises;
fighting or trying to fight with rival supporters or chasing them
through the streets with Intent to start a fight.
Such variations In the types of disorderly behaviour preclude specific
offences but call for a general provision to cover disorderly
behaviour. A suggested form 1s:-
        "Uslng threatening, abusive or disorderly
        words or behaviour whereby alarm, harassment,
        annoyance or distress is or is likely to be
        caused to another person."

Concern has been expressed that such a provision would bring too much
by way of high spirited behaviour into the ambit of the criminal law.
it is the view of the Association of Chief Police Officers that the
safeguards provided by (a) the independent prosecution service (which
will reject charges lacking adequate evidence); (b) the courts (which
will require evidence of a significant wrong) should ensure that
society s needs for a measure to cope with hooliganism will be balanced
with the need for people to legitimately display high spirits.            ipi
Conduct of the type envisaged as falling within this provision 1s often
the forerunner of more serious outbreaks of disorder. Adequate
legislation 1s essential for the maintenance of order and tranquility
on our streets, as an element of crime prevention, as a means of 3 3
preventing serious outbreaks of public disorder and to regulate
behaviour at, on way to, or from, such gatherings as football matches.
A general power to deal with "disorderly behaviour" is                  ■«
                                                                   more
effective,^ because it is so much more flexible, than a              vr
specific offences dealing with "chanting Obscene or racialist ibUs^ or
 running on the pitch". Such behaviour is better regulated by
identifying ringleaders and charging them with disorderly behaviour
than creating a specific offence which may be committed by such large
numbers of people that arrest and charge becomes impossible. Specific
offences which cannot be properly enforced may bring the law into
disrepute.
*he+i/?]atliVe.. rfsP0nsib1lit1es of police and the management of a
football club within the ground, particularly with regard to crowd
control and evacuation in the eventof an emergency.

It is the responsibility of a football club to provide and maintain the
physical structure of the ground so that evacuation in an emergency can
be achieved. The Club is also required through its management and
stewards to have a plan for evacuation and to be capable of carrying it
out.    10 prevent public disorder considerable nunfcers of police
officers are often in attendance at sports stadia and consistent with
the nature of their duties they will generally assume control in an
emergency. It is recognised that the Police 1f present in numbers
generally take on crowd control as a matter of routine and need to be
aware of evacuation procedures.          This should not diminish the
preparedness of the Club on whom the primary responsibility lies.
The duties of the Police in an emergency originate in their obligation
to protect life and property.            That obligation may in some
circumstances be onerous and far reaching but it 1s to be distinguished
from liability based on contract or tort which will generally not be
relevant.

     played, and rugby league grounds, are basically similar though they may
     vary in degree. Crowds attending rugby league matches for example, are
     often in number similar to those attending football league matches in
     the lower divisions. It is all the more perplexing therefore to
     discover that the hooliganism phenomena only rarely manifests itself
     among spectators at rugby matches who, by and large, are drawn from
     similar catchment areas as those attending football league matches.
     It is timely, however, that the police are alert to the possibility of
      football hooliganism" being displaced into other sports as an '1
     unintended consequence of tighter police controls at footlwll MtcheSvSS^i
     It is the policy of the ACPO to closely monitor crowd behaviour at
     other sports in the event that hooliganism manifests Itself in any
     discernable pattern. Should that happen we shall be- seeking an
     extension of powers currently specific to football league club grounds
1)   The adequacy or otherwise of the police participation in uocai              *•*
     Authority teams for the purposes of inspection and certification under       y'
     the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975.                                       "

     Hitherto, police involvement in Local Authority inspection teams has
     been limited to the certification stage only. It is the view of the
     ACPO joint inspection teams, including the police, ought to visit
     designated sports grounds on an annual basis to inspect and report upon
     the adequacy of arrangements and equipment in accordance with the
     provisions of the Act and the Green Guide. Re-certification and a free
     exchange of information between all parties involved will serve to
     maintain standards and ensure that all conditions imposed on safety
     certificates are complied with.                           ’
     Unless a formalised system of annual re-certification is introduced it
     is felt that the current high standards being Introduced will
     inevitably start to decline as the impetus wanes.
■)   Any suggested amendments to the Home Office Guide to Safety at SDorts
     Grounds (the Green Guide).

     Section 5.2 deals with the dangers of boundary fences of inadequate
     strength and height. Attention has so far been focused upon the
     standards of pitch perimeter fences of metal construction but it is
     felt that specific guidelines should be made on the strength and
     structure of brick and concrete walls not only surrounding the playing
     pitch but also those which surround the ground itself. Experience
     shows that many external walls are in need of repair or replacement and
     in their present state not only represent a potential danger but also
     provide a source of ammunition to the hooligan element amonq
     supporters.
     Section 6.14.13 reads "All doors on an exit route should be secured in
     the fully opened position before the end of play." Such a guideline
     puts at serious risk police arrangements for segregating rival fans and
     represents a potential flash point for crowd disorder. It is the view
     of the ACPO that on the majority of football grounds the number of exit
     gates far exceeds the reasonable proportions which could be expected to
     be controlled by a police officer, and as a consequence it is necessary

from an operational point of view to allow these gates to be locked and
stewarded with a universal lock and key system controlled by f ir e and
safety stewards. Whilst this aspect is contrary to the recommendation
in the Popp 1ewe 11 Interim report the ACPO take the view that i t is
necessary to order. We are interested in the development of f a i ls a f e
locking devices as used at Ipswich Town which allow for control from a
central point but can be opened locally in the event of power fa ilu re .
If these systems can be perfected technically they may provide an
answer but i t i s recognised that they may be very expensive.

Section 6.14.7 deals with tu r n s tile f a c i l i t i e s . It reads, f a c i l i t i e s
should be provided to enable people to leave the ground at any time.
For th is purpose a number of reversible tu r n s tile s or doors so operated
as to lim it the openings to the passage of one person at a time might

The ACPO take the view that this section should be amendedto exclude
the words     'reversible turnstiles," as by their very nature they
intimate a mechanism capable of jamming either in the reversing process
or by any physical pressure. The mechanisms other than hlnges are
discouraged by the guide, and on average the opening width of most
turnstiles is below the minimum exit width recommended in the guide.
Turnstiles should be so constructed as     to discourage      any useas an exit
route.
Section 8.3(b) deals with evacuation from stands at sports grounds and
recommends that evacuation time for stands ofwooden construction
should be 2.5 minutes. It is the view of the ACPO that this evacuation
time be reduced from 2.5 minutes to 2 minutes.
                                                         '*
Section 8.4 reads, "Seats and gangways should be so positioned as to
provide ready access to exits. No person in any part of a stand should
nave to travel more than 30 metres to the nearest exit from the stand."
It is the ACPO recommendation that for wooden stands the maximum
distance travelled to the nearest exit should be no more than 18
metres.    Thisamendment will allow compliance with the reduced
evacuation time recommended at Section 8.3(b).
Section 18.4 reads, "Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements
for the sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be served
in plastic containers."
The ACPO recommends that this Section should be amended to take account
of the provisions of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act,
1985, so far as it relates to controlled sale and possession inside
football grounds.

                    DUTIES OF POLICE OFFICERS AND STEWARDS

              RESPECTING 'PACKING1 AND MONITORING OF CAPACITIES

            OF TERRACING AT LONDON 1ST DIVISION FOOTBALL GROUNDS


ARSENAL

Up until the end of the 1988/89 football season working practice and verbal
agreement between police and Arsenal Football Club has been that stewards are
responsible for showing spectators to their seats in the stands.

On the terraces, however, police have taken responsibility for         packing
spectators into 'pens' and directing them to the appropriate area      of the
ground.   Stewards do assist with this task but they are ineffective   without
police backing; it has been found impracticable to make them            solely
responsible as they lack the authority to deal with non-compliant      crowds.
Stewards are now responsible for manning the perimeter of the pitch.

Following the Hillsborough Disaster, from the start of the 1989/90 season
police, Arsenal FC and the London Borough of Islington have drafted a
statement of purpose which includes the duties of police and stewards. The
number of stewards will be drastically increased.


CHARLTON AND CRYSTAL PALACE

Duties of police officers inside the ground are primarily associated with the
presentation of public order, segregation of supporters and maintenance of a
sterile area. There is no formal agreement with the club on the packing of
spectators, although verbally it is accepted as a steward's responsibility and
not police.   Stewards are present at all games, they are not particularly
effective in packing spectators into terraces and usually rely on police to
initiate requests for action or to actually undertake this task.      Charlton
Athletic stewards are noticeably more effective than Crystal Palace stewards,
but this is due mainly to smaller crowds and a more flexible allocation of
accommodation to away support for Charlton games.

In the absence of electronic counters, monitoring of crowd capacity is done by
the ground's turnstile counters although the numbers are received by police
will some caution.


CHELSEA

Police search at two sets of turnstiles and private security officers at the
remaining three, but with police in attendance to assist.

Police do not pack spectators on the terraces, this is the responsibility of
stewards who are also required to keep gangways clear, man exit and pitchside
gates and 'police' the crowd.    The stewards radio system is monitored by
police in the control room and close liaison maintained with senior stewards
and section leaders.

There is a written agreement between police and Chelsea FC setting out the
number and duties of stewards at various parts of the ground including the
stands and terraces.

MILLWALL

Searching of spectators entering the grounds is carried out by police alone.

The more able stewards are employed on the perimeter track, manning the
additional pitch emergency exit gates which have been constructed since the
Hillsborough Disaster.

Due to previous crowd disorder, the east stand of the ground is manned solely
by police who are responsible for all crowd control including packing of
spectators. The north stand spectators although less volatile still requires
police officers to maintain the main gangway and assist spectators.        The
underlying problem is the general standard of stewarding; the recruitment of
acceptable personnel is difficult, bearing in mind the low remunerative reward
and potential danger to such persons from crowd disorder.


QUEENS PARK RANGERS

Police duties are primarily    to preserve public    order   and   to   assist   in
searching at turnstiles.

Stewards are responsible for most tasks within the ground including the
marshalling of crowds into the stands and terraces.    However, because of
previous problems in the 'away' terracing, police officers undertake the
packing of spectators into this section of the ground.

Monitoring of the capacities of sections of the ground is carried out by means
of a computerised counter which can be monitored in the police control room.
As a section of terracing approaches capacity the officer in charge of the
serial at the appropriate turnstile is advised to close it.

There is no written agreement between Q.P.R. football         club      and   police
concerning the respective duties of police and stewards.


TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR

There is close liaison between senior stewards and officers in charge of
serials employed in the stands.

Police are employed in the vicinity of turnstiles to assist the security firm
employed to carry out searches of spectators entering the ground. Police and
stewards are employed together in packing the terraces, and keeping the various
gangways clear.

A computer is installed to monitor the number of spectators entering through
the turnstiles, this is linked to the police control room. When a stand or
terrace reaches 200 below capacity the officers in charge of serials at the
turnstiles are instructed to close them.

There is no laid down agreement between police and the club regarding the
employment of stewards and their responsibilities.

WIMBLEDON

Police duties are to maintain public order and uphold the ground rules.

Packing of spectators in the terraces, marshalling of crowds and manning of
emergency exits and gates is carried out by stewards, who would also assist
police in the event of an emergency evacuation. Packing of spectators on the
terraces is not a police duty.

Monitoring of capacities of sections of the ground is carried out by means of
digital counters linked into the control room.

Police duties are as determined in the Special Service Agreement; police are
not involved in the private arrangements made between the club and stewards.


WEMBLEY

Police officers are no longer posted to the pitch perimeter; they are posted
to the inside of turnstiles, the circulating corridor of the stadium, on the
terraces or on reserve. Their primary function is to maintain public order.
Police also assist stewards in searching the prohibited circles and preventing
alcohol being taken into the ground.

Stewards are primarily responsible for the distribution and packing of
spectators within the terraces. Police monitor the situation and report any
build up of supporters at any particular bay to the control room, assistance
to stewards with the packing of bays is carried out only by prior request from
Wembley Stadium other than in those cases where there is an immediate risk to
public safety.    The ineffectiveness of stewards in packing the standing
terraces has resulted in overcrowding when supporters with incorrect tickets
have been allowed into standing bay areas which is aggravated if other
stewards have not properly distributed the supporters in the bay.

There is no written agreement between Wembley Stadium and police with regard
to the individual duties of police and stewards. There is a reluctance on the
part of Wembley Stadium Security to allow police an input into stewards
briefings concerning their powers, deployments and responsibilities; relying
solely on the knowledge and expertise of former police officers in their
employ.

There is at present no mechanism for monitoring the capacity at the stadium,
Wembley Stadium rely on the number of tickets sold for an event.

Subject                                                           Date   31 May 1989




          I   havennnsidsrsri thp file relating to alleged offences committed by
                                   was a turnstile operator at the Hillsborough
          football ground on the 15 April 1989 , when the Hillsborough disaster
          occurred.

          He is alleged to have stolen the sum of £30, the property of Sheffield
          Wednesday Football Club\              has admitted allowing supporters
          through his turnstile although they were not in possession of tickets.
          The match being played was an all ticket match.       He admitted being
          asked by the supporters if he would accept money to let them into the
          ground but told them he would not. He also admitted allowing supporters
          through although they had no tickets, but said he did this because of
          the crush outside the ground and those in the turnstile could not go
          backwards.     He denied taking money from anyone but said that the
          supporters threw money at him, and he couldn't do anything about it.
                   idmitted keeping 3 x £10 notes thrown at him by the supporters,
          m e money was later recovered from his house. He told the Police that
          he was sick about what happened that afternoon and had been thinking of
          putting the money into the Disaster Fund.

          On all these facts, there clearly is not a case or cases of theft
          committed by              The authority of Powell-v-MacRae (1977)•
          Crim.L.R.571.            ided on identical facts states that such a
          turnstile operator was no more than a recipient of a bribe, and by no
          stretch of language could it be said that the money "belonged to" the
          employers.                     —

          An offence may have been committed against S.I.(l) Prevention of
          Corruption Act 1906, but a prosecution would require the Attorney
          General's consent.   I do consider however, there may be evidential
          difficulties in respect of such an offence, concerning the words
          "accepting or agreeing to accept", as there was no prior agreement
          between           nd the football supporters, to accept money as a
          condition or entry

          I can see no reason to disbelieve the account given bj              and
          consider that a charge of corruption would in any event be an extremely
          heavy way of dealing with a case of this particular nature.

                                              L




As the evidence in respect of a charge of corruption is not in my view
strong enough to support it, a caution in these circumstances would be
improper.

I would therefore advise no further action, and return your file.

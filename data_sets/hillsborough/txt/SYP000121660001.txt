             At     the above m e n t i o n e d          fixture     I was       depu t e d   to work w i t h a serial

             on their way              into     the ground.          The     conduct       of the supp o r t e r s      in the

             m a i n was good h u m o u r e d , the flow towards                        the turnstiles        was      steady

            to moni t o r         the L i v er po ol        supporters.            A position was        taken up        in the

            tunnel         at    the e n t r a n c e     to Fen 4.         The     pen was almost        full   at     this

            time,, sal though               there was       room to     let      further      supporters     in as       they

            arrived,.            A ga i n    the    stream of s upporters               entering    the enc l o s u r e was

            steady.             The    serial       as a whole       became        aware    that the     pen was       filling

            up and we then s ta r t e d                  to turn s u p p o r t e r s    away to find an a l t e r n a t i v e

            p o s i t i o n in the ground.                 The numbers           were    so small     that   ente r e d that

            we were able               to    c o n t r p 1 them as    such,        the advice was        taken without

   qu e stion   by a large           percentage      of the    supporters.        The     conduct   of the

   fans     during the     game was         very good however          at times     of excitement

   they did surge        f or w a r d     in large    n u m b e r s , this did    cause    concern but

   as far as     I am a ware          did not     result    in a n y   injuries.

   At the end of the game                 the serial     as a whole      then s u p e r v i s e d the

   Li verpool    s u p p o rt er s   exit    from the ground,          this   led us onto Leppings

   Lane where we w a l ke d           in amongst      the   crowd onto Hali f a x Road,          towards

   the i r transport.          A ga in     the   crowd a c t e d   in an o rde rly manner       and     I am

               To    clarify the        points      raised about           the    duty worked at           the above

               f i t u re .

               As Phase 2 of the m a t c h got under way                         I a t t e n d e d at    the   tunnel

               entrance         to Pe n 4 wit h a aerial.                I took       up a position            in the tunnel

               whilst       other    officers       took up a posit i o n at the                 rear of        the   pen.

               The       pen filled     up s t e a d i l y and after a while                I was       joined    by officer

               who       had been    inside       the    pen,    one    of w h o m was PC 25£ 8 Hughes.                 He gave

               i n f o r m a t i o n that   the    conditions          inside     the    pen were        so bad from the

               n umbers       in the    crowd that he had to                  return to the tunnel.

               It was at this           point      that     the serial         started to turn s u p p o r t e r s away

               to f ind an a l t e r n a t i v e        v i e w i n g area.

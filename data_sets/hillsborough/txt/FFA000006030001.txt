            1.   INTRODUCTION

i          1. 1 Foot bail is the world's most popular team sport/ being played
           in practically every country.    Thar© axe 156 national football
           associations in .'nambership of the Federation Internationale de
           Football Association (FIFA), tha ga»e' S world governing body.
           There are four separate national football aaiociations in Great
           Britain - in England, Wales# Scotland and northern Ireland.    In
           England, the association is named "The Football Association."
           (The f a ) . The name "England" does not form part of this title as
           The Football Association was the first such body In the world to
           be formed (in 1863).
           1. 2 The FA it the governing body of the game of Association
           Football in England,  it is responsible for the promotion,
           development, regulation and control of the game within its
           territory.  One of the principal activities of The FA i« the
           organization of a national knock-out competition for senior
           ciuha, called The fa Challenge Cup Competition (The FA Cup).

mr        1. 3 The FA is also responsible for the sanctioning either
^         directly or indirectly through ita constituent County Football
P         Associations of store than 2,000 leagues and competitions.   The
           beat known of these league* is The Football League.   The Football
           League (also without national title because it was the first of
           its kina in the world, foundad in 1669)/ is an organisation
           consisting of 92 professional football clubs, who compete in four
           separate divisions, with pro»otion and relegation between the
           divisions.   Three of the club* Competing in The Football League
           Are affiliated to The Football Association of Wales and not to
           the FA.   These three Welsh clubs, together with eleven others
           from the Principality, also coaiptfcs in the FA Cup,

            l. 4 The FA is governed by a council, made up of nominees and
            elected representatives of various bodies involved in the game,
            including those clubs in full membership of The FA and County
            Football Associations.   The Football League is managed by a
            Committee, consisting of four representatives elected by the
            clubs in the First Division, three elected by the Second Division
            and one elected by the clubs of the Third and Fourth Divisions
            (The Management Committee).   The Management Committee in its
            entirety also sits on The FA Council.

            1. 5 The Pootball Association and The Football League have decided
            to make this submission jointly.   The submission has been
            prepared by a group of five members of f a Council, two of whom
            are also members of The Football League Management Committee.

            1. 6 The professional game in England attracts millions of people
            from all walks of life, transcending barriers of class, race,
            religion, politics and sex*   The total attendance at match*?
            Involving Football League clubs in season 1967-89 was in excess
            of 20,000/000.   Attendances in 1939-90 show an increase of soma
            2. 5%, which represents the third consecutive seasonal increase in
            attendances.   (Attendance figures appended )

            l,          7 It has become fashionable to point the finger at football and
            to blame the game, or those who are responsible for its
            administration, for the behaviour of the tiny minority of those
            attending watches who create trouble out of all proportion to
            their numbers.   Government figures show that, in season 1987~86,
            6147 people were arrested in connection with matches involving
            Football League clubs.   According to the information the Football
            Authorities have to hand, only about a third of these were
            arrested inside grounds.   The courts are entitled to designate
            the offences of those found guilty as "football related* and to
           issue an order excluding the offender from attending football
m          games.   In the period August 19S7 to May 1989, only 1/760 such
9'         orders were issued.   This callsinto question the basis on which
            the calculation of the number of arrests considered by' the police
ft         to be football related is made.    Even If every one of the quoted
     “     6 ,147 oases involved a football supporter at, going to or
     #     returning from a football match - which seems highly improbable -
           that would still mean that only three arrests were made in season
            1967*66 for every 10,000 people attending a football game.
            (Comparative arrest figures are appended )■

           1. 9 The FA and The Football League accept that one arrest is one
           too many and unequivocally condemn the conduct of this section of
           so-called football supporters.   Football is, however, saddled
           with a problem not of its making.   Blaming football for
           h o o l i g a n i s m la s k i n t o c r i t i c i s i n g t h e h o u s e h o l d e r f o r t h e c r i m e s
of the burglar, to apportioning guilt to the victim instead of
the mugger,  Nevertheless, the football authorities recognise
that they must take a lead in attempting to rid the game of the
scourge that has beset it. They unlesstand that the world at
large vill expect them to take tha lead in. dealing With
hooliganism.  Football has accepted this responsibility*  It has
tackled the problem - successfully, we contend - it is continuing
to do SO.
1. $ The problem Is, however, complex,  There are no *asy answers.
There are considerations of safety as well as of behaviour.   We
need to find long-term educational solutions as well as adopting
immediate, effective crowd control measures.
 l» 10 Football, in partnership with the police, has developed an
intelligence network that allowe matches to be planned- in as
thorough a manner as Is possible, taking into account the
unpredictability of human behaviour.    Every Football League club
is required to lodge with The League ft "local plan", detailing
the measures it takes in ensuring the orderly conduct of matches
at its ground.    Appended ( ) as an example is the local plan for
Sheffield Wednesday.    Before every game, the police - from ths
areas both of the home club and the visitors, - the visiting club
itself and the transport authorities decide the arrangements that
will apply.    The police rule on the number of officers that will
be deployed both inside and outside the ground*    The clubs pay an
agreed fee for each policeman operating within the stadium.     In
practice, the clubs are obliged to accept the ruling of the
police on the number of officers who should be deployed for each
game.    Zn 1937-38, the total police charges paid by Football
League clubs for the policing of League games was B3, 339,600 - &r.
average charge per match of £1,650.    This burden is lightened
somewhat by the payment by The Football Trust of 35% of the
charges, excluding vat.    The balance borne by clubs represented
4. 2i of gate and seaioa-ticket receipts.   <An explanation of the
role of The Football Trust is appended).
1. 10 The single most effective contribution to the fight against
hooliganism in the last decade has been ciose-circuit television.
It was a recommendation of the Home Office Committee of inquiry
into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds of January 1996
(the Poppleweii Report)# that followed the fire st Bradford city
football club, that such systems be introduced at Football League
grounds in England and Vales (paragraphs 4.92 to 4. 101). The
process had already begun prior to Popplewell.  It has now been
completed and all Football Leagua grounds either have permanent
systems or access to a mobile one.

              alterations made necessary by the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
              have, of course/ absorbed significant amounts of money*      Froa
              1978, much of this expenditure has been met by The Football Trust
              and by The Football Grounds Improvement Trust.      To date/ a total
              of £68,000,000 has been provided.      £2,775,000 has been spent on
            f the installation ot close-circuit television crowd surveillance
              systems in England and Scotland*     £43, 500,000 has been allocated

^w            The total amount spent on safety at English Football fceague
           . grounds> including the clubs' own contributions, is estimated at
              almost £50,000,000 in tha last ten years. An incalculable amount
             has also been spent on ensuring proper segregation of supporters
             within grounds and on other security measures.

«&•          l. 13. l The net result has been a dramatic decrease in the number

                  stadia,    we nave no cea&on to doubt that evidence froa the police
                  authorities will substantiate this viaw. The alight upward trend
                  in arrest figures can, la tha opinion of The FA and The Football
                  League be ascribed to the effectiveness of close-circuit
                  television eye tows within and in the area of ground* in
                  identifying and bringing to court those whose misdeeds previously
                  went undetected.    Police undercover operations have also shown
                  that the committed trouble-'maker now prefers to operate away from
                  grounds.

                 playing the game.   The figures below indicate the steady rise in

           stadium from a 65/000 capacity/ of which 20,000 were seat*/ to
           44/ 000/ of which 35, 000 were seated.   At more or lest the sane

          2. 2. 2 Arrests at the ground have gone down considerably ( ]. The
          Strathclyde police report that most of the arrests made at the

          proportion of arrests,      f J There is no doubt in the mind of the

          2. 3 Aberdeen FC went one step further than Rangers, converting
          their Pittodrie Stadium to all-aeater as long ago as 1978.   The
          capacity is a respectable 23,000 and, while the club does not
          enjoy the massive support of its Glasgow rivals, it still
          achieves a healthy average of around the 14,000 mark.   More
          significantly, perhaps, the statistics for arrests in connection
          with Aberdeen's home matches are remarkably low, «« the table

         2. 4 During the summer of 2961, Coventry City fC converted their
         stadium at Highfield Road to all seats, Th© capacity wa* tat at
         20, 500,  The club received enormou* criticism from It* supporters
         and ha* fait obliged, over a number of seatfona to revert to a
         stadium offering mixed accommodation. The preAint balance ia
         16, 496 seats and 11,904 standing plaoaa. A letter from Coventry
         City ia appended (Appendix ). Xt will be noted that one of tha
         major problems encountered by tha club waa tha unwillingness of
         spectators to ait in uncovered aaating. Another factor in tha
         decision to ravart to a certain amount of standing has bean tha
         action of soma visiting supporter* in ripping out seats to use as
         weapons.
         St. 5. l The experience of two cluba ia Holland* a country that has
         suffered as much as England in recent years from hooliganism, ia
         worthy of note.     Utrecht football club has recently fltoved into a
         new purpose-built.stadium on tha outskirts of the city.
         Interestingly, it has chosen not to make the stadium all-seater.
         Tha old ground had 13,000 standing placas and 7,000 seats. The
         new has a ratio of 14, 000 aeats to 6, 000 standing*   The standing
         accommodation ia in tha corners of tha ground.
         2, 8 , 2 Fayenoord, a big club in Rotterdam, continues to use an
         established ground that hat 51,000 seats, xt has. chosen to kaap,
         however, two small standing sections of 1, 900 plaoes each. Here,
         the standing torracea are immediately bShind the goals.
#       2. 5. 3 Xt is tha view of Robert da Bafckar, tha Security officer of
        tha Dutch FA, that all-seattr stadia do not necessarily bring
        better behaviour.    He seas tha provision of a preponderance of
        seats as desirable, but ha pointa out that those who are likely
        to cause trouble are not reformed overnight simply through their
        being put into a seat.    Ha believes that a small section of
        standing is desirable and will remain so for the time being.

          2. 7. 1 These varied experiences indicate to it* that there is
          distinct benefit to be gained by a move to more seating.
          All-seater stadia, however, are not the panacea many believe them
          to be, Neither would they be acceptable to a large proportion of
W         the present football public.    Xt is tha general view of the
          police that seated spectators are more easily controlled.        The
          tendency to taunt and gesture.is less prevalent amongst seated
          spectators.    Nevertheless* it ia possible for spectators to stand
          and watch football in safety.    The Faettosrt. A s M t M H M and The
        k Football League believe that it is possible to achieve a balance
          between seating and standing accommodation that delivers the
          requirement of safe stadia vhllo satisfying the requirements of
          tha public.    We are prepared to commit football to the
          achievement of this balance over a period of time. Xt is not
          reasonable ox neceesary to force football to undertake, with the
          associated crippling expenditure; an immediate widescale
          installation of seating.

              Football League is appended (Appendix ). We recommend that it be
             made a condition of the issue of a licence under the Safety of

 story, however,   The Coventry experience Indicates that people
 vili not Bit in uncovered areas. To cover the new seating would
 take an estimated further £100,000,000, in view of the abuses of
 some new seated area*, when seats have been stood upon/ or
 deliberately broken, it will almost certainly be necessary to
 agree on a more robust specification.    This certainly brings the
 estimate of £35 per seat into question. — JLmSs gw s teian. Nor
 should It be automatically assumed that the prises that can be
 charged for the new seated accommodation will automatically
 compensate for the reduction In total capacity,     Liverpool ?C,
 for example, the most successful English club in the last 25
 years, do not believe that th*y would be able to chargeCjffor the
 new seating they are contemplating installiagjsubstantially more
 than the present standing admission price.vWe discuss below,
 (paragraphs 2. 15 tO 3. 13), the financial implications.

2, 9 As we are proposing that standing accommodation should be
allowed to remain where the clubs and the public desire it, we
consider it essential for the criteria applied to the safety of
standing spectators to be re-assessed.  The ?A and The Football
League will be proposing, (Section 3, below), that crucial areas
of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds be made mandatory.
Amongst these mandatory provisions should be capacity per
standing terrace, permitted capacities per access/egress,
strength of crush barriers and the number of steps permitted in
one uninterrupted drop*  It may also be necessary to confine
standing to the areas behind the goals, as oited above (2. 5. l),
the builders of the new stadium in Utrecht have, however, chosen
to put their standing sections at the cornera of the ground,

bring in mv^e supporters or effect a revolution in behaviour.

       basis of a fund to assist clubs with the installation of seating
       and/or to help with tha construction of new stadia.
       2. 16 The time-seale tor the Introduction o£ higher percentages of
       seating can he accelerated if assistance is available from
       elsewhere.   The 7 \ and The football League will propose to other
       bodies/ such as The Football Trust/Football grounds Improvement
       Trust, that such assistance be given,    a further reason for
       giving these proposals, and those relating to safety on terraces
       the backing of law, is that Football Ground# Improvement Trust is
       entitled by its deed to grant aid work necessarily carried out as
       a condition of the issue oJHaTfirc«y,*l,icenee, up to 75% of the
       total cost.

    2.17 Given The fa and The football League's willingneei
c>Y the necessary finances/ there is a strong case for the government
    to reciprocate with a reduction in the pool betting tax from
    42,5% to 40%,   This would release £16/000,000 per annum which the
    Pool Promoters Might be persuaded to alloaate for ground
    improvements* thereby putting the game in receipt of over
    €30, 000,000 per year from pools sources. There is no need to
    create a Football Levy Board/ as proposed by the Rothschild
v Commission in 1977.Cwhen it recommended a reduction of duty to
    37%)l because the Football Trust/Football Grounds Improvement
r Trust already acts as a suitable vehicle withrproven tracX

   2. 16 Much criticism is levelled at football for what is seen by
   many as wasteful spending on transfer fees. This criticism
   ignores the basic fact that transfers are a "circulating fund*
   that enables smaller olubs to derive ouch needed income by
   investing in young players and realizing the investment by
  selling on the asset to one of the bigger clubs. It is not a
  case of choosing between facilities and players.    The success of
   a el us on the field of play is the major consideration for most
  supporters.    A team that is winning attracts more spectators than
  when it is not performing so well.    The attendance flguree quoted
  above for Glasgow Rangers matches indioate whet can be achieved
  when a club is playing well and, at the same time gives its
  public good facilities.    Glasgow Rangers have invested as heavily
  as any club ia the transfer market in recent tines. Clubs must,
  therefore, looJc to their playing strength as well as to the
  comfort and safety of their grounds.    No club shies away from
  expendi ture on essential safety work.   Each club does, however,
  have to decide for itself the appropriate balance between its
  spending on player's and on the Improvement of facilities.   The
  current tax ayefraw,—                           i^            M

    3. 2 The Guide to Safety at Sport* Grounds does not have the force
    of law. tt is the recommendation of The soofchaiLi. *sgp«efre4riiivt and
    The Football League that certain parts of the Guide should he
    made mandatory.   We examine these below. (3. 3)
   3. 2 It is the view of the FA and The Football League that, while
   a certain amount of local flexibility is required, there should
   be established a central direction to easure standard practices
   in the implementation of she Safety of Sports Grounds Act and the
   issuing of safety certificates.   It is not our proposal that the
   certificates ehoui'd be issued centrally.  This should continue to
   he the function of the local authority.   However, procedures -
   and the criteria applied - do, in our view require
   standardization.   A far from exhaustive enquiry amongst clubs has
   revealed that tha person responsible for the issue of the clubs1
   safety certificates might he the Building Regulation* officer,
   the Fire Officer or the Planning Officer, in many cases, these
   people have no direct expedience of problems of safety within
   football grouaas.   The widely varying attitude to perimeter
   fencing following Hillsborough illustrates this need for central
   direction.
     3 Seotioaa of the guide to Safety at Sports Grounds that the FA
   and T&4 Foot b a l l s y ague recommend should be mandatory
   3. 3. 1 Section 2 - Management responsibility

   The role of *Management" in the safety of spectators is
   diminished by the senior police officer taking overall control of
   events.  This inevitably leads to the emphasis being placed on
   public order, as against safety, tt is for this reason that we
   recommend that &ansgement be recognised as the responsible body
   with all that that eataila.  The requirement to provide first-aid
   facilitss should be wore clearly defined,  (See below. )

                   protecting it from invasion in all other circumstance*.                   The need
                    fox central direction is graphically illustrated by the confused
                   attitudes to fencing produced by the Hillsborough disaster.                   The
                   ?A and The Football League do not present themselves as technical
                   experts in this area.             They will/ however, monitor whet is
                   available on behalf of clubs.             They have already Inspected a
                   self-opening system in Nines, France and ace looking to conduct
                   an experiment with the systew in England,                even if there is no
                   one system that is appropriate to all grounds, the prevention of
                   pitch invasion* by one means or another should be made
                   compulsory.      The alternatives, from which the club end its
                   licensing authority should choose, should be included in the
                   <3ui.de. These alternatives may well include moats# as used on
                   many continental grounds.             Another possibility is the proposal
                   that was put forward in the seventies for a "double barrier”
                   system - effectively a dry moat at the same level as the pitch,
                   created hy establishing a walkway between a continual barrier and
                   a second barrier or wall adjacent totthe pitch. CujL d, ibku. Cu

 national membership ©oheme for football-  Football remains
 opposed to tne concept,  xt ha* stated# however# that it would
 wish to be responsible for the implementation of t&e scheme
 should the legislation be accepted by Parliament.
 4. 2 The FA and The Football League have appointed the Management
 Consultancy,, Arthur Young to advise on all aspects of the
 establishment of e national membership scheme*    {Append Report]
 The Minister for tfport has stated that the government will not
sanction the introduction of a scheme until such time as it is
 clear that tha necessary technology exists to ensure its
successful implementation.    In our view, a successful '
implementation must entail an assurance that the public can be
admitted to grounds without undue additional delays.     It is tha
view of the government that there should be a central
computerized registry of members and that membership cards should
be computer read at the point of entry to the ground.     Our
concern# which must be deepened following Hillsborough, is that
the time taXen to read each card and to deal with Invalid or
defective cards Will add intolerable waiting times to those
already experienced.    Appended to this fcubmissioa ( } is a study
conducted by Arthur Young at the Li ttl©woods Cup replay between
Arsenal and Liverpool on 9th November, 1368, when, between 3,000
and 5,000 people were locked out of a full Highbury Stadium, The
conclusion that Arthur Young have drawn from the queuing model
forming part of their study is that the absolute maximum
additional admission time that can be coped with for the
processing of each membership card is 2 seconds, Arthur Young
are currently evaluating the proposals that they have received
from a short-list of companies asked to bid for the provision of
the technology required for the implementation of the national
membership scheme.    While it is too early to judge whether the
companies will be able to meet this 2 second requirement# it is
certain that no system has been tried and tested to theee
standards in the real environment of a football match.

4. 3 Tine f a and I'ha Football Leaguo would sot wish to give the
impression from the foregoing that they are against the concept
of membership per se. Quite the contrary, ?hey recognise that
it is in the interests both of the clubs and the supporters for a
closer relationship to be developed between the parties.     The
examples of clubs ,such as Barcelona and Real Madrid/ each with
some 100,COO members, illustrate what can be achieved through a
close identification of club with community*     Many clubs are
already moving rapidly in this direction.     The Football Trust has
instituted a Community Relations Award Competition for clubs,
with cash prizes for the more enterprising schemes.     In its fisst
year, Miiiwall and Preston North End shared the main prise.
These submissions, together with that of Arsenal FC are appended
to this document.     (Appendix )
before and creating a nuisance, supporters were also staying on
after gamea and causing trouble and considerable expense was
incurred by tfta clubs who had to take overnight accommodation.
7, 2 it haa become tne practice in Scotland, for matches between
rivals Celtic and Ranger# to begin at 1. 00 pa. The polioe
believe that this Adduces tha time supporters have to consume
aloohol before the match.
7, 3 Seme police forces prefer all matches in an area to start at
tha same tine to avoid supporters clashing an route to ga»ea.
7. 4 There is a contract between The PA and the Football League on
tha one hand and tha Pools Companies on tha other that provides
for tha large majority of games each weak to ba played on
Saturday afternoon. This contract brings more than 93,000,000
into tha game of football*
7. S If kick-offs were moved to, say# 11. 00 am on Saturdays, the
problems outlined in 7.1 above In relation to the bank holiday
games in London could wall ba repeated. Any drinking prevented
by the earlier start would, in view of the relaxation la the
licencing lawp, simply be transferred to tha poat-match peristf,
Thera would be the additional risk of clashes between visiting
supporters and the usual Saturday morning shopping public.
?. 6 Sunday mosBinge ha?e also been suggested. Many of the above
criteria apply equally to Sundays, to which must bo added tha
objections cf residents, a substantial proportion of whom still
regard Sundays aa a day of quiet and rest. Furthermore,
according to low, a club may not legally deny entry to a match en
a Sunday to anyone who does not wish to pay.
7. 7 The FA and The Football League see no compelling argument for
a move from the traditional Saturday kick-off time of 3. 00 pm.
They do, however, fully accept that certain matches should be
played at other times in the interests of security. They will
continue to respond flexibly to recommendations from the police
on tha timing of this minority of problem games.

                6.   GETTING THS PUBLIC INTO QftQPWPfl EARLIER



•
                6. l it has become the practice since Hillsborough for the police


*
                 to insist upon the delay of kick-offs when there has been a
                build-up of supporters outside grounds close to the scheduled
                start of a match. This is undarstaadable, but is clearly
                unacceptable in the long-term. If it becomes the rule rather
                than the exception for matches to be delayed, the effect will
                simply be to encourage people to come later rather than earlier.
                The fears expressed in paragraph 4. 2 about further delays caused
                by the need to verify membership cards make it even more
                imperative for a means to be found of persuading the public to
                come to grounds earlier.

 \_ydrunkenness among football BuppCXtsrs.         This has not happened*
           at&ftdftgd pyastefcee now, among those who take moderate amounts,
     /ws well as t^oa® wfco consume too much, is either to buy alcohol
    / in supermarkets or off-licences and drink it in the street/ or to
tt.' stay in the pub until the last minute. The net effect is
      potentially lethal*       Large numbers of people*.some the wo#se for
      drink, arrive late and in a burry to get intaHjrame#. The police
       prefer to get supporters into grounds early, where they can he
      properly policed.       They will only go voluntarily into grounds at
      a reasonable time if they can have something palatable to eat *
      and drink.     The prohibition on the consumption of alcohol on
      trains and in coaches, going to football matches has resulted in
      more and -.ore people travelling to matches in private vehicles*
      The hired mini-bus has become particularly popular,       The number
      of special trains bringing Liverpool supporters to the last three
      eetni-finals at Hillsborough in which the club has featured has
      been* in chronological order, 13, 3 and i. A greater load is
      thus thrown onto the road *yste» and the police have greater
      aifficulty in obtaining intelligence about the movement of
      supporters.     The PA and The Football League reooaunend, therefore,
      that the element* of [ alcohol legislation] restricting the tale
      of alcohol in grounds and prohibiting the consumption of alcohol
      on transport, be repealed,       it is further recommended that coach
      operators, carrying football supporters to matches be ve$ulr*d by
      law to register with the police their schedules and projected
      routes.


          7.   POLICY ON KICK-OV? TIMES


     7* l By tradition, weekend matches in The Football League and FA
     Cup begin at 3, 00 pm. Proa time to time the suggestion is stade
     that crowd control would be facilitate* by the greater use of
     morning kick-offs.   it is in fact the practice of some clubs to
     ?re<nn bank holiday games at 11, 00 am or u. 30 aa. Most prsfar
     the traditional start time.   Some years age ( how many} the
     Metropolitan Pol.toe persuaded ail of the London Clubs to begin
     their bank holiday games ia the morning. After an© {?J season,
     the oxper.Jment was dropped as gates had fallen, local Public
     Houses were losing business, supporters ware travelling the ni^ht

             9     gDUCATION


             5. I The FA spends a large asiQuat aach year on its educational
             programme.     to. the financial year 1396, the amount was
             £ 1, 191, 440, made up ot tha cost of running courses and The
             National Football School, and of supporting the FA Youth Trust
             and the PA National Sports Centre Trust. Since 1982, when Mr
             Bobby Robson was appointed oJt Rational coach, The fa has stepped
             up tha marketing of it& coaching and other educational
             activities, with the       au.lt that the numbers attending courses
             have risen fxoa 19,524 ia 19S2 to 2i0,fl09 in 19§8.

             9. 2 Much r>t this iscreas® is accounted for by the introduction of
             teaching and leisure prograwaes for young people. All of tfcess

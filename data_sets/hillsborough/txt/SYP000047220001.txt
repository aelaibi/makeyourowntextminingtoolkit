28th June 1990

Dear lHr Tope

I now act fear* the parents of Ian David Whelan in place of Messrs Colin
Watson & Co of Warrington.

I a® trying to tie up a number of loose ends for Mr and Mrs Whelan, I
anticipate that either yourself or Matt Sawers may be able to help with one
of the* if you would be so kind.

Ifr* and Mrs Whelan have seen photograph reference AH/9 (paragraph 12 in the
Coroner's Summary) and they recall that Ian has a jacket over him at that
stage.   They believe that the individual who laid the jacket on their son
nay have been one of the man who was assisting in the carrying of Ian on the
hoarding across the pitch and they are anxious to try and trace this
individual if at al 1 possible for two reasons.

Firstly   to thank him far his help and secondly (and perhaps mere
importantly) to try and find out from him what state Ian was in when he
found him and whether any efforts ware made by this individual (or anyone
else) to revive their son or whether it was believed that he was beyond help
when this individual first came into contact with him.

I appreciate that you may have no information about the jacket or its owner
but I have said to Mr and Mrs Whelan that I wi 11 speak to you and !y p if you
can help then in any way. Can you?

Kind regards                                                                   ay        'A'      HW*-               -basu,

Dear David,

I attach correspondence which I have received from Trevor and Jenni
Hicks concerning the Peter Wright interview carried by the Sheffield
Star.  You will recall that Mr. & Mrs. Hicks lost their two daughters
during the course of the Hillsborough disaster.

I strongly support the sentiments expressed in. his letter and hope
that you will feel able to say something publicly about the attempts
to smear supporters who attended the Hillsborough game.

I look forward to your response.

Yours sincerely.
Jel                                                          Trevor & Jenni Hicks

                            re: Peter Wright Article

 rarther  to  our   discussions  I enclose   copies  of  the "Sheffield Star"
 newspaper that carried the interview with Peter Wright.

      You will see that despite Taylor and all  the conflicting  evidence to
 the   contrary he  insists  on  claiming  drink was   a major factor in the
 disaster.The families find this outrageous and offensive to the memories of
 our loved ones.

      He  also claims  that   "additional evidence, particularily about* the
 effect of alcohol on fans will present a different picture  at the Coroners
 Inquest." This is alarming families and again is most offensive.

 It is wrong that Mr. Wright should infer/ use confidential information (if
 indeed he has it i) to deflect the critiscsym that he  justly was subjected
 to.He is abusing his    priviledged position. His comments  beg two further
 questions

 1)why was all the     evidence not given to Taylor /West Midlands Police?

 2 ) It could be argued that this act of "disclosure" could well
 prejudice the Coroners Inquest/ Jurors.

 At the Inquiry, Andrew Collins QC became so vexed at the Police B a r r i s t e r ’s
 ( Mr.Woodward QC)    attempts to use this smear tactic that he released blood
 alcohol levels of   the victims in an attempt    to stop  it. Now  here we go
 again.

 I would welcome your   views on how we  can stop  it once  and for all and
 obviously a statement from Mr. Waddington  supporting Taylor would be one
 way.

                                 Yours F

The Lord Justice Taylor,
The Hillsborough Enquiry,
The Town Hall,
Sheffield


25th May 1989


Dear Lord Justice Taylor,


On Tuesday,         16th May your Enquiry heard evidence from Mr Ian
Clarke about his experiences at Hillsborough and afterwards.
During the course of his evidence Mr Clarke stated that while
he was in hospital two BBC journalists attempted to gain
access to him after falsely claiming to be his uncle and
aunt.


The BBC has looked carefully into the conduct of its
journalists covering Hillsborough.         We can find no trace of
the incident Mr Clarke described.         And given the guidelines
to which our journalists work, and their general conduct,                        it
would surprise me very much if we had.          I have no doubt that
the people described by Mr Clarke were as false in their
claim to be from the BBC as in their claim to be related to
him .

Yours sincerely,




JOHN BIRT

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

I refer to the submission which you and the Football League put
forward for Part II of the Inquiry. Lord Justice Taylor has read
this and has asked for clarification on the following points

i.    He would like to know more about the merits of the arguments
      on transfer fees outlined in paragraph 5.26.  In particular,
      what is the source of the money originally used in the
      example? Also, there seems to be some disparity between the
      amount raised in transfer fees and the amount spent on
      ground improvement. Are there any reasons for this other
      than the argument that the present system gives strong
      fiscal inducements to clubs to spend on players rather than
      improvements?

ii.   Do the Football Association and Football League fund safety
      at football grounds at present and how would they expect to
      see safety improvements funded in the future?

iii. Has a joint organisation to run football, embracing the
     Football Association and the Football League, ever been
     considered? What are the issues involved?

I look forward to your reply in due course.    I have sent a letter
in similar terms to the Football League.

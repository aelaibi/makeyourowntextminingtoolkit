               Gary    sto pped     to talk w i t K us b r i e f 1y , and said that he was making                      his

               way    to the     ground,       anty a s k e d w h ic h   part    of    the ground we were       in.     He

               then    carried      on his way,         walk in g     towards     the    ground.      We knew that      he

               was    in the s ta nd in g       s e c ti on and       I believe       that   he was   going   to the

               g ro un d at    that     time    so as     to be able       to get a good         position.

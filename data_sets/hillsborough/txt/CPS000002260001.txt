1 The issue of partial intervention in a private prosecution is raised by Chris Enzor
  in his minute of 14/12.1 have discussed this further with him and note below the
  points considered.

2 Re para.3: it may be more helpful to see the role of the CPS as being to exercise a
  discretion in relation to private prosecutions which should be guided by the
  principle that the CPS will only take over a private prosecution “ when there is a
  particular need for it to do so on behalf of the public.” The right of private
  prosecution is a constitutional right enshrined in the POA 1985. That right should
  only be constrained where necessary to prevent its abuse.

3 Re para.6: there may be no logical distinction between the two situations
  envisaged by Chris Enzor, but there is a practical and rational distinction in the
  exercise of the discretion by the CPS. The two situations are not the same. In the
  Hillsborough situation there is no ground under the CPS policy to intervene in the
  charges which make up the main part of the case. The balance of the case is
  strongly in favour of non-intervention. In the hypothetical case, the charges which
  make up the main part of the case are charges where the CPS consider that there is
  clearly no case on the evidence. In that case it is necessary for the CPS to
  intervene on a charge-by-charge basis in order to achieve a just result. ( The
  evidential position requires intervention but once the CPS has intervened to take
  over and discontinue the main charges it would be bound by the Code to
  discontinue the lesser charge although to do so would defeat the policy on private
  prosecution.)

4    In the present case the practical considerations which provide the basis for
    exercising the discretion in favour of non-intervention are: firstly, that on the main
    charges the CPS have not concluded that there is clearly no case; secondly, that
    continuation by the private prosecutor on the one peripheral charge, (and, in the
    context, lesser charge) would not place the one defendant ( Duckinfield) in
    significantly greater jeopardy since he will in any event be facing proceedings for
    manslaughter and other offences; and the defendant has an alternative remedy if
    he believes that the prosecution for attempt pervert,etc has no evidential basis -
    either to argue abuse of process or to make a no case submission at committal.

RE:   HILLSBOROUGH -
      THE ATTEMPT PERVERT COURSE OF JUSTICE CHARGE


      I have spent some time over the last couple of days thinking about the
      complex issue of whether to take over the attempt pervert course of justice
      charge alone, i.e. intervening in part in the Hillsborough prosecution. I have
      looked very carefully at your letter to Stephen Wooler and I hope you will not
      think it unhelpful of me to raise the issue again.

      In your letter you set out a tentative conclusion that it is possible to take over
      part of a private prosecution in order to discontinue it and leave the remainder
      of the case to be run by the private prosecutor. This follows the arguments
      contained in George Croston’s review and I support those arguments.

      Further support for this view may be derived from the argument that our
      policy on private prosecutions is in effect a duty, where a request has been
      made by either party that we take over “the case” for whatever reason. Our
      own policy states that where there is clearly no case to answer a prosecution
      commenced in such circumstances would be unfounded and would therefore
      be an abuse of the right to bring a prosecution.

      Having discussed this briefly with Dru, she pointed out the case of Doody —v-
      Secretary o f State fo r the Home Department [1993] 3 A ll ER 92. At page 106,
      Lord Mustill summarises the principles to be applied in the exercise of
      statutory powers. The following principles can be summarised thus:
•    Statutory powers must be applied in a manner which is fair in all the
     circumstances
•    Standards of fairness are not immutable and may change over time
•    The principles of fairness are not to be applied by rote identically in
     every situation; the context must be taken into account
•    Fairness will often require the opportunity for a person affected to make
     representations either before or after the decision is taken
•    Fairness will often require that a person affected should know the gist of
     the case against him in order to make representations.

If the relative seriousness of the charges were reversed, i.e. a private
prosecution consisted of several charges, the most serious of which was so
weak that there is clearly no case to answer. In those circumstances, I suggest
we would conclude that we would have little choice but to intervene in the
most serious charge and discontinue it. Our position on the other charges
would depend on our assessment of the strength of the evidence. If, as in
Hillsborough, we concluded that the charges fell between clearly no case to
answer and realistic prospect, I suggest we would let the private prosecution
continue on those charges only.

The question I pose here is whether there is any logical distinction of
substance which can be made between that hypothetical situation and the
Hillsborough situation? In my view, there is not and I refer to paragraph 4.1
of the Code, “if the case does not pass the evidential test, it must not go ahead,
no matter how important or serious it may be”. The Code does not permit a
distinction to be made on the basis of the seriousness of the charge when
applying the evidential test.

I think there are other arguments which militate in favour of taking over the
attempt pervert course of justice charge and I thought it would be helpful if I
briefly rehearsed these as I think there are some dangers for us if we do not
act.

I argue that taking over the case in part is more readily justifiable than not
intervening at all. In developing these arguments, I am mindful that our policy
on private prosecutions has been exposed to both the prosecutor and
defendants. I am also aware that the defendants are funded by South
Yorkshire Police and further that they have each put together very powerful
defence teams. There is every reason to suppose that they will go for judicial
review whatever our decision.             There has already been a hint in
correspondence when the defence argued that they considered the code tests
ought to have been applied. To the best of my knowledge, there has not been
a challenge on our policy on private prosecutions and the defence may well
consider that this is potentially fertile ground for them.

Leaving aside judicial review, I think there is still a problem in justifying a
decision not to intervene in part on its merits. If asked about the attempt to
pervert the course of justice charge, we could fairly quickly be backed into a
comer on the basis that we considered we could intervene in part, we thought
there was clearly no case to answer but we were influenced by our decision on
      the other charges. It will be difficult to maintain justification. I appreciate
      that we could attempt to avoid the issue by declining to comment on an
      individual charge basis. (In any event we would have to be extremely careful
      in what we say to the press as the case will still be sub judice, of course). Here
      it is appropriate to note the distinction between justifying our decision to the
      parties and justifying it more widely to the press.

10    I agree that it would be difficult to explain a decision to intervene in part,
      given the tight limits on our ability to explain a decision in relation to a case
      which continues before the courts. It ought not to be impossible, however, and
      the decision would be capable of being justified to the parties on the basis of a
      proper application of our policy on a charge by charge basis. I suggest also
      that we would be in a much stronger position should judicial review
      proceedings be commenced. We would then be able to demonstrate with ease
      to the court that we had considered our policy, we felt it should be applied on
      a charge by charge basis and we had applied it accordingly.

11    The converse argument is that we might find it difficult to sustain the non
      intervention line before the Divisional Court as we would immediately have to
      concede that we had not applied our own policy. This could even taint, in the
      eyes of the Court, a decision in relation to the other charges. The defendants
      would have a much better chance of persuading the court that the whole
      decision was wrong if they were able to point to part of it and criticise it with
      some certainty. I pose the question whether this could in itself put the entire
      policy on private prosecutions at risk?

12    I appreciate that my points of view may well be unattractive. I hope they are
       useful, if not in this case, then in any wider debate which may take place.

        RE:        HILLSBOROUGH -
                   THE ATTEMPT PERVERT COURSE OF JUSTICE CHARGE


        1          I have spent some time over the last couple of days thinking about the
                   complex issue of whether to take over the attempt pervert course of justice
                   charge alone, i.e. intervening in part in the Hillsborough prosecution. I have
                   looked very carefully at your letter to Stephen Wooler. I initially started this
                   minute on the basis that I felt there were powerful arguments in favour of
              I    partial intervention. I have since reconsidered, but I thought it might be
                   helpful to expose these arguments in case they are useful at a later stage in the
             ^     event that the policy is rewritten.

        2          In your letter you set out a tentative conclusion that it is possible to take over
                   part of a private prosecution in order to discontinue it and leave the remainder
                   of the case to be run by the private prosecutor. This follows the arguments
                   contained in George Croston’s review and I support those arguments.

^       3        ] Further support for this view may be derived from the argument that our
                 I nolicv on private prosecutions is in effect a duty, where a request has been
                   made by either party that we take over “the case” for whatever reason. It is
                   important here to note that any ‘duty’ is very limited in its application.

        4           The right to bring a private prosecution is enshrined in statute, of course. It is
                   considered an important constitutional right and is one which should not be
    ’              interfered with lightly. To intervene when it is not strictly necessary to do so
                   would be to act to the prejudice of the private prosecutor. Our own policy
                   states that where there is clearly no case to answer a prosecution commenced
in such circumstances would be unfounded and would therefore be an abuse of
the right to bring a prosecution. Thus we must be sure that there is clearly no
case to answer before stepping in to discontinue. The principle underlying the
policy here must be to give maximum effect to the right of the individual to
bring a private prosecution.

Dru has drawn my attention to the case of Doody -v- Secretary o f State fo r the
Home Department [1993] 3 All ER 92. At page 106, Lord Mustill summarises
the principles to be applied in the exercise of statutory powers. The following
principles can be summarised thus:

•    Statutory powers must be applied in a manner which is fair in all the
     circumstances
•    Standards of fairness are not immutable and may change over time
•    The principles of fairness are not to be applied by rote identically in
     every situation; the context must be taken into account
•    Fairness will often require the opportunity for a person affected to make
     representations either before or after the decision is taken
•    Fairness will often require that a person affected should know the gist of
     the case against him in order to make representations.

I suggest we should consider the principles set out in Doody in making our
decision.

If the relative seriousness of the charges were reversed, i.e. a private
prosecution consisted of several charges, the most serious of which was so
weak that there is clearly no case to answer. In those circumstances, I suggest
we would conclude that we would have little choice but to intervene in the
most serious charge and discontinue it. Our position on the other charges
would depend on our assessment of the strength of the evidence. If, as in
Hillsborough, we concluded that the charges fell between clearly no case to
answer and realistic prospect, I suggest we would let the private prosecution
continue on those charges only.

The question I pose here is whether there is any logical distinction of
substance which can be made between that hypothetical situation and the
Hillsborough situation? On one view, there is not and I refer to paragraph 4.1
of the Code, “if the case does not pass the evidential test, it must not go ahead,
no matter how important or serious it may be”. The Code does not permit a
distinction to be made on the basis of the seriousness of the charge when
applying the evidential test. It could be argued that there is a read across to the
private prosecution policy, ie. where there is clearly no case to answer the
charge must not be allowed to proceed no matter how serious (or trivial, I
might add) it is.

I think there are other arguments which militate in favour of taking over the
attempt pervert course of justice charge and I thought it would be helpful if I
briefly rehearsed these as I think there are some potential dangers for us if we
do not act.
   It could be argued that taking over the case in part is more readily justifiable

     proceedings be commenced. We would then be able to demonstrate with ease
     to the court that we had considered our policy, we felt it should be applied on
     a charge by charge basis and we had applied it accordingly.


    ( The  converse argument is that we might find it difficult to sustain the non

     we had not applied our own policy on an individual charge basis. This could
     taint, in the eyes of the Court, a decision in relation to the other charges. The

     decision was wrong if they were able to point to part of it and criticise it. I
(    pose the question whether this could in itself put the entire policy on private
     prosecutions at risk?

    11 Having exposed some of the arguments in favour of partial intervention, I
    m readily accept that there are arguments which go the other way.

      In paragraph 8 I pose the question whether there is a logical difference. At one
      level the answer is probably not, in pure logical terms. However there are
      powerful practical/rational arguments which enable a distinction to be made.
16      Where the more serious charge fails the ‘clearly no case to answer’ test, it
        would be likely that it would be appropriate to step in and take over and
        discontinue, even on a partial basis. It would be wrong for the defendant to be
        in before the court where there is clearly no case. Intervention would thus be
        necessary to achieve a fair result. Whilst the defendant would still face other
        charges, it would be unfair on the defendant to face the trauma of the more
        serious charge.

17      The distinction where the weak charge is less serious is that the defendant will
        continue to suffer the trauma of the more serious charges. It is unlikely that
        continuing to face the less serious charge would unduly add to the trauma of
        the proceedings. There can be little doubt that the manslaughter charges in the
        Hillsborough case far outweigh the attempt pervert charge in their seriousness.

18      Further, the defendant retains another remedy, ie. asking the court to discharge
        the charge at committal proceedings. True, this is available in the case where
        the weak charge is the more serious, but the trauma argument would still be in
     11 play. This can be put in another way, will the defendant suffer prejudice as the
     V- result of non intervention?

19      The question then becomes, is partial intervention necessary in the interest of
        fairness? In this context, necessary really means essential.

20      Taking all factors in account, the decision may be perceived to be finely
        balanced, with competing factors on both sides. That being the case, the
        decision ought to be exercised in favour.of non intervention. Further, the
        Doody arguments lend considerable support to the view that the decision,
        unlike the Code test, must not be taken in isolation from other relevant and
        appropriate factors.

21      I understand that the view at this stage is that it is likely that the decision will
         remain in favour of non intervention. I hope that this minute may be helpful in
         exposing these arguments for use at a later stage in the event of a policy re­
         write.

22      George Croston has seen this minute and he agrees with the views expressed.

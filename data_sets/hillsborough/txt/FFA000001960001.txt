14. SEMI-FINAL TIES - F.A. CHALLENGE CUP   It was reported that
      at a meeting of the Challenge Cup Committee earlier that
      day concern had been expressed in respect of the disbursement
      of money from Semi-Final Ties.   It was their feeling that at
      present it was possible for the staging club to make more
      money from Semi-Final matches than the two competing teams.
      A discussion followed during which various members expressed
      their views but it was felt that further financial information
      should be available before any recommendation could be made.
      During the discussion reference was again made to the possibili ty
      of staging the two Semi-Final Ties at Wembley Stadium in view
      of difficulties which were often experienced when deciding
      venues for these matches.  Mr. Millichip pointed out that this
      would be a policy decision and would require the consideration
      of the Executive Committee and the Challenge Cup Conmittee.

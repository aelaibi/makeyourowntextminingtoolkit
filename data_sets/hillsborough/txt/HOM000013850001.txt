           Dear Mr Addison
           HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER : COMPENSATION CLAIMS
           In my two previous letters I have made reference to the uninsured compensation
           liabilities which might arise from impending civil actions against the Chief
           Constable in relation to the Hillsborough disaster.
           Unfortunately although half a year and more has elapsed since the date of the
           disaster, the size of this liability remains a matter of conjecture.
           Nonetheless I am now in the course of preparing a budget for submission to the
           Police Authority in December. Within this budget, provision will have to be
           made for the above costs on the best information that is available in the new
           year in order to raise sufficient money from the precept on the district
           councils.

           The Authority has instructed me to write to you to enquire under what
           circumstances and to what extent the Home Office will consider giving further
           special assistance to the Authority in meeting what could conceivably be a very
           substantial burden.

           I should be grateful for a reply to this enquiry before the end of November so
           that the Police Authority can have some feel of the possible size of this one
           item when considering the rest of the budget for the coming year.
           Yours sincerely




           R C Johnston
           Clerk and Financial Officer

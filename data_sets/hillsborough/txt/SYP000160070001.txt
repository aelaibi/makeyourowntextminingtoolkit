Dear Mr Glover
Ian Thomas Glover (deceased)
Further to my letter of the 7th January 1997, I have now received the information that I
needed concerning your enquiry. I am sorry that this has taken a little more than the
fourteen days that I originally hoped.
I am happy to confirm that each of the items listed in your letter is to be sent out to you
shortly. Because we do not have facilities to copy video tapes or photographs here they
will in fact come from the police. Should you not hear from the police within 28 days
please contact me.
In each of the three categories of evidence you include the phrase “and also any other
evidence you may be able to give me". I am sure you appreciate that the evidence relating
to the Hillsborough Inquests amounts to a huge mass of paper. If you wish to have sight of
any document that was taken in evidence at the inquests I would be very pleased to assist
but it is simply not practicable for me to give you such further assistance unless you are
able to be rather more specific.
Finally, you are quite correct in your understanding that a video record was kept of the
inquest proceedings. This was taken as a back-up of the work of the shorthand writers. It
simply consists of a wide view of the front part of the court from a fixed position. In other
words the camera is never moved.
There are a total of 186 tapes and the cost of copying them would be quite
disproportionate, particularly as they add nothing to the transcript which I assume you
have already had sight of. If there is a particular point that you would like clarifying from
the videos please let me know.
I hope this is of somg, assistance to you.

Dear Mr Lowe
Hillsborough Inquest
I enclose a copy of a letter received yesterday from Mr Glover, the contents of which are
self-explanatory.
There is obviously some history behind this. I would be grateful if you could just ascertain
the up-to-date position from a police point of view and then make contact with me.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear

I write with referenceto your letter dated 3 February 1997.

I feel the best advice I can give to assist you in your work is that youobtain copies of both the
Interim Report and       Final Report of Lord Justice Taylor, following hisenquiry into the
Hillsborough Disaster. These will address the subject matter in your assignment.

Unfortunately I do      not have a spare copy of these, but they can be obtained from
Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 49 High Holburn, London WC1V 6HB. The Interim Report is
reference number 0101076522 and is priced at £10.30; the Final Report is reference number
0101096224 and is priced at £10.50.

Should you require any assistance or clarification on any particular point please do not hesitate to
contact me.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am currently a student at                                                studying a B-TEC
National Diploma in Public Services. For one of my subjects I have been assigned to cany
out ,over five months an in-depthstudy
                                     ^ of the Hillsborouch
                                                        C* D isaster.
                                                             —        I plan to include
                                                                             w. u           ini Uljr
                                                                                  iv iu u v u   my
assignment areas such as; what really happened on that day; police action on the day; the
role of the social services after the disaster and the action taken by the Football
Association.

Any information regarding the above will be very helpful to me, in addition, if you have
any visual data for example a plan of the ground before and after the disaster you will be
helping me an awful lot in completing a well researched and worthwhile study.

I thank you for any help you can give me in researching the above.


Yours Faithfully

           Dear Sir

           You will be aware that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith met with a number o f families during his
           visit to Liverpool last week. In some o f those meetings he asked whether the families had
           received a complete body file from South Yorkshire Police. In the following cases I was
           unable to state categorically that a fail body file had been released and undertook to clarity this
           with yourself: -

           Paul Carlile;
           Michael Kelly;
           Philip Hammond;
           Kevin and Christopher Traynor

           In all o f the above cases some information has been released to families in the past. On this
           basis, only a limited amount o f information was supplied to myself as you assured me that this
           comprised the remainder o f the body-fiie. However, at individual meetings with Lord Justice
           Stuart-Smith families o f the above named deceased identified gaps in the evidence provided so
           far. In order that I might comply with my undertaking to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith I should
           be grateful if you would provide me with a copy o f the complete body file.

           I thank you for your assistance.

           Yours faithfully

                     At 0945 am on Saturday,            15th April               1989,    < 150489)     I commenced duty at

                     the Hillsborough Football Ground,                          briefing          commenced at 1000 am in

                                                                   —        —                 —                  ■— ?
                                                        I was under the supervision of PS Chapman,,

                     serial     one which      covered the track area of the ground.                             A f X.«rf

                     completion of the briefing             I took up postiion on the track under the

                     Nortlj^Stand n        e    L   e   p    p         i        n   g     s        Lane end.     Usually I

                     always work the track below the West Stand but for some reason I

                     stayed at the North Stand on this                          particular match.           I then commenced

                     patrol around the track area noticing a few Liverpool                                     fans wpre

                     already within the          central    pen of the West Stand.                       The Spion Kop was

                     also beginning to get a trickle of Nottingham Forest                                   fans    in.

                    At approximately           1,45 pm <1345)              I went to the gymnasium on direction of

                    PS Chapman for a hot meal.                I returned about 2.15 pm (1415)                           to see

                     that the Spion Kop was almost full with Nottingham Forest fans, as I

                    walked past the first gate of the Kop I was called back by several

                    Liverpool      fans    requesting that             I escort them to the West Stand so

                     that they could be with their own side.                              I asked them where there

                     ticket allocation waS for within the ground,                                  they stated the Spion
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 R476

Kop.     I refused them stating that they should stand to the                left of

the Kop in a p a r t i t i o n e d a r e a set aside for Liverpool   fans,

a ppr oximately;twenty Liverpool      fans    came to ask the same question

-■whilst I was speaking to this particular youth,            again they were all

Refused.     I told them to return to their places, they then became

abusive anci I walked away,        ! took up my position around the track

and remained there awaiting kick off.               I could see that all area of

the ground were full apart from the extreme              pens situated in the West

Stand where Liverpool      supporters were,         but 1 did not tend to take

much notice        I concentrated on the North Stand where             I was stood.

The    crowcL/was very noisy,   chanting and singing and I could not hear

any radio transmissions whatsoever.

At ^approximately 2.50 pm <1450) the Liverpool             footballers    came out

f n t n the pitch, again I did not take any notice of the pitch area

only the North Stand where        I was.     As kick off took place I saw

Liverpool    fans climbing aver the fencing from the central              pen in the

lower West Stand     into the extreme       pens.     The central    pen now looked

overcrowded and     X could see that there was still          room in the outer

areas.     I again did not give it a second thought and carried on with

my own dut ies.

At 3.05/6 pm <15055      I was aware of Police Officers         coming onto the

pitch and could see Liverpool        fans from the West Stand spilling onto

the pitch,    I immediately thought that Nottingham Forest fans had

managed to get into the West Stand and that fighting was taking                   place

and that Police Officers were bringing them out to transfer them to

the Spion Kop.      I still   could hear no radio transmissions taking

place.     I remember an announcement        being made on the tannoy by Police

Constable Ryan in the      control box but      I couldn't hear any of it due

to the noise and mayhem on the pitch.               Nottingham Forest fans were

chanting towards     the West Stand,       it became, obvious from watching that
                                                                                 PAGE     3

there was a major          problem with overcrowding and fans were now

straying onto the pitch area where the match was taking place,                    I saw

a Senior officer          run onto the pitch and take hold of the referees arm

anif obviously ask for play to foe stopped.             This he d i d and the

footjsallefs ran up the players tunnel.               I then saw a young man with

h i V a r m ; totally    broken as though it had been embedded around the

ste»el b a r k e r s within the pen.       He was taken by a St. John

Ambulajgr'ceman towards the gym area.           It then struck me that not only

was A h e r e    overcrowding but casualties as well.         Still    there was no

   mmand or none heard as to what we- as police officers should be doing

at this stage.            I then saw hoardings being     ripped from around the

track by both police and football             fans,   casualties were being carried

on these hoardings which were being used as stretchers towards the

gymnasium area.           There were hundreds of police and fans on the pitch

but still no instructions were made and               it was a case of doing what

everyone thought they should at the time.                I. tried to calm drunken

Liverpool        fans down who had come to the front of the North Stand in

order to jump over onto the pitch',            I was explaining that there was

enough problems at the moment and they would only contribute to that

further by going onto the pitch,             this they ignored and became very

abusive and I expected getting assaulted at this stage by them so I

left them and walked up to the West Stand area to see if I could help

anyone.         As 1 approached I saw a drunken Liverpool youth run down'

towards the Spion Hop,           scarf   in hand and entice them.      There was a

lot of shouting and abuse going off around the pitch area by all

concerned and I remember thinking that besides trying to deal with a

major incident there was going to be a pitch invasion and a full

scale    riot.         I saw Police Officers and fans together        carrying   people

on hoardings and officers           carrying out mouth to mouth as were St.

J o h n ’s Ambulancemen/women and fans.          I saw people laid on the floor

      with coats/jumpers, over their heads and it ,on.ly then struck me that a

      major disaster had happened.                        I helped injured people to the gym

      After a short while                   I ’m not sure of the time I went          into the

f   ^ g y m n a s i u m area and saw the extent of what had happened,                     dead bodies

      were beginning to be laid in rows into some type of order                             if that was

      possible.           A Detective Sergeant 724 Hallows approached me whilst                       in

      the gym and requested I follow him,                         he then identified to me the body

      of Eric Hughes              I was then told to stand by with the body and that I

      would be dealing with this sudden death.

      1 then remained in the gym all evening together with other officers

      until there were eventually 95 bodies                         in this area,     identification of

      the deceased was taking place all through the night but no relatives

      attended to identify Eric Hughes that evening so at around 0445 am on

      Sunday,        16 April         1989, a decision was made for all bodies to be

      transported to the Medico Legal Centre.                           I then escorted the body of

      Mr. Hughes          by ambulance to the mortuary together with all                    his

      possessions.              The body was           laid out by C1D officers and the relevant

      paperwork completed as in a normal                         sudden death.

At $ 9k5am on Saturday the 15th of April 1989 I commenced duty at the Hillsborough
Football Ground, briefing commenced at 10.00am in the North Stand, conducted by
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and other senior officers. I was under the supervision
of PS Chapman, serial one which covered the track area of the ground. After completion
of the briefing I took up position on the track under the North Stand near to the
West Stand, Leppings Lane end. Usually I always           work the track below the West Stand
but for some reason I stayed at the North Stand on this particular match. I then
commenced patrol around the track area noticing a few Liverpool fans were already
within the central pen of the West Stand. The Spion Cop was also beginning to get a
trickle of Nottingham Forest fans in.
At approximately 1.^5pm I wegt to the gymnasium on direction of PS Chapman for a
hot meal. I returned about 2.15pm to see that the spion cop was almost full with
Nottingham Forest fans, as I walked past the first gate of the cop I was called back by
several Liverpool fans requesting that I escort them to the West Stand so that they could
be with their own side. I asked them where there ticket allocation was for within the
ground, they stated the spion cop, I refused them stating that they should stand to the left
of the cop in a partitioned area set aside for Liverpool fans, approximately twenty
Liverpool fans came to ask the same question whilst I was speaking to this particular
youth, again they were all refused, I told them to return to their places, they then
became abusive and I walked away. I took up my postion around the track and remained
there awaiting kick off. I could see that all area of the gDOund were full apart
from the extreme pens situated in the West Stand where Liverpool supporters were,
but i±I did not tend to take much notice as I concentrated on the North Stand where I was sbc

At approximately 2.50pm the Liverpool footballers came out onto the pitch, again I
did not take any notice of the pitch area only the North Stand where I was. As kick
off took place I saw Liverpool fans climbing over the fencing from the central pen
in the lower West Stand into the extreme pens. The central pen npw looked overcrowded
and I could see that there was still room in the outer areas. I again did not give
it a second thought and carried on with my own duties. Ix
At 3»05/6pm I w%s aware of police officers coming onto the pitch and could see Liverpool

Nottingham Forest fans had managed to get into the West Stand and that fighting was

 his he did and the footballers ran up the players tunnel. I then saw a young man
with his arm totally broken as though it had been embedded around the steel barriers
within the pen. He was taken by a St John Ambulanceman towards the gym area. It then
struck me that not only was there overcrowding but casualties as well. Still there was
no command or none heard as to what we as police officers should be doing at this stage.
I then saw hoardings being ripped from around the track by both police and football fans,
casualties were being carried on these hoardings which were being used as strechers
towards the gymnasium area. There were hundreds of police and fans on the pitch t

riot. I saw police officers and fans together carrying people on hoardings and
officers carrying out mouth to mouth as were St Johns Ambulancemen/women and fans.
I saw people layed on the floor with coats/jumpers over their heads and it only then
struck me that a major distaster had happened. I helped injured people tothe gym area,
a woman who was frantically look for her husband came and grabbed hold of meandbegged
me to look for her husband with her which I did and we eventually found sad&Bshim safe and well
at the gym area. She thanked and hugged me and they went on their way. Whilst at the gym
area I started together with another police woman obtaining names and address', phone nos
4f possible of casualties being transported to hospital by ambulance so that some reference
could be made to people enquiring about relatives/friends.
After a short while I'm not sure of the time I went into the gymnasium area and saw the exten
of what had happened, dead bodies were beginning to be layed in rows into some type of
orier if that was possible. A Detectiwe Sergeant 72^ Hallows approached me whilst in the gym
and requested I follow him, he then identified to me the body of Eric Hughes, I was then
told to stand by with the body and that I would be dealing with this sudden death.
I then remained in the gym all evening together with other officers until there were

the night but no relatives attended to identify Eric Hughes that evening so at around
^f.^am on Sunday the 16th of April 1989 a decision was made for all bodies to be transported

officers and the relevant paperwork completed as in a normal sudden death.
At approximately 5 .15am that date I retired from duty.

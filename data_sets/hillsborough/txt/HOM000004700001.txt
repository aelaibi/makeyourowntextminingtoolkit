   TAYLOR REPORT: NEW OFFENCES                                             2lr<M 0
   You copied to me your letter of 20 August to Geoffrey Howe.

   2.   I note that the costs that fall to central   government  are
   unlikely to be significant. Provided that colleagues can agree to
   absorb whatever costs  arise from these proposals    from within
   existing resources I am content.

   3.   As for the costs that fall on local authorities, you will
   have seen the exchange of correspondence between Chris Patten and
   myself about new burdens on local authorities.       Following the
   proposals set out in my letter of 14 August, I would be grateful
   if you could let me have an estimate, agreed with Chris, of what
   those costs are likely to be.  Could you also confirm that you
   think the proposal is sufficiently important that you would if
   necessary be prepared to give up equivalent spending on a central
   government programme?

    4.   I am sending copies of this letter to members of QL and H
    Committees,   and to   First   Parliamentary    Counsel    and
    Sir Robin Butler.

From

Date      20 November 1995

          GRANADA TV: HILLSBOROUGH

            Granada TV, will be here on Friday 24 November at
11am.

I have been through some of the Hillsborough files and I have
copied the final letters and some of the initial statements.

I have yet to go through the cupboard which is said to have the
rest of the files.

The main file                  is in the paper room nearest to
registry on the far rack, bottom row.

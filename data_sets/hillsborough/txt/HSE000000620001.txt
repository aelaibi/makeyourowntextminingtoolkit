Summary


Examination of turnstiles A-G confirmed that although old, somewhat worn and in many
cases in need of lubrication/routine maintenance etc all were working satisfactorily
and would each allcw at least 20 persons per minute throughput.

Data on load/pedal release pressure tests, throughput and conputer count tests are
the subject of a separate RLSD report.

SUBJECT:     EXAMINATION OF TURNSTILES A-G
USER         SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB, HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD
INTRODUCTION



I visited the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ground during the week commencing

the 24th of April 1989 to continue investigations at your request and in accordance

with the wishes of the judicial enquiry team headed by Justice Taylor.



I was present on site between the 24th and 28th of April with the exception of

Thursday the 27th of April and on each occasion I was acconpanied by Mr C J Pertee,

Principal Specialist Inspector, Construction Engineering, North East FCG.      During

the week I examined turnstiles 17-23 (A-G) and this report contains the results of

this examination.



TURNSTILES


The general layout of the 7 turnstiles A-G which feed the west terrace at the football

ground is shown in Fig. 1 of my earlier report NE/PCG 14/M/18/89 and details are

confirmed in Messrs Ralph Braid & Associates drawing no. 1340/Q£.




                                         1
A general view of the turnstiles from the approach side is shewn in Fig. 2 and from

the egress side in Fig. 3.



All the turnstiles were of considerable age and were noted to have been manufactured

by Messrs W D Ellison & Co Ltd, Irlam, Manchester. Details of the turnstiles and

their method of operation are shown in the makers trade literature at Appendix 1.



All the turnstiles were of the lew pattern type and turnstiles A, C, D, E, F and G

were fitted with convex arms. Turnstile B was fitted with straight arms.


I took detailed dimensions in all the turnstile enclosures and assisted with

functional tests of each unit.


All the turnstile ratchets were working satisfactorily and although vrom, all the

foot pedals and footstep motion cams were working correctly.    Some of the lower

mechanisms were in need of lubrication, however, this did not prevent the mechanisms

from operating satisfactorily and allowing at least 20 persons per minute to pass

through each turnstile.


I noted the patent nuntoers on the turnstil^| which were shown as 658191 and 658226

and were marked on several of the mechanical counter cover plates.    The serial

numbers were also marked in this area but were only present on turnstile C (serial

no. 14038), turnstile D (serial no. 13263) and turnstile G (serial no. 14039).


1 noted that all the doors at the front of the turnstile enclosure were approximately

0.63 m (25 inches) wide and the opening widths were between 465 itm and 555 itm

(18.3 inches and 21.8 inches).   The heights of the openings were approximately

2 m (79 inches).


                                        2
The passageways through each turnstile ware approximately 2 m (6 ft 9 inches) long

and 0.5m (20 inches) wide.     The ceiling height in each passageway was

approximately 2.25 m (7 ft 5 inches).



The height of the turnstile tables was approximately 1.04 m (3 ft 5 inches). The

heights of the turnstile arms and their lower skirt plates etc and the gaps between

the ends of the arms and adjacent walls in individual passageways are shown in
Table 1.



Vertical blocks of wood were secured to the walls at the entry side of the

turnstiles in all except passageway C where a box had been constructed on the wall

opposite the centre of the turnstile spindle.    All blocks of wood in turnstiles

except C were approximately 14 cm x 14 cm x 61 cm long (5.5 inches x 5.5 inches x

2 ft long) which were positioned with their lower ends approximately 38 cm (15 inches)

above floor level and their central axis approximately 30 cm (one foot) forward of

the turnstile axis.



The box mounted on the wall opposite the rotating arms of turnstile C was 46 cm

(18 inches) long on its front face and 61 cm (2 ft) long on its rear face.    The
box was 24 cm (9.5 inches) deep and projected from the wall by approximately 10 cm

(4 inches). The top face of this box was approximately level with the top face of
the turnstile arm.    (See Fig. 6).


Additional wooden blocks were also fitted on the walls opposite the turnstile arms

in passageways A and B only.   These blocks were mounted on the turnstile side of

the aforementioned vertical wooden blocks and had curved form varying from

7.5 cm (3 inches) thickness at the ingress end to 9.5 cm (3.75 inches) thickness at

a point opposite the turnstile axis centre.   These blocks were approximately 49 cm

(19.25 inches) long and 14 cm (5.5 inches) deep and reduced the gap at the end of



                                        3
(   the turnstile arm to approximately 2.5 cm (one inch).



    Photographs of turnstiles A to G taken from the egress side show the aforementioned

    features together with the respective footstep cams and pedal counterweights etc.

    (See Figures 4-10).


    I removed several of the foot pedals from the turnstiles and two of these from

    units B and C are shown in Figs. 11 and 12 respectively.


    Pedal return action was achieved by a counterweight mounted on the respective arm,

    these weights can be seen in"Figs. 11 and 12.



    OTHER OBSERVATIONS



    During my examination of the turnstiles I noted that an electronic counting system

    had been installed and that duplicate switching arrangements were present on the

    majority of the units.


    Small roller type limit switches were noted in positions immediately above the
    central boss carrying the turnstile arm adjacent to the main rotating shaft. These
    switches were arranged such that they would be actuated at each quarter turn of

    the turnstile.   The central switches at units C, D and E were the only ones

    connected.


    Additional rat-tail switches were seen to have been positioned on the wooden frames

    at the egress side of the turnstile block and were actuated at each indexing motion

    by the respective turnstile arm.   However, these switches were disconnected and

    had broken tails at turnstiles C, D and E, they appeared to be connected and



                                           4
• (
      functioning correctly at the other turnstiles A, B, F and G.



      load/pedal resistance testing and throughput rate testing of the turnstiles together

      with checks on the mechanical and computer counting systems are the subject of a
      separate RLSD report.



      It was also noted that photoelectric emitters and sensors had been arranged in pairs

      across each turnstile passageway at positions above the turnstile arms as well as at

      table level at the egress side.   Examination of these devices indicated that many
      had been either removed or disconnected and in some cases the wiring had been cut.

      The latter was noted on the over/turnstile sensors at units C and F.


      CONCLUSIONS



      Examinations of turnstiles A-G confirmed that although old, somewhat worn and in many

      cases in need of lubrication/routine maintenance etc.    all were working

      satisfactorily and would each allow at least 20 persons per minute throughput.



      Data and load/pedal release pressure tests, throughput      and computer count tests
      are the subject of a separate RLSD report.



      KBCXEMENDATIONS




      It is recommended that the gaps between turnstile arms and adjacent walls should be

      reduced to the minimum practicable safe dimension in order to prevent persons
      gaining access without actuating the turnstile mechanism.



      In my opinion the over/turnstile photoelectric devices should be reinstated to detect

      persons clinbing over without actuating the mechanism, alternatively, full height

I
    turnstiles (floor to ceiling) should be installed.



    Where necessary, individual turnstiles should be repaired at their broken table

    supporting pillars in order to iirprove rigidity and several of the units required

    re-levelling.


    End float in all the turnstile spindles should be checked and adjusted accordingly

    as many exhibited approximately 4 rnm lift.


    All ratchets, pedal mechanisms and cams should be suitably lubricated at appropriate

    intervals.

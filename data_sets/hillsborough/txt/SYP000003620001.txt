    pen.     The crowd was packed i n J t i k e     sardines and I kept shouting to my

    brother move to the right ter try and get out of the stream of fans

    which was swept to the fr/nt of the pen.                All the time I was in the

    crowd,    I was being pusht/d forward until I was about 12 feet away from

    the gate in the fronv f en c e .         I then came against a solid barrier of

    people and I just couldn't move any further but I could feel the

    crowd getting tighter

    I and others were shoutiruf' at a young officer by the gate to fo&kinq

    open it.      I then saw t f t e    gate open and two young lads climbed to get

    out but I can't remember if the two lads got out or were pushed back

    in but the gate was closed again.

    All this time the .fans were/shouting' and spitting at^the                lie eman

    who was very young l^ok^^g.             He was joined by two other^officers and

    the gate was opened again.

    Prior to the gate opening again, the second time, the crush became

    unbearable.      I couldn't bneath or move and I think the fans at the

    back must have seen t h & f gate open and they surge/ forward and

    pressure from the ba^k was unbearable.

    The gate opened aVj^sin and people started                climb out.   At this

    point,    1 felt and saw a man's h^ad pressed against my stomach and

    against the angle of the me^al crush barrier.                I couldn't see his

    body, just his head. k T \y£ next moment I was swept past him ai

    towards the gate and 1 climbed out.               I never saw the man/whose head

    was trapped between my stomach and barrier again.

    It could only have been about 3 mins from the time I ei^e^ed

          I got out onto the pitch, the match was still being play e^ ^'I walked

          along the track trying to get my breath until/ I goty to another gate

          through to the injured and for the fans to stay where we wei

          After I got my breath back I stood on a, metal barrier anc              coked for

          my brothers.     I saw           on the       and I saw about |5Q% of the

          Police Officers standing about doing nothing to help.              I met up with

          my brothers,              and         and we made our way out of the ground

          to try and find our other brother,                   We found our brother,

                     in a street sitting down, so all the people I travelled to

          the game with survived the disaster.

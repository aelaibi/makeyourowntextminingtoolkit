            spot     but was on his back with his arms                        straigh t out.           T here was         no one

            w ith the y outh and           I did not see a ny on e             tre-aft or assi st           him.     I cannot

            remember      seeing       the y o ut h a g ai n until           I Vo o ke d at the S u n d a y         papers,

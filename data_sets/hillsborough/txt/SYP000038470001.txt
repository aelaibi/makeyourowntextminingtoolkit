        SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE - REFRESHMENT PERIODS PER PI 011 89
       LIVERPOOLINOTTINGHAMFOREST CUP FINAL 15/4].89 (HILLSBOROUGH)
                            ANALYSIS OF SCHEDULES


SERIALS - REFRESHMENTS
A total of 64 serials engaged on the match took their refreshment break of
half an hour in either the gymnasium in the ground (23) or at Claywheels
Lane (41) traffic complex which is some distance from the ground.
Travelling time must therefore be taken into account when dealing with
serials taking refreshments at Claywheels Lane.

Serials No’s 46, 48, 49, 51, 61 and 63 were allocated a specific
refreshment period 3.15 - 3.45 pm. Serial Nos 47, 50, 62 and 64 4 -
4.30 pm, i0 Serials in total. The remaining 54 serials took their
refreshment period either prior to kick off (i) after kick off (9)before
half time (9); at half time (ii); after half time (9) when authorised by
control (4); staggered during match (5) or at no time specified (6). This
method of allocating refreshment periods is very imprecise and gives rise
to the following comments:

Serial No 1 comprising 1 Sergeant and 20 Constables were detailed to take
their refreshment break prior to kick off. Their function was to man the
perimeter track (equidistance around the ground) standing and facing the
crowd before kick off, half time and full time and also during any
stoppage of play or when there is crowd unrest. This means that during
what transpired to be a critical period officers posted to the perimeter
track were reduced. Further enquiries in this area need to be considered
to clarify when /if they took refreshment break as this could be
siKnificant.

Given that 9 serials were detailed to take refreshments after kick off, 9
before half time there is a potential 18 serials that could have been
taking their refreshment break at 3.01 pm. Add to this the 6 serials
commencing refreshments at 3.15 pm, 6 serials staggered during the match,
6 serials with no time specified and 4 serials when authorised by control
and it could increase to 40 serials (ie 400 plus officers).

The 6 serials commencing at 3.15 pm were designated to ta~e their
refreshments at Claywheels Lane as were 6 serials with no specific time, 3
serials staggered during the match and 2 serials when authorised by
control. Total 26 serials.

Serials No’s 13, 14 & 18 were detailed to take refreshments after kick
off. These serials were allocated in the West Stand/Leppings Lane area of
the ground and with key functions. Six Police Constables from Serial 13
were deputed to stand at the front of the West Stand to prevent missiles
being thrown/stand tickets being dropped to terraces or persons climbing
up from terraces and to maintain order before the match. Durin~ the match
Serial No 14 were posted to the central tunnel to the Leppings Lane
Terraces to maintain order as required. Serial No 18 were posted to
turnstiles 9 - 16 on concourse inside the ground before kick off.
Refreshments were to be taken in the gymnasium. Further enquiries are
necessary particularly in relation to Serial Nos 13 (6 officers only) and
14 to clarify when/if they took refreshment break as this may be material.
t
                                           .




    Serials No’s 15, 16, 17 and 19 were also posted to Leppings Lane Terraces
    or turnstiles area but as their allocated refreshment period was after
    half time this should not have had any bearing on events.

    INSPECTOR - REFRESHMENTS

    A total of 28 Inspectors were supervising the 64 Serials, i0 were detailed
    to take refreshments in the gymnasium and 17 at Claywheels Lane.    This
    is based on the fact that Inspectors are posted with Serials and Serial
    feeding locations are common to each groups under the command of that
    Inspector. In the case of one Inspector however, he could have taken his
    refreshments at either location the order is unspecific.

    No actual feeding time is shown in the order for any of the Inspectors.

    OTHERS - REFRESHMENTS

     No feeding times or locations are shown in the order for any of the other
     units engaged in this operation ie CID, Mounted Officers, Traffic, Dog
     Handlers, Control Room Staff, Special Constables, British Transport
     Police, Complaints Officers, Admin/Property Staff or in fict any of the
     other officers mentioned. The only reference to feeding for some of these
     groups appears in Appendix I dealing with Admin Control and Custody Staff
    which says all staff subject to it will take their hot meal at the
    direction of Inspector Bennett and Appendix R dealing with Special
     Constables which says refreshments will be available in gymnasium.

    GENERAL

    Paragraph 46 of the Police Order deals with refreshments and says - two
    meals (one hot) will be provided and these will be distributed at mealing
    locations prior to the allocated meal times. Refreshments will be taken
    as indicated in the individual Serial Order. Information in this report
    is based on details taken from the individual serial orders and appendix.

    In reading this report there is an apparent lack of information/precision
    in the allocation of refreshment breaks. This comment must however be
    balanced with the fact that at this stage no analysis of the
    statements/recollections of Serial Supervisory Officers has been carried
    out. That could reveal that at sub briefings supervisors allocated set
    breaks either for Serials or individual officers. Further work in this
    area would be necessary to confirm or refute this suggestion and i~ may be
    that the means do not ~ustify the ends. A more viable alternative would
    be to concentrate investiKations on the key areas identified with Serial
    Nos i, 13, 14 and possibly 18.
    A question that has not been addressed at this stage is how many officers
    were actually in the gymnasium or at Claywheels Lane during the period
     leading up to and at the time of the disaster. Unless meal tickets or
     some other means of recording were in place at that time at these
     locations the only way to arrive at any reliable figure would be to
     research each officers statement. Preliminary enquiries are currently in
     hand to ascertain whether meal tickets or any other recordin~ system was
     in use.
                                     3.



OBSERVATIONS
Because of the way in which refreshment breaks were allocated in the order
it is difficult to come to any concrete conclusions concerning the manning
level at any particular time either before or during the match or when the
disaster started to unfold. This must have made it more difficult for the
Senior Officers to deploy manpower and may even have been a consideration
in their activation of South Yorkshire Police Operations ’Support.’
(According to the order they already had 729 officers on duty for the
match).

Enquiries within West Midlands Police area show that the practice of
feeding officers is generally dealt with by bringing them on early and
supplying a meal before they are deployed. Any officers taking a
refreshment break during the operation are designated specific
times/locations. This practice is to be commended given the experience
at Hillsborough although it does have financial implications.

                              SEMI FINAL HILLSBOROUGH
                                   15 APRIL 1989
                               REFRESHMENT ANALYSIS
                                     SERIAL 1

Serial No I, as outlined in Appendix ’B’ South Yorkshire Police F Division
Operational Order, is by far the largest serial consisting of one Sergeant and
20 Constables under the Control of Inspector Darling.

It may also be thought that the duties and responsibilities of that Serial are
the most important of all of the Serials, that is the patrolling of the
perimeter track.

The Serial consisted of the following officers:-

 Insp    Darling            Statement   No   S1615
 PS 454 Chapman             Statement   No   $877
 PC 1669 Walpole            Statement   No   S1075
WPC 3151 Marsden            Statement   No   S1606
 PC 2988 Burkinshaw         Statement   No   $880
 PC 417 Illingworth         Statement   No   $873
 PC 1285 Smith              Statement   No   $2202
 PC 446 Groome              Statement   No   $2259
 PC 2348 Hanson             Statement   No   $655
 PC 700 Helliwell           Statement   No   S589
 PC 442 Cuckson             Statement   No   $927
 PC 2046 Holmes             Statement   No   $874
 PC 1247 Street             Statement   No   $2580
 PC 1842 Brookes            Statement   No   $705
 PC 1402 Lamb               Statement   No   $822
 PC 2387 Collins            Statement   No   $876
 PC 814 Finnegan            Statement   No   S922
WPC 3034 Richardson         Statement   No   S1076
 PC 1977 Farthing           Statement   No   $879
 PC 1079 Croot              Statement   No   $878

 PC              did not work the match and was not replaced.

In their respective statements and recollections most of the officers indicate
the times between which they received a hot meal in the gymnasium at the
ground. The Operational Order indicates that their respective meal times were
to be staggered between themselves before the match, ie before 3 pm.

The attached ’flow chart’ diagramme indicates the times that officers fed and
when compared to the attached map of the ground with each officers postings
indicated several interesting facts emerge.

In respect of the Leppings Lane end of the ground, the perimeter track was
patrolled by 4 officers:-

WPC Richardson, PC’s Smith, lllingworth and Cuckson.

PC Cuckson fed between 1300 and 1330 and returned to his post at the junction
of the West Stand and the North Stand. He says nothing in his statement that
indicates he moved from the position prior to the disaster occurring, so one
has to presume he remained in post.
                                        2.




In the opposite corner of the pitch ie West Stand at South Stand WPC Richardson
was posted. She went for her meal at 2.10 pm and returned to a point between
gates I and 2 Leppings Lane end at 2.35 pm. She remained in her position and
indeed opened gate i to allow three youths into terrace No i.

PC’s lllingworth and Smith however are a slightly different case. In
recollection/statement they went for a meal at 1400. Difficulty was
experienced at the gymnasium with meals and there was a delay of some 20
minutes. They waited there, took the meal and returned to their position, a
key position, in front of pens 3,4 and 5 at 14.50.

In evidence to the Inquiry PC Smith said that PC Helliwell relieved them while
they went for a meal (Day 17 Page 107 Para E). This is not strictly true. It
has to be accepted that when Smith and Illingworth returned from their meal, PC
Helliwell was on duty at the Leppings Lane end, but looking at the flow chart
one can see the history.

Helliwell was posted in front of the South Stand. On his completing his
refreshments at 1345 he was deployed escorting a prisoner to a local station
returning at 1420. On his return Sgt Chapman asked him to relieve Smith and
lllingworth at Leppings Lane and which Helliwell did. As stated WPC Richardson
was at refreshments from 1410 to 1435. This resulted in no Serial i officer
being on the touch line between gates i and 5 from 14.10 to 14.20, then only
Helliwell from 14.20 to 14.35, when WPC Richardson returns to gate 1 and 2
leaving Helliwell to cover gates 3,4 and 5 from 14.35 to 14.50, when Smith and
lllingworth return.

Notwithstanding that PC Helliwell told the Inquiry that he saw nothing wrong
with the crowd while he was there, when he left there and it was only on his
return to his original post in front of the South Stand, (allowing 2 minutes to
walk there approx 1452) did he look back to the Leppings Lane end and see
people climbing over the fence.

From Sgt Chapman part, it must be said that during the time that Leppings Lane
was depleted of manpower because of refreshments, he had the choice of numerous
other officers to relieve Smith and lllingworth at 1400, ie Collins, Finnegan
and Croot.

Looking further at the refreshment times and taking into account the meal times
of PC’s Marsden, Hanson and Brookes it can be seen that at 1400 for the whole
of Leppings Lane end and onwards in front of the North Stand until PC Street is
reached, only WPC Richardson is present and she only until 1410. No one is
present then until the return from meal break of PC Brookes at 14.20 and at the
same time the deployment of PC Helliwell.

Insp Darling who was in charge of the Serial states that he walked the
perimeter track before 2 pm talking to officers on duty. At 2 pm when Leppings
Lane end was devoid of officers he with Sgt Chapman was at the Players Tunnel
conversing about poor radio reception. He says at 2.40 he again patrolled the
pitch and saw a number of officers on the perimeter track. By the time he
reached Leppings Lane end that would be true. However, it is clear that
neither Insp Darling or PS Chapman noticed the absence of officers during the
times stated.

In evidence PS Chapman was asked by Lord Justice Taylor about his specific role
in remaining at the players tunnel. (Day 17 Page 97 Para D and Page 99 Para
D).
                                       3.




It may be thought that the reason given is far less important than ensuring his
officers were in post, aware of their responsibilities and considering that he
had posted 3 officers Richardson, Collins and Croot (17, 97 Para F) or so he
says, to Leppings Lane who were totally inexperienced at football matches and
without radios, it may be thought he ought to have paid especial attention to
these.

Page 98 of Sgt Chapman’s evidence is particularly relevant here.

It is quite clear, indeed admitted by Chapman, that he failed to brief his
officers in respect of safety and overcrowding perhaps even relying on them to
read, understand and digest the copy of the Operational Order he sent to them.
It is also quite clear that those officers were not supervised correctly either
by Chapman or Darling and the fact that lllingworth and Smith were missing for
50 minutes went totally unnoticed.

As can be seen from the flow chart some officers have not recorded in their
recollections/statements the times of their meal breaks. It is thought unwise
in view of the findings to approach them and ask for their times at this stage.

                                       SEEIAL 13

Serial 13 of the South Yorkshire Police were, on 15 April 1989, posted to the
seated area of the West Stand. Their duties were fourfold:

   2 PC’s at North Entrance Gate to assist Stewards
   2 PC’s at South Entrance Gates, to assist Stewards

   2 PC’s to Patrol the Concourse and Bar areas.

   6 PC’s Located in front of the seats to prevent missiles
          being thrown and fans climbing from the terraces below.

It is the fourth aspect that provides officers immediately above the pens
i - 7 at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

Serial 13 was under the command of Inspector BULLAS and Sergeant 2001 BURMAN.
(Statement numbers: S.1265, S.860).
From the Officers recollections it appears that only 5 officers were posted to
the area in front of the seats in the West Stand:

   PC   2498   SCHOLEY   (Statement No.   S.862)
   PC   1494   NAYLOR    ( ....           S.913)
   PC   2717   SAVOURY   ( ....           S.i088)
   PC   i0     MERCER    ( ....           S.I092)
   PC   2167   FROST     ( ....           S.I091)

PC SCHOLEY     was posted to the area above, Pens 2 & 3. He describes how the
West Stand     began, gradually, to fill with fans from mid-day onwards but
noticed at     2pm that Pen 3 was completely full with Pen 4 having spaces.
Pens i, 2,     6 & 7 were ’thinly covered with people’

An hour later at 3pm, PC SCHOLEY mentions that Pens 3 & 4 were totally full,
but i, 2, 6 & 7 still had ample room.

Shortly after kick off he became aware of fans climbing onto the seats and
also onto the pitch over the perimeter fence. It was some minutes later that
he noticed fans injured.

PC NAYLOR was posted to the area above Pen i. He recalls at 2.50pm noticing
an unusual amount of spaces in Pens I & 2, and at 3pm when the match kicked
off, he saw between 150 and 200 supporters surge onto the terracing behind
Gate No. i. At the same moment he recalls a surge of fans in the middle two
pens, i.e. 3 & 4. It was then he noticed fans being crushed in Pens 3 & 4.
                                       - 2 -


PC SAVOURY was positioned behind and above Gate 5. He gives the meal postings
for the Serial, i.e. 3 pm, but on Page 2 of his statement mentions meeting
PS BURMAN at 2.40 pm, the first time he had seen the Sergeant since 11.15 am.
PC SAVOURY noticed the central terracing behind the goal substantially full at
this time, while the North and South ends of the terrace were relatively
empty.

PC SAVOURY, on Page 3 of his recollections, says "it was obvious that the
centre sections were overcrowded". At 1503 he recalls seeing fans surging
forward in the two pens behind the goal and two minutes later he was aware of
injuries.

PC MERCER was posted with PC SAVOURY above Gate 5. His evidence is word for
word the same as that of PC SAVOURY.

PC FROST was posted to a point slightly to the left and above the entrance
tunnel at the Leppings Lane end. He noticed that the middle sections of the
Leppings Lane terracing were considerably full at about 2pm and he describes
the same terraces as being ’quite compact’ at 2.45pm but with large unused
areas on each flank of the terracing, i.e. Pen i, 2, 6 & 7. PC FROST says at
this time he had been standing with Insp. BULLAS for quite some time. At
2.55pm PC FROST sensed increasing agitation in the crowd on the terraces and
Insp. BULLAS went to see what the problem was.

Fans began to climb up from the terraces, into the seated area and PC FROST
radioed saying that a large number of people were down and injured. What
action was taken as a result of that radio call is not known, but clearly, if
the message was received, very little action was taken at that stage.

Sergeant BURMAN states on Page 3 of his recollection that he spent most of his
time in front of the central area of the West Stand overlooking the terraces
of the Leppings Lane end - clearly a different account to PC’s SAVOURY and
MERCER. At 2pm he noticed that fans were ’cramped’ in Pen 3. He shouted to a
fan to get from a wall and the fan returned abuse at the Sergeant, who left
the seated area and went to the tunnel to find him, presumably to arrest or
eject the youth. He found he could not get across to the Pen No. 3 because of
the crowding of fans there.

Sergeant BURMAN saw two fans jumping from a barrier into the crowd, obviously
causing some problems with other fans. He describes how he was unable to get
to these men because of the number of fans.

Insp. BULLAS says at 2.30pm he looked down into the Leppings Lane Terracing
and thought they were reasonably fully, but with space at the rear of Pens 3
and 4, again different to the account given by some of his Constables. On
Page 2 of his recollections he says that up to 3pm he did not notice anything
unusual with the crowd on the terraces whichwould cause him concern. He goes
on to say (Page 3) that when the teams came onto the pitch he saw what he
describes as a line of people suddenly enter the terraces from the tunnel and
push forward down the terracing. He saw people being crushed and attempted to
contact the Control Room by using his radio, but was unable to do so.
                                       - 3 -


Overall then it appears that the Constables, without exception, noticed a
large build up of fans in the Pens 3 and 4, some becoming concerned about the
matter, but no action was taken by any of them.

The Inspector never noticed any problem until 3pm and the Sergeant says he was
above Pens 3 and 4 for most of the time. At 2pm the fans were cramped, but
again nothing was done to inform the Control Room.

It may be thought that if these officers had been aware, indeed briefed about
safety and had paid particular attention to the crowd build up below, early
signs would have been identified. It’s quite clear that Sgt. BURMAN was in a
position to raise the alarm and even went along the tunnel at one stage and
experienced the problem for himself, yet took no action to inform his
Supervisor.

From the evidence in statements of officers in Serial 13, it appears that no
Officer from that Serial actually took a refreshment break.

The Operational Order directs that Serial 13’s refreshments were to be taken
following the kick-off. This clearly did not occur. However, further
enquiries would be necessary to confirm it.

Serial 14 of the South Yorkshire Police consisted of the following
officers:

Insp White                 Statement   No   $2223
PS 1341 Crawford           Statement   No   S1354

PC 3232 Burton             Statement   No   $839
PC 3347 Thomas             Statement   No   SI147

Their main duties were split into three phases:

Phase i - Before ’kick-off’

Ensure supporters entering turnstiles A-G were not in possession of
missiles, alcohol, etc; maintain order on the terraces.

Phase 2 - During Match.

Officers posted to the tunnel, to ensure order on the terraces when
required.

Phase 3 - After Match.

To supervise the exit of supporters.

The officers were briefed at the ground during the morning of Saturday
15 April, and shortly after that they received a packed lunch. The next
meal was to be after kick-off in the gymnasium.

Serial 14 were in position for Phase i at Ii.00 am or thereabouts, and they
remained there until after kick-off. In reality none of the officers
achieved Phase 2. Before they could actually move from Phase i to Phase 2
the call for assistance onto the pitch had been received and all Serial 14
officers made their way to the pitch via the South Stand.

A few of the officers saw the mass of fans who came through gate C surge
down the tunnel, but as one officer, PC Grant, says, ’they were powerless to
do anything about it.’
                                     - 2 -




From the Operational Order it appears that there was not a serial posted
to the tunnel area specifically at Leppings Lane BEFORE the kick-off, so
movement of fans along that tunnel was not mentioned.

None of the officers actually took a meal as indicated in the Operational
Order, ie, in the gymnasium after kick-off.

In relation to supervision of Serial 14, it is clear that Insp White was
absent from the concourse area with a prisoner from 2.40-2.45 pm.

For Sergeant Crawford’s part he was engaged in the main on the concourse
dealing with the build up of fans coming through the turnstiles.

down the tunnel, but as one officer, PC Grant, says, ’they were powerless to
do anything about it.’

    From the Operational Order it appears that there was not a 4erial posted
    to the tunnel area specifically at Leppings Lane BEFORE ~l~.e kick-off, so
    movement of fans along that tunnel was not mentioned. °~

    None of the officers actually took a meal as indicated in the Operational
    Order, ie, in the gymnasium after kick-off.
     In relation to supervision of Serial 14, it is oiear that Insp White was
    ~Bqut from the concourse area with a prisoner ~rom 2.40-2.45 pm.
                                                   /

    For Sergeant Crawford’s part he was engaged in the main on the concourse
    dealing with the build up of fans coming through the turnstiles.

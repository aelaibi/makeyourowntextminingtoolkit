HILLSBOROUGH - HOUSE OF COMMONS VIDEO PRESENTATION



On 6 November I received your minute about a forthcoming video
presentation in the House of Commons (date not known) at which
a Superintendent of the South Yorkshire Police was to present
extracts of video tape footage from the Hillsborough disaster.
I am afraid that I started off on one or two false trails
before finding the information I needed.

 2.   On 9 November our enquiries (tactful I believe) of the
 South Yorkshire Police revealed that the video presentation
 took place on the afternoon of 8 November when 12 MPs
 attended. It appears that the House of Commons presentation
(was arranged by Mr Shersby who, in his capacity as adviser to
Ithe Police Federation^, had seen some 30 minutes of the video
|tape when he was attending a meeting at South Yorkshire Police
 Headquarters to discuss possible prosecutions of Federation
 members following Hillsborough.

3.   Our source in the South Yorkshire Police, the Chief
Constable's Staff Officer, told us that Mr Shersby, who left
the presentation for a short while to attend a previously
arranged meeting with the Home Secretary, indicated on his
return that the Home Secretary had expressed some interest in
seeing the video.

4.   The Chief Constable's Staff Officer, perhaps anticipating
that we might suspect that South Yorkshire Police were anxious
to present their side of the Hillsborough disaster case to
MPs, made a point of telling us that at the presentation the
Superintendent gave a purely factual account of events shown
on the video.

HTTISBORQUGH - BOOSE OF OCMMQNS VIDEO FRESEMEftTICN



Mr Storr, an information received from Mr Martin Brandon Bravo MP,
tells me that there is an event to be organised in the House of Commons
 (date not known) at which a superintendent at the South Yorkshire
Police will present extracts of video tape footage from the
Hillsborough disaster. It came to the Private Office here on the basis
of a tentative enquiry whether the Home Secretary would like to be
present - wisely refused.

2. But I thought you and other copy recipients should know of it and
if it is possible, tactfullyfto discover how this event     to be
arranged it would be helpful to know.

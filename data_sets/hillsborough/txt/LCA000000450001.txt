          "That this Council notes that the capital expenditure

           provision of only 50% financing of new capital
           expenditure and that the Financial Control

           properties which are occupying land and which in the
           interests of the service should be replaced.   In view
           of this and bearing in mind that New Heys
           Comprehensive School is at present on a split site and
           that the Middle School was sold for £1.2 million, this
           Council authorises the City Estates Surveyor to market
           the Lower School Site and utilise the accrued monies
           to locate the whole of the school on the Upper
           School/Allerton Wing site."

    be approved, viz:-

                                 Report

          The proposal contained in the Motion is currently the
    subject of consideration and will come forward in a report
    of the Director of Education in due course.

 NOTE TO EDITORS:
 The Police Complaints Authority, set up under the Police and Criminal
 Evidence Act 1984* is an independent body whose purpose is to see that
 whenever a complaint is made about the conduct of a policy officer it is
 dealt with thoroughly and feirly. The Authority supervises investigations
 into the most serious complaints and considers the report of every invest­
 igation into a complaint against a police officer whether or not it was
 supervised.

                  I looked up and              could see          the West S tand seats above m e .                                     I saw a

                  helmeted        policeman wit h a radio and another                                  chap and myself                          waved at

                  him.    trying         to gain his attention.                         E v e n t u a l l y we         caught         the a t t e n t i o n

                  of a Liverpool              supporter         leaning           over     the    stand.              We m o t i o n e d him              to
      -s. O   ^
                  tell    the     policeman and he tugged                         the     p o liceman on the arm.                               The

                  p o l iceman     looked down            from directly above                     us and. we                   pointed at the man

                  over    the    barrier and shouted                      " H e ’s dead,"         a few times.                       The        policeman

                  had his       radio       held to his mouth.                    He      looked at us without                          any       real

                  I d is t i n c t l y    remember        beginning           to panic at              this        stage.              I thought             "My

                  God,    I ’m going          to be killed on this                      barrier        as well."                     I had my hands

in the air and using all                         the effort           I could       I mana g e d to move myself

to the         left of the             barrier       to the     point m a r k e d 2 on the grid                 plan,

I felt myself                  being    lifted up and           I was       find     it increasingly            difficult

to breath.                I was     gasping        at a faster and faster                     pace.     By this          time       I

was      facing          the    pitch and         I noticed the            game was        in progress,             I

thought          "Please God don't                 let Liverpool            score."           I was    now aware

that       there was a serious                    problem spread throughout Pen 4.                           I could

hear       people         shouting       "God help me," and                 "God     I'm going," and            "God help

me    please."

About       two      feet       in f r o n t    of me      I s aw a m a n      sink       down and      backwards             out

of    my    view.,         A man       to m y     r ight    said      "I   c a n ’t h o l d    on,    h e l p me,       I'm

go i n g . "        He    s t ar ted to        si n k d o w n a n d    I saw     pe o p 1 e t ry i n g to      1 i f t hi m

ba c k     up.

The      crowd was             now swaying          in all     d irections and             I felt myself

t ramp 1 i ng on the man who                      had j ust d i s a p p e a r e d     f r om view        :!.n f ront      of

me.        I looked sown at                the     fence and saw a few                 poiicemen         gesturing            to

people         to    push back.            I remember         thinking          "Why don^t           they get a

megaphone?"
                                        A=r
I then saw that a small                         gate    had beet/ op^rtet^ in >fie fence and                        thai

police were               pulling       people       out.      I a^rw other          policemen trying               to    pull

the      fence away wit h their                    hands.       I d o n ’t remember             the    crush easing

off at, all              during     this       period.       We were        still     trampling          on the man on

the      gound and             I knew there was             no way he         could still            be alive.

I saw s o m ebody with bolt                       cutters     cutting         the    fence away and           people

began       to spill            onto    the     pitch.       The      crush began to ease and as more

people         left       the    pen    I could see          bodies        lying     on the      pitch and          on the

t e r ra c e .

Af ter about              10 mi nutes          I could see         the     body of tne man who we                   had

t r a m p l e d on.            He was    lying       on his     back at         right angles           across       the

terrace          with his          head to my          left hand side.               He    had a dark        bi. ue

c o m p l e x i o n and there was           no sign of any                life whatsoever.           His   eyes

were    open and he was              looking        upwards,.         His m o u t h was       half   open avid his

I never         caught       sight a gain of the rnan who                    had been doubled over             the

Although         I w a s n ’t injured myself                 I was    totally numbed by what               had

We all      left       the    ground at ar o u n d 4.15              pm     (1615)   after a policeman             told

us    it was alright            to do so.           At no stage             during   the whole       incident          did

I have     the following             obs e r v a t i o n s    to make        regarding     the way the

i n c i d e n t wa s h a n d 1 e d „

A    loudspeaker         announcement            instructed          people     to    leave    the   pitch,        I

thought      this was          stupid.         An a n n o u n c e m e n t    should have       been made

stating         that    people     had been hurt.                  This w o u l d have stopped the Forest

fans    jeering and            inciting        the Liverpool              fans who were        so upset.         It

s hould have           been made       clear      that       it was       not a problem with hooliganism,

                                                                                                                            S 1733

                  I thought          the    police    cordon across           'the pitch was       u n n e c c e s s a r y and

                  i nf 1arnma t o ry .       It a n n o y e d me «

                  I saw     cash,        jew e l l e r y and various articles           of   clothing        lying         on the

                 terrace and             I never     saw any       person     pick them up.

                  I arn not against            the    police       but on this      o c c asion    I felt      extreme anger

                 towards       them.         I saw Liverpool           s u pporters    openly abusing               them and they

                 did not       reply or         respond        in any way.       This made        it worse          in a way.

                  I thought          some members         of the      press    c o nducted   themselves             in a

                 d i s g r aceful        manner.      I saw one        in Pen 3 taking          photographs           of the

                  broken barrier.              This       looWu      really ghoul isn and he was a t t a c k e d                  by

                  furious Liverpool                supporters.

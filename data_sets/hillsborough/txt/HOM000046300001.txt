   Dear Mr & Mrs Church

  Thank you for your letter of 20 September to Ms Dunne.  Let me say first that
    am sorry o earn that, in addition to your distress about the sad death of
  your son, you feel that the justice system has let you down.

  I understand that your specific complaints about your solicitors have been
  disposed of by the Solicitors Complaints Bureau and the Legal Services
  Ombudsman, and that the Bureau wrote to you on 24 June to inform you that they
           enter into any further correspondence about these matters.

 However, I note that you have been dissatisfied about the role of the
 Hillsborough Steering Committee. Ms Dunne has already explained to you the
 function of Steering Committees. May I suggest that if you remain J c l e a r or
 unhappy about the result of the claim you have made (or the Steering
 outsidf^thp T         ^ ?6aling r th that claim>’      should consult a solicitor
           Th * L - r ° ° l ar6a     haS had n° connection with the Hillsborough
  J ® * ’, T£ at       avoid any suggestion of conflict of interest which has
    early been of concern to you in the past.      I enclose a list of solicitors in
 neighbouring areas so that you may choose one who is convenient for yo^

 I must apologize that in Ms Dunne's letter of 7 September, you were given the
 name of Elizabeth_Steel. Ms Steel is now a Circuit Judge and no longer has
w o u l ^ t h e 118^ 111^ 168 a® chair of the HiHsborough Steering Committee. She
           therefore be unable to deal with any correspondence on this matter.

 I regret that we will be unable to help you further.

Yours sincerely

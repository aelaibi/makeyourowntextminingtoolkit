     1.   I JOHN FLACK will say:         I was born on 6.8.48.



     2.   I am a leading ambulanceman and have been with SYMAS for 21

          years.     I have been a leading ambulance man for 11 years.

          Before that I was a qualified ambulance man.                      I have worked

          at Corporation Street, Batemoor and Parkway.



     3.   Thursday was my day off        and on Friday I worked from 1400

          hours to 2200 hours.      On    Saturday I was to work 1400 hours

          to    2200 hours as well.       I have worked on semi-final day

          before but have never had to visit the ground except as a

          spectator quite a few years ago.



          My driver was                         We were called at 1410 hours to

          the                Pub where     an old man was                 having   problems

          breathing.  We took him to Northern General casualty, unit. „                           ,

          through the gate and saw Station Officer Eason frantically

          waving to us.        I got out of the vehicle and told,.the driver

          to stay with the vehicle.                          Another ambulance/was already

          there.       think               thj^y?w               a          amfcurinanc^wnjrcn lmu been

          I went up to Eason and he asked for a cot to be taken out of

          his ambulance.       He said that there had been a bit of a crush

          and that a young boy had been crushed and stopped breathing.

          At   this   time    we   were         all        unaware              of       the       extent           of      the

          situation.       We removed the cot and made our way by foot onto

          the pitch.         3itr-wae— now— aboinfc— 1515— 1lours.                                   The game had

          stopped and there were no players in sight.                                                There were a

          few people on the pitch.                        We went              diagonally                 across            the

          pitch towards       the west stand.                         We did not come across any

          other ambulance men.               We reached the boy who was lying in

          the goal area       with a few people around him.                                           A police              man

          was giving mouth to mouth resuscitation and a man was giving

          cardiac compression.             I assume that he was a doctor from the

          way that he was talking.                  The doctor said that the boy had a

          good chance of surviving.                   We then put the boy on to the cot
and ran back across the pitch to the ambulance.                          While we

were tending to the child we could see people behind the

fence climbing on top of each other but at that point the

boy appeared to be the worse casualty and we did not see

anyone    else   laid   out   on       the    pitch.        I was    really     just

concentrating on the boy rather than the crowd.



We got to our ambulance which by this time was coming down

onto the pitch.         We opened the doors and took one of our

cots out so that we could get the cot with the boy onto the

ambulance.       I jumped     into the back            of   the    ambulance     and

started    resuscitation         and    put    an   airway       into   the    boy's

mouth.    The police officer was doing cardiac massage.                        Eason

was in our vehicle and he got onto the radio and informed

casualty at Northern General of the condition of the child.

We then turned the vehicle round and went back out.                           It was

a tight fit to get off the pitch but there were no other

ambulances trying to get in while we were trying to get out.

I was working on the child and so I could not see what the

situation was in the yard.              T fln-nnt Irnnw what -Hmn it irn~

At Northern General I spoke to a doctor and he asked whether

there was likely to be more casualties.                     I said that it was

serious but I could not say how many more would be coming
 I told the illI'vtTi to clean the suction equipment as soon as

 possible so that we would be ready for off.                                                   We were about

 three or four minutes In the hospital and then we loaded the

 return to the ground at the Penistone Road entrance.                                                        We had

 a     quick          trip     back          down    Herries           Road          south     and       a   police

 officer directed us across the junction.                                                  We went through

 the first entrance and back into the yard.                                                There were a few

 ambulances going up Herries Road as we were coming down.

 There          was       still       a      lot of      confusion              at     the     around           as we

 pulled into the yard.                          I got out and told the driver to stay

 with the vehicle.                           There were bodies around that area and

 police officers walking about.                                      I spoke to a*/'inspector and

 asked                     ?vr rFtenra1'*'y           t1         "g                  -trn-r nnrt where our

I then saw Leading Ambulanceman                                                              from Rotherham

vehicle.           At    this point there were                     fans grabbing me               and

asking me to help.                 Then a fire man came up to me and said

that they were resuscitating an 18 year old boy and were

getting        some     response.           I went        over      to    the boy who was

nearby in the gym yard area.                       There were people lying nearby

on boards who appeared to be dead.                             I went over and looked

at    the     boy.            He    was     still      warm.       I     went    back ± o         the

ambulance and got out a cot.                            I called Li'ie dr-Li/m. and we

loaded the boy onto the ambulance.                           I shouted to the fireman

to see if there were any others that we could load quickly

as we needed to move the boy as soon as possible.                                      There did

not appear to be any walking wounded about who wanted to

come with us.             As we had one stretcher case already on the

ambulance we could only take slightly injured people because

of    the     room.          It    took      us    about       2    minutes       to       get    the

stretcher on to the vehicle and I then gave the order to the

did not seem to take long.



We got to the Northern General and were met by a doctor.                                           He

said that there was no hope for the boy and he told us to

take him to the plaster room which was a temporary mortuary.
                The doctor asked me to tell control that it was getting too

           y   then round onto Leppings Lane.                                The police were on every

                have no idea what time it was when we got to Leppings Lane.

                There was some delay around the gates because of the amount

                of people around.                It was bedlam when we parked with fans

               ,and police everywhere.   There were about three ambulances in

                tried to find an officer in charge but could not see one.

                Then a police inspector came up to me and asked me to take a

                young boy and his dead                      father because                    the boy would not

                leave his father.               The boy was not injured.                             I said that I

                could not move dead bodies and as the boy was not injured he




                                                                  i%

The     vehicles    started   to    move    up.     This    was    about      five

minutes after we had arrived at Leppings Lane.                    Then another

police officer came and said there was a doctor and patient

ready for moving.        I went up to the doctor who had a drip in

the     patient's    arm.      A    Derbyshire     ambulanceman         who   was

separated from his colleague and had been advanced trained

helped with the loading of the cot                  on   to our     ambulance.

There was a lot of equipment with the patient and so we did

not look for any more patients to take with us.                    We managed

to get out onto Peni stone Road which took about three or

four minutes.          I was in the back assisting the doctor who

told us to go to Hallamshire because he had worked there

before and understood that Northern General was quite full.



I was not aware of the journey because I was helping in the

back.      I   think    it   took   about    7    minutes   to    get    to   the

Hallamshire.



We unloaded the patient and handed him over to casualty.                        I '

then radioed clear and was told by control to go back to

Leppings Lane. _X--et43r3r'asstHBe^                 Lepptnys- Eane~~w3s "t

                  control again to ask where the casualty clearing point was.

                  I was then directed to the Herries Road bus depot to stand

                  by.     We were able to turn round and go back up Leppings Lane

                  and along Herries Road where we met Station Officer Eason.

                  He    told    us    to park       in    the      driveway   to   the   depot.       All

                  drivers remained in their vehicles and I liaised with Eason.

                  We were there about 30 to 45 minutes and then heard control

                  sending all West Yorkshire vehicles back to base.                             We left
I                 the Derbyshire man and his colleague with his equipment at

       ♦          the    bus    depot.        All    South        Yorkshire   vehicles     were    then

                  instructed to go to the Penistone Road entrance.                              We went

                  right    up    to    the    side       of   the    gym   where   we    were   met    by

                  Mr.David Jones.            We parked the vehicles and he then called

                  us together for a briefing.                     There were probably about 20 of

                  us.     He split us into groups of those on the various duties

                  and those who were off duty but had been called in.                           He then

                  directed us back to the station.                    We got back to the station

                  at about 1800 hours, cleaned our vehicle and completed our

                  shift.

                This         side       of    the    g r o u n d was        designated             for    the L i v e r p o o l      supporters

but    there        was       no       evidence          of    this       on    our       arrival        at    th e      turnstile.

At    1.50prn       <1350)             t ha t     date,       I assisted             another        officer             in e j e c t i n g        a

ma n who       was       believed                to    have    entered          the       ground        without          a    tic k e t .

Apart      from         the    enquiries                from       fans    asking          where        particular             terraces

or    stands        were?          they          were    not       directed          to a n y     one        terrace.

Wear     to    these          turnstiles,                were       two    sets       of    toilets           and       on    numerous

occasions           my       officers             and    1 h ad      to m o v e       countless              fans       on,    who        were

stood      outside            the       toilets,             urinating          against          th e    w a ll .        Th is

continued           up u n t i l            kick-off          time,       when       the    rear        of    the       terraces           and

stands        cleared.

This     particular                problem             again       reared        it's      ugly     head       at       half       time,

when     not       only       were          the       fans    urinating           outside         the        toilet          walls,        but

were     stood          on    the       upper          terraces,          urinating          into        the a r e a          directly

behind        the       stands.

At    3 . 3 5 pm    < 1335')           t ha t     date,       officers           of m y     serial           and myself             went        up

into     the       seated          area          above       the    terraces,             where     fans       from          the    lower

terracing           were       being             helped       up    into       the    West       Stand        seating          ar ea.

There      w as     a    number             of    fans       that    had       already       dispersed              amongst           the

cr owd ,      but       15 to 2 0            persons          were       ejected          from    the        ground          for    the ir

actions .

At    4.05pm        (1603)             that       date,       my    serial        was      directed           to    the       S p i o n Hop,

where      there         was       a    report          of    fighting          between          rival        fans.           By    the     time

•we a r r i v e d       at    this          location,          there       was       no    fighting           taking          place.

It wa s       shortly          after             this    that       1 took        refreshments.                    My    serial           and     I

then     resumed             and       at    full       time,       cleared          the L i v e r p o o l         supporter:;             from

the    ground-               During          their       egress          from     the      ground,           the    supporters

knocked        o ver         and       literally             trampled          over       a newspaper              seller          and.

another        officer             and myself                had    to    force       our    way        into       the       crowd and

a s s i st h i m        f i r s 1 1y to           hi s feet         and    then       out    of    the        c ro w d .

We    t h e n a c c o m p a n ied            t he     f ans    as    far       as H a 1 i f ax     R o a d , w h e r e ot he r

At   6.45pm   (1843)     that   date,   my   serial   and   I were   stood   down   from

operation.

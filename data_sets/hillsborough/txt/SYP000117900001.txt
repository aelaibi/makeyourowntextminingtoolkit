              At   a. 30    am on Saturday,                 15th April       1989,     I started a tour                of duty at

             a parade at D o nc as te r               Police Station,             regarding        the F.A.        Cup Semi

             Final       at H il ls bo r o u g h ,      between Liv e r p o o l        F . C . and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.

              I was to work              in company w ith PC 256 4 Musk,                    a t t a c h e d to Serial            27,

              under Sgt.           Mozley.          PC Musk and m y s e l f were            to man a barrier at the

              j u n c t i o n of F i e ld in g R o a d and P e n i s t o n e Road.                We a t t e n d e d    in t h e ’

             N o r t h S t a n d of the football                 ground at 9 .45 am for the m a t c h briefing.

             After       the b r i efing PC Musk and my s e l f                   a t t e n d e d at our      point        at    10,45 am

             where we e re c t e d            the    barrier.        Neit h e r    PC Musk        or myself        were         issued

             w i t h a radio,            only Sgt.          Mosley was       given one.

             While       on our        point we were           visi t e d several          times     by Sgt,       M o z l e y and an

              Inspector,           w ho « e   name    I do not know.              F rom about        11,30 am the volume

              of fans       began to          increase        near our       point,      there was a mi xture                   of

             L iv e r p o o l     and N o t t i n g h a m    fans all m i n g l e d together and w a l k i n g                   in

              opposite           directions,         there were        no    public      order     incidents           due      to the

             moving        of fans w i t h i n my sight.                It was       however a p p arent           from the

              outset       that m a ny of the Liverpool                     fans who       passed us from our                   right

              to   left,         who were age d         in their       late teens         and twenties were                  drinking

              al c o h o l i c    b e verages       that     they had o b v i o u s l y     purchased from an off-

              licence at the              j u n c ti on of P en i s t o n e Road and Vere Road.
M an y of the L iv er p o o l                fans were     carrying           between 4       and 8      cans of beer

or    lager,        or    large       plastic bottles             of drink.           They were         not however

causing        problems.             Many       people did however               become very a n n o y e d

e sp ec i a l l y    the      nearer         to 3.0 0     pm    it got,       w h e n we w ould not a llow them

access      a long F ie l d i n g R o ad to take a short                         cut to the L e p p i n g s Lane

end of the ground.

F rom    the outset             of     our     "point" m any Li v e r p o o l           fans a p p r o a c h e d us    and

a sked us w he r e            the     "ticket t o u t s ” were.               They    were informed that              we

had     not seen a n y and we                     b e l ieved there were             very few about.           Many of

the     fans wer e          s u rp ri se d        by this, and               informed usthat         there were

many     "touts"           last year and they had had no trouble obt a i n i n g                               tickets.

It was a p p a re nt            that all         these     fans       had    no tickets.          All    day   I heard

the     call    for        "spares",          "spares"         from L i verpool         accents as        they

s e a rched     for       tickets.            T hey were        even a s k i n g N o t t i n g h a m fans.

Several        cars stop p e d              on P en is t o n e R o a d near       to us      including a black

taxi and the occupants,                         all Liv e r p o o l     fans a s k e d for dire c t i o n s           to a

P u b l i c H ouse         called       ’The Beehive*            as    they     said a 'lot of Liverpool

people were m e et in g                there as they knew the                    landlord.

F r om 2.40 pm man y                 fans were        running along P e n i s t o n e Road,               in both

directions,              o b v i o u sl y    rushing      to     the         turnstiles. A lot of Liverpool

fans were           irate       because           we w o u l d not           a l l o w them access       to Fielding

Road.     0 . A.P.'s          and mi d d l e aged          people w ith          toddlers were allo w e d

road and kept away                   from the         parked       cars.       O nly about        15 to 20 were

a l lo we d through.

At 3.00        pm we were jo i n e d by PC 59 6 S t u b b i n g s who                        had been manning              the

other     end of F i e l d i n g R o a d .              He was        enroute     for     his meal       to C laywheels

Lane.       M y se lf       or PC Musk was              going     to a c c o m p a n y PC Stubbi n s , but due

to the      number          of fans          still    running along Pen i s t o n e             Road,     we delayed

going     for our meal,                until       it became          less    busy.       Still    many of the
                                                                                                                R 151

L iverpool       fans w a n t e d access along F i e l d i n g Road,                      but PC Stubbins

informed t hem they                 had time     to walk          round as        there were about 2,000

fans    still      queu i n g       to get    in.

At about        3 .20    pm we were          informed by a lady who                     lives    in F i e lding Road

that she had h e a r d              on the    radio or TV           that        something       had   c o l lapsed      in

the    ground a n d        some fans had been crushed to d e a t h .

S hor t l y a f t e r w a r d s ,    fans,    some       still     drunk and m a n y of them visibly

shocked and          crying,         w a l k ed along P e n i s t o n e Road and told us that

people were          dying      inside and there had been a pitch                            invasion,         some of

the    fans were als o              s w e aring and a c c u s i n g        the    police    of k i l l i n g    people.

PC Musk and m y se lf               d ec i d e d not to t o t a l l y aban d o n the             barrier,       but

•for just PC Musk              to go to the ground and                     leave me       insitu,       as we had

not    rec eived a n y d i r e c t io n from anyone.                       Not    having     radios,      we did

not    fully a p p r e c i a t e       the scale         of the      s i t uation       inside    the ground,

I a sk e d several            S e n i or Officers,          who    passed along P e n i s t o n e Road,

heading        towards        the    ground w ith         ’Serials*           if we were        required       inside *

but    I didn't         get    any     response      or direction.                Some of the Liverpool

fans who        passed m y          point after          the m a t c h had been abandoned.,                   were

very a g g r e s s i v e      towards Po l i c e         officers         and due to numbers             of    these

fans     it was      impos s i b l e      to do a n y t h i n g about            it.     I had o c c asion to

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION
1     Purpose of the Report
To inform members of the potential liability which may fall to be met by the
Authority as a result of the Hillsborough stadium disaster.


      2    Recommendation
           Members are asked to note the contents of this report.



3     Background Information
3.1   Members have asked to be kept informed of the latest position in respect
      of the claims submitted as a result of the Hillsborough Stadium
      Disaster. At the F and G P meeting on 29 October 1993 it was reported
      that the estimate of claims over and above the Authority's insurance
      cover had fallen from £1.8m to £1.3m. Provision for £1.3m had been made
      in the 1992/93 accounts.
3.2 Zurich Insurance, who aredealing with theclaims on behalf of MMI, have
     now updated the position and have indicatedthat the estimate of the
     Authority's uninsured element has risen from £1.3m to £1.35m. It is not
     expected to vary significantly from this sum. The number of outstanding
     claims stands at 80 as against 1566 which have been settled.
4     Financial Implications
It would be prudent to make provision for a further £50,000 liability in the
1994/95 accounts and this will be taken into account in the revised estimates
for that year.

            on the Penistone Rd. end.

            I e n tered the ground wit h other Officers                           and was           told by a Police

            Inspector       to form a line on the                touchline          facing          the N S t a n d , ><fn the

            N o t t i n g h a m half of the       pitch.       I could see a large                   number        people     on

            the    pitch at the Leppi n g s Ln end.

            with i n a few minutes              of this,       I was     told t o g e t h s n y ^ i t h other Officers

            to form a line across                the    halfway        line   by a no tene r Police            Inspector.        At,

            this    point     I had no        idea of the        nature       of t*ne incident and believed                      it

           was a pitch             invasion by         Liverpool       fans, yand the               line was formed to

            stop the Liverpool              fans app r o a c h i n g    tja'e N o t t i n g h a m    fans at    the

           P e n istone Rd and.           By this       time   I had been split                  up from the       o^fher

           O ffic e r s    I had a r r i v e d with,        with the e x c eption of PC E M E R S O N .                  We had

           no Sergeant          or    Inspector wit h the traffic                   contingent

           Whilst     on the half way             line    I saw Police Offi c e r s ai/d civilians

           St Johns Ambulance,                carrying      people       from the          pitch to the         gym area,        I

           b eli e v e d   these      people     had been       injured        in some       sort       of fight.

           L i v erpool     fans      started a p p r o a c h i n g    us on their way back to the

           L epp i n g s Ln        end and were asking            why we were              not   helping.      I then heard

           that     people         had died at         the Leppings Ln end                 in a crush.

            I then     left        the   halfway       line and went          to the Leppings              Ln end of the

            pitch and saw that              there was       large      numbers        of    people       laid on the        pitch

           from one side             to the     other.    It was obvious              that       some of these        people

           were     dead,     others      had    injuries.

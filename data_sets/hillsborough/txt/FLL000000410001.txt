matches          in    reasonable          safety       in     spite       of      the      horrific         breakdown
in     crowd       safety which             occurred         at      Hillsborough            both       inside,          and

 The    next         football            season


 4.     As the        disaster            occurred               at      one      of the       big       football            events
 of     theyear           and       involved            a        failure         to control                 a     large and         eager
 crowd,      it may            be       of     assistance               to     the Inquiry                  to     know the         big
 matches        which         are        likely to               occur prior              to      January         1     1990.       A
 list     of     auch matches,                     based         on     expectation            of      an       attendance          of
 75% capacity at                    a    ground          of       raore        than 30,000             spectators,            appears

 Causes      of / the          Disaster            at       Hillsborough




 [ Appendix           2       sets       out       relevant             references           to     the      evidence
 supporting          the      propositions                  in    each         paragraph          below ]




5.     The     cause          of    the       disaster            wag        the    failure            to       close    off       the
mouth     of     the          tunnel          by    about          2.45 pm         when        Pens          3 arid 4         of        the
lappings        Lane          terraces         were          up       to or        near        safecapacity.                 Had
that    been      done,            fans       could         not         have     crowded down                the      tunnel
causing        gross          overercwding               of      Pens 3          and     4 and           the deaths           of
many    of     those          already          in       the       pens       and       seme       of    those         crowding
down,     if    the           tunnel          had    been          closed          off    in           proper                time,the
many    other        events          which         have          given       rise       to     criticism              would         have
taken   place        without             disaster            and        indeed without                 significant
overcrcwling,          since            the    evidence               indicates          that       the      numbers          of
spectators       which          entered            the      Lappings             Lane     End,         including         those




                                                                  8 *
who     entered          through       the        gates       or         got            in          illicitly                      without
tickets,        did       not     or       did    not        significantly                             exceed                 the        capacity          of
the     west        and       north    sides          of    the         ground, Put                                another              way,        the
tragedy        occurred         because           of    crowd           distribution                               within               the    west        end
Of     the     ground,         not     because          of     excessive                         numbers                     entering          tha
ground.




6.      Hie    evidence          is    overwhelming                that              the            responsibility                            for
preventing           overcrowding            of the          central                pens               had            been          undertaken              by
the     police,          and    that       the        cause       of           the disaster                                  was    accordingly                a
failure        in       policing. The             police,            including                        the             south         Yorkshire
Police,        in       general       do     a    magnificent                    job            in          managing                    football
crowds        week       in    and     week       out       throughout                       the            season                 at    a     very
considerable             ccMQitment          of       officer's1               time              and            police              resources             in
general.        Everyone         concerns              with       football                      must              be          grateful             to     them
for     their willingness                  {and,        despite                Hillsborough, their                                       continued

enjoy       themselves          in     passionate            support                   of          their                team.           Most        of    the

unreasonable            £rcm        having            drunk     too       much,              and     a    number          who     had
no    tickets        and       were          making       more       or        less          active       attempts          to        gain
entry       or     assist          fellow          non-tiekel            holders             to    do     so,        as    well        as
fans    confused          by        the       Inconsistent               ticket             and    turnstile              codings..
The    position was                    made worse          by       crowd              hysteria (in              a    form which
this        experienced             police            force had          not       previously             experienced)                as

misbehaved were                   to    be        numbered          In    hundreds, not                   thousands: perhaps
5%     at    most       of     Liverpool                fans    who       attended,               while        there        is    no
evidence that            theother             95%        misbehaved                     in     any way,              other than
verbally          expressing             frustration                at the             crushing          and larik of

real        cause       of     difficulty                for the         police             was    not     hooliganism                or
misconduct          but        a    problem               of     numbers           of        supporters,             with        tickets,
flooding           Into       the       Lappings          Lane area            in            the half           hour before
kick        off    in order             to     see       the     game         which          they        had    paid        to     esc
and     the        inability            Ofthe           turnstiles         to cope                 with         such numbers.

crovxi build             up        between            about     2.40      and          2.50pm,           diminishing
thereafter.             Given          the        lack    of     Liverpool              supporters             visible           in
their        seats       or        on       the       flank     terraces           at        the     Leppings             Lana     End
by     2,30        pm     in       1989,          a     greater build              up         in the           final half             hour
was     almost          Inevitable.




10.     The .Police                Cctmiander did                   not consider              delaying           the kick             off
(until        far       too late)             because          of    a    police             preconception                that        the
kick        off should             not        be        delayed if         fans             had no         excuse for             late
arrival.          The     conversation                  between          the       Police          Ccmrvnnder         and        Supt
Murray        at     about          2,30          reflected         this.          A    decision           to    delay           the
kick        off     for        fifteen            minutes announced                    at     2.30       would       probably
have        relieved          the           frustration of               the       crowd which                 was    building             up,
prevented          the        hysteria             to    get         in which               developed,           and enabled
the     turnstiles            to     work        faster,           It     is       in    fact       likely       that         the
kick     off         would      have        had        to    bedelayed             by         up to    half         an     hour
to     allow         the whole            crcwd          in.

was     a       system      appropriate            for           use    by      opposing        fans        of      different
parts        of      the terrace            or    convenient              management            of    a        limited         crcwl

it     promoted           the      safety         of    the spectators                   by    preventing            groups         of
fans     having           excessive          space          to run        in        or possibly preventing
horizontal             surges        in    the     c r w d . . it             almost       certainly           enabled          the
police          to     reduce        their       manpower             cornraitment        at    the       Leppings         Lane

12,     Bor       the     three           semi-finals             of     1987 -9 ,       however,         which       vrerc
known        in      advance         to    be     all        ticket          sell-outs         at     least         at     that
end     of       the      ground,          the    police formed                    the view          that      the       fans
would        find      their         own    level           on     the       terraces.         In     contrast           to
league          games     they made              no     provision             in     their      operations            orders
for     specific          responsibility                in        checking         the     level       of      the       known
favourite            pens       (3    and        4),    for            directing          the crcwd            away       frcm

full,       or       for cettmunication                 between          officers         charged          with      these
duties.           Instead        they       relied           on       general       monitoring            by     officers           in
the     vicinity          including          the        Police          Control         Box.     In       retrospect           it
can     be      seen      that       it     was        essential           to      have       express          provision            in
the     operation           orders         to     cover          these       matters, Fans                were      not       in

and     4 because             the     lack        of        gates       in     the      radial        fences         (save       at

misconduct          subject        to        the    defence         of      no   control          and       all    due

clubs    that        no    disciplinary              action            will      be    taken if spectators                       are
temporarily allowed                 onto        the      pitch       because          of   fear        of     overcrowding
(which might             taken          literally        be     a    breach       of       Rule       24{i)(b))          and
will     consider          whether the              Rule      should        formally         be       amended.          This
will     of     course         leave open            the      possibility             of. disciplinary
proceedings          for       having          allowed      any      overcrowding             to      develop           in       the
first    place. There                   is     evidence         that      in     spite      of     the      wording              of
clause     I 1       o£      the        1985    memorandum           no       club     has       in    fact       been
disciplined merely                 for         failure      to      implement          a   precaution             in     the
Memorandum          and      the    FA       will        take       the        opportunity of clarifying
this    to     clubs,




Perimeter       Fencincf


22,     There        have      been             mordents during thecourse                    of       the          Inquiry
when    one        or    other      party           appears       to      have       treated       crowd          safety         and
crowd     control         as    two            separate matters                and 1ms        suggested that
perimeter       fencing            is        concerned with              control       andnot         safety.           In
fact     safety         and     control         of       spectators          are not          divisible in               the
context       of     football           matches. Perimeter                    fences       have       not     been
erected          (and        often        Insisted            upon by      the       PA) in      order          to    keep
the     pitch       beautiful.            They       are       there       to    prevent         overexcited               or
malevolent            fans     fmn        proceeding             onto the        pitchto          challenge           rival
fans       (an    invitation              to     battle which is                 likely          to    be accepted)                     or
to         attack players or                officials,              Experience         has       shown         that i£
fansget       onto       the         wide       expanseof            the      pitch        in    order         to          indulers
in    violence           it     is very         difficult            for      the     police       tocontrol              them
and     that      (as with            any      crowd)          the       violence         can    be     contagious.                 In
extresn©       cases            this      can        lead       to veryserious              incidents          such        as
the      pitched battle at                  Birmingham              in    1985       (Popplewell               Final report)
or    at    the        Luton-Millwall                match          in                    , both      of       Which
involved         serious           casualties.           There       has      fceen crowl             violence            since
the     Hillsborough            disaster,            Even       a    "benign"         crowd        invasion,              such          as
occurred         at      the    Cup       Final          in     1989, may           only        require one            or          two
fights      to      be         picked       for      general violence                 to develop,              particularly
when    drink          lias been          taken.          It     will be         recalled        that          the
requirement            for     a    barrier          to       protect         the playing             area      fron
invasion         is     not        just    a    requirement              of     the    f a .) but       is      stressed            by
UEFA,




23,     For      these         reasons         the       FA    believes         that       perimeter           fencing             will
continue         to     be     necessary            at    many       grounds, The               appropriate            design
for     such      fencing will              be       an       important             matter       for       Phase          XX       of
the     Inquiry         and     the       FA    has       already          inspected         a     collapsible                 system
in    France.




National         Membership          Scheme


24.     The      Inquiry will be aware in general terns of the National
frfembership Scheme                provided          in       the    Football         Spectators           Bill           1909.
It    is    generally           assumed         t!tiat any           such       scheme       will      have          to
involve       the       presentation            at       the     turnstile           by     a    spectator           to        a
computerised irtachine of                      an     identification                card.       Such       a    procedure
is    bound       to     increase          delay         at     turnstiles           and     arguments           have          been
raised       that         such        a     scheme would                   have        increased the                problems         at
Hillsborough,               In      view        of     thepolitical                     issues            involved, it            is
respectfully              suggested             that it          should                 be    made clear              in    the
Interim          Report          (if       it    is        the     Inquiry's intention)                         that these
mattero          will       be        considered            in    Please          II and          that       none      of      the
interim          reocmmendations                     axe     to       be        read as       favouring              (or
dismissing)            the       scheme.

(ii)     where        a     pen        or       terrace          is        expected          to    be       full      and      the

appropriate           for        the       gates       to        be        kept      open      throughout             the      match
with     stewards           and        police         in     attendance.                This       expedient           was
employed         by    Manchester               United           FC        at     the    Liverpool              v    Nottingham

(iii)       the   police            must        clearly           stress          in     their            operation        orders

anticipated.           It        is       essential          that          there        is    a      sufficient            police         or

         sink,        a       work      top,      preferably               two       beds     with       curtains,             a    stocked
         cabinet,             power,       light,          water,              a direct telephone^ thd                     reasonably
         close        access            for     emergency            vehicles,           stretchers,            a     carrying            eh&ir
         and      oxygen           should        be       available            during        matches. One                person          at     the
         club       should          expressly             be    made           responsible         for        upkeep        of      the       first
         aid      room         and       facilities,
                    V

                (b)       a    doctor           should         bepresent             from     a    reasonable              tlnna         before
         all      matches,              There        is    no     reason why                the    doctor           should          not,      at
          typical         Jjeague matches                  with       small           crowds,      be     there           as       cover      for
         both         spectators and                 players,             since       players        are       far        more          lively      to
          be    injured            than         spectators.               He    should however             be            located so           as
          to    be        available             for       both,       ht       matches with          largerattendances,                       it




                                                                           6-
will       be     appropriate            to       have       two        doctors       available,            or       a       separate
doctor          specifically             available           for        spectators.


 (c)       for        all    matches with               an     anticipated            attendance             of       over          5,000
spectators,             at       least       one       fully       equipped        ambulance               should         be       in
attendance. Tor                   big     matches            two    ambulances             and    a        foot      team          of
attibulancj&ten should be                     available


     (d)    the        above is          intended to                be in        addition             to,       and       not       to
be     in       substitution             for,      the        services          presently         supplied               by    the
St,        John's          Ambulance Brigade                 or     the        like at m t c h e s ,




(vi)            One     may have             sympathy with                the     general         police          approach              and
apparent          prior          agreement of                Supt Murray and                 the       Police            Cctrrfiander,
evidenced             in        their    conversation at                  about       2,30 pm,             to     the         effect
that        if       fans       choose       to    drink           in    pubs      and      turn       up       late          at    the
ground           in    large       numbers         they        should' expect               to    miss          part          of    the
match       and        not       to     have the             kick, off         delayed           for       their         benefit          to
the        inconvenience              of those           fens       who        have token          the       trouble               to
turn        up       early.       It may well                 be        that    that       principle            could          have
been        applied             at the       Fen istone        Road end           without              causing           a     crush
situation              since       there          is    no     bottleneck             at    that       end        of         the
ground.          ^     Nevertheless,               as     Chief Supt.             Mole       observed,               the       safety
of     the        crowd         has     to    be       the     criterion           for      delaying            kick-offs, and
it     is        regrettable            that       the       Police        Ccrcmander        never          considered              this
option           until          it was       too       late,       It     is     submitted                 that        the         kick
off        should          be    delayed          if     the       police        anticipate            a        considerable
accumulation                of    fans        at       turnstiles          shortlybefore               kick        off             for
whatever              cause,       if    the       police          consider that            there          my        be
consequent             difficulty             in crcwd             control * The addition                       of       the
proviso           is       necessary          toprevent             late       fans    having          any               confidence
 that       the       match       will        be       delayed          for     their       convenience.
The    choice       of       Hillsborough               for       the    semi        -     final        In    1989


26.     It    Is       obvious         that it           would have             been          more      appropriate            from
the     supporters1point                 of       view        if      Liverpool           had       been         allocated the
Spion      Kop     end       of       the     ground         both        in    1388        and       in      1985/      sines
the     club       has       a    much       larger          home support             than         Nottingham           Forest.
The     allocation of                 ends       was    a matter              for    the        police,          who     made       it
clear      that     Liverpool            must          on     crowd management                     grounds       be     allocated
the     Leppings         Lane         End.       The        correctness 'of               that police              decision
has     not       been       challenged,           nor        has it          been       suggested           that       the     FA
could have             reversed it,               ThePA          accept,       as     Mr            Kelly      acknowledged
in    evidence,          that         the     choice          of      Hillsborough             for      the      second        year
running was            unfair          to     Liverpool            supporters.             The       FA      understand         it
to    be     generally            accepted         that          the     choice          of    ground,         while         unfair
in    that way,             was       not     causative            of     the       dioaster.




27.     While       everyone           must now             wish that           Old        Trafford          had        been
selected to            stage          the     original             tie    and       Hillsborough              to      stage     the
replay       if     necessary,               rather         than vice           versa,             it wasnatural and
understandable              to        stage       a     semi-final            between          the        same     teams       as
last    year        at       the      same        venue          as last        year          when the           1988 match
had     apparently gone                well.          Tne police              appear          to    have         regarded it
as    helpful          to        them that         thsy were                  staging          a repeat        fixture.
While      tiie     telephone            representationfran                         Liverpool prior                to     the
meeting       of       the       Cup Ccmtiittee              should           have       been disclosed                 to    the
Camdttee          as     a       whole       and       not       merely       to     the       Chairman          of      the
Matched       and      Grounds          Committee,               Mr     Kelly       is        almost       certainly           right
in    saying,
            , that the committee                             would         still         have accepted                that
Chairman's          recommendation.




28.        Selection             of    semi-final             venues          may    well          be     difficult          next
year,      and     the       PTi Will            be          taking       steps          to     improve          the
Information            available            to     it       on     suitability of                  venues        for
particular         ties,          including            information             from       club       supporters.             For
example         it    appears         that       one       of    the     grounds        offered      to     the       FA
as    a    venue          had    not,     urikncwn     to       the     FA,      been    issued      with        a
safety      certificate,              although        it    should       be      said    dn    fairness          to    the
club      concerned         that        Investigation itticjht have                   satisfied      the     E!A that
the       ground was            safe    for     suoih a         tie.




29.       Hie    internal         misunderstanding              at     the       FA   and     consequent         failure
to    provide         pre-match          entertainment           is     regretted,           tut    the     Incjuiry
will       have      noted       that     the    tie       was    advertised            in    Liverpool       as
having      pre-match            entertainment.            The    FA's        error      cannot      therefor©
have       influenced           the     time    of     arrival         of     Liverpool        fans,      although
sane       fans      who        arrived      early may           have    teen         disappointed.         No       such
evidence          has      been    given        and    the       view       at    Watford      PC    that     pra~
match       entertainment              does     not    materially            influence        time     of    arrival
may       well       be    correct.

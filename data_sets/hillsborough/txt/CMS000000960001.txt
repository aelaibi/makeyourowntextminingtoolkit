Thank you for your letter of 6 September to the Home Secretary
expressing your g r o u p ’s concern over the decision of the Director
of Public Prosecutions (DPP) not to take criminal proceedings as
a result of the Hillsborough disaster.

I should perhaps make clear that decisions of the DPP are not
matters for the Home Secretary and the Inquiry carried out for
him by Lord Justice Taylor was not set up with a view to criminal
proceedings.    I hope you will understand, therefore, that it
would be wrong for the Home Secretary to comment on the decision
of the DPP to whom, I see, you have written direct.  I am however
arranging for copies of this correspondence to be passed to the
Attorney General who has responsibility for the Crown Prosecution
Service (which is headed by the DPP) so that he is aware of your
concern.




                                                                    P R C   STORR

Subject:     POLICE ENQUIRY - HILLSBOROUGH


Dear Sir


As a mature responsible person who attended the recent semi-final at
Hillsborough and witnessed the appalling tragic development, I offer sane
observations for your enquiry to consider:-


1    I approached Leppings Lane at 2.35 with my two sons and commented
      on the small number of fans asking for 'any spare tickets' - frcm
      previous experience I would have expected to have been inundated
     with requests.

2    At no time during my approach was I asked by police or stewards
      to display my ticket. (Apparently this practice had been adopted
      in previous games).

3    On arriving at Turnstile A (one son proceeded to Turnstile B) I
      was suddenly confronted by a huge crowd in a very restricted area
      and in minutes found myself and one son engulfed by people
      converging fron behind.    The crush was terrifying and there
      was no noticeable police presence to control crcwd movement.
      I saw four foot policemen and two mounted policemen - completely
      inadequate!     We were .pushed and pummelled until eventually
      passing through the 'A' Turnstile.

4     On gaining entrance I was amazed to see the large number of
      constables INSIDE the ground.    I approached a senior officer
      and expresed my concern about the lack of crowd control outside
      and requested him to do sanething about it. I also asked why the
      adminstrators had not 'put back' the match start to dispel the
      panic of supporters who were finding it difficult to gain entry
      amid chaos.

5     With my son I then made my way to the North Stand where I
      witnessed in horror the carnage that had developed.   This was made
      even more unbearable by the fact that one son was in 'B' area
      behind the Leppings Lane goal.    Thank God he survived and helped
      perform the gruesome task of pallbearer to sate of the unfortunate
      deceased victims.


                                                    /continued

                                             page 2



          I would like to conclude sadly by putting my honest impression of
          influential factors that contributed to the tragic events:


                        Lack of effective crowd control outside the ground

                        No apparent ccmnunication frcm inside to outside the ground

                         Inaudible public address system

                        Apparent lack of decisive leadership as the situation deteriorated

                         'Caging' of innocent people



          In no way do I have anything but admiration for the average constable
          who on this occasion appeared to be acting in an unco-ordinated attempt
          to retrieve a terrifying situation.

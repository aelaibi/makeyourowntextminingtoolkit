Scope




This document draws together information1-2,3 that a chartered engineer should be
aware of when designing or analysing demountable spectator stands.
   In the context of this document, demountable stands are considered to be
structures assembled from suitably connected single and/or part-assembled
components supporting a level or stepped platform. In general it is expected that they
will not be in a position for periods longer than one month and that after dismantling
tte constituent parts will be reused many times. It is assumed that they will have to
(l® orm with Building Regulations A l, 2 and 3 and B1 and B3.4
   Much of the material is naturally common to the design of all stands whether
permanent or demountable. Special emphasis is however placed on those items that
are likely to be of greater importance in the design of demountable stands. It
concerns:
  stand occupancy access and egress
  loading
  foundation design assumptions
  analytical procedures and
  inspection responsibilities
  It should also prove helpful when assisting his client to draw up the brief before
going out to tender. A clear brief to the supplier is essential to avoid
misunderstanding later.

There may be many instances when the contractor                          It is only from a test to failure that the real mode of failure

;This test is intended as a non-destructive test for
: confirming structural perform ance. The assembly should
 prove capable of sustaining the test loading given in
  subsection 3.3.

 3.5 Strength test
 The strength test is used to confirm the calculated capacity
 of the structure or component. Before carrying out the
 strength test the specimen should first be submitted to and
• meet all the requirements of the acceptance test.
    The capacity of the assembly under test will be
 dependent on the material properties. The test load
 (including self-weight) is given by:
            _ (averaged yield strength)
  test load =                           -x (factored load)
                    (design strength)
    The actual yield strength of the material should be
 determined from coupon tests*, and an average yield
 strength value taken from such tests.
    A t this load there should be no failure by buckling or
 ruptUre of any part of the specimen, and on removal of
 the test load, the recovery should be at least 80%.
    The design strength and factored load are as defined in
 subsections 2.4 and 2.5.

 4.7 Balustrading and h an drails
 Demountable grandstands should be fully protected with
 front, side and rear safety rails. These rails should comply
 with the relevant local licensing authority requirements,
 but the following general rules should be observed:
 E n d sa fety rails
   ^M Om m high of closed- or open-mesh construction such
   ^R ft a 100mm sphere cannot be passed through any part
      Side rails should resist a horizontal load of 0.75kNm
    run at their top rail position
   Rear safety rails
    1100mm high of closed- or open-mesh construction such
    that a 100mm sphere cannot be passed through any part
       Side rails should resist a horizontal" load of
    l.OOkN/m run at their top rail position
    Front rail
   Front rails should resist a horizontal load of 1.5kN/m
   run at their top rail position
    Front balustrade (in fro n t o f gangway)
    1100mm high of heavier construction to resist a horizon­
    tal load of 3.0kN/m run at their top rail position.
   All access stairways and ramps should be fully protected
 with safety rails.

 4.8 Stairw ays and ram ps
   All access stairs and ramps, w hether internal o r external,
   should be so constructed as to have at least Vih fire
   resistance1011. Stairways need not be closed in or covered,
   but steps should be well defined and dimensioned as given
   in subsection 4.4.
      With internal stair units (constructed within the grand-
 : stand main understructure) it is often difficult to restrict
   the num ber of risers to 16. W here this occurs, the relevant
   local licensing authority should be approached for a
   dispensation. Where poor light conditions exist in an
   indoor arena, emergency lighting and clear signs should
   be fitted to ail stairways and ramps.

  4.9 V oids and add ition al structures
  By nature of their construction, dem ountable grandstands
  have large voids underneath the main seated areas. These
  voids become the resting place for paper, cartons and
  other combustible materials that can be ignited, un-noted,
  by a carelessly discarded cigarette end o r even by
  vandalism. These areas should be cleared of litter as
  regularly as possible but at least after each performance.
  Litter is a major fire hazard to spectators. In addition, it
  should not be possible for infants to gain access to them.
     It is now a common feature to use the voids under very
  large grandstands to provide space for purpose-built
  hospitality suites or rooms. Each box or room becomes an
  integrated part of the grandstand understructure and
  usually provides a glass-fronted viewing room just below
  the first level of seating. By nature of their use hospitality
  boxes present a certain fire hazard, and it is therefore
  essential that these additional structures are constructed
  from materials that have at least Vih fire resistance.

    In the case of tim ber soleplates, which should prefer­

 concentrated column loads may be assumed to spread
 down at a slope of 2:1 horizontal to vertical along the
 grain, and 1:1 across the grain.
    The edges of any excavation should be protected
 against erosion by wind o r water.
    In certain cases where baseplates are larger and stiffer
 than those generally employed, the use of plywood
 soleplates at least 19mm thick is permissible.

FOREWORD
                                                                        R eferences

In 1986 HMSO published the Guide to safety at sports grounds            Guide to safety
to provide measures for improving spectator safety primarily            at sports grounds,
at existing sports grounds for management, local authorities,           HMSO, London 1986
and specialist technical consultants such as engineers. It was
itse lf the result of considerable discussion by a technical panel
chaired by Mr Martin Killoran to advise Mr Justice Popplewell           Committee of Inquiry
for his report Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and               into Crowd Safety and
Control at Sports Grounds.                                              Control at Sports
                                                                        Grounds, July 1985
Many sports grounds in the UK were built up piecemeal as
the fortunes of individual clubs improved and attendances
increased. Attendances reached peak levels in the early 1960s,          Guide to fire precautions

•
land facilities were expanded, often without sufficient thought
for long-term planning and maintenance.

With falling attendances once again prevalent, lack of money
                                                                        in existing places of
                                                                        entertainment and like
                                                                        premises, Home Office

and of imagination has led to many sports grounds lagging
behind foreign contemporaries in quality and appeal. Decay
of the fabric, lack of maintenance, change of social habits
have aggravated this e ffe c t.

New concepts in the standards and techniques of management,
diversity of use to which these sports grounds can be put, and
the relationship of the facility itself to its community are
required. These necessitate considerably better maintenance,
more methodical appraisal and higher standards of refurbishment
or design if the requirements of comfort, appeal and safety
are to be met within the finite budgets of most clubs. Appropriate
certification can then be gained from the Licencing Authorities.

It is of paramount importance to ensure the safe evacuation
of spectators in an emergency.

This publication is intended to stimulate the imagination of
all parties to improve the imagery that the public holds of
sports grounds by the application of sound method and engineering
principles to make such places safer, more comfortable and
satisfying to visit.

Its task is to help increase the chance of success of such facilities
in the community as well as reduce the risk of failure.

1.   SCOPE
                                                                            R eferences
     This publication provides a companion book to Appraisal                Appraisal of existing
     of existing structures first published by the Institution              structures, Institution
     of Structural Engineers in July 1980. It is to act as a                of Structural Engineers,
     reference source to the multi-faceted problem of refurbishing,         July 1980
     appraising, or designing sports grounds. It also aims at
     developing an overall engineering methodology and body
     of scientific knowledge to enable competent personnel
     to carry out reliable and complete appraisal of existing
     sports grounds (or the design of new ones).

     It is also intended that this booklet be complementary
     to the Guide to sa fety at sports grounds to improve the
     knowledge of and communication between different categories
     of person concerned in the operation of sports grounds.
     It is addressed to the following persons:

     (i)     Directors and managers of sports clubs who must
             run clubs to a budget and provide a service to the
             customer that can be afforded and which is satisfying,
             safe and controllable

     (ii)    Engineers, architects and other consultants engaged
             by the clubs' managers to appraise, design the refurbishment
             and organise any necessary maintenance

     (iii)   Public officers responsible for approving measures
             for refurbishment and maintenance, and for licencing
             sports grounds for their various uses.

     The attendance at most sports grounds are generally sufficiently
     low not to put strain on the existing, perhaps under-maintained
     fabric. Occasionally a particular fixture brings to that
     sports ground the possibility of near capacity attendances,
     putting pressure on under-practised management, overcrowding
     the way of ingress and egress, and straining the under­
     maintained sports ground with the resulting considerable
     erosion to public safety. Bradford was just such a case
     in point.

     It is the responsibility of club management to appraise
     themselves of the necessary measures to prevent risk
     to their clubs and the public by employing professionally
     competent personnel to advise them on any repairing,
     refurbishment, and certification that will be required
     before their sports ground can be used to its full potential.

2.   PLANNING MATTERS : WHAT MANAGEMENT SHOULD KNOW

     2.1   REGULATIONS AND SAFETY                                     References

           The Safety at sports grounds Act 1987 imposes a
           licensing system on sports clubs* with stands having
           a capacity of 500 or more. The implications of
           the Act for club managements are far reaching.
           In future managements will need to be aware not
           only of the regulations and associated documents
           but also of what measures will need to be implemented.
           The main regulations are:

           The Building Regulations 1985 (for England <Jc Wales)
           The Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1977
           (for Scotland)
           The Building Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1977
             (for Northern Ireland)

           Approved document B2/3/4 Fire spread gives guidance
           on the fire safety provisions of the regulations for
           England and Wales.

           Management will be responsible for overall safety
           of the public. This means, inter alia:

           -   having available drawings of the overall facility
               (1 : 1000 city plan; 1 : 500 ground plan and section
               showing principal means of ingress and egress,
               compartmentation and other facilities such as
               location of stewards and public address system

           -   being able to identify
                 potentially combustible materials and building
                 fabric

                 potentially dangerously degraded or substandard
                 fabric

           -   establishing the principal needs for good access
               and egress

           -   providing good information transmission systems

           -   keeping the conditions of terraces, viewing slopes,
               stairway, etc. in good condition




           * Sports grounds are widely defined in the Act to
           include not only soccer, rugby, cricket, tennis, etc.
           but also horse and greyhound racing, athletics, etc.
           grounds.

                                                                    COPY No. 1 ,

      -   establishing the need for appraisal, testing and
          refurbishment (usually without disruption to
          the sports programme and club facilities) to
          bring the ground to the required standard

      -   establishing a planned preventative maintenance
          routine

      -   establishing a strategy for emergencies

      Management will need to estim ate the necessary
      work and prepare a cost plan (probably on a quarterly
      basis) so that the aims can be achieved. A list of
      day-to-day routine responsibilities is given in Appendix
      A.

      This document is aimed primarily at advising on       —
      safety for spectators in existing sports grounds,
      and as such it attempts to take account of the contraints
      and difficulties that are present within these grounds.
      Although it is not a design brief for new construction
      work or reconstruction at sports grounds, the principles
      may well still be applicable. Such work should not
      be to a standard lower than that set out here, and
      the scope offered by new design work should lead
      to better standards than can be achieved at grounds
      already built.


2.2   MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS

      2.2.1   Preparation of drawings of sports ground
              The impact of a new sports ground on the
              local infrastructure requires careful consideration
              from the aspects of road safety; traffic
              congestion; environmental changes and the
              e ffe c t on the lives of the local residents
              during match days.

              The convergence of over 30 000 persons on
              a locus within an urban neighbourhood can
              create both traffic congestion and the potential
              for road accidents. The construction of a
              major sports ground within a community
              also can create social and physical stress.

              In regard to the social behaviour of the spectators
              converging on the sports ground it is important
              that confrontation of the supporters is avoided
              through ease of access to the respective
              parts of the sports ground. An open-plan
              sports ground free from boundary fences
              and having freedom of access from most
              compass affords the best solution to crowd
              control.

              Such e ffe c ts are best judged from a plan
              of the sports ground and surroundings at a
              scale of about 1:1000. Further larger scale
              drawings of the ground and its constituent
              parts will be required.

2.2.2   Access for emergency vehicles                            COPY No. -2 !
        Adequate roads for emergency vehicles such
        as fire appliances and ambulances should
        be provided so that speedy and direct access
        can be obtained to all buildings within the
        ground. Emergency routes should be defined
        (in consultattion with the police).

        Wherever practicable and where necessary
        roads within 0.5km (5 mile) of the ground
        should be kept entirely free of parked vehicles
        so as not to delay or obstruct the access
        of emergency vehicles.

2.2.3   Considerations affecting capacity
        There are two elem ents in the design of facilities
        for crowds - crowd management and crowd
        control. In good design the crowd would
        be managed such that its self-motivation
        would lead it to behave correctly. Crowd
        control is necessary where self-motivation
        would lead to incorrect behaviour.

        In many instances, the required safety standard       Guide to safety at sports
        to be attained will relate to the maximum             grounds, HMSO, London
        number of spectators who are liable to be             1986 (Section 16)
        admitted to the ground (or part of it). For
        example, a large football ground with a maximum       BS to comment
        spectator capacity of tens of thousands is
        liable to pose significant crowd pressure
        risks. To accommodate safely a maximum
        crowd at such a ground might entail substantial
        remedial work; alternatively, consideration
        might be given to accepting a much smaller
        number of spectators who, properly dispersed,
        could be accommodated safely without having
        to incur costly repairs or alterations. The
        first step, therefore, is to assess how many
        people can be safely accommodated in the
        different sections of ground given the existing
        condition of the ground, i.e. to determine
        a safe spectator capacity.

        (Note: practical example to be included that
        differentiates between normal and emergency
        conditions.)

        Although controlling crowd numbers may
        serve to reduce some risks to an acceptable
        level, remedial work is likely to be necessary
        to overcome others. Obvious defects such
        as trip hazards (especially at the head of
        stairs or steps), loose or weak handrails on
        stairs, and obstructed exists of exit routes,
        should be rectified as part of the general
        care and maintenance of a ground. Structures
        should be sound and inspected by suitably
        qualified persons. Design, layout and signposting
        of exits and exit routes require particular
        attention to ensure that they can safety cope
        with the number of spectators who will use
        them at the end of an event or in an emergency.
         Similarly, the condition of terraces of viewing
        slopes and presence or otherwise of crush
        barriers, correctly sited and meeting the
                                                                  COPY No. 1*
          Broken, uneven terracing causes stumbling.
          Barriers not only serve to break up crowd
          pressures but also assist in controlling movement
          off the terraces by restricting the rate of
          arrival at exits to suit their capacity, and
          encouraging the formation of queues so that
          spectators arrive at exits in an orderly fashion.

          It follows that in general in a ground where
          it is proposed to retain a high spectator capacity,
          the measures needed to be taken to accommodate
          safety such large crowds are potentially more
          extensive.

2.2.4     Division of ground
        _ A ground should be divided into sections to
          prevent potentially hazardous migrations
          by spectators. Each section of a ground has
          its own limit of safe capacity and a major
          migration can cause dangerous overcrowding.
          Each section of the ground, for example,
          each end or side, should be self-contained
          with its own entrances, exits and toilet/refreshm ent
          facilities. For football grounds in particular
          there should be no access from one such major
          section to another except in an emergency.
          At other sporting events such as greyhound
          racing spectators may need to move freely
          between different parts of the ground, and
          this should be borne in mind when considering
          access to and from the sections of the ground.

2.2.5     Signposting
          A comprehensive system of signposting that
          clearly indicates routes to the various parts
          of the ground, and the the exits from the
          ground, should be provided. Signs relating
          to fire safety and other safety signs (e.g.
          first aid facilities) should also be provided.
          Exit gates them selves should be clearly signposted,
          preferably using illuminated signs. Directional
          signs should be provided to encourage crowds
          in any particular section to flow in one direction
          when leaving the ground.

2.2.6     Exits
          Locked exit gates should be manned by a
          steward at all tim es when the public are
          in the ground, to ensure they can be opened
          immediately from inside by anyone in an
          emergency. The use of a common pass key
          for all exits should be considered, as should
          one-way exits to cope with normal conditions.

          All gangways and exit routes must be unobstructed
          and capable of being used to their full capacity
          at all tim es when the public are in the ground.
          Every part of an exit route should be able
          to accommodate the flow from the terrace
          or stand exit.

2.3   REFURBISHMENT AND RECONSTRUCTION WITHOUT
      DISRUPTION TO CLUB ACTIVITIES
                                                                     COPY No.   1
      2.3.1   General
              Changes in legislation and the need to make
              significant improvements in the provisions
              for spectators have presented football clubs
              with a serious challenge to their existence.
              Clubs of different standing within the present
              league structures are confronted by major
              expenditure on their existing grounds in order
              to meet future standards in comfort, safety
              and competition.

              Functional and financial considerations often
              necessitate the redevelopment work being
              carried out in phases, and management of
              projects of this kind equates with the special
              technical and practical skills required to
              design and construct large-span structures.
              Whether the aim is to construct a single stand
              within an existing ground or to create a com pletely
              new complex, the project requires technical,
              managerial and financial skills of a high calibre.

              Safety provisions must comply with the requirements
              of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1986.
              Comformity with fire regulations is of paramount
              importance.

              Ingenuity of design, construction and the
              creation of new provisions will determine
              the health and welfare of sport in general,
              and football in particular. Current technology
              is advanced sufficiently to permit the reliable
              design and construction of new concepts
              in sports grounds, provided that they are
              commercially viable.

      2.3.2   Preplanning
              There are many important matters to be
              considered in the creation of sports grounds,
              and preplanning the project management
              are essential elem ents of reconstruction.

              Preplanning commences with a definition
              of the overall concept of the proposal for
              development, by identifying and researching
              the potential market for the facilities and
              by- making arrangements for financing the
              reconstruction work.

      2.3.3   Spectator safety
              Safety of spectators requires consideration
              to be given to the behaviour of large masses
              of people stimulated by certain events. Hooliganism
              can be inflammatory and can result in extreme
              behaviour by small groups or encourage the
              general misbehaviour of large masses of spectators.
               Unruly behaviour is identified best by seating
              all spectators since serious mischief in terracings
              is clandestine and difficult to control.
                                                      COPY No. 1

Easy access to groups of spectators is important,
and an adquate system of passageways facilitates
crowd control. Television cameras can also
act as a deterrent. Alcohol is a stimulant
to be avoided since it can cause unacceptable
behaviour in some individuals. Alcholic drinks      / / BS to revise
cannot be taken into grounds in Scotland.

The provision of a high security fence between
the spectators and the playing field prevents
both the exercising of control over crowd
misbehaviour and the egress of spectators
at a time of panic or disaster. The use of
fences to restrict crowd movement in a cage
environment is not the best solution. Safety
is best served by an open-plan concept for
grounds where spectators are placed within
specific areas to and from which access and         DC to comment
egress are rapid and simple.                        BS to comment

The latter-day concept of high walls and
fences around grounds within which pay-
kiosks are located is no longer tenable, and
new grounds should eliminate the restrictive
strips of land between the boundary fences
and the spectator stands. Pay-kiosks should
be positioned within the stands and the boundary
fences should be removed.

The removal of the barriers to free movement
outside the stands eliminates the feeling
of being within a stockade and promotes
better crowd behaviour. The occasional misdemeanours
by some spectators is readily handled within
an open-plan system. Incidents within strips      / / DC to consider
of land between boundary fences and stands
are difficult to handle and control, and the
ease of access provided by the removal of
boundary fences facilitates crowd handling
by police, and operations by fire and ambulance
services.

Stairs providing access and egress to stands
should be well designed to obviate dangerous
jostling by spectators and dangerous forward
movements to groups of spectators. Collapse
of a mass of individuals can cause severe
crushing of persons caught in the zones of
maximum thrust.

Rapid exit of spectators in emergency situations
is important, and generous provisions should
be made.

The materials used in the construction of
new grounds should inhibit combustion and
the spread of fire and provide spectators
with an opportunity for escape and survival.

.4   Spectator comfort
     Comfort is a relative description in the context
     of open-air grounds since climatic conditions
     control largely the amount of comfort being
     experienced by spectators.

     Seating should be clean and comfortable,
     and the manoeuvrable spaces between the
     seats should be adequate for all sizes of persons.
     Seating decks should be free of columns to
     permit a clear view of the playing surface
     by all spectators. Spectators should be close
     as possible to the playing surface.

Additional facilities beneath stands
The use of grounds on an intermittent basis,
is a commercial limitation that necessitates
additional income from other sources such
as pools and sponsors. The use of space for
diverse commercial businesses within sports
grounds can provide financial resources for
the club and can benefit the local community
by employment and service to industry. Advantage
can also be taken of space available below
inclined seating to provide additional facilities.

Comfort
Comfort of the spectator also forms a major
consideration in the design-ef stands. Inevitably
in these days of television, less and less people
will be attracted to the sports grounds unless
the comfort conditions are improved and
are comparable to those at home. The level
of comfort can be raised by providing a warmer
environment, roomy seats or accommodation,
protection against elements (i.e. against
rain or chilly wind), refreshment facilities
of reasonable standards as well as toilet facilities.
The ranking or grading of the existing stands
can possibly be made on the basis of the above
considerations.

Viewing and sightlines
One of the important parameters in the design
of sports grounds is 'good viewing'. It is essential
that the spectator should be able to see the
principal object of the sports (namely the
football or tennis ball or the athlete as the
case may be). This is also a primary consideration
in appraising an existing sports ground. When
large crowds are present and densities are
high the frustration from lack of proper visibility
of the principal object can cause aggravation,
irrational behaviour, and build-up of pressure
within the crowd. Some consideration of
viewing and sightlines is given in Appendix
B.

Circulatory space
It is necessary to provide a greater area for
circulation in the case of perambulatory
viewing such as athletics and horseracing
than for stationary viewing such as football
(see Appendix B).

SAFETY OF SPECTATORS

3.4.1      Home Office Guide                                     References
           Since the Ibrox Park disaster, the safety
           of the spectators in sports grounds has been
           extensively studied in the UK. The sources
           of problems have been identified and recommendation
          given in the Guide to safety at sports grounds
          to minimize hazards to the crowd with particular
          application to football grounds. Recommendations
          include ingress and egress arrangements to
          and from the sports ground and means of
          escape, standards for stairways, ramps and
          handrails, fire precautions as well as the
          standard for viewing slopes and terraces,
          including layout and design criteria of crush
          barriers. Pressures can be set up within a
          departing crowd by impatient people; such
          incipient pressures can and must be contained
          and controlled by careful attention to the
          detailed design of barriers, stairways, gangways
          and exits. Reference should be made to Section
          5 for further information on flow rates etc.

3.4.2     Deviations
          Although the recommendations of the Guide
          are not mandatory, they are accepted as
          guidelines by the local authorities in enforcing
          the Safety of sports grounds Act 1975. The
          Guide however, was prepared primarily in
          the experience of football stands; therefore
          some of the recommendations may need modification
          before being applied to stands for more relaxed
          activities such as tennis, horseracing, etc.

          Deviations from individual guidelines are
          possible without necessarily detracting from
          the overall safety of the ground. The variety
          of type, function and layout of sports grounds
          and the inter-relationship of the different
          parts of them means that a flexible approach

          particular circumstances at individual grounds.

          It is necessary to evaluate flow characteristics
          which, are generally based on notional ideas.
          The rate of ingress at which people moved
        • was variable and could easily change, e.g.
          "parents looking for children etc. Egress rates
          are hard to calculate as people do not divide
          themselves evenly but go where they want
          in order to get on to 'target' to where they
          are going, rather than sorting out into an
          even distribution. At certain events, e.g.
          Olympics etc, people drift in and out depending
          on the attractidn of the event. To have even         Jake Pauls: American/

             There are essentially four types of safety
             problem to be considered within a ground
             and in its immediate surroundings, all of
             which are linked in some way:

             1.   Hazards that cause individuals to trip,
                  slip and fall causing individual injury
                  but also serious further injuries due to
                  build up of pressures

             2.   Build up of crowd pressures.

             3.   Danger of crushing of people during
                  the evacuation under emergency conditions.
                   Orderly evacuation of large crowds
                  under emergency conditions is a very
                  serious problem.

             4.   Risk from fire (see Section 4).

     3.4.3   Information transmission
             The importance of communicating clearly
             to people, particularly those waiting, cannot
             be stressed too strongly. Good public address
             systems are required.

                        Structural safety is the primary consideration
                       of structural appraisal and design. For a
                       new structure, the design generally follows
                       the recommendation of. the Codes of Practice
                       appropriate to the material to be used, and
                       if guidance in some respect is not clear cut
                       or sufficient in the Code it is based on the
                      engineering judgment and appreciation backed
                      up y experience and/or tests. When appraising
                      existing structures particular attention has
                      to be paid to the e ffe c ts of joints or elements
                      from corrosion, from cracking and from potential
                      degredation by fatigue.                        iw uiai

                      In the current Codes an accepted level of
                      safety is deemed to be achieved by the use
                      of partial safety factors on loads to allow
                     for the possibility of a given load being exceeded
                     accidentally and by partial safety factors
                     on the strength of materials to cater for
                     its probable variation in the actual construction.
                     In the appraisal of the existing stands however,
                     the situation is somewhat different. At the
                     design stage, for example, many factors remain
                     unknown and need to be covered by a safety
                     margin in loads and materials.

                     In the appraisal of existing stands, however,
                     the situation is somewhat different since
                     most of the variables are determinate. In
                     consequence, it is possible and often preferable
                     to apply engineering judgment as to the appropriate
                    level of these safety margins such that the
                    assessment does not become inordinately
                    conservative. What is most important is
                    the application of rigorous methodology to
                    the matter of appraisal to ensure nothing
                    is missed or misinterpreted.

3.6    LOADING

                   In the appraisal of any existing structure
                   or design of new works all relevant loads
                   should be considered invidually or in the approriate
                   combination to give the most critical effects
                   on the elements and the structure as a whole.

               In addition to its self-weight and any other
               permanent loads, the structure should be
               designed to withstand loadings, from crowds
               and their movement, wind, snow and any
               other forces to which it may be subjected.

               Vertical imposed floor load
               This should comply with the requirements                BS 6399 Part I: 1984
               of BS 6399: Part I, Table 7. For the most               Design loading for

                   or a concentrated load 4.5 kN.

               In come circumstances, it may be appropriate
               to appraise a stand in the light of the possible
               loads it is likely to receive in relation to
               maximum crowd density achievable.

       3.6.3   Imposed roof loads
               The roof structure must be able to withstand            BS 6399: Part I
               the effects of superimposed loadings as given
               in Section of BS 6339. Attention should be              Draft Snow Code
               paid to the e ffe c ts of concentration or assymetry    BS 6399: Part 3
               caused by possible patterns of snow drifting
               in valleys in relation to the shape of the roof.        BRE Digest 290

               The person responsible for determining the
               adequacy of the roof should pay particular
               attention to its accessibility. This will apply
               particularly to existing roofs, where access
               other than for cleaning, while unintended,
               may be possible.

                              In addition to wind forces, the structure will
                              need to resist applied longitudinal or transverse
                              horizontal loads resulting from co-ordinated
                              wave motions in the crowd.

                               Recent research indicates that a force of
^                    /         up to 150 N per person parallel to rows of
                               people, and 200 N perpendicular to seating
                               rows can effectively be exerted in the horizontal
    K / j(r ^ j / iV J        direction during a co-ordinate surge. Such
                ^             a force can be particularly significant to
                              frameworks whose own self-weight is low,
                               or in a poor state of maintenance, and where
                               crowd densities are high.

                  3.6.6       Dynamic loads
                              Traditional design approaches incorporate
                              dynamic loading as statically equivalent live
                              loads. This provides adequate strength but
                              only partially accommodates vibrations.
                              Attention should be paid to periodic forces
                              that may arise due to gusting wind. Concerted
                              spectator activity should be considered where
                              any of the natural frequencies of the structure
                              are below 4 Hz.

3.7   STRUCTURAL SAFETY IN FIRE

      3.7.1     Fire resistance (see Section 4)
               The statutory requirement for the minimum
               period of fire resistance of a structure is
               normally specified in the Building Regulations
               or equivalent.

               The structure should be able to withstand
               a fire without collapse and prevent its growth
               and spread for a sufficiently long period to
               enable safe evacuation of the occupants.
               The degree of fire resistance required, therefore,
               varies with the fire risk of the building as
               well as the facility for rescue operations
               and is in general governed by three considerations:

               (i)   type of occupancy (i.e. the purpose
                     for which the building is used)

               (ii) floor area and cubic capacity of compartments
                    and

               (iii) general height above the average ground
                     level.

                Considerations (i) and (ii) are indicative of
                the expected fire load, the area of ventilation
                and the geometry of compartments that influence
                the fire severity and thus determine the degree
                of fire risk, while consideration (iii) relates
                to rescue operations. The higher the building,
                the more time is likely to be needed to evacuate
                the occupants to safety.

                Steel roof structures of stands do not therefore
                require a specific period of fire resistance
                but clearly in the case of particular elements
                in steel adjacent to high fire loadings whose
                failure could lead to disporportionate areas
                of collapse, additional protection may be
                necessary to achieve a minimum of half an
                hour fire resistance.

       3.7.2    Smoke venting
                 The form, organisation and constructional
                 material of a stand or sports ground must
               . be such that accumulation of the products
                 o f combustion (smoke, toxic gases) does not
                 occur so as to inhibit escape to the outside,
                 either in still wind conditions or under the
                 various directions of prevailing wind. When
                 there are significant fire loadings, wind tunnel
                 studies may be required to assess the likely
                 consequences of particular wind directions,
                 and additional smoke venting provided.

5.   CROWD SAFETY AND COMFORT

     5.1 GENERAL
        The Guide to safety at sports grounds contains procedures       Guide to safety at
        for evaluating the capacity of different parts of sports,       sports grounds. Home
        i.e. sports grounds. Chapter 16 of that Guide gives             Office/Scottish
        examples for the estimation of safe ground capacity.            Office, 1986
        Assessment must be made of:

               the holding capacity of a terrace or viewing
               slope or seated area

               the capacity of a given exit route from a terrace
               or stand

               the location of crush barriers to minimize
               pressures associated with crowd movements.

        The number of people that can be safely accommodated
        on a terrace or in a stand (or other covered accommodation)
        is either its holding capacity, or the capacity of the
        exit system to be used in normal circumstances at
        the end of an event or the emergency exit system
        whichever is the least.

     5.2 PASSAGEWAY BLOCKAGES
        With a crowd moving along a passageway, physical
        blockage can occur once a critical density is reached.
        In these conditions crowd pressures can escalate
        to a dangerous level, and if a person stumbles or
        falls the crowd cannot adapt to avoid him or to stop
        to help.

       The blockage may be 'spontaneous' and does not require
       an obstruction such as people falling to generate
       it, the mass of people forming a 'comprehensive arch'
       against the onward stream between the 'abutments'
       of the passage boundaries. Any obstruction such
       as people falling will of course aggravate the effe c t.

       Once a blockage occurs the build-up of pressure and
       resultant injury and asphyxiation may be rapid if
       the following crowd is not halted and is unaware
       of the obstruction ahead.

       Since this type of danger arises from crowd pressures
       its remedy lies in their removal or restraint within
       safe lim its .’

       The essential measures are:

              the means of controlling the crowd density,
              which is by controlling the initial entry into
              an exit route such that the rate of entry is
              commensurate with the capacity of the route

              the design of the passageway to eliminate
              obstructions to flow and other hazards
                                                                COPY No.
         provision of sufficient barriers on terraces
         to ensure restraint to surges in 'peak' or 'other1
         viewing areas without incurring pressures
         on the human body that cannot be 'tolerated'.

5.3 FLOW RATES
   The recommended flow rates given in Chapter 17
   of the Guide to safety at sports grounds are:

         From stands and stairways a flow rate of 40
         persons per minute per unit of exit width (i.e.
         550 mm) should be used (73 persons per minute
         per metre). From terraces (including covered
         terraces) and the ground generally a flow rate
         of 60 persons per minute per unit of exit width
         should be used (109 persons per minute per
         metre).

   The design of each passageway section against these
   flow rates should be for those flows expected in an
   emergency, where other passageways have been closed,
   rather than the normal situation.

   It should be noted that all rates may be reduced where
   spectators may be less physically able, after consultation
   with both the Licensing and Building Authorities.

   Appendix C shows flow rates assumed in Israel and
   US for a range of recommended uses including sports
   centres. Also included are the flow rates used by
   the Department of Transport for pedestrian facilities.

5.4 SEQUENCE OF CALCULATION
   The capacity of an element is the product of the
   flow rate, the available width and the emergency
   evacuation tim e, as defined in Section 4.

   The sequence of calculations for each element in
   the ground is illustrated in Fig. 5.1. It recognizes
   that should a particular element fail to reach the
   required capacity the options are generally to improve
   the element or to reduce the overall capacity.

5.5 CONTROL OF CROWD FLOW IN EMERGENCY
   The need to control the flow of crowds in emergency
   situations is recognized. In an emergency, reactions
   may not be logical and clear concise directions must
   be given. It.is important that exit passageways are
   identified, signed and sized, and allowance should
   be made for the emergency situation when other
   exits may be unusable. Care should be taken in the
   planning of exit systems to ensure that, in the event
   of an emergency that blocks any of the usual exit
   routes, alternative routes will be available. Management
   and stewards must be familiar both with the layout
   and organization of the ground and the plans for emergency
   evacuation. Arrangements for entry and exit and
   those for seated or standing accommodation can
   conveniently be considered separately. Disasters
   at Ibrox (1973) and Birmingham (1984) occurred during


                              5/2
                                                                 COPY No.
egress, while those at Bolton (1946), Oxford and Carlisle
(1973) happened on the terraces due to collapse of
barriers or insufficient barriers.

5-5.1     Entry control
          Entry should normally present no problems
          within the ground as spectators generally arrive
          over an extended period and are 'filtered' by
          the turnstiles. Crowd pressure can however
         occur outside the ground, such as under 'house
         full' conditions after the turnstiles have been
         closed. An important provision is means of
         automatically recording the numbers admitted
         at each point. This information should be
         continuously available at a central control
         point. This allows the spectators to an area
         or section but will not necessarily prevent
         surge pressures that can even occur in partially
         filled pens if the crowd concentrates in a favoured
         area as is common.

5.5.2    Exit control
         Where problems occur as in the event of an
         exit passageway blockage for whatever reason
         it is essential that the entry to that passageway
         is closed quickly. The public address system
         should be used to reinforce, and even inform,
         the stewards. However, such communication
         cannot be achieved unless the public address
        system is aimed at the specific passageway
        or the passageway itself is clearly identified
        in some manner for example, alphabetic or
        numeric. The labelling of each of the passageways/exit
        routes at regular intervals such that, for instance,
        it could be announced that passageway R was
        closed and passageway T should be used as
        an alternative would be of benefit. The ability
        to redirect crowd movements by such clear
        identification of exit routes is of major importance.

        Protection provided to stairs, landings and
        passageway should be enclosed to a standard
        such as NOT to pass a 100 mm diameter ball
        through the protection.

        All padlocks on exit doors should be unlocked
        and made ready for removal throughout the
        period that spectators are within the ground.
        Wherever feasible, for example, at manned
        pitch perimeter gates, non-locking security
        devices should be used.

        Splitter barriers are those that are arranged
        parallel with the flow and split it into separate
        lanes. They have a regulatory effect, help
        to reduce surge pressures and-provide a desirable
        hand support on one side. Some reduction
        of flow occurs with lanes less than 1.1 m wide.

5.6 CRUSH BARRIERS
   While it is of paramount importance that collapse
   of barriers under crowd pressure does not occur,
   it is also important that crowd pressures cannot be
   generated so as to cause injury to those spectators
   pressed against the barrier.

   It should be recognized, however, that maximum
   pressures occur with all spectators between two barriers
   contributing simultaneously, which although it seldom
   occurs is likely to cause gross discomfort rather than
   actual injury.

   The Guide to safety at sports grounds contains guidance
   on the reduced spacing of barriers in areas where
   spectators may crowd together, for example behind
   football goals.

6.   STRUCTURAL APPRAISAL                                               COPY No.

     6.1 GENERAL APPROACH
        In carrying out an appraisal of an existing ground or
        individual stand it is especially important that the survey
        of conditions of both the overall structure and all its
        individual details is methodically and meticulously carried
        out so that as complete a 'picture' of its existing condition
        and likely structural performance can be identified.

        Any remedial measures that may be required to ensure
        structural adequacy can then be more precisely targetted.
        Although the process of appraisal inevitably leaves less
        scope for choice of strengthening necessary than does
        the process of designing a new structure, it is nevertheless
        important that measures should be as attractive as possible.
        The imagery of such basic structures has been shown
        to play a significant part in how the facility is viewed
        by the public.

     6.2 EXISTING SURVEY DRAWINGS
        Original drawings should be sought. If not available,
        a survey should be undertaken to identify the construction
        and provide base drawings for use and annotation during
        appraisal (see subsection F.4).

        For new work (and old if possible), the ground should
        retain original as-built records on the premises, preferably
        in negative form so that they can be readily reproduced.

     6.3 SURVEY OF CONDITION & RECORD OF FINDINGS

        Determination of the physical condition of the structure
        is important. The task of determining the condition
        of a structure should be approached with an open mind
        without prejudging the cause of any apparent defects.
        There is always the danger that new defects that are
        outside of previous experience will be missed, and much
        effort may go into trying to find a well known type of
        defect that is not present. It is necessary to describe
        the conditions adequately so that the situation can be
        reviewed objectively. However, previous experience                Appraisal of existing
        of defects should be borne in mind and checks made                structures, IStructE,
        for them.                                                         London 1980

        eyes. He must therefore be dressed when undertaking
        this work.so as to be able to inspect all spaces and be
        equipped with a torch, tape, hammer, ladder, notebook,
        etc. He must be prepared to expose members or connections
        where he judges that defects may occur. Clear notes,              (Fig.A is Appendix A

        The report Appraisal of existing structures should be
        consulted for guidance on surveying the condition of
        a structure.

            under sway loading should be noted. Thick
            packers under units can be potentially hazardous.
            Poor quality in situ concrete terracing can
            create a tripping hazard.

        -   Attention should be paid to block/brick
            walls enclosing public corridors, perimeter
            walls and those forming entry/egress gateways
            especially if not adequately restrained,
            since they may be subject to significant
            lateral loads from crowd pressures.

        -   All parapets, barriers, e tc.

        -   In the case of slender structures with long
            cantilevers and long span structures, attention
            should be paid to the e ffe c ts of fatigue
            resulting from possible fluctuations. Principal
            welds should be inspected on a regular basis
            for evidence of cracks.

        The above would be some of the key areas for
        inspection which are needed in any event to
        determine whether the construction has been
        built as intended from the drawings.

6.4.2   Inspection

        What needs to be inspected must be safely and            Appraisal of existing
        easily accessible.                                       structures, IStructE
                                                                 July 1980

        There is always a temptation to view from                Structural renovation of
        a distance, especially in bad weather, and reliance      existing buildings. CIRI
        must not be attached to impressions gained               report III 1986
        from distance viewing.

        Gutters/downpipes should be included in a                Historical structural
        'structural/fabric' inspection to ensure leaking         steelwork Handbook

        Early stands may be 'light' on stability e.g.            Use of redundant
        Victorian iron sheds are often dependent on              buildings -
        their corrugated iron for frame bracing. The
        engineer must therefore beware of removing               sheets 19, 20, 21 and
        cladding, without prior appraisal. He could
        consider whether permanent extra bracing is              Architects Journal,
        desirable.                                               March 21 and 4 April


        Checks should include identification of deleterious
        or hazardous materials. These will include:

            high-alumina cement in structural elements

            woodwool slabs as permanent formwork

            calcium chloride in admixtures for use in
            reinforced concrete

           sea-dredged aggregates (inadequately washed,
           so containing residual chloride)

           asbestos products

            concrete subject to alkalisilica reaction

        Toilet areas, or structures below toilets designated
        and otherwise), are particularly at risk from
        acids etc. Dark corners should be checked.

        Pre-World War II concrete may contain clinker
        or otherwise sulphate/nitrate rich aggregates.
        Leaks through these can highly corrode existing
        embedded filler joists or supporting steelwork.
        Embedded details may require sample or widespread
        opening up.

        The services of an expert are recommended
        to inspect timber elements for rot, insect attack,
        and to identify or warn of conditions that could
        encourage these. (Damp unventilated areas
        are notorious for dry rot.)

        Details that contain junctions of steel and concrete
        should be checked for corrosion, eg precast
        terrace or seating units on steel frames. Anything
        fixed by chemical or expanding anchors should
        be regarded as potentially suspect.

        GRC is a material that will bum and become
        brittle, and its presence should be identified.

6.4.3   Recording of results of condition
        Specific comments should be meticulously marked
        on a 'pro forma' check list as per Fig. 6.1. Ideally
        the locations of any particular defects should
        also be cross referenced to the survey plans,
        and photographs taken.

5 POTENTIALLY COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS AND BUILDING
  FABRIC

  Guidance on matters concerned with fire appraisal has
  been given in Section 4.

6 TESTING OF MATERIALS & ELEMENTS

  Where the survey provides sufficient information to
  enable the engineer to complete the appraisal and reach
  conclusions and make recommendations with confidence
  there will be no need to test. Requirements for testing
  will arise where, for example,

        there is lack of information on what materials
        are present in the structure

        the presence of deteriorated or deleterious material
        or substandard material is suspected

  Such requirements, whether they be for materials testing
  or for load testing are described in Appraisal of existing
  structures

7 TESTING OF CRUSH BARRIERS/HANDRAILS

  Crush barriers should be tested in accordance with the               Fig. 6.2 Testing of
  Guide to safety at sports grounds by an approved testing             barriers at Bradford
  machine. See Fig. 6.2.

  Where testing is carried out on isolated members, as
  opposed to complete barriers, then the loading on the
  member should take account of any loading transfer
  due to fixity of components.

  The results of each individual test must be recorded                 Ref Guide to safety
  and kept in a log. Copies should be available to both                at sports grounds
  the Licence Holder and the Local Authority. Tests should             § Annex C
  be carried out either on a five year cycle or totally at
  least every fifth year. This information should be noted
  on a 1:200 plan of the ground, and should be incorporated
  into an annual report for inspection by the Licensing
  Authority.

  Failure of barriers should be to the criteria laid down
  in the Guide.

  All failures should be prepared or renewed prior to the
  next activity taking place, or the areas in question taken
  out of use until made safe.

  Any works of strengthening and refurbishment carried
  out as a result o f a failure must be re-tested and logged
  before being opened to the public.

  All new or renewed work should be designed to comply
  with the Guide for loading capabilities and to the relevant
  structural codes of practice arid, if supervised, by a Chartered
  Civil/Structural Engineer, need not be tested on completion.
                                                                          COPY No. - Z
   The incorporation into a testing schedule of all new or
   renewed barriers/handrails should be determined by the
   Engineer.

6.8 APPRAISAL OF THE EFFECTS OF WIND

   6.8.1   Wind tunnel tests
           If on appraisal doubts are raised as to the e ffe c ts
           on the structures or on smoke venting of the wind
           regime, investigations by representative wind
           tunnel test may be necessary.

           Sports ground structures tend to dominate their
           environment and can make major changes to the
           original airflow pattern. Sports grounds are seldom
           built on level sites free from obstructions, so
           that the topography and all structures in close
           proximity will need to be included in any wind
           tunnel test. Care must be taken to ensure that
           this does not reduce the scale of the model so
           much, in order to fit the wind tunnel, that model
           is too small to reproduce the dynamic e ffects
           accurately. Suitable wind tunnels are specially
           built to reproduce the gusty nature of the wind
           to the same scale as the structural model and
           are available in specialist laboratories. Tests
           in the smooth and uniform flow of aeronautical
           wind tunnels give inaccurate and misleading results.
           Guidelines for wind tunnel tests is given in Appendix             CP 3: Chapter V
           K of CP 3: Chapter V, Part 2, and Part 2 of The                   Part 2. Appendix K
           designer's guide.

   6.8.2   Analysis of effects on wind loading
           Approach to the assessment of wind loadings is
           covered in subsection 3.5. Most structures which
           are not slender, ill-conditioned or long cantilevers,
           can be analysed for response under quasi-static
           loadings. However gust loadings generally excite
           the structure over a wide range of frequency
           producing a combined static and dynamic response.
           The dynamic part is normally a random buffetting
           which may cause problems of fatigue. Data on
           the loading cycle for fatigue assessments are
           given in Table 1 of IP19/84 and in Fig. 24 in the
           ECCS Report No. 52. Regular periodic oscillations
           caused by vortex shedding only occur with slender
           solid structures, such as lighting masts. Lattice
           structures and typical stand enclosures are not
           usually subject to this problem.

           Flexible stadia structures and especially any with
           long cantilevers may display excessive dynamic
           e ffe c ts. If investigation (for example the classification
           procedure in BS 6399 Part 2, Digest ??? Part
           2 or Chapter 10 of The designer's guide) shows
           that dynamic effects are likely to be experienced,
           there are three problems to consider. Firstly,
           the interaction between the structure and the
           air flowing over it; secondly, the determination
           of the magnitude of the forces which this causes:
           and thirdly, the response of the structure itself
           when random or periodic forces from wind or
           spectators are applied to it.
                                                                  COPY No.
         In practice, there is no necessity to assess the           Cook, N. J.:
         complex behaviour of large amplitude dynamic               'Designers guide to
         response, since the engineer is required only to           wind loading of
         understand its causes and e ffe c ts sufficiently          building structures',
         to avoid such an occurrence. This can be achieved          Ch. 10.
         by altering the shape of the structure to reduce
         the aerodynamic forces and eliminate instabilities;
         by changing the member stiffnesses to move the
         natural frequencies away from those generated
         by the wind or the crowd; or by increasing the
         damping to reduce vibrations to negligabie amplitudes.
         Even relatively simple arithm etic calculations
         will be sufficient as long as they can demonstrate
         that there is no danger to the structure from
         wind loading or any feasible behaviour of the
         spectators.                                    —

         The simple calculations of BS 6399 Part 2, Digest
         ??? and ECCS Report No. 52 are sufficient to
         determine the peak dynamic forces with sufficient
         accuracy for most stadia structures of regular
         shape in relatively open environments for preliminary
         assessments.

6.9 APPRAISAL OF STRUCTURES AGAINST DISPORPORTIONATE
    COLLAPSE

   With so many people collected in one area, it is necessary
   to ensure that sports ground structures do not collapse
   disproportionately to the cause.

6.10 REPLACEMENT OR STRENGTHENING OF DOUBTFUL
     ELEMENTS

   Where either the survey or subsequent testing, or appraisal
   shows an element to be unsatisfactory it should either
   be replaced or suitably strengthened.

   Such considerations may well require the installation
   of temporary support until such time as the permanent
   remedial work can be undertaken. All such temporary
   works should be designed and constructed with the location
   and nature of usage in mind.
                                                                        COPY No.

                           THE INSTITUTION OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS

    The failures at Birmingham, Bradford and Brussels football grounds of 1985 led directly
    to the establishment of Mr. JustioePopplewelTs Report. This Report highlighted further
    the potential dificiencies, sometimes severe, which exist in many sports stadia in the UK,
    despite the existence of the Green Guide 'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - Football
    (1976)'. This Guide had originally highlighted the need for thorough, complete engineering


•   analysis of such facilities.


    Such potential problems are not limited to football grounds but can and do need to be identified
    and solved for almost every rugby league, cricket, tennis or golf stands where high occupational
    densities can be achieved.


    All failures that have occurred in recent years have in a sense been engineering failures
    which the application of engineering method and analysis could have prevented at little
    additional first cost. Appraisal is largely an analytical process suitable for execution by
    a person trained as an engineer. Really a guidance document is required to enable competent
    engineers to carry out a realible and complete appraisal of existing sports stadia and for
    the evaluation of the design of new ones.


    The establishment of an ad hoc Committee by the Institution is therefore both appropriate
    and would be effectiv e in the production of such a guidance document over the next two
    to three years. With good organizational layout, up-to-date referencing and compilation
    such a document would supplement the Green Guide as the standard document worldwide
    to establish good practice.


    The remit given to this Committee should be to produce an integral document which tackles
    the problems of structural condition, traffic flow, crowd densities and fire safety in the
    light of modern crowd management techniques. It should address itself to the evaluation
    of individual elements, each stand area and the total complex.

4.0     FIRE AND FIRE SAFETY                                                     REFERENCE

        Safety from fire is     achieved by measures that restrict initiation,
        rate of early growth and later spread of fire; provide and protect
        escape routes; segregate higher fire risk areas; provide warning
        (and where necessary detection) of fire; and assist with fire­
        fighting operations.  The fire officer should always be consulted
        on matters of fire safety.

        The type of accommodation that can present the greatest hazard
        in the event o f fire is the existing covered stand where specta­
        tors sit or stand, where the level of combustibility may be high
        and the resistance to propagation and spread of fire is low. Such
        a combination o f properties can endanger life.

        When there are poor housekeeping, combustible structures, poor
        stewarding, no evacuation procedures, a lack of fire-fighting ap­
        pliances or these are not in the appropriate places, there is great
        potential danger from fire when large numbers of people arc
        gathered together in   a relatively confined space.

        It is an undeniably       fundamental principle that in the event of
        fire people in a stand must have ample time to be able to make
        their way to safety without having to endure smoke and toxic
        gases, heat radiation, etc by use of protected exit routes.

        The means provided for escape depend on the rate at which the
        fire may develop, the number of people involved, as well as the
        size and geometry of the structure.



        FIRE SAFETY APPRAISAL STRATEGY

        The age o f existing structures, their construction and the resis­
        tance to spread o f fire will vary considerably along with the
        chances of safe escape. It is therefore not considered practical or
        viable to produce a definitive set of rules from which a judge­
        ment can be made. Therefore an approach based on the experi­
        ence of appropriately qualified professional persons, licencing
        authorities and club management working within a set of de­
        fined parameter is adopted.

        The assessment o f the fire  performance of an existing stand is
        dependent primarily on (1)  the layout, (2) thematerials of con­
        struction and (3) the management of the facility which must in­
        dependently comply with a minimum standard.

        However it is important that the assessors, the club management
        and the local authority recognise that a performance o f one as­
        pect that is below minimum acceptable levels must result in clo­
        sure of that element or improvement to the minimum level.

        In concept the appraisal strategy is very simple and is defined in
        the following flow chart (Fig 4.1).

In order to enable a relatively reliable means of assessing the
large number of parameters which influence fire safety, the
sports facilities are grouped into various risk categories.   Subse­
quently in each category the fire safety provisions are reviewed
interactively and equated to a ..graduated scale for assessing the
escape capacity in accordance with limitations o f Fig 4.2 follow­
ing the techniques described in Section 5.0.

.1   Allocation   o f Stands   to   Three    Risk     Categories:

     Accepting compliance with the minimum standard, the most sig­
     nificant feature o f any enclosure is the combustibility and
     spread o f fire and smoke characteristics of the cladding and lin­
     ing systems.    This is therefore used as the criteria for allocation
     of a sports facility to one of the three risk categories. The assess­
     ment is a function o f the spread o f flame performance (ie Class 0
     or Class 1 - Building Regulations Section B) and the risk of lateral
     spread of fire. For 'non-traditional' materials such as coated tex­
     tiles the assessment is more appropriately based on large scale ad
     hoc testing.
                                                                    COPY No.

     High Risk Stand : Category 1                                            REFERENCE


     EITHER

      A stand consisting of combustible material with a Class 1 spread
       of flame rating (BS 476 Part 7) eg timber with an intumescent
      coating, or Class 1 cladding supported by test certificates for the
     composite construction.

     OR
      A stand consisting of combustible materials where it is possible
     to justify that the lateral spread of fire will not inhibit escape or
     fire fighting operations.

     The desirability of preventing undue flame travel under roofs,
     even those made of inert material, is important. Where this can­
     not be prevented by the intrinsic form of the roof, then it may
     be possible to restrict the travel of flame along the underside of
     a roof by installing deep roof screens combined with substantial
      areas of venting in the roof to allow the flame to pass to the out­
     side. The reservoirs so formed should generally be much smaller
     than are needed for smoke ventilation in order to reduce the
      area o f stand exposed to unacceptably high levels of heat radia­
     tion.     Much larger areas of venting would be required than are
     needed for smoke venting.        However, with the greater buoyancy
     o f the flames, the effect of wind is likely to be less important.
     The roof. screens, together w i t h their fixings must be able to re­
     s is t attack by : flame and very hot gases , for a period commensu­
     rate with escape and fire fighting operations.

     Where the roofs o f stands are so connected that smoke and
     flames could travel along essentially two or more sides of a pitch,
     a . wide break in the roof should be made to separate each side un­
     less flame travel could be eliminated by the measures above.

     In very difficult cases, removal of the roof altogether could be
     considered.


.3   Low Risk Stand : Category 2

     A stand consisting o f a non-combustible material (BS 476 Part 4)
     with a Class 1 ' spread o f flame rating (BS 476 Part 7) defined as
     Class 0 in the . Building Regulations.

     A construction-comprising a low density primary timber frame
     which meets , the fire resistance requirements with a Class 0 clad­
     ding would be acceptable in this category.


.4    Covered Ground        : Category 3

      As Category 2 but spectator and sports arena are covered under
      one roof enclosure. Careful consideration should be given to all
      materials to m inim ise ignition and spread of fire and smoke.

      leading away from the stand to be Class 0 construction.

GUIDANCE FOR ASSESSING MINIMUM STANDARD                                REFERENCE
OF CONSTRUCTION AND PLANNING

Generally the appraisal should be guided by the Building Regula­
tions and appropriate legislation (see Section 2.1).  However the
specific items which relate particularly to sports grounds   must
be considered in addition to the basic planning and structural as­
pects defined in this document and in the "Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds HMSO 1986". The charts in Figs 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5
should be referenced to guide the appraisal.



C o m p a rtm en ta tio n /P rotectio n   of   Tiers

Fire-resistant construction is required to separate high fire risk
areas and voids from the spectator tiers, flo o rs separating stand
tiers should also have appropriate fire-resistant construction.
(See minimum requirements defined in Figs 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 for
various categories of stand.)

Automatic sprinklers could be considered as an alternative to
compartmentation although in the majority o f cases compart-           BS 5300 Part 2
mentation is the better option. Sprinklers are not acceptable in
outside stands.



Planning     of   Escape      Routes

Escape routes should be planned to keep people well clear o f the
smoke from a fire. The hot buoyant smoky gases produced by a
 fire will flow r upwards and will collect under and flow along roof
 spaces, balconies, etc. As the gases rise, they entrain air strong­
 ly, which increases their volume and lowers their temperature.
Further cooling takes place by radiation and convection heat
transfer as the gases flow under roofs, etc and eventually they
 may have lost enough buoyancy for them to follow air move­
ments created by any wind. This could mean that within a stand
-smoke is brought down to ground level. The escape routes should
be planned with these factors in mind so that people can gener­
ally jnove downwards and away from the smoke and protected
from radiation.

Escape routes should not be significantly threatened -by continu­
ing fire and its products o f combustion or by a developing fire.

Alternative widely separated escape routes are preferred, pro
viding similar protection.



Smoke      Control     M easures

It may be possible in some cases to keep smoke away from escape
routes by restricting its travel and even making it flow out of the
building altogether.

Some geometries o f roof, eg transverse open-ended barrel vaults,
can promote the rapid ejection o f smoky gases from a stand and
inhibit their spread along it.   Conversely, longitudinally vaulted
roofs would favour the rapid spread of smoky gases along a stand.
                                                                                   COPY No.

        Where the roof geometry is not of itself capable of ejecting                     REFERENCE'
        smoky gases, then reservoirs to contain them together with roof
        venting to cause them to flow to the outside may be advisable.
        The design of such systems is normally made for still-air condi­                 Thomas, P.H. &
        tions.  With an open building of this kind, the effectiveness of                 Hinkley, P.L. :
        the venting can be strongly influenced by the wind because                       Design of Roof-
        over-pressures generated above a roof and/or suctions under­                     Venting Systems
        neath it can oppose the flow of smoky gases out of a vent, and                   for Single-
        even cause a complete reversal of flow so that air from above the                Storey Build­
        roof flows down through the vent.    Thus roof venting cannot be                 ings, London,
        a universal solution. Expert assessment and possibly wind tunnel                 HMSO, 1964
        tests may be required.



4.2.5   Restriction        of    Flame    Travel        Under   Roofs

        Flames from a large fire that impinge on the underside of a roof
        or balcony, even one made of inert material, will elongate very
        considerably as they flow along under the roof and, radiating
        downwards, can put people below in great danger and greatly
        enhance the spread of fire horizontally at floor level.   As with
        smoke spread (see Section 4.1.2) the geometry of the roof can in­
        hibit or favour spread o f flame along a stand and should be care­
        fully considered.   Similar design approaches to those of Section
        4.1.2 are possible, and expert assessment may be required.



4.2.6   Emergency          V ehicle      Access    to     Ground

        In addition, consideration will need to be given during the early
        planning for adequate and maintained access for emergency ve­
        hicles to all parts of the ground from outside the facility.



4.2.7   Measures      to        Prevent or    Retard       Early   Fire   Growth

        It is absolutely crucial to restrict fire growth rate to manageable
        proportions because o f the impact of fire growth rate on escape.

        There is a need to break interaction between fire spreading in a
        litter-filled cavity and wooden seating or flooring. This can be
        done by:

        (a)      cleaning cavity and compartmenting from tiers;

        (b)      cleaning cavity and filling with concrete;

        (c)      replace flooring and seating with concrete;

        (d)      clean and seal cavity, provide cavity barrier and detection
              supporting evidence to show that lateral spread of fire
               along floor or seating is not a significant hazard.

8   Compartmentation        of    Spaces     Under   and   Between   Stands  REFERENCE

    For stands with space underneath the seating where a fire might
    develop in stored materials, it may be necessary to provide auto­
    matic sprinkler protection under the stand and a fire-resisting
    barrier between the stand and the space beneath.       Significant
    storage areas should be isolated from stands.



9   Prevention     of   Growth     of   Fire

    Where there is extensive wooden seating on a concrete or simi­
    lar floor, giving a high fire load, protection may be gained by
    providing manually operated sprinkler system in order to pre­
    vent build-up of smoke, etc.  (Such a svstemis not sufficient to
    protect wooden seating over a litter-filled cavity,)



10 Fire      R esistance   of    Structure

    The    fire resistance period of the structure should be compatible
    with     the compartmentation (Section 4.2.2) that it supports and
    also    sufficient to prevent premature collapse or progressive fail­
    ure    o f a facility (indeterminate structures are an advantage in
    this    respect).

    General requirements for fire resistance period are defined in
    the charts (Figs 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). However these values are not
    definite and careful consideration is required in appraising the
    consequences o f failure o f a particular element and its implica­
    tions on means of escape and subsequent fire fighting.



11 Fire      R esistance   Appraisal

    Where specific test data is not available or tests to BS 476       indi­
    cates a lower standard than required, an alternative fire         engi­
    neering approach could be adopted to make an assessment.           This
    approach recognises the influence o f fire load, ventilaton,      loca­
    tion o f- structural members and their working stresses.

    The stability of structural members during a fire is controlled by
    the temperatures that they experience and the nature and mag­
    nitude o f the stresses in the members.      The fire engieering
    method o f design can quantify the conditions to which structu­
    ral members will be subjected in the event of a fire.

    Different approaches can be made when implementing fire en­
    gineering, many being simple, while others are complicated,
    costly and time-consuming. In view of the cost implications in­
    volved in the length of a study, the level of potential cost savings
    should be evaluated to establish whether the application of fire
    engineering is worthwhile.

        In both existing sports grounds and in those of new design, the

        they are aware o f their role in an emergency situation should be
        given the highest priority. It is the responsibility of the Man­
        agement who have the best knowledge of their particular situa­
        tion to produce the documented evidence (operating plan) that
        they have considered the total problem and that the stand/
        ground is safe for the certified occupancy.



4.3.1   Q uality   Assurance     for   Larger     Facilities

        For larger facilities, quality assurance techniques can        be used
        beneficially to provide the documentary evidence and            give an
        affective means of monitoring the application of the           manage­
        ment intent. The following steps are a simple resume           of the pro­
        cess:

        1.    Produce an operating manual to cover all aspects relating to
                 crowd management, emergency situations and equipment.

        2.     Verify and monitor the manual for, say, 1 year to ensure its
              adequacy and consistency and that it forms a basis for certi
             fication.

        3.    Adjust manual if necessary.

        4.     Monitoring process continues, based on operating manual.



4.3.2   Emergency      Procedures      and    S ta ff   Training

        It is essential that plans should be made for dealing with emer­
        gencies including fire. The onus to do this lies with the manage­
        ment of the facility.     Joint consultation between Management,
        police, fire, ambulance and other emergency servicesshould
        take place in order to produce agreed plans of action for all fore­
        seeable types of emergency.       While the public are in the
        ground, the number of staffon duty should be sufficient to cov­
        er entrances, exits and other strategic points and to fulfill other
        essential duties.

        All such staff should be trained in the use of the fire fighting
        equipment provided, and in the action they should take in the
        event of fire.

        Organisation of stewards and their training to respond appropri­
        ately in an emergency is the Management's responsibility but
        the.»advice ^of- the«'4oeal»^iFe and police authorities should be s«.~ «*■=■«■

Public        Address    System                                               REFERENCE

In dealing with any emergency situation, it is important to                   Fire and Human
recognise the way people behave. The seriousness and extent                   Behaviour, D.
of effect has been found to depend considerably on the reac­                  Canter, Univer­
tions and patterns of activity of people associated with the                  sity of Surrey
emergency or fire situation.

It is especially important that appraisers and designers recog­
nise the need to minimise any delay to the start of evacuation.

In this context clear authoritative and planned instructions
given on a reliable and audible address system are extremely
im portant.



Fire     D etection      (fire    alarm     system s)

A timed automatic fire detection system to enable reliable, ear­
ly detection and start on evacuation procedures. This must
register in the control centre/room where the public address                  BS 5839
system is situated and, to prevent a panic situation, must not be
audible to the general public.

Fire     L oading

Seating, partitioning and any other fixed or moveable con­
tents including seat cushions, hired or sold, to possess a good
performance in fire and be limited in amount.

Contents
Contents not easily dismantled and used to make fires by hooli­
gans.

L it t e r

Accumulation o f litter to be avoided; easily accessible litter
bins to be provided with provision for collection.

Provision         of    Fire     Fighting    Equipm ent

Advice will need to be sought from the loca) Fire Authority.            At
least the following should be considered:

 (a)     provision of adequate water supply and hydrants;

 (b)     hose reels to BS 5306:Part 1, o f sufficient length to reach
          whole area;

 (c)         provision o f portable fire extinguishers, properly main
             tained and protected from vandalism to BS 5423 and sited
              and maintained according to BS 5303:Part 3.

 Measures to Restrict the Extent of Fire Spread                 in
 L ater Stages

 Restricting the extent and speed of fire spread in the later
 stages of fire will reduce the possibility of people's escape be­
 ing further threatened, assist the operations of the fire bri­
 gade, and reduce the ultimate size of fire and extent of damage.
                                                                                              COPY No.

                     Most measures which reduce the rate of fire growth in the early                  REFERENCE
                     stages will help to restrict fire spread in later stages.


           4.4       PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL FIRE PRECAUTIONS TO EXTEND
                     MEANS OF ESCAPE TIME

                     If the exit        capacity   of the stand is Jess than actual capacity of the
                     stand, it is       feasible   (subject to the limitations of Fig 4.2 and guid­
                     ed by Figs         4.3, 4.4   and 4.5) to increase the escape capacity by the
                     addition of         further   safety provisions. The methodology of the
                     approach is         defined   in the flow chart of Fig 4.6.

                     Additional management activities or active fire protection meas­
                     ures must be justified by the management and supported by a
                     sound technical submission and agreed by the licencing authori­
                     ty. It should be clear that the additional provisions will, in reali­
                     ty, improve the safety of the facility.

 As the diameter of a football is 220 mm, it follows that the
 maximum distance between a spectator and the furthest point
 on the football playing area should not exceed 190 m. It should
 be borne in mind that at this distance the object is barely
 recognizable and does not in fa ct provide a good and unstrained
 visibility. The maximum distance therefore should, where
 possible, be reduced by 20-40% of that calculated by the above,
 i.e. for a football ground the furthest point of the field to
 a spectator should be lim ited to, say, 150m. In a football (and
 also in a rugby) ground this win correspond roughly to a circle
 of 90m radius from the centre spot as shown in Fig. A l.

  Figs. A2 and A3 show the optimum viewing circle and the
  maximum distance in two existing grounds - in St James Park,
  Newcastle, and Wembley Stadium. It is clear in the case of
  Wembley Stadium that a section of the spectators will remain
  outside the optimum sight distance or even the maximum sight
  distance of the full arena.
  This consideration sometimes is most crucial in deciding whether
  the stand should have a single rake or multi-tiered ones.




                                    APP 1
                                                                              COPY No.
. Another aspect inter-related to good viewing is the sightline.
  The slope of the rakers should be such that the lines of sight
  from the eyes of spectators in each row to the focal point
  should be clear of or at least tangential to, the top of the
  head (together with the head cover) of the spectator in the
  row in front. The focal point is taken as the near edge of                 Handbook of sports and
  the playing field or the centre-line of the nearest line of the          recreation buildings design
  nearest lane of the athletic track. The profile of the raker
  can be determined graphically and by calculation. Simplified
  formulae can be obtained from references listed in the Handbook.

  There are three main categories of raker:

  1.    straight rakers of constant slope

  2.    series of straight rakers of different slopes, and

  3.    curved rakers.

4 fch e curved arrangement is theoretically ideal but cumbersome
^ n practice, and apart from the high cost, there can be a safety
   hazard where crowd movement is involved. Orientation of
   the stand as well as positioning of the first row with respect
   to the arena (touchline, for example) is important to allow
   a good view of the whole of the touchline by all viewers.

  Depending on the nature of the performance there appear
  to be three borad patterns of crowd circulation in stands:

  (a) Static crowd: which exists where the show is continuous
      or even interm ittent such as football, rugby and some
      athletics, but without any interrelated diverse activities
      during the interval.

  (b) Circulating crowd: which exists where the show consists
      of several consecutive events with interrelated extra
      activities during the interval between them, and generally
      associated with betting, such as horse racing, dog racing
      etc.

  (c)   A combination of (a) and (b), where one part of the stand
        could have a static crowd while the other parts have circulating
        spectators.

  Compared with (a) crowds are smaller and more leisurely in
  the other two categories, especially in (b). The design criteria,
  of necessity, will be different and the facilities provided by
  the designer will, of course, have to be compatible with the
  requirements of the patrons in each relevant category. A
  relevant numerical comparison of the three categories is given
  in Table A l.

* Ascot Racecourse Grandstand does not have the same amount
of built in facilities for multi-purpose use of the buildings
as doe the Doncaster and Sandown Park Grandstands.

** The area of 2.60 m 2 per spectator was calculated with
regard only to the seating and standing capacity of the rakes.
Durking major races a crowd of 30 000 could actually use all
the facilities and then space per spectator would come down
to 0.69 m 2 only, thus comparable to category (a).

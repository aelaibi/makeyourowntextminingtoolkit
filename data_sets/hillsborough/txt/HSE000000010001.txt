HILLSBOROUGH


In response to TD/FAID concern as to how this    incident had been
handled in HSE (ie RLSD taking the lead), I visited Dr Alan Jones,
D/SEL on 15.8.89 to discuss our unease.

Please find attached a copy of my notes of this     meeting, which
have since been agreed with Dr Jones,  together     with relevant
Annexes.

Further to my commentary in Para 6 of the notes,      Dr Jones has
responded in regard to his 1investigations1 concerning the crowd
density figures, and I include his comment as an Appendix to this
minute.

All in all, I think our points have now registered with RLSD, and
we can look forward to improved cooperation in presenting,   what
appears to be to the Inquiry Team, the HSE views.

Notwithstanding this position, I would welcome any comments you
may wish to make on the points covered in my discussion of
15.8.89.

    Dear Professor Maunder

    HUISBGKXGH DISASTER INQUIRY

    N w that the Interim Report has been issued I would like to describe how the
    details of HSE's contribution will be reported and invite you to consider
    requirements for additional work.

    It is my intention to produce a compilation report, similar in style and format
    to the first HSE report, covering the following areas: testing of turnstiles;
    metallurgical assessment of barrier 124A; strength of crush barrier
    calculations; finite element stress analysis of barrier 124A; calculation of
    crowd capacity in Pens 3 and 4; further crowd density estimates in Pens 3 and 4
    (including the 1988 semi-final); noise level measurements.

    A length of wrought iron tube, from barrier 129, will be tested to establish
    the flow stress but, since the calculations explain adequately the collapse of
    barrier 124A, it does not at this stage seem necessary to commit further
    resources to the testing of a complete barrier. I would welcome your views on
    this matter and on any further work which may be required from HSE in the
    second phase of the Inquiry. For example, do you foresee any HSE involvement
    in the revision of the Green Guide?

    In our internal discussions, a number of relevant areas in which information
    appears to be lacking have been identified. These include: the relationship
    between crowd density and surges; stresses induced in crush barriers by crowd
    pressure; the height of crush barriers; methods of testing crush barriers.
    Staff in HSE could, if required, be involved in the discussion of these topics
    and it may be appropriate for research to be commissioned by the Home Office.

    I am now on leave until 29 August. Please contact                    or            if
    any urgent matters arise before then.

    Yours sincerely

OVERCROWDING - HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND TRAGEDY

1.   You wrote on 19 April to             about       _ who has
had to return to Sheffield City Council to help deal with the
investigation at Hillsborough.  You copied the minute to Miss
        who copied it to me and we would simply comment that we
are sure HELA would like central approaches to continue in the
local authority enforced sector and therefore for the secondments
to APAU to continue.  We will wait and see whether 1     Z D can
return to the APAU or someone else would need to be seconded.

2.   But that is not my real reason for writing.

3.   You ask at the end of your minute whether HSE/APAU should be
involved in the aftermath of this incident.   I note from the
'Times1, that the cr^sfn barriers are to be sent to RLSD for
testing and I assume that APAU's involvement would be with the
suggested audit of the management of safety at sports grounds.   In
these areas I see very good reasons for HSE getting involved - it
has expertise and experience to contribute.   But what concerns me
a little is whether HSE is in any position to contribute to the
enquiry on the central issue ie. overcrowding and crowd control.
And should it be?

4.   My interest in the issue comes from 4 rather tangential
directions


                                                        ” R E C E I V E D sr«

                                                             THE i
     - Section 3 and demarcation lines between the HSW Act and
       other legislation
     - policy on the leisure industry
     - violence at work
     - policy for the disciplined services.

Section 3

5.   The Section 3 review SPD D carried out last year was sparked
off by the Bradford fire - another tragedy at a football ground,
but where barriers were not present and spectators were more
readily able to escape from danger.              Iis preparing
follow-up to the Section 3 review for the Commission and will be
covering any demarcation issues which arise from the Hillsborough
tragedy; the lead on Hillsborough is very clearly with the Home
Office, but we ought to be clear what, if any, supplementary
responsibilities we have and ensure that we fulfil them.

6.   Other crowd related issues arose on the Section 3 periphery.
One was prompted by the German air show disaster where, if I
remember correctly, the plane which crashed was flying over the
watching crowd.  We checked to see if HSE was responsible for
enforcing at UK air shows.  It is not - the CNAA are and they do
not allow crowds beneath flight paths.  But we did wonder about
crowd control at, for example, stock car or Grand Prix racing.

7.   Other Section 3 'peripheral' areas arose with the railways.
       | drew our attention to the problems of over-crowding on
London Underground and I understand the Clapham Junction enquiry
will look at the contribution over-crowding may have had to
injuries and fatalities.   I understand that Mr      is pressing RI
to undertake some work in this area.

Leisure Industry

8.   Section 3 links very much with H S E 's responsibilities for
enforcing in the leisure industry (and the responsibilities of the
local authorities which are to be increased under the proposed
revision to the Enforcing Authorities Regulations). Football is
not of course, the only form of mass audience entertainment -
there are marathons, discos, indoor and outdoor pop concerts and
fairgrounds.

Violence towards employees including the disciplined services

9.   There is also the connection between over-crowding and
violence towards staff; on the underground and railways, incidents
have been recorded where anxious and threatened (or disruptive)
members of crowds have turned on Underground staff trying to
control them.  I assume the same is true for the police and other
disciplined services - at least this has been alleged at
Hillsborough.  There are also connections between crowd control
and the abuse of alcohol; policy on the use of alcohol at work is
MD's responsibility.
    Involvement

10.  Returning to my questions in para 3, is HSE in a position to
contribute to the debate on over-crowding and crowd control, and
should it be?  I don't know the answer to the first part.
Certainly I don't feel in a position to do so, despite our
(limited) interest.   I do not know of any advice or guidance or
research which addresses the issues, except the Home Office Green
Guide for Sports Grounds.   I wonder if recipients, particularly
RLSD, know of any work which has been done, especially on the
psychological or design aspect of crowd control.   As to the second
part, I fear the answer is yes.   This issue seems to be one of
growing public concern and perhaps justifiably so.   The trade
unions are I understand concerned about the problem in the
railways.  It is perhaps likely to be a politically live issue.
Overcrowding seems to me to be a serious work-related hazard and
possibly a growing one partly because of the growth in "non-
traditional" sectors.

11.  To float a thought, the sort of contribution HSE might
possibly make would be to commission some appropriate academic to
do some work for us.  This would mirror our contribution to the
Violence debate, where HSE itself did not have much expertise, but
commissioned Tavistock to produce general guidance, which we then
adopted.  The work involved for HSE was not high, and the results
have been well received so far.

12.  I have taken the liberty of copying this minute widely to
anyone I can think of who might have an interest;  I hope you will
excuse my exploiting the opportunity of your minute.  I have done
so because, although one or two people have indicated that they
share my unease,I am not at all sure of the general concensus
within HSE.  I would be interested to hear others' views.  I
realise the implications of suggesting someone should explore the
problems of overcrowding.  I would be very happy to be told that
someone has work in hand or is willing to take it up.

OVERCROWDING - GENERAL POLICY ISSUES


1     I would like to thank all those who replied to my minute of
2 8 April about Hillsborough and the general question of
overcrowding.

2.   The responses suggested that it was SPD D who had
responsibility for policy on this issue within HSE, and we accept
it.  However, there was general agreement that any major action,
even if desirable, should wait until the Hillsborough Inquiry
makes its report.

3.   There also seems general agreement on the legal position.
Section 3 of the HSW Act undoubtedly covers the safety of many
types of crowd - in particular, those who pay cash to an
"undertaking" in return for watching an entertainment.   The
Bradford fire judgment had already firmly established this.
However, as with many other areas covered by section 3, the safety
of crowds can also be covered by more specific legislation.  For
example, football crowds like the one at Hillsborough are covered
by the Safety at Sports Grounds Act, and HSE has agreed with the
Home Office that section 3 will not be enforced in these
circumstances.

4.   A more general point was also raised: where potential crowd
safety problems are not covered by other legislation, how far
could HSE'-s section 3 responsibilities stretch? Mr Linehan
suggested as a general rule that HSE has no responsibility for
protecting crowds from themselves (ie. crowd violence).  However,
he proposed that HSE does have a responsibility for protecting
crowds from risks which can reasonably be foreseen and which arise
out of the work activity - such risks could range from pieces of
debris from a motor racing accident, to the inherent dangers of

I
requiring large numbers to gather in a confined space.   This seems
a. very sensible distinction to draw, and is in line with the
Bradford judgment.

5.    At MB recently attention focussed on the work which RLSD is
doing to assist the local authority and others in the Hillsborough
case.   It was generally agreed that the scientific, technological
and medical services could in appropriate cases offer advice and
assistance irrespective of whether HSE had enforcement
responsibilities.   It would be important that the cost of such
help was recorded,as even if it was decided not to charge it was   i
important evidence of additional work done by HSE.

6.   Respondents suggested that, while awaiting the Hillsborough
report, SPD should familiarise itself with current thinking on the
subject and w^^-k—   practice of HSE and Local Authority
inspectors,          also pointed out that overcrowding on railway
trains and stations was a subject on which he was asking for a
literature search to be undertaken,

7.   I therefore propose asking               in SPD D3 to do the
following:
            work with SPD C3 to initiate a literature search;

            talk to the LAU and LGTB/LACSAB about any local
            authorities who might have particular experience;

            talk to such a local authority to discover what written
            guidance they have on overcrowding,
            expertise, and what legislation they believe applies to


I would also be grateful if recipients could copy to us any
relevant reports, minutes, evidence on the subject so that we can
act as a focal point and keep abreast of developments. ^ With this
background knowledge available we can consider our position again
after the Hillsborough inquiry has reported.

8.   If you have any further views or advice please contact
            or

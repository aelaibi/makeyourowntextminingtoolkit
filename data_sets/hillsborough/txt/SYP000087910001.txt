              On leaving         the ground,        I walked with D etective                       stable Davis and

              other     officers        of serial     40 to the top of Hali fa x Road where,                         on our

arrival       at a p p r o x i m a t e l y    11.15am,       I saw that       one    coach was alre ad y

parked at the end of the dual                         carriageway.           From then on,          throughout

the morning,           coaches a r r i v e d         in.ones and twos.              They were       each parked

immediat ely         behind the          preceding          coach and this way we wo rk ed our way

back down Halifax Roa d towards Hillsborough.                                  As    loaded    coaches

a r r i v e d one of our         serial           would board the          coach,    advise    the fans as          to

the    ban on large           banners and the taking                     of alcohol    into the ground and

also    to w hich gate           they should enter                 the    ground.     It soon became

a pp arent     that a large            number        of    coaches were arriving             empty of fans,

h aving    first u nl oa de d near to the ground before arriving                                 on Hali fa x

R oad to park.            A number           of    coaches also a r r i v e d bearing stickers                on

the w i n d s c r e e n showing         that they had been s ea rched                  prior     to entering

the City       limits.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3. 0 0 p m that         date we were          i nstructed by D etective

Inspector MEEK            to make       our way to Clayw he el s Lane                 for a meal.         We were

by this       time,     on Pe ni st on e Road outside                    the GATE    INN,    and the     crowds

had gone.          For about         one half         hour       prior to this,       large    crowds     had

been making          their way towards                the ground.           Most had been        in good

spirits       and o bv iously          in ant i c i pat i on of having a good time,                    a lt h o u g h

quite a number were                carrying          cans of beer and          lager and had to be

r eminded of t^he ban on alcohol                          inside the ground.                                   /

On entering Cla^thee 1 s Lane we were                             joined by other       serials who were

also m aking         their     imV    for a meal.                At this    time a message was           received

by D et e ct iv e      Inspector CHAR LE S to the effect                      that all       unemp lo ye d

o fficers were to make                their way to the L ep pi ng s Lane                    gate.     Ihis we

did a n d on arriving at the junction of Vere Roa d and Leppi ng s Lane we

were    lined up in serials.                      At this time           1 saw that Sgt Cloke was             not

present,       neither was D .I . Meek,                    but    it was    stated that D.I.         Meek     had

gone on a head to see what                        the trouble was.           We were then sent           to the

Lep pi ng s    Lane gate where we were a gain                        lined up in serials.              A few

        m oments       later,       we were^iKjjered into the ground,                     thinking       that    some

        sort     of    crowd trouble was             takiYxa p l a c e .     On entering          the ground          I saw

           crowd of fans             ’milling*       about    rouvld the entrance               to the tunnel
                                                                            CoN Course
        1 eadl>FV3 to the           playing area.          On e n t ering     the       crowd I saw two          bodies

        lying on the ground.                  They were       obviously dead.              We    formed a ring and

        dis pe rs e d the          crowd from around the bodies and at this                         time,       a Police

        Co ns ta bl e       emerged from the tunnel and shouted for assistance.                                   I went

        up the tunnel              aware    that    other officers were             following me.              There were

        quite a number of              people       in the tunnel,          shouting abuse and             in an

        a gg re s s i v e    demeanour.        On    leaving       the tunnel       I could not see any                sign

        of crowd d isturbance                but was d ir ected by           ' F a n s ’ towards     the front          of

        the    crowd.         I forced my way through,                passing a number of                people who

        were    o bviously distressed,                and saw a number             of    injured people.              1 was

        at^t hi s     time     still    looking for fighting an d crowd trouble.   On nearing
                                            Pon

        the from,           of the    crowd I saw what could only be d es cribed as a heap of

        bo^i^es^^i 1 ed up, against                 the   front     fence.     Some of the          people were

        still moving           but the m aj o r i t y were obv io us ly dead.                    I started to

        di se nt an gl e      the bodies and as            I mana ge d to get one free,                  I passed       it

        over    to other officers and members                      of the     public       to transport          towards

        the    rear.         All    this    time    I was aware of the hosit il it y of the fans                         in

    W   the u p p e r \ i e r .
        thi                           Beca us e     of the slow       progress          o£ getting       the    bodies

        way,      I a s s i st e& nt wo      other    officers       in ripping away the             perimeter

,       fence.  Once this was done, we were able to convey the dead and
                X.                                    ■
        injured o n v k the playing area. I am not aware how many dead and

         n j u r ed I moved,          but    I recall a young man and at                   least two female

        victims.            I stayed there until             the    last    ’b o d y 5 was m oved a nd then

        stayed        in the compound.              At this time,          still    fearing       that    the    ’l-ans’

        in the upper           tier w ould overspill               into the    compound that             I was    in,    I

        was    ordered by someone,                 to form a line.           This       I did.     When someone

        ordered us to link arms and face the                          crowd,       I had had enough.              I
    , *                                                                   P AGE

             turned my back          to the    crowd and     leaned on a barrier.       We were     later

             told to filter          back    onto   the   playing area,   w hich   1 did.    By this     time

             the   crowd     in the upper       tier was dispersing.        I went    onto the     playing

             area and a t t e mp te d to give assis ta nc e where          I could.     Once the ground

            was    emptied      I wa lk ed alone      back towards Clay wh ea ls Lane.

               On Saturday           15th April      1989     (150489),        I attended         the FA Cup Semi            Final

drink.         It was      quite      full with other Liverpool                supporters,          most       of

them were          drinking      but there was         no d r u n k e n e s s .        We didn't    stay there

very    long as the drink was                 poor and then went             down to the ground

w hi ls t walking          to the ground we           received no Police                 d i r e ct io n or escort

a l t h o u g h there were a number             of officers about.                     I saw no violence,

disorder       or drunkness            on our way to the match.

We got to the ground at about                     12,45 pm.          We stood outside              for a number

 f m in ut es       reading our         programmes,       but then decided to go                   in

and    read them,          this w ould haye        been at about           1 pm.

I had no diff ic ul ty             in finding my turnstiles and there were                              no queus

at/^LL 1 and        I had      no proin.erns entering          the     ground.           Ther^r *>ere a number

As    I e ntered the ground              I handed my                 t in and           I did not       see a ny of

very quiet.           So muc h so t h a t w e r e            able      to sit down,             behind a

              have been at about 2.30                 pm.

              So we m oved down and further                    to our      right.         We ended up about 2 steps

              back      from the front        fence.         I have       i n d i c a t e ^ on the same         plan this

              I was      still    standing with my three                 friends at this               stage.     S l o w l y but

              s ur el y the      crowd got     busier and busier,                 but     I d i d n ’t feel      it was any

              diff er en t      to a normal       m a tc h a n d y c e r t a i n l y    not enough to worry me.

              As the teams         came out(we w e r ^ p u s h e d           forw ar d with a surge from behind.

              I e xp ect ed      it to    relax but         it d i d n ’t the          pressure kept         piling   on and        I

              was      being    crushed quite        badly.         In this        push I lost          contact wit h my

              friends.         As far as      I am aware all             the     people around me were alive,

              ft had noticed two girls               in front         of me and to my                left.   They were

              arya then disappeared.                I think they went                  down.     I would describe          them

g Q j y y oou/as about         18 and     16 the     elder one was             taller with blonde               hair the

              other Mad dark hair.                The    one wit h blonde               hair was wearing a leather

                  1 remember just as the crush started a man walked over the tops of

of" 3r£C-i> ,everyones         heads and      climbed over the front                     fence.        He was    in his 20 *s

              a nd had     long hair.

 &            As a result         of the     crush      1 was     pushed forward and                  right to    point 2 on

              the a tt a c he d    plan this        being B8.          My feet were            off the floor and

              the      pain was    quite     intense,        in fact my          left     leg went       numb,    someone was

              pushing against my            calf.        I thought my leg would break.                          People were

              screaming         out for help all ar ou nd me,                                   yr

              I saw the Police            shouting at          people      to move        j^s!ck, thats all        they did

cr*rres       at that      stage.        I then saw the           little gat^/to my                  left open,    and some

              people got out but then                 it was      closed ^ a i n .             people were       by now ^

              climbing         over the front.

The gate was             opened a ga in and stayed open.                    A lad tried twice to                  pull

me over the front                fence    but    he c o u l d n ’t m o v d me an     inch.

Some      time    later there was a relaxation                    Ln the      crowd and         I found myself

right       up against          the front       fence.       I/was able       to move.          1 immed ia te ly

s ta rt ed to       climb out over the front                   fence.       I was   helped over the top

by a policeman.                                                                 <S£/\/c £   l

Once      I got over        I looked back for my friends and saw                                     I saw there

was a pile of bodies                v i r t ua ll y    right    in front      of him,    it was

impossible          to    recognise        anyone       in the    pile,      I shouted to                  and he

climbed over followed by                              and e v en tu al ly           came over.

We all      sat on the ground getting                     our breath'' back then we m o ve d away

from the goal area and stood on the tracK                               round the     pitch by the South

Stand.        Some       fans    came and started            puming      down hoardings            so we helped

them do that,              C A T

We then went             to the    players       du        t and got a drink.            In all         h o n es ty      I

was    just      in a daze and           didn't       realise what        was happening.

We e v e nt ua ll y       left the       ground at about 3.4 3              pm going out         next to          the

S p i o n Hop where all            the ambu la nc es were

W hi ls t    in the ground          I    did not witness           the consumption of               any alcohol

On the terracing                though there were a /few pe/fpl e who I consider to be

drunk.        There was one             person    in partiv                 behind me he         could hardly

stand up,         I have seen him since                 that    day so      I know he d i d n ’t die.

I did not see the barier                   break       in my pen a lt h o u g h     I was       o b v i ou sl y

quite       close    to it.

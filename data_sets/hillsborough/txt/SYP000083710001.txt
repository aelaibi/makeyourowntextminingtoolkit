Upo n a p p r o a c h i n g      the    turn s t i l e s    it was      plain to see            that     the m a j o r i t y

of the fans were                 just wan d e r i n g       about as        though      in a d a z e , some

hysterical,          many were           angryy/



Upo n    reaching        the      Wrnstile           area    I was      d i r e c t e d with other           officers             to

form a cordon aj?ross the                      entrance          to the Leppi n g s Lane              end to       prevent

any     other ( ty g r s a n s    getting       into the          ground ~ some          fans at         this      time       did

turn up with tickets                    and upon being a d v i s e d             they    could not           enter went

and stood         on the         far    side    of the       road.



We were       then detailed              to assist          at    the   siae     folding        gate     on the         right

of the       turnsti/Jes.              I be earns involved at              this     time       in a s s i s t i n g

walking       ivjfxxred to find               safe    places away          from the        fans       corning out            in

thsir      h #mdreds       from        the    rear    of the S t a n d area,            so they        could await

treatment         and be taken to hospital.,



Ambulances         were a r r i v i n g and           some       bodies    ware     being       brought          out    by

fans and Police.                 The     fans    still       earns out       of this       gate ana as             it was

now getting           congested wit h            injured          people,       dead bodies and a m b u l a n c e ,

I started         directing            fans    to other          gates and away from the area.                           A

cordon was          formed        inside       the area          behind    the Stand and              the    fans

di r ected away          to gates            on the other          side    of the       turnstiles.               Other

officers        and myself             then were       d e t a i l e d to form a cordon down the                          siae

of the f encing a d j a c e n t               to the       river    to as       to forrn a wall             to    place       the

injured and dead behind-                        Later       d i r ected    to    clear     the      bridge        are

a d j acent     to the t u r n s t i l e s       to assist          the a m b u l a n c e s     coming       in.



At    this    time     the       fans were       just mill i n g about as                in a d a z e , showing                   a

lot     of verbal        anger and hatred which was                        d i r e c t e d at     the Police,

however       no actual           physi cal      voilance was             d i r e e l e d at    us.      We were
                                                                                                                S S797

             informed     by an    Inspector       not     to   react    to this abuse          but to   ignore       it

             at this     time -    Quite     a number       of the      fans a p p e a r e d   to have   been

             d rinking and the was a strong                 smell    of alcohol        in the a t m o s p h e r e .



             I continued       to assist      ar o u n d   the L e p p i n g s Lane     end of the       turnstiles

             until   Serial    44 was      refor m e d and direc t e d         to patrol        the streets aro u n d

             Leppi rigs Lane are a      in    case of fighting            - of w hich there was            none.



            Later    returned      to Clay Wheels wit h SErial                 44 and was        stood down at 7

              On Saturday 9 April      1988 (090488)   I was on uniform duty at the FA Cup

              Semi~T inal football match between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool

              footbal1 clubs.       The match was held at Hillsborough football          ground.

              corner stand between Leppings Ln end and the North S t a n d .

              dispersal      of the crowd.

              number of people attending the g a m e , I saw no crowd problems or

EVIDENCE OF DETECTIVE SERGEANT JULIE APPLETON
 1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    You have had a chance to look at
 2        what Debra Martin said to me.     Would you like to tell me,
 3         in your own words, what your contact with Debra Martin
 4        was?
 5    A    I was Debra Martin once - on one occasion at her home
 6         address, which is the day that I took the second
 7         statement.   That is the only contact.     I obviously must
 8         have made arrangements to see her over the telephone, but
 9         I have only met her on one occasion.      Everything was very
10         pleasant.    I was invited in, had coffee, biscuits.      She
,11        was upset but that was not surprising considering the
12         events of the day, but she seemed perfectly OK and I
13         actually thought that I had got on very well with her.
14    Q   What was the purpose of your visit?
15    A   The Coroner had said he thought it highly unlikely that
16         Kevin Williams had spoken, and he asked that     I go to speak
17        I with her and tell her what he believed, what    he thought,
18        ! and ask her whether this was the case or not; whethex she
19        \could be mistaken or whether she was adamant that he did
20         speak.
21    Q   Did you refer to the Coroner as "your boss"?
22    A   No, he wasn't my boss.    I would say "the Coroner".
23    Q   The Coroner had asked you to clear this up?
24    A   Yes.
25    Q   Did you try to clarify with her at all theearlier parts
26         of her statement, her original statement?
27    A   No.
28    Q   Did you appreciate that she was obviously completely
29         confused in that part of the statement?
30    A   No, not until I read the transcript today.       No, that
31         hadn't been brought to    my attention.    I wasn't aware of
32         that.
33    Q   She seems to be the only person, so far as       I can s e e , who
34         appears to think a blue gate at the Penistone Road end was
35         forced and she was pushed into the ground and got out
36         again and so on.    You hadn't appreciated that?
37    A   No.

                                        2
And you were not interested in that?
No.
So having told her why you had come, what happened then?
She talked through her recollection of that day, and she
was asked if she would like to make a further statement,
which she said yes, and I took down the statement at her
dictation.
Did you use a dictionary at all at any stage?
I do carry - or I did, I don't now - a small dictionary.
It is possible that I took a dictionary out to check that
I was spelling a word correctly.     I haven't got any
recollection of that.
It sounds as though she may be right about that.
Yes.
Did she at any stage go out of the room in tears?
No.
And she is - I have seen her - a very emotional lady.       Was
she in tears at all when she was talking about Kevin
Williams?
I cannot recall.    I can remember - if I say she was upset,
I had seen an awful lot of people that had been affected
by this disaster.    She certainly was no more distressed or
upset than a lot of other people that I had seen.        I don't
recall her breaking down and crying.     I have no
recollection of that.     It obviously was difficult for her
to go over.   We were talking some 11 months later, and to
go over what had happened - but I certainly don't recall
her being unduly upset.
And the language that she uses in the second statement was
entirely hers about being a zombie and this kind of thing?
Absolutely.
What happened?     You wrote it out there and then, did you?
Yes.
And then you asked her to sign it?
I asked her to read it, and obviously invited if there was
anything that was not accurate or if she wished to alter
 1          anything,   that obviously she could, and she        read it and
 2          signed i t .
 3    Q     And I see that there are, at any rate, two corrections.
 4          She made two corrections?       Is that right?     I have got a
 5          copy of the original statement here .
 6    A     Yes.
 7    Q     How did that come about?       Did you ask her to initial those
 8          afterwards?
 9    A     Yes, that would have been done afterwards.
10    Q     And what about the caution at the head of the statement?
11    A     As with any witness,   I would ask her to read it and make
(12         sure that she understood.       She said she did     as a Special
13          Constable, and then she was invited to sign          it.
14    Q     Did you have any problems with the parents at all?
15    A     None whatsoever.    That is why I am surprised,        to be
16          honest.
17    MR.   BONE:     They were there?
18    A     I can certainly remember her mother being there.           I don't
19          remember her father being there.
20    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Not in the same room?
21    A     No, they weren't in the same room.
22    MR.   BONE:     Did you go to the house on any other occasions?
23    A     No.     I can remember that I couldn't find the house when I
24          went on this occasion.       That is how I am so     sure that     I
25          had not been previously.       I certainly never     went back
26          again.    I went on one occasion, and one occasion         onl^.
27    LORD JUSTICE    STUART-SMITH:      And so far as you know, no male
28          police officers have been.
29    A     I am sorry?
30    Q     No male   police officers have been     to see her so far as you
31          know?
32    A     I think a number of officers went to see her.
33    Q     In the initial stages.
34    A     Yes, and she would have been asked,       I think -    she would
35          have been shown photographs.        I did not do that,     and I
3 6         have got a feeling that it may have been another

 1        policewoman.         Whether that was before or after I went,            I
 2        d o n 't k n o w .
 3    Q   That would be in the ordinary course of trying             to trace
 4        people through and so on?
 5    A   Absolutely.
 6    Q   So you telephoned her at home, did you, to fix             up this
 7        appointment?
 8    A   I honestly don't know.         I certainly haven't got any
 9        recollection of phoning her at work, and I certainly did
10        not phone on numerous occasions.           I phoned with    the
11        intention of making an appointment to see her.              To the
12        best of my recollection,        I made on telephone call       and we
13        made an appointment that suited both of u s .
14    Q   You are now a Police Sergeant, is that right?
15    A   I was at that time.
16    Q   You were at that time.         What are you now?
17    A   Yes, a Sergeant, a Detective Sergeant.
18    Q   You are still a Sergeant, are you?
19    A   Yes.
20    Q   I don't know that we can really take this much             further.
21        Is there anything else you want to tell me?           Is there
22        anything else that occurs to you?
23    A   I would like to say that I am totally shocked at the
24        allegations that have         been made.    I dealt with a lot of
25        families through this         disaster, and to my knowledge this
26        is the only person that has made any allegation.              I don't
27        understand what she hopes to achieve by saying this.                 I
28        really am shocked at what she said.          I know how      important
29        it was to the families of the deceased to know what
30        happened to their family.         I am shocked.    I don't
31        understand why she has said what she said.           I mean,       if
32        there would have been some tension at the          house or we
33        hadn't got on, I perhaps could have          understood it, but,
34        you know, I couldn't have been treated nicer than              the way
35        that family treated me.        As I say, we had coffee,
3 6       biscuits.        I was there for several hours talking        it
37        through, and obviously the first thing I knew was              the

    Roger Cooke Report, and when I saw it I was just
     absolutely shocked.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   There we are.   Thank you very much
     indeed for coming to see m e .

          Mr Narey



          SPORTSGROUND SAFETY: TAYLOR RECOMMENDATIONS


          1.        Following the meeting on Friday 31 January called by the

          Minister to discuss the current high level of media interest in
          the Taylor recommendations on all-seater football grounds, and

          increasing pressure from some clubs to review Government policy
          to allow some standing and/or to extend the deadlines for all­
          seating, Ministers will wish to know the latest developments.



          LORD TAYLOR'S PRESENT VIEW


          2.        In response to an article in the 'Independent on Sunday1 on

          26 January (Annex A) in which it was said that LJ Taylor was

          understood to have changed his mind on all-seater stadia,                LJ

          Taylor himself wrote to the editor to confirm his original view.

          His letter was printed in the correspondence column of the paper

          on 2 February (Annex B) .       Had the letter not been printed we

          intended writing to LJ Taylor's clerk seeking confirmation that




£   ' d        I   ' ON                                 nBd/BitiaoioBdSNi SBOinaBS a a u
                                                                  --                       ^
         he still stood by his recommendations.                              This action is not now

         necessary.


         3.       However,     LJ Taylor's letter lends added support to the

         confirmation        given          by         the   Minister   at     Friday's             meeting             to

         robustly maintain Government policy on all-seated football stadia

         whenever and wherever necessary to keep the pressure on clubs,
         especially those in the current first and second divisions.


         DELAYS AND PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY CLUBS OBTAINING PLANNING

         PERMISSION TO IMPLEMENT TAYLOR RECOMMENDATIONS


         4.        Some clubs are anxious about the time it is taking to
         consider        planning              applications          for      ground            developments/

         redevelopments which may lead to their being unable to meet the

         Taylor deadlines.                   Such applications are a matter for local

         authorities .to whom                    the Department         of    the       Environment                 have

         published       guidance                advising       sympathetic           consideration                     to

         proposals aimed at all-seated accommodation.                                This guidance also
         recommends early consultation between clubs and authorities.



         5.        Southampton        FC       are one        such   club who           are       experiencing

         problems.       Their case has been taken up by Mr Christopher Chope

         MP with the Minister for Sport.                             Enclosed at Annex C is a

         proposed draft reply for the Minister for Sport to send.                                                   This
         mentions that the Chairman of the FLA is seeking a meeting with

         Mr Yeo, Minister of State at the DOE.

         PREMIER LEAGUE AND MEMBERS FUTURE ACCESS TO MONIES AVAILABLE

         THROUGH THE REDUCTION IN POOL BETTING DUTY



         6.      Although the formation of a Premier League seems likely to

         take place in time for the start of the 1992/93 season (August

         1992)    there are still some details to settle.                 The Football
         Association hope to obtain final agreement on outstanding issues

         (mainly the eventual size of the new league; the transitional

         arrangements and the period of transition) at the next FA Council
         meeting on 20 February.    This is a matter for the football world
         to sort out but an important side issue is Premier League clubs

         access to reduction in Pool Betting Duty (RPBD) monies.                       This is

         a matter for Government.


         7.      In presenting the 'Blueprint for the future of Football*

         last year, the FA were widely optimistic about the additional

         revenue likely to accrue to football by reorganising the sport
         (business) to have the Premier League under direct FA management.

         However, while the FA are either unable or unwilling to give a

         realistic account of likely future income, how or whether it will

         be distributed to the smaller       (non-Premier League)                   clubs           to
         assist with the cost of implementing the Taylor recommendations,

         there is a strong suspicion that the PL clubs will retain the

         lion's share for themselves.    This raises the question of whether

         they should continue to have access to RPBD money


         8.      At present it has been agreed that grants will be paid to

         current FL first division clubs (who by and large will; form the

         new PL) for Taylor works completed or uukmiLantlally<comi.                            d by

distribution of available income.                                    The Minister for Sport may

                         the    Football               Licensing      Authority           which            have         been
                         awaiting settlement with the Treasury of the amount to

                         be recovered by means of the licence fee;

You wrote to the Secretary of State on 6 January enclosing
correspondence from Paul Weston, Acting Director of the
Hillsborough Community Development Trust regarding a bid by the
National Federation of Stadium Committees (NFSC) for support from
the Special Grants Programme (SGP).      I am replying as I am
responsible for this particular Programme.

I should explain that the SGP is always heavily oversubscribed
and 1992-93 is no exception. A number of difficult choices had
to be made between different schemes, each worthy in its own way.
In the case of the bid by the NFSC I am not persuaded that a
sufficiently strong case has been made for funding.

I can appreciate the feelings of the local community about match
days and about the potential ground relocation issues arising
from the Taylor Report. However, there will be an opportunity
for the interests and views of residents affected by any changes
to be taken account as part of the normal planning process.

I am copying this letter to Robert Atkins and Lord Ferrers in
view of their direct interest in the Taylor Report.

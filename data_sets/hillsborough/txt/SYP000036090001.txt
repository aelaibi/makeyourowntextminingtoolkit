Chief Constable P. Wright ,
South Yorkshire Police Force .
                                        Tuesday 18th. April 1989-
Dear   Ilr. Wright ,




          At approx. 23:00 hrs. Sunday ( 16th.   - last )I was telep­
honed by a reporter of the "Evening Standard"    (London )newspaper
, regarding the previous days Hillsborough tragedy .
I was asked  , (quote) "In view of the Police's obvious inefficiency
and disorganisation" , to give details of previous occasions when
your force had failed to control crowds at the ground.
This I could honestly not do , and replied to the contrary that you
had experience handling many such games efficiently in the past ,
for which regretfully you would not be remembered . He was totally
unaware of such games ever taking place , and to say he was
surprised would be an understatement .

           For the little it is worth , please hear me when I offer
 my sympathy , over the disgusting way in which your colleagues and
 your^eTF-T ^ e r e found guilty by the media , less than 24 hours after
 the tragic events .
           I made an effort to point out to the journalist concerned
 the geographical reasons behind the allocation of tickets for the
 ground , as very few other reporters appeared to have any idea .
 Whilst of course requesting him to offer our clubs' sympathy to the
 London branch of the Liverpool Supporters club on the loss of some
 of their members , I did indicate to him that there were perhaps
 other areas he could look at , for not unconnected events .
            I make no comment on the human behaviour factor , your
 Officers are in a better position than me to comment on it , but I
 feel obliged to draw your attention to the enclosed photocopy , page
 26 from the previous weeks programme from the Liverpool - Wednesday
•game at Anfield , where there, is notice of the club's official
 coaches departing from Anfield at 11:30 a.m. for the Semi Final at
 Hillsborough . A departure at that time maybe adequate for a normal
 league fixture , but I would say it was cutting it fine for a major
 cup game , when so many more fans were travelling , and Liverpool
 F.C. were requesting there fans to be in the ground by 2 pm .
            Perhaps this information will be relevant to the
 forthcoming enquiry , when maybe some of the blame maybe shared
 around . I wish you luck .

                                        Yours Sincerely ,

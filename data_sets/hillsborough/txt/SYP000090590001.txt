               1 am a single man and             reside at the above address with my mother.

               I am a Liverpool          Football        Supporter,            not a season ticket        holder and

               at te nd m os t ly home games.             I o bt ained a ticket              for the semi    final

               m a t ch between Liverpool            and Notts Forest w hich was                  to be played at

               Hi 1 Is bnrmiiih. S he f fi e ld on Saturday,                   15th April     19S9 from my brother

                                             It cost £6 and was                for the Leppings Lane        terrace.



               On the morning          of the m atch          I went        to my brother's       house

                                and   I went   to the m atch                in a car driven by                         I do

               not know his address,            also      in the            car was my brother                   and




                     think we    left my b r o t h e r “s house at                11am and stopped at a Service

St a ti o n on the way to Sheffield.               On the outskirts              of S he f fi e ld    the

Police were      stopping      coaches and this            caused some delay and we arri ve d

in She ff ie ld at about        half        past one.



We stopped at a pub          in Sheffield,         it     was called the         " Saiution          Inn" for

a drink we also       called at this            pub last year.            We    left this       pub at

about 2.15pm and drove             towards      the ground.         We    parked the       car    in a

side    street about       five minutes walk             from the ground.



Because    I was    in the same are a of the ground as                     last year       I knew where

to go.     We wa lk ed along Leppings Lane                 towards       the ground,      the        four of

us were    still    together.        On      reaching     the Leppings Lane turnstiles

there was a mass of          people ail         trying     to get    into the ground.                We

jo in ed the     crowd and tried to make             our way towards the turnstiles.

At this    stage    because     of the        crowd and the        pushing       I lost    contact

wit h the other three          people.         I was^j^t     very happy and was getting

crushed.       I saw a couple        of m ou nt ed Police          in with the          crowd trying

to sort the       people    out,    but because there was no                   proper    queues

there w a s n ’t muc h they        could do at this          stage.



I vyas in the      crowd outside          the t urnstiles         for about a quarter             of an

  yr during w hich time            I was      pushed about.         I then saw a gate at the

fide    of the   turnstile      open and the         crowd started to surge                through

  was    pushed towards        the open gate and entered the ground.                            I did

not hand my ticket          to anyone,         I did not see anyone              to take the

ticket,    Police    or S t e w a r d s .



I did not see my brother and his mates,                      I had t r a / e 1 led to the

match with.        I saw    people     going     into a tunnel           wKi ch was      in front

of me so    I just    followed them.             Whe n    I got    into    the tunnel       I could see
                                                                                                P AGfc.
                                                                                                S3485

the    pitch a n d t h e g a m e h a d k i c k ed a f f „



I was    pushed along          the tunnel      by the    crowd    it was    very tight and

I could not turn an d go back because                    of the    crowd.     I felt     very

u nc om fo rt ab le    because      of the    crush.     When    I came out of the

tunnel     into the terrace           I came up against a fence and a mass

of /people*      the terrace was          packed wit h      people and more were

 oming     in down the tunnel,               I went    slightly    to the    right     into

pen 3 but was          crushed up against         the    centre    fence,    I could not

move    either way.           My arm was against         the fence and       c o u l d n ’t move

it,    I could breath but was             scared.



At this     time      I think      the game was still          going on.     I saw that

fans were being             pulled up    into the West S tand at the            rear    of the

Le ppings Lane         terrace.       I pulled myself          up into the    centre     fence

 nd then someone             in the stand grabbed my arm a nd pulled me up

into the s t a n d .



On looking towards             the front      of the terrace       I could see

people     climbing         over   the fence    into the       pitch and the     players

were    leaving       the    pitch.     1 could see      people at the front           of the

terrace who were             crushed,   and saw       people    lying on the     pitch

being treated and some a p p e ar e d to be dead.



There were       people       still   being    pulled up into       the stand but

because     of the      crowd there was         no way      I could get down to

help on the terrace.                I saw some fans kicking and             ripping at

the fence a r ou n d the           pitch trying       to get at    people who were

trapped     inside.          When the Police      realised what       had happened

they also started             ripping at the fence,            I think at first
                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                             83483

they thought       it was a pitch          invasion.       I saw    people    getting-

pulled onto       the    pitch and then the Fire -Service came.                   I

don't    remember       seeing an a mb ul an ce     on the       pitch just St Johns

memb er s    helping     people.     I could see a lot of dead and

injured      people on the      pitch.



I saw the Police          carry a girl age d about 20yrs              up the

tunnel      u nderneath us,     she a pp ea re d to be dead.              I really

remember what       she    looked    like or what       she was wearing.



I stayed      in the stand until          the    crowd had       cleared from the

terrace and       then    I climbed down into the terrace.                   I w an de r ed around

looking for my brother and his mates,                   but      could not

find them.        There were       people    on the     pitch but the dead and

injured had been          cleared.        I went onto      the    pitch    looking

for my brother and his mates,                but still      could not find them.

1 was worr ie d     if they were safe.             I w an de r ed around the          pitchin a

daze.    1 remember       hearing Kenny D a l gl i sh on the tannoy an d shortly

after    this    1 left the ground,          wa lk ed out through the

tunnel and       into Leppings Lane.            I cannot    remember seeing any

dead or injured          in this area just         crowds     of people      looking

around.



Outside      the qround      I saw                      and he told me

that my brother          had gone to       look for me.          I stayed there

with            and after about       ten minutes                    , my brother,

came    back.     I was    relieved that        everyone was alright



We made      our way to our        car,    I was   still    not    really fully

aware    of what    had happened.           Some on e   in a private house
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     33485

let us use       the telephone      to    ring home    to    let them know

we were alright.         After   this we made         our way home

arriving at about        seven or eight          oclock.



I think    that    if the kick off         had been    put back       for a

few minutes       it w ou ld have    prevented       people    rushing    to get

in a n d not miss anything.              This   I think w ould have

prevented the       crush because         people w ould have known

they would get       in and not miss anything.



I think    there    should have      been more Police          outside the

ground organising        the queues        before    letting    the    people

build up so near       the   turnstiles.



I do not think anyone         the Police,         Stewards     or the Club

were    geared up to     cope with a s ituation             like the one      that

occurred.



I was    not    injured but my shirt was            ripped,    I was wearing

a light            shirt with buttons           down the front,        long

sleeves,       blue jeans and white trainers.                1 was not

wear in g a hat or scarf.

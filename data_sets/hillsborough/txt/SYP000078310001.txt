           At 8am    (0800^ Saturday 15 April              1989 (150489)   I commenced duty at

           Mexbo rough P.S.Nwhere upon I was transported to Doncaster P.S. and
                                                                                      N7/S<r
           there I joined Se r ilHi 33 under the supervision of Sgt. 2228 ATKIN.



           At 10am (1000)       I was atN < i 11sborough Football Ground together with my

           serial where we were briefedSi4garding the F.A. Cup semi-final between

           Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.



           Shortly beforV^commencing patrol we were agaTTv^briefsd by our Serial

           ComrtNijfcder I n s p e c t ^ MILLET.     At 11.15am I commence X patrol      in company
                            N 7 I3 H
           with PC 2576 McEWEN4, we were on a static point betweeh, the Travellers,

           Rest    public house and Wadsley Bridge upon Penistone Rd Khort h where a

           large number of the Liverpool supporters were expected.
                                                                      PAGE       2
                                                                      S2257



At this time there were a few Liverpool      fans walking around,   some

heading    in the direction of the ground and some in the totally

opposite direction.    In general    the fans were in good spirits,

however,   many of them approached me with only one question as to the

location of the nearest public house.      On informing them that they

would be some distance away I was asked how they could catch a Taxi to

one.



As the kick off drew nearer the numbers on the street grew rapidly yet

the flow of the fans were still toward and from the ground.         There

were quite a number of fans    carrying openly packs of lager and beer

some even had bottles of cider and sherry in their hands.       I could see

by fHeir demeanour that a lot of these fans were      "very merry'.



At approximate^    2.30pm (1430)    coaches began stopping on Penistone Rd

North and the supporters attempted to alight.       I prevented about six

coaches from doing this as per my instructions and my actions         received

hostility from the fans on board as they thought this action would

make them late for the kick off.



There was now a strong flow of fans toward the ground and I could see

a number of ticket touts selling tickets as they were walking along.

The pace of the crowd increased as the minutes ticked by and some of

them were actualSLj( running to the ground.



 I then grouped with my serlhal and we headed in the direction of the
i
•ground.  As we drew level witlTt^e Gate P.H. a little way down

Penistone Rd there were a number of cJTficers outside and I was

informed there had been some trouble inside the pub.       We ascertained
                                                                              PAGE    3
                                                                              S2257

that it was now under co ntr ol .



We then proceeded to the ground, at this time I was unaware of the

reason.     As I arrived outside the Leppings Ln turnstiles there were a

number of other officers sjready present and about 4 mounted

officers-     There were a smallN^umber of Liverpool          fans outside.

I particularly remember one fan making a nuisance by continually going

up to the turnstiles and attempting toSgain entry.              At this time it

 speared that jio one was 1&«4jng allowed into the ground.           The youth was

 coirfcsi nual ly requested to move lix^iy.   A mounted officer approached the

youth ami t\he officer told him to moV* back.             The youth somehow got

under the horses belly and this ijtade theNqoNfse rear up and its hoofs

landed upon the youths     leg,



We then formeii. a cordon but I was still unaware why.        Then suddenly I
                T----------
saw a number of Liverpool fans a p p ^ M ^ f r o m behind the turnstiles

carrying some apparently unconscious          persSKjs.    I immediately thought a

fi^t   must be taking place.       Someone then shou^Ud that we should go

into tmK.aro und . Toqether with other officers I weiH^ into the area
                                                 ----
behind the t~b<nstiles and was confronted by people lying prostrate all

over the ground,     they were obviously suffering from being crushed.



I went towards the tunnel entrance and a young girl             came out and

collapsed in front of me.         I stopped and took hold of her,         she was

gasping for air, as I comforted her she calmed and began breathing

easier.     I carried her to wh^Rfi the ambulances were gathering,            as I

did she kept muttering "HAVE LIVERPfo&L W O N " .         I could smell

intoxicants on her breath.         I then left i W   with some medical staff

and returned to the tunnel entrance where I foliated a cordon with a

couple of other officers,      not of my serial,     to prevent fans re­
                                                                                 PAGE    4
                                                                                 S2257

         entering the terrace area.



         I seemed to do this for a long time and throughout I was confronted by

         angry and disturbed Liverpool fans attempting to break the cordon.

         They were screaming and shouting at us and some fought violently

         against us to gain access.     Some were genuinely trying to look for

         their relatives and friends but there were also a number just wanting

         to see the match,   totally ignoring what was happening around them, and

         some just taking advantage of it.



         I still had no information as to '\JHqat had happened,   but eventually the

         crowd got the message that the game had been cancelled and the

         pressure we were under relented.



         Gradually most of theN^rowd dispersed and I then regrouped with my

         serial outside the groundV    After a few minutes    I returned to the

         North Stand where we were debriefed.



         Eventually I ret i r ecK f r om duty at 8pm (2QQQ) at Mexborough P.S.

 entries      into the         city.

 During     the    course       of the afternoon,              several         s upporters a s k e d myself

 producing        to me a b rown ticket.

 At this      I directed          the    g e n t l e m a n towa r d s   the L e p pings Lane        entrance.

 At w h i c h he said          " I ’rri s u p p o r t i n g Forest,     t h a t ’s the Liv e r p o o l    end".

 I a p o l o g i s e d an d e x p l a i n e d that that was             the only entra n c e        he would

 get    in w i t h a brown ticket.                 It t r a n s p i r e d    that this m a n    had      in fact

ground.           It became an             impossible and m e a n i n g l e s s              task         to speak to all

groups as           there were           too m any w a l k i n g         past.

The    time by now was a r o u n d 2 . 1 5 p m                    (1415)       and    people were            saying

"Is this          the L i v e r p o o l      end" w a l k i n g       towards        the S p i o n Kop.            After

advising          them       "No    it w a s n ' t "     they were        saying        "Well     the       coppers       up

there       (meaning L e p p i n g s           Lane)       have sent us down here".                         This    problem

arises       from o f f i c e r s        not having a list of the                       colour        codes m e n t i o n e d

earlier          for d i f f e r e n t areas           of the ground.                By 2 . 3 0 p m       (1430)    the        list

of the       colours          had become            invaluable         due to the amount                   of su pporters

ask i n g    directions.

By 2.45pm           (1445)         s u p p o r t e r s were     b e c oming     frantic        to get        into the

ground,          ask i n g    to be able            to get t h r o u g h the barriers                     to the Leppings

Lane    end.         T hese were all Liv e r p o o l                  s u p p o r t e r s and all          were    drunk and

most were           carrying          cans    of      intoxicants.

drink was           very m u c h        in abundance,            and due to the sheer                      number    of

supporters            carrying          cans,       a c t i o n that w o u l d have been t aken elsewhere

was    not       possible.

having       chance        to eat a mouthful,                a Sergeant           shouted       "We've all        to go

back     to the ground,              there's         trouble        brewing".

I ran out of              the    garage       to see PC Doug Collins,                     A D i v i s i o n G ypsy

L i a i s o n O f f icer,        diving       onto    the    f o recourt         of C l a y w h e e l s Lane    garage,

I op e n e d the          side    door       of the transit            van and we were all               conveyed

down to L e p p i n g s Lane.

U p o n arrival           there    I saw a large am o u n t               of s upporters           inside the

L e p p i n g s Lane       e x t erior       gates,      At this        point       I knew not        if the

internal           gate    had been opened,                 I o b s e r v e d a fan being           t r a m p l e d under

foot by a police                 horse and then             I made my            way towards       the West       stand,

I ran t h r o u g h the           tunnel       to the ter r a c i n g            and as    I went     t h r o u g h the

tunnel       I was a w a r e       of    people       in obvious          distress,          sitting     down     in the

tunnel.            As    I reached the terrac ing                   I veered        right     into Pe n 3.           There

                  I went        to the / r o n t       of the       pen and     t h r o u g h the gate onto           the       pitch

                  out a girl a p p r o x i m a t e l y         18-SO years,            slim build,        wearing       jeans and a

                  wa s    not blueing and a p p e a r e d u n c o n s c i o u s              not dead.

                  The girl was              laid on the        grass and        I then gave m o u t h to m o u t h

                  thi/ assisted             supporters         to    climb t h r o u g h the fencing.

                  T^b4re were a p p a r e n t l y         10 more       bodies        inside    the    pen,    and then my

                  Attentions were             then d i v e r t e d to        removing        the bodies        from the           pitch

                  I took down an a d v e r t i s i n g              board from beside            the goals,          ki c k e d off

the man.          I then      ran back across               the    pitch and en route           I pulled a

hoard i n g      from the      front      of the N o r t h s t a n d and            ran back towards             the

W est   stand w h e r e       the girl who           I had tried            to    revive was    placed on the

hoarding and            c a r r i e d ^ a c k towards the gymnasium.

P o l i c e Sgt.      C h i d d e y took charge of the female d e l e g a t i n g an officer

to stay w ith the             body.

I returned to the               pitch to find a              cordon had been set up acr o s s                    the

halfway       line.        I there        spoke      to PC E 4 9 9 S e r h a t l i c a n d other       A

D i v i s i o n officers.

At   one    point       one s u p p o r t e r was     hell        bent   on causing        trouble and kept

trying      to    provoke an officer                on the        cordon.        Friends    of his were

trying to         calm him down.              An u n k n o w n     Inspector        came to my s e l f a n d PC

1741 S o w e r b y a n d said words                to the effect            "If he continues w i t h this

I want you to q u i e t l y arrest                  him an d take him away".                  This was          the

first      piece of        instruction         I had bee n g i v e n since             entering      the ground.

A scuffle         broke      out   in the      lower N o r t h stand and P o l i c e m e n who were

in the      cordon       i n s t i n c t i v e l y went    to break up the scuffle.                  I then

s h o u t e d at a g e n u i n e l y      u n k n o w n S e r g e a n t "To hold the line".                He

a p p e a r e d to    look at me          in a m a z e m e n t an d then said                 "Oh      yeh". He then

held the         cordon an d the s i t u a t i o n was              calmed.

After      some      considerable        time      the cully communi cat ion^i-ecei ved was                       that

to keep tickets an d they wou 1 d /be h o n o u r e d . N_(-^ 6 ople were a p p r o a c h i n g

me saying         they had a full             ti    :et,     stub an d ticket,          w h i c h had not been

checked,         four    separate       people a p p r o a c h e d me and showed me these

tickets.

A f t e r a while an d the w hole s i t u a t i o n was                     beginning      to sink     in and          I

became     obl i v i o u s    of friends and              colle a g u e s   talking     to me.       The fans

had d i s p e r s e d a n d    I w a l k e d from the gr o u n d and down L e p p i n g s Lane,

right    down Vere Road.                I w a l k e d down the           centre of the         road,    along

             the white          line a n d - p e o p l e were as k i n g me       to go     into the house and

             have a tea/coffee.                 I a c k n o w l e d g e d them but decli n e d as         I was

             e m o t i o n a l l y and    p h y s i c a l l y shattered.     I turned        left onto Pen i s t o n e

             R o a d N o r t h and w a l k e d     back towards my original                 point,   as    I walked      I

             was w a t c h i n g    the    floor and was a g a i n t o t a l l y oblivious              of my

             surroundings.               I looked up to see P C ’s Jow i t t and M u s k o n the

             Fielding Road           junction.

             PC Jowitt w a l k e d         in front      of me and d e l i b e r a t e l y s t o p p e d me      passing

             an d q u e s t i o n e d my welfare.             I was   e m o t i o n a l l y upset and     this was

             o b v i o u s l y a p p arent.      He kept as k i n g me and then a lady who                      I now know

             as                                                                  Sheffield        took me        into her

             h ouse and made me a cup of tea.

             She a l l o w e d me to         phone my wife an d           this     I did but was        unab le     to

             phone friends*              wifes who      I had seen were           safe.

             F r o m then to the s u b s e q u e n t          de-briefing        break at C l a y w h e e l s    Lane and

             j o u r n e y home     I was     in a w o r l d of my own.

             I saw no ac t i v e          involv e m e n t    of the s t e wards      so,    could not      truth f u l l y

             comment       on their actions.

             1' d i d n ’t p e r s o n a l l y have a radio so            I again      cannot     comment       on break

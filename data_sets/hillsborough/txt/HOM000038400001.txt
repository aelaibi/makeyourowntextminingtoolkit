                                 AFFIDAVIT


I, Roger Houldsworth, of                                                   MAKE
OATH and say as follows:

      I amM years
            S '* *old
                    ' and hold an H N p qualification as an Electronics Engineer.

2    Save as herein stated all facts and matters deposed to hereafter are within my
      own knowledge, information and belief.

3    At the time of the Hillsborough disaster on 15th April 1989,1 was engaged on a
     contract basis by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as a video technician. As
     such I have a detailed knowledge of the workings of the closed circuit
     television systems (“the systems”) in operation at the club. In particular, I was
     on duty on the day of the disaster itself and was charged with the responsibility
     of ensuring that the systems were fully functional and working properly.

4    In the immediate aftermath of the disaster I made a comprehensive statement
      detailing the scope and extent of the systems and the remedial works I had
      carried out immediately prior to the disaster to ensure that the systems were in
      full working order. My statement also described the circumstances in which 2
      video tapes went missing on the night of the disaster. There is exhibited hereto
      and marked “GH1” a copy of that statement.

5    Having made my statement I was under the impression that the contents thereof
     would be considered by the Taylor Inquiry and by the Coroner at the Inquests
     of the victims held between 19 November 1990 and 28 March 1991. I was not
     called as a witness to either Inquiry.

6    I have recently read extracts of the actual evidence submitted to both Inquiries
      in relation to the systems. I feel compelled to rebut that evidence. There is
      exhibited hereto and marked “GH2” extracts of the said evidence and my
      rebuttals thereof.
7    I am anxious to ensure, and the public interest requires, that all the evidence
     relating to the systems and the quality of the visual material available to the
      South Yorkshire Police as the disaster unfolded, is the subject of further
      scrutiny.

Sworn this 25th day of November 1996.

   I.      ROGER         HOULDSWORTH         of

                     WILL STATE



  I      am 42 years old and up to the week commencing 10th April                                   I

  was       employed           as     Technical     Director    by       M.W.       (Technology)

  Limited           of       Sheffield.       I had been employed in that                  capacity

  for       some         2    years until I resigned my position.                    I     hold    an

^^H.N.C.           qualification            as an Electronics Engineer.                  Prior     to

  working           with       M.W.     (Technology)     Limited         I    had     previously

  worked           for       more     than 10 years abroad,         in       the     electronics

  field



  When I returned from working abroad, in 1986, I was approached

  by      the then Company Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football
                                                     t
  Club,           Dick       Chester,       who asked me to assist in               relation       to

  certain           problems          the    Club   were having      with          their       closed

 ^ircuit           television           systems     (CCTV).    I understand              the     CCTV

  system          then installed had been put in place by Philips Alarms

  in      about          1984 but that Company had subsequently gone out                           of

  business.



  I     did look at the system at Mr. Chester's request and as then

  designed and installed it was not working properly.




                                               It
                                               - 2 -



Shortly           afterwards       I    joined M.W.       (Technology)         Limited       and

whilst        their          employee   I    completed my         examination          of    the

existing           system and re-designed it to improve the system                           and

also        the     computer system related to it.                    I also     re-designed

the     CCTV        system       which had been installed by               the    Club       for

Police        use - this being a separate system from that                         operated

by the Club for its own purposes.



^he Cl u b S y s t e m

This        consisted of a number of static T.V. cameras situated at

strategic               points    around the     ground.         As     aresult    of       my

examining           the       system I arranged for some additional                    cameras

to     be     installed to enhance it, particularly when                         the     Spion

Kop part of the ground was re-opened in 1986.



Being        a static system the cameras                  are in a fixed position and

focus         on         a    particular fixed       area.        They were        in       fact

positionedat                 strategic -points       to           view    the     turnstile

entrances,               and there wasalso a camera covering the                   players'

entrance.               Within the CCTV room, situated in the south                      stand

near        the     players' entrance, there is a bank                   of     20 monitors

plus        a monitor for the computer system.                    This computer system

records           the    number of spectators             who come through the turn­

stiles            for    each     separate    area         of   the ground.       Of         the

20 monitors             within the control room,            19 display the scene              as

depicted           in the Club's static system.                 The remaining          monitor

is connected to the Police CCTV system.
                                   ——

                                                          - 3 -



Each - of the monitors connected to the Club system is in                                                 turn

connected                 to        a VCR so that we have the facility to tape                             the

film        shown              on    those       monitors, on a           video    tape.           "of     the

19 static                 cameras however 1 was not in commission at the time

because           a wall had been constructed after the camera had been

installed,                  which          obstructed        that    camera's       view           of      the

relevant              turnstiles.                The turnstiles in question were                         those   j

j^umbered             9-16            which      will     be referred to           later           in    this

Statement.


   s'
The Police system

This         consisted                of     5    fully      functional         remote     controlled

cameras           - i.e. those cameras could pan tilt through 3 60°, and

zoom        on        a     16/160 lens.           They are c o n t r o ^ e d from             a    Police

control           box          which        is fixed in position at               tfre    south          west

corner           of        the       ground, adjacent to the western                     end       of     the

south            stand.               The    cameras         for    the    Police        system           are

positioned as follows:-



        1        on        the       upper south west corner               of     the     west

        stand;



        2        are       positioned on the top of the south                           stand,

        1 at              about its centre point and the other to                          the

        eastern end of the stand at the top;



        1 at the top (rear) of the roof of the Spion Kop;


                                                        74
             1     at the south west corner of the ground, mounted

             on     high           near             the score board and close                    to    the

             Police control box.
         s




  Within the Police control box there are 7 T.V. monitors.                                                         5 of

  them        are dedicated,                        1 to each of the CCTV cameras.                         The other

  2          are     connected to special time lapse Video                                        Recorders,          and

^ o u        can     switch from camera to camera by means of                                          a     passive

  switch           within the control room so that the Officer in                                             Charge

  can        record        the                   scene          being displayed on any           1     of     the     5

  cameras.               The              remaining                    2    monitors are used    so        that     the

  at     any       given time.                       P.C. Trevor Bishop was the                   Officer           who

  worked           the     CCTV system for the Police but it was                                       not        usual

  for     him to be alone in the control room - thei;e might perhaps

  be     3 or 4 other Officers in there with him at any given                                                      time

^ o r     their own reasons - e.g. to watch a section of the                                                      crowd

  from an elevated position.



  Within           the Police control box there is also a telephone                                                land

- line       which         is             part of Sheffield Wednesday                        F.C.'s         internal

  telephone              system,                  and          the Police have           their   own        separate

  telephone land lines installed also.



  The events of Saturday,                                15th April,              1989

  Although               I had previously resigned my position as                                       Technical

  Director           of M.W.                      (Technology) Limited I was asked by                        Graham

  Mackrell           to attend                       at              the ground on that day       in        case     my

                                                                                                           A * * # '

    assistance was required.                    We knew that the F.A. Cup semi-final

    between        Liverpool           F.C.     and     Nottingham Forest      F.C.        was     a

    sell-out           all ticket match and I arrived at the ground                        fairly

    earl^         on     the Saturday morning to check that everything                           was

    in     order.        I was in fact asked to rectify a fault on 1 of                          the

    Police        CCTV        cameras, the one at the south west               corner           near   y*.

    the     score        board.        I checked it,found it was not           functioning

    properly           and     I     made the necessary adjustments to               the        iris

^^Qtf«r6Ts^^*ithin the camera and thereafter checked that it was
y    '                   \
/ working          OK. 1 Late           in the morning I then went          to       the        CCTV

    co7fErol~~room where P.C. Harold Guest was also in                           attendance,

    as     usual.        In     addition        there    was present   Doug      Lock,           the

    Security           Officer for Sheffield Wednesday F.C. and

    of     M.W.        (Technology).           P.C. Guest, as a matter         of     routine,

    would     have           ensured early in the morning that cassette                        tapes

    were     inserted           in     the     19 VCRs - 1 of course ‘ would              not     be

    recording           a picture because the camera was out of action                           but

^^.C.        Guest           would     nevertheless routinely load all               19.         The

    authorised           crowd       capacity       figures for each section              of     the

    ground        was        part of the data stored in the computer, and                        the

    display            monitor        for     the   computer   would    show        how         many

    spectators           came        through each of the turnstiles in               operation

    as     the day went on.                 The system was so designed that when the

    turnstiles           for a particular area had admitted 90% capacity to

    that     area, the total for that section would flash on the T.V.

    screen        and if, for example, one part of the ground was                              being

  supporters           to    a     different set of turnstiles.              Each    of     the

  turnstiles           was       also fitted with an infra-red ray sensor,                   so

  turnstile        number              through which the fans entered,            the "Gate

  I     was present in the CCTV control room from about 11.30                             a.m.

  that     morning          when the turnstiles were opened and                 spectators

  were     entering the ground.                The Spion Kop and the south                stand

^^had     been designated for Nottingham Forest supporters, and the

  north     stand       and west stand (including Leppings                      Lane)     were

  reserved       for        Liverpool supporters.            The authorised         capacity

  for the various sections of the ground was as follows:-



                       Spion Kop                             21,000

 By about 2.45 p.m. the Kop and the south stand areas were full

 of     Nottingham           Forest supporters but the north stand and              the

 west     stand areas were only about 2/3 full at that time and it

 was     noticeable             from the static camera covering the         Leppings
                                                                                          O mVv6v-A. /

 *r~    : ' ~                          “     1    ' ' * — —
 turnstiles in that area.  I produce [Exhibit 2 ] a plan of the

 ground     showing the Leppings Lane entrance to the west and the

^^urnstiles           (7     in    number)   which    admit   spectators     to     the

 terraced        area of the west stand are designated A/G.                 It     will

 be     seen that to the south of those turnstiles runs a concrete

 path     which leads around eventually to the south stand.                        That

 path     is bounded on the one side (the south) by the river                       Don

 and     on the north side by a high brick wall.                Situated in that

 wall     just        immediately       beyond the turnstiles - i.e.         to     the

 east     of them - was an exit gate designated Gate C which is                       a

 double     gate        of      the   concertina metal type     which      was     kept

 closed.         One       of     the static cameras of the CCTV        system      was

^^ituated        on     a post just east of that gate, the camera                 being

 positioned so as to show the area of the turnstiles A/G.



 It     was through the monitor showing the scene depicted by that

 camera     that it was possible to see the build-up of supporters

 outside     the turnstiles.             The Police had erected some barriers

 across     the        pathway a short distance east of Gate C              so     that

 spectators           could not walk along that pathway to get access to

 the south stand.               The build-up of Liverpool supporters outside

 the    Leppings Lane entrance was such that some had been forced


                                                     78
  beyond          the entrance to the turnstiles outside Gate C and some

  of those supporters were visible within the field of vision of

  the static camera.



  The       position           was such that I recall commenting,     at     perhaps

  2.50          p.m.,    "For God's sake why don't they delay the kick-off"

  and       I     made     that comment in the presence of     Doug        Lock        and

  P.C. Guest.              We    were all, as I recall, in general         agreement

^ ^ ha t        it would be sensible to postpone the kick-off to               enable

  people          to get into the ground, although I do not recall                 that

  anyone          in     the    CCTV control room attempted   to    contact            the

  Police          by radio or telephone to suggest that.           The Police           of

  course were monitoring the situation themselves from their own

  CCTV       system, and in particular using the camera on the                    south

  west      corner         of the west stand roof.     We could of course

  There         came      a time when Gate C appeared to be opened,            and          a

  number          of spectators rushed through into the "reservoir” area

  between          the     turnstiles and the rear of the west        stand.            An

  examination             of    the video recording appears to indicate            that

  this          occurred        when the Police opened the gate in an          effort

  to       eject one of the spectators that way, and a number of                       the

  fans      pressed through from the outside.            It would appear           that



                                                7.9                        s t / s *    ?       '

   several        hundred        got     through     before the ' gates             were        again

   closed.



   Subsequently           the     static        camera picked up the           fact        that     a

   number     of     fans        climbed up over the           structure           housing        the

   turnstiles,           and     jumped down into the reservoir area                       inside.

   That     is,     it     seems,        further     indication        of     the     pressures

   building        up outside the turnstiles although a steady flow                               of

^J^spectators        was coming through those turnstiles at all                             times,

   in the normal way.



  I     recall      that        after     the first influx        of        several        hundred

  spectators         through Gate C Doug Lock left the CCTV room to                               go

  outside          presumably            to     report   the   matter         to     the        Club

  Secretary,         Graham Mackrell, and/or to check the position                               for

  himself on the ground.



^^Some     time later, I am unsure of the exact time,                              I heard over

  the     Police      radio        (we        had one in the CCTV           room)     a     Senior

  Police     Officer           make a request that a gate be opened                        at    the

  Leppings         Lane    entrance.           Police control asked which gate                    he

  wished      opened       and he repeated his request 2 or 3 times.                              On

  about      the     fourth occasion he said "Someone is going                             to    die

  here.     Open      the gate" and Police control replied "If                             someone

  is going to die open the gate, open the gate".

     As     appears           from the video tape recording the scene the                 gate

     was     then        opened apparently by a uniformed P.C., and                  a    huge

     number of fans flooded into the area.



     At     that        point in time I realised,            from the    numbers     already 11

     for     that reason.             The perimeter fencing at that point is high

     and     not        easy    to climb over.       I sat down in the        stand       area

     behind        the     dug-out, and watched the situation for               a     little

     time     -     perhaps 2 or 3 minutes before I realised what                     really

    was       occurring.                One    of the   Sheffield       Wednesday     ground

     staff     came down           the tunnel holding 2 stretchers and I grabbed

     one     from him and ran across with it to help ferry the injured

    people         to    the       gymnasium area where the first-aid           room          was

     situated.            It    was    in fact only after I had ferried 3                or     4

    injured         people         in that way that I then realised           that       there

    were      many people who had died as a result, and the gym was in

     fact designated as a temporary mortuary.



    After      helping          on    the     pitch as much as     possible     at       about

    4.15/4.30           p.m. I went back to the CCTV room where

    and      P.C. Guest were present, and I had a cup of coffee and                             a

  from the computer monitor, and ejected the tapes from the VCRs

  leaving them in the machines in the ejected position so that I

 could         later     know       exactly     which        tape    related      to           which

Sworn this 25th day of November 1996 before ..—     ^          ——»-
Comments bv Roger Holdsworth on the camera eviaenca.

 I went to the club at about 8.00 am because I'd been asked by Graham
Mackrell to give the cameras a final check. We'd had a problem with the
camera on the scoreboard.
I switched on all the cameras at the police control box, and checked the
irises were working properly, monitors and VCRs were OK. It would
have taken about three quarters of an hour.’

The faulty' camera
'There had been a flaring problems with the camera on the scoreboard -
an electrical fault when the scoreboard came into use. It wasn't a
problem with the quality of the picture. I had been there all day the day
before to sort it out. On the day of the disaster itself I phase-locked the
camera, which cured the problem, and to save any more potential
problems, I disconnected the earth to the camera which suppressed the
electrical supply. By the time I had finished the check, everything was
working OK.

Graham Mackrell came and talked to me when I was up the ladder and I
said it was all working properly.
Mick Ryan also came in when I was checking them. I would have shown
Ryan and Goddard that they were working when I had finished.'

Evidence given by police re cameras:

Mick Ryan says in his evidence to Taylor p 52E re camera 5 'there was
an apparent fault on the camera to the West stand., the one that is
mounted on the electronic scoreboard'

He also specifically describes this camera at 53 E to say 'It is principally
directed towards the West stand terraces'.

He goes on on p53 A to say 'the picture was very distorted1. He says
that he contacted Roger Holdsworth himself about it, and Holdsworth
'was there working on it for some considerable time'.

He then says The picture was never satisfactory as far as I recall... It
was not as clear as you would hope the picture to be...It was the quality
of the picture which was the problem'.
 RH: The quality of the picture was never a premium - ana . tuaa che

 1)Camera 5 faulty                                                   - -
 In his evidence to the Taylor Inquiry (June 12th), P43 Trevor Bichard
 claims, like Mick Ryan, that there was a problem with the scoreboard
 camera which overlooked the terraces. He says that 'for a number of
 weeks we had been having difficulty with the camera, and they had
 been looking into having the camera replaced or improvements made.,
 when the system had been switched on, the picture would go white -
 you would lose what you could actually see., we seem to think it may be
 a problem with the electrical supply to the camera.
       On that particular day, it was not up to the mark, but it was a lot better        {k,I>a S ^ V it
       than it had been. We were getting pictures, that is the best way of              /■ ^ f f
       describing it’.

       At the Inquest, P80 . Bichard admits that camera 5 was trained on the
       Leppings lane end, but says that the camera 'had been faulty and in fact
       you saw some of the problems that occurred. You were getting what is
       called flare. It is reflection of light on coloured objects and you lose the
       picture. The camera was not being used as much as it normally would
       be because of the substandard picture.’
                                                 f         A.
       Inquest P89 B Bichard says that from 2.05 onwards there was only one
                                                                                    lb tN-5
       camera trained on Leppings Lane, which solicitor Mr Manning
                                                                                        f     Ht
       summarises as being 'a small screen and not a very easy picture to
       distinguish and differentiate'.

      At the Inquest, P93 A. Bichard again describes the camera as
      'inadequate1.

      RH: 'Bichard gives an accurate description of what the problem had
      been, but I disagree that 'it was not up to the mark'. As far as /               Cj    J-

^~s   2.)No close ups available with camera 5
      At the Inquest P92 D Bichard says that it is not possible to get whet he
      would call a 'close up’ view of the centre pens from any of the cameras.
      He is defining ’close up’ as no more than 6 or 7 heads and shoulders on
      the picture.

      Inquest p96D/E/F. Bichard agrees with the comment that it is not
      possible to zoom in so that one can clearly identify a given individual if
      one wishes to do so. He also denies that you can zoom in and see
      clearly facial features with the camera.

      RH 'With camera 5, you wouldn't get 6 heads at the far end of the
      ground, but you would get them in the central pens.
       It is possible to pick out facial features with the camera. [This is
      home out by the evidence of the families and lawyers who went to
      Hhe ground]. It would be more difficult to pick out facial features
       while events are happening, -but this is not the specific question that
      Bichard was asked.'

3). Camera 5 was not only faulty, it gave a distorted view of the
terraces

Bichard describes the close up that is available of the pens from this
particular camera (5). He says tc Taylor p43E.

'A close up is available to move into those centre two pens. However,
because of the position and the angle, it does give you a false                        ) t           o
impression about the crowd that is in there. It is quite low down and it is
                                                                                       CIA
set at 90 degrees to the pens rather than looking face o n ... The picture
it creates is a bit of an illusion about the crowd that is in there. You may
be looking at somebody who is stood in the far corner of pen 3, and it
may give you the impression that in fact he is stood at the far corner of
pen 4. It is because of the angle of the camera          The physical
position it is in is difficult to assess that the pens would be getting
overcrowded'.

RH: ’ This explanation does not make any sense at all. You cannot
get optica! effects with crowd density. Even looking at an angle
you've got reference points. You've got a perceptive depth which
would give you an indication o f density. / had focused each of the
lenses along the focal plane, so they were virtually in focus all of
the time. A CCTV camera doesn't auto-focus, would also disagree
that it was difficult to assess that the pens were getting
overcrowded from that camera'

4)Colour earner^ (camera 2} does not provide a very close picture
of the terraces \           J
Taylor P44 D Bichard says of the colour camera that although it 'does
provide a better angled view’ of the terraces 'it does not provide as
close a picture as the one mounted on LL itself.

Taylor P63 D. Bichard says that the zoom facility of the colour camera
was not good enough to see whether or not people were being crushed
                                                                                               /v“

Bichard admits that it enables you to see the fence , but not to get a         t/V**         a*.
close up of the people at the fence.                                            S'AAtsw ^
'We must define what you mean by a 'close up'. It is closer than it is
closer than in its extreme, yes, but it is not a close up of an individual.
You would probably only get 30 or 40 heads and shoulders at best on
this picture'.
At tiie Inquest, P77B Bichard says of the colour camera 'If you were to
take pictures of people below the camera in the uncovered seating
area, you would get identification because they are so close to the
camera, but once you get to the end of the South Stand area, Leppings
lane, the magnification available on that zoom was insufficient to create
identification'.
(He admits, however, at 77 F that it gave you a 'reasonable view' of pens
3 and 4).

RH: 'The colour camera had the same magnification as the camera
on the scoreboard. The magnification was reasonable (1:10). After
all, it was designed for identification purposes. This evidence is
contradictory and not altogether truthful, it depends where on
Leppings Lane you are talking about. The shots of the very far side
would obviously not be quite as detailed. But the camera was
designed to give a view of the Leppings Lane end. You could                           ft^              t^yti > kA.
ceitainly identify individuals with it, and distinguish their clothing. A
shot would give you S or 7 heads and shoulders, depending on the
crowd density'.       '

RH: 'That the camera had been replaced 6 months earlier, and was
so good that he could pick out a car number plate at the end of
Leppings Lane.

6}Why there is no video evidence from camera 2 before 3.00

At the Inquest 79C Bichard says 'when the colour camera came into
use, the tape had expired'. Bichard also says that the colour camera
was also trained on the Spion Kop, along with camera 3, and camera 2
was not retrained onto the terraces till after 3.00.


7) Why no video recording of the terraces before 3.00.                   Lr
Taylor P51 D. Bichard admits that there was a video going of the         hT
situation on the West terrace from about 2.30. [yet no pictures from this T           w <5                       /
camera were ever made available to the Inquiry or the Inquest],          J            ^
                                                                                  fU .1       c-vO /
At the inquest, p80D. Bichard can offer no explanation of why there is
no video material available of from camera 5 before 3.02. He admits
that it would have been recording before then


                                                                         5
Taylor P69 D Bichard claims that of the 2 VHS recordings that were
made, one expired just after 3.00 [this does not explain why there was
no evidence available from this tape before 3.00]. He says (Taylor p69
H) that it finished at 6 minutes past 3.

’The other tape, somewhere between 2.30 and 3.00, the actual function
of the tape, the mode of operation, altered inadvertently.. The
assumption is that when the radio repair man came into the control box,
Mr Ducfcenfield actually came and stood to my right had side, behind the
controls, and I would then move to the left hand corner and I have
caught the video with my knee - the actual operating button.

RH.Tfte buttons in the front of the machines are tiny. They don't
stick out. It is highly unlikely that he could have knocked it with his
knee. More importantly, it is actually impossible to flick a switch
and go into time lapse mode if, as Bichard claims at 69G, the
machine is already recording'.


8)'Pictures shown to jury at inquest greatly enhanced*
At the inquest P73 F. Bichard says that the video pictures shown to the
jury of Leppings Lane end of the ground were 'greatly enhanced’.
'What you must consider is that the screen we are looking at is only 12
inches..(the tapes shown to the jury) gave a false impression about the
accuracy of the picture you were seeing’. He agrees with the coroner
that the image seen by the jury is 'infinitely clearer".

RH: The screens in the control room were 14 inches, not 12. They
are 5 ft in front of the camera operator. The size of the screen is in
i elation to the position of the person watching it in the control
mom. You get the same information as you would do if you
showed the picWm_on a larger screen, as they do in the court. It is
irrelevant if the image xs blown up. It is simply not true that you get
more information on tfije screen if the picture is enlarged'

At the inquest p74D Bichard says that the pictures the court have seen
(which he initially claims that he did not recognise as his own) was
running on a time lapse system, and was not running at the same speed
as they would have seen it on the camera.
[From p80 A, we know that the pictures shown to the court were actually
taken from camera 5, the allegedly faulty camera, and showed the
Leppings lane terraces], .
RH: 'You only get the time and date imprinted on the recording if
things are recorded at normal speed.'


9) Camera 3 not trained on LL end                                     ^ ^
P77G Bichard says that Camera 3, the one with maximum zoom S           Odt™       8
facilities, wasn't trained onto the Leppings Lane end because there had
been an incident at the Kop end. He agrees on p78 A that the camera
remained on that location - then goes onto contradict himself at 78D by
saying that it was retrained onto the Leppings Lane end, but it was not
recorded.

At 78 B, Bichard says that this particular camera would not have been
good enough to enable identification of individuals at the front of
Leppings Lane terraces ’it would give you an overall picture only'.

RH: 'This camera was extremely powerful - and had magnification                         ^   ?
facilities of 1:500 It would have been able to give a very clear 11                   ^ _____
picture of the Leppings Lane terraces'.                          I

10) Why pictures from camera 3 did not become part of the
recording
At 78 D, Bichard says that the reason the pictures from Camera 3 when

The system operated whereby at_2.30 I should have replaced both             /             .
tapes. Because of what was happening on Leppings Lane end I didn’t                 °
replace those tapes, and eventually I think it ran out just after 3.00. The
camera was used, but it was not taping’.

RH 'It is very unusual for them to have needed to replace both tapes
at 2.30. It would suggest that they had been recording everything in
real time since 11.30 am .'

Chief Inspector McRobbie (observer in Control Box)                    ^       ^
The evidence on McRobbie to the Taylor Inquiry (p22C) is that he was
impressed by the zoom facilities of/the black and white camera which
was showing the scene on the terrace. It was used to pick out someone
directly underneath the control box who had dropped his trousers. He
says p26G 'the definition was quite reasonable1. ‘        1
This appears to be the same camera that Mick Ryan described as
'never satisfactory'.          /

                              /
McRobbie is directly contradicting the evidence of his colleagues.

                         /
McRobbie also contradicts his colleagues when he tells Lord Justice
Taylor’s Inquiry that you could see 'quite clearly' that ’pen 3 was full,
and 2.. had got space’ (p29B).

s a t i s f a c t i o n as o p p o s e d to any f a u l t

T hen   r e a l l y it w a s    just a case of

N o r m a l l y on a n o r m a l m a t c h as soon

as the t u r n s t i l e s       are o p e n e d we

would     start v i d e o i n g e v e r y one of

these monitors               t h a t you can see

here.       But on t h i s p a r t i c u l a r d a y we

didn't      start     straight        away because

these are o n l y g e n e r a l t h r e e hour

u ntil about q u a r t e r to t w e l v e w h e n

There wasn't mu c h activity between

          Video ftrideaca - Hillsborough Disaster

          I Trevor Hicks of
                                                       would make the
          following statement in connection with video material I have
          viewed ia recent weeks.


          Earlier in m y career I was Divisional Director of Chubb Alarms
          Ltd, a company which sold , installed and serviced security
          systems and hence have a reasonable working knowledge of
          closed-circuit television systems (CCTV)

      #
          a)     It ia m y firm belief that the material I viewed is
                 genuine footage r e c o r d e d b y the South Yorkshire Police

                 cvideo system and that the time and date codes on that
                    .......       ^
                  footage are correct.


          b)     I am content that the video material proves four key
                 pointsi -


                 1)      The crucial camera (scoreboard/Camera S) was working        s'
                                                                                    >/
                         from 1200hrs through till 1722hrs at least.


                 2)      It could pan, tilt/ and zoom and produced pictures
                         of sufficient quality and detail to "identify facial ’■>
                         features”


                 3}      That camera could produce good views of people
                         standing at the front of Pens 3/4 of the Loppings
                         Lane terraces and can be seen to zoom during such
                         seguezices.

                 4)      They clearly demonstrate the capabilities of the
                         colour camera (cam.2) and the other black and white
                         camera (cam.3) mounted on the South Stand


                                                   1
                                                             TO:01712424270   PAGE:07
27-00-97 14:05    FROM. SOLICITORS BUS UNIT 0151S52356




         c)      All of the above corroborate Soger Houldsworth'a
                 statement and in m y opinion shows that Police Officers
                 Ryan and Bichard gave false witness.


         d)      Because of the large number of "sequences* contained
                 within the videos it ia incomprehensible that the peraon
                 or persons who edited the "Compilation Video" did not
                 know of the existence of the extensive footage from the
                 acoreboard camera.


         e)      It was not produced despite several requests from the
                 inquest jury and this indicates suppression of critical
                 evidence.


     ^^ f )      Footage from colour camera 2 and black and white camera 3
                 clearly illustrate the powerful zoom facility that gave
                 the police the ability to see the Leppings Lane terrace
                 to a level that allows "facial recognition".


         g)      Xt is m y belief that had these sections of video footage
                 been produced and shown to the jury it would have totally
                 changed their opinion of *what the police could see".



         Background
         Following discussions with Katie Jones of Granada Television,
              contacted M r Chris Bryer, Head of Factual Programmes at
          orkshire Television in an attempt to establish what material
         was still in their archives following their production "First
         Tuesday".


         After our telephone discussion he agreed to see what was
         available and contact me further.           The following day he
         returned m y call and advised that he and Roger Finnigan
         (Senior Producer and co-producer of the First Tuesday
        programme) had discussed m y telephone call /various aspects of
        Houldsworth*a evidence.

            Meeting At Yorkshire T - Friday 24 th January 1997
            Foil owing a preliminary discussion mainly surrounding
            Houldsworth'a evidence and the relevance thereof, we crossed
            to another building and entered an editing suite.


            We viewed at length several video tapes including references
            PI-Part 1,2 £ 3 and P4~Part 1 & 2, which clearly showed that
            the score board camera (camera 5 on map attached as appendix
           A ) was working.


            The pictures from this camera were clear enough to enable
           identification of individuals and in only one case was there
           any evidence of the flaring (whitening of screenJ appearing.


        +The      clarity of the images was more than satisfactory and
           therefore raised a serious doubt in m y mind regarding the
           truthfulness of evidence by the police officers responsible
           for operating the CCTV.


           Tapes PI-Part 1,2 & 3 shows several different sequences taken
           from the scoreboard camera ( camera S) from the earliest time
           of 1200hra through to 1423 and then 1502 through to 1523hrs.


           Although there ia no footage recorded from this camera between                     &V
           1423 and 1502 it is more than probable that the camera was
           working perfectly well throughout this period . The screen in                             x-y
           the police control box would of course show the output from
          V P i s camera even when it was not recording.


           Tape P4- Part 1 & 2 include              similar footage tijaed at1557 and
           through until 1722 when the              tape runs out.


           These sequences include some very clear shots of the front of
           of the West Stand and Pen 3/4 on the terraces. Camera 5 can he
           seen to pan, tilt and *ooo,              especially when looking at a group
            Qf four people at the front             of the terrace.

           Both sequences of video tape show the arrival of a Lijnousioe
           Registration NTV2 and comparing the video time bases we wore
           able to establish that the footage had come from two video
           machines -which fits the configuration of the Sheffield
           system.


           I contacted Roger Houldsworth by telephone and he confirmed
           that the two video machines in the police control box operated
           in parallel.       This would appear sensible as it would enable
           recording via either VCR of any of the two ■sequencing*
           devices output enabling the police to either view or record a
           specific incident while the other machine was still on auto-
           sequence.

       A
       ^^Comment and Opinion
           It is m y opinion that this footage has never been seen before
          b y myself and X believe has not been included in any police               CA   if       kJ v

                                                                                                L-L.
           compilations and/or other tapes that I have seen.
                                                                                         />AC          -


          From m y knowledge of close circuit television and of this
          particular CCTV system, this evidence ia uncontroversial proof
           that camera 5 - the black and white scoreboard camera was               i^k^c S«-i'v ^
          working between the hours of say 1200am and 1722pm.             In all     ^            *
          cases bar one , the images are clear and caxmot be described as
          inferior'.                 ~         ~~                 "

           Tg addition to the proof of quality , the sequences contain
         ^Bn,    tilt and zoom actions which not only prove that these
          facilities were functioning, they prove that the operators
           (i.e. the policemen) were using the camera and de facto must
          have known it to be working and to have been able to see the
           terraces.


           Within the batch of tapes is footage from the South Stand
           colour and black and white camera's. Both cameras are shown to
          have very powerful zoom facilities and are used , admittedly
          not at the crucial time , to view the front of theTLepping lane
           terraces.

          Tape P5-Part 1 has excellent footage (1S3S to 1637) showing
          the front of the terrace and individual (even facial)
          recognition is possible. The camera ia physically seen to zoom
          in/out and both pan and tilt xoovements take place. These are
          exaggerated /jerky which shows that the camera ia zoomed in at
          thia point.


          There are sequences from both cameras showing activity in the
          North West corner of the Spion Kop (approximately twice the
          distance of that to pen3/4) and again clarity and definition
          are adequate for recognition. Using the same zoom on half the
          distance would dramatically improve the view on the monitors.


      ^^Thia proves that these camera's would have allowed clear view
      yiWof the terrace, including the front of Pqna 3 & 4, and la
          again contrary to evidence/comment from police officers given
          to the Inquiry and the Inquest.

          It is m y belief that the footage I viewed totally supports
         Uouldsworth'a position.


         Messrs Bryer and Finnigan operate in the television world and
         have produced many documentaries (including First Tuesday)
         which have relied upon video evidence.         They gave me the
         impreasion that in their opinion thia footage was more than
         adequate.


        ^furthermore, they advised that the transcript or their
         interview with Bouldsworth tends to support his statement and
         in effect corroborates his position has not changed between
          the disaster and now regarding the performance of the CCTV
          equipment.


          I was loaned a working copy of the tapea ao that I could look
          at all the relevant sections in detail and I would confirm                *
          that the compilation attached ia a true copy of that working
          copy. YTV can confirm that the original tapea. Including those
          with footage from camera 5 were supplied to them b y South
          Yorkshire Police.

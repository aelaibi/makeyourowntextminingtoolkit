Our   duties,        together w ith other serials was                  reception of Liverpool

supp or te rs at       the Midl an d R a i l w a y S t a ti on and their subsequent                 escort,

on S ou th Y or ks hi re      transport        buses   to H i l l s b o r o u g h football     ground.



We began duty at           the M id lands       station at        1000 hours        (1000)    but at this

time there were          no fans arriving.             As the morning             progressed

supp or te rs    began arriving,         they were         put on buses which were waiting

at the st at ion and when the buses were                      full    they were       tr an sp or te d to

Hillsborough         f o o t b a l 1 ground.    Eac h bus was         escorted by two Police

officers who         t ravelled on the          bus,   their     brief was         to drop the

Li verpool      s upporters      off at the Leppi ng s Lane entrance                      to the stadium

and then return on the empty bus to the                         railway station.



In the m ain the         supporters arriving             from Liverpool           were well     behaved

and good natured.             Soma    of them were         carrying       tins of beer and

other    intoxicants w hich they were made                    to dispose          of before    getting

on the buses.



W he n all    other     officers      from our      serial      had    left on buses         to escort

s upporters      to Hillsborough,          Sgt F L A C K , Sgt RODDIS and             I went    on a

bus w ith supporters,           as we    got     into H i l l s b o r o u g h    centre    I saw large

numbers      of football       supporters        standing       outside         pubs drinking.      Upon

arrival      at the ground the supporters                  on the bus on w h i c h          I was

Sgt FLACK,       Sgt R OD D I S and myself          then    returned to the M i d la nd Stat io n

on the empty          'bus,   where we     rejoined other members                  of our serial.        We

I saw large           numbers       of su                                ir way         towards   the ground.

As we drove           down Leppings                                      iere was a large           crowd of

fans outside              the L ep pings                                 I also         saw that mounted

We    continued along L ep pings Lane and turned                          right       into P e n i st on e Road.

We then e ntered the                football       ground and went         into      the g y m n as iu m where

we were      to remain on standby.                      At this   time    Insp DEWS and all            our

" p r o b l e m s ’ in the Leppi ng s Lane               terraces.       Lead by Inspector DEWS we

went    onto        the    perimeter       track    in front      of the N orth Stand.             At this

time the m atch was                still       in progress.



As we w alked             towards Leppings Lane,             I saw several           s upporters      run onto

the    pitch from behind L ep pings Lane                     goal.       I then       realised that         there

were a large              number    of    people    standing      on the       perimeter      track    between

the    playing s urface and the fencing                      in front of         the Leppi ng s Lane

terracing.

invasion.            As we a p p r o a c h e d the goal       it became apparent              that a large
                                                                                                    PAGE

number    of spectators           in the   pen behind the goal            to the    right of

perimeter    fence     gate 4       (facing the gate         from the      pitch)    were       being

crushed against        the    perimeter      fence.



Together with        other    officers      I climbed onto          the a d v e r ti si ng    hoarding

in front of the        perimeter       fence and      indicated to fans            inside       the       pens

to move    bac:k=     This had no effect at all.                   Fans were     climbing          over       the

fence onto    the     pitch and were also            climbing       up the w a l 1 at        the    rear of

the    terraces     into    the stand.



It was quite a pp ar en t         that we were able          to provide       little a ssistance

from the    perimeter        track and that the only wa y to                 relieve      the      crush

without    people at        the front      being    further    trampled on was            to get          into

the terracing and try to get                the    crowd back through the tunnel                   at the

rear    of the terracing.           To this end       I made my way along             the     perimeter

track and ente re d the terracing                 through a gate to the            left      hand side

of the t erracing          (when facing      the terrace       from the       pitch.)         I then

made my w ay along          the terracing         towards    the    rear of the goal.



I made my way along           the    terrace until         I came to a fence w h ic h              runs

from the front        to the back of the terrace               dividing       it into        pens.        When

I got to this fence           I could see         into the terrace area at             the      rear of

perimeter    fence gate 3.            I could see that         there were a large               number          of

unconscious/dead           people    piled up behind this            gate and up against                  the

perimeter fence/wall.               I began to climb over            the fence       into the         pen

when a s upporter          took   hold of my foot,            I d o n ’t know if he was            trying

to help me ever        the fence       or trying      to     stop me getting over but                 I

had to kick       out at him to make          him    let go of my foot.



I got over    the fence and made my way to the                      rear of gate 3 which                  I

               considerably.             I started      pulling    people from the         pile at     the    rear of

               the    perimeter      fence/wall         and    laying    them on the terraces.            I m a n ag ed

 DOI           to work my way to a point on the terrace                         immediately behind gate 3.                       I

            side,     looking   from the L ep pings Lane        stand.    I carried the     body all

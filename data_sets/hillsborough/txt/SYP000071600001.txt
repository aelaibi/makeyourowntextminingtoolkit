             I am a single man and I live at the above address with my parents.



             On Saturday,          15th April        1989 (150489)       I attended the F.A. Cup Semi-

             Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the Hillsborough
                                                             c a -t
             Football Ground, Sheffield.  I have been a Liverpool Supporter for

            over twenty years and have been to away games before, attending the
            C/=vT        S6-M \
            s-ame match, last year, I normally stand in the Kop at Anfield and I

             am used to crowds.



             I travelled to Hillsborough,                  Sheffield this year            in a fifteen seat

             other people I d o n ’t know.                We left Liverpool at about 9 am (0900)               to
                                                                                                             PAGE        2
                                                                                                             S 1586

             travel         to Sheffield and we used both the motorways and the "A" roads

             across Snake Pass.                  We experienced heavy traffic across Snake Pass

             and we stopped once about 26 miles outside Sheffield to use the

             toilet,         we arrived at Sheffield at about                 12 to 12.30 pm (1200)-(1230)

             and parked at the Mi llwojaA T a v e r n , Millwood Road, Sheffield.                           We

             stayed at the T a v ^ n f o r            a couple of drinks and we arrived at the

             Ground at aba<ft 2.15 pm (1415),                  having walked from the mini-bus.                  On

             our arriyal at the turnstiles there were no orderly queues,                                it was

             just /        mass     people,      there was a constant stream of fans joining the

             jji-aiss and I just got swept              into the crowd edging towards the front.

             saw three mounted Police O fficers shouting to form q ue ue s but you

             just         co u ld n’t do anything about         it.   Whilst        I was    in the crush I saw a

             young lad helped out of the crush and passed towards the Police who

             helped him it was obvious that he had collapsed.                                It seemed like a

             lifetime before                I got to the turnstiles,          but    it was actually about         14.

             40 hrs         (1440) when I went through the turnstile,                       at the other side I

             waited for my gi rl fr ie n d’s brother.                 Whilst        I stood in the space

             between the turnstiles and £Ke back of the stand I saw several                                  people
              c   a   t      o / v / r u T r i   £-t^cr&r~l                                             ;
             climbing over the t u r n ^ y f e s ,            I saw a police officer throw out a youth

             who^had climbed over the turnstile,                       he did this by opening the

             concertina gate, while the gate was open I heard fans ask the officer

             to loose them in but he didn't the gate was then shut.



             Me and                              made our way towards the tunnel,               because t h a t ’s

             where we were last year,                 as we got to the tunnel j& n % ra .ry &        I heard a

             large roar from outside the ground and I                                           Officer open the

             concertina type gate just to the left                     q/ T   the turnstile as I looked

             back,                    and I carried on down/the tunnel and,                  I d o n ’t know how
^ £ - 5 T"
             many people came through                                 I had free passage down the tunnel

             until you got to the other end when you hit a solid wall of
                                                                                          PAGE      3
                                                                                          SI 586

                fans,   by this time the Pens were already full and level with the exit

                from the tunnel.     I saw no Police or Stewards     control at either the

                entrance or exit from the tunnel.        I wejjV^to the right of the

                segregating    fence and   int*r Pen c / T eased my way into the pen by about

                twelve feet, the s^m^ing starred and with the excitement I was
                                      sJ--: JT   ■

                gradually forced forwap'as/t awards the front fence. I eventually

                reached point near the fence about five feet away from the exit gate.

                At this time there were two people in        front of me and the crush was

                like something that    I had never experienced before it was horrifying.

                The two people    in front of me either fainted,     or died in front of me

    ^           due to the crush,    they had their hands up against the fencing trying

                to stop themselves being      crushed but they couldn't keep it up and

        v   .   they eventually disappeared from in front of me.         I can only assume

   \\^           that they fell    to the floor and I never saw them again.         I was then at

                full arms   length bracing myself against the crowd,      because    I d i d n ’t

                want to get crushed against the fence myself.        Whilst the     people were

                still   in front of me and I had my arms up against the fence trying not

                 thirty years with a moustache had his head on my right arm, which was

                 locked, he kept saying, "You're choking me."  The crowd pressure kept

D e c Q         forcing his throat against my arm until he eventually died,           he turned

                blue and his mouth fell     open it was obvious that he was dead.          I

                remember wishing that my arm would break to help him,        but there was

                nothing   I could do, and as the crowd eased which was about five or ten

                minutes time he just fell off my arm.        I remember looking back around

                me and seeing a pile of bodies       lying around.   I couldn't say if they

                were dead or not I thought      I have go to get out of here.       I grabbed

                hold of the fence and gradually pulled myself across /eople who were

                underneath me and started to climb the fencing, at Imis time I was

                exhausted, but I managed to climb the fence ani I/eventually reach the

                                                                                       S 1586

          top and I got one leg over the top of the spikes but I kept getting my

          other    leg stuck on the spikes,    at this time a Police Officer was

          trying to help me,      but   I eventually got my leg over and I just jumped

          off the other side of the fence.         I just    lay on the pitch then for two

          or three minutes trying to get my breath back.



          Once    I had recovered I then went to find                 and I found him still

          in the crush the other side of the fence.            I told him to try and climb

          the fence    like I had and that I would help him,          but he just h a d n ’t got

          the strength.      At this time his face was pressed against the fencing

          and he was just staring at me saying,        "I can't,      I can't."    At this I

          got frustrated and had to walk off to calm down and I returned a few

          minutes    later and there was two Police me n and a Policewoman helping

          him out.     He eventually got out onto the pitch and I stayed with him.



          Whilst    I was on the pitch I. saw fans, Police Officers,          St John's and

          Stewards giving first aid to people/on the pitch.              All the time people

 C /rT    were still    climbing over the f ei^Ce to get out.         I saw dead or

              lapsed        people being c a r r i e / on make do stretchers, ie the

                advertising boards, I also / a w a Police Officer trying to pull the

          fencing down but he g&i^tfold by a Sergeant to stop it and I couldn't

          say if he did or not.         I also heard the Forest fans chanting,        "You're

          not going to Wembley."        As others were carrying dead or injured people

          out,    1 don't   think the Forest fans realised what was happening,           at

          this the Police formed a line across the half-way line to prevent

          Liverpool    fans running back towards them, as the chanting had insensed

          them.



                    and I were taken by a St John's man to the rear of the stand

          where the ambulances were because]                |was   injured.   Eventually

           after making a phone call an wondering around in a daze we were taken

           to the Northern General Hospital       by a Police van for treatment,    I

           d i d n ’t receive any treatment other than lying down recovering    in what

           looked like a Sports Hall.     As we left the hospital we were stopped by

           a film crew of Yorkshire T.V. and asked if I would give them an

           interview but 1 refused but they filmed us any way and it appeared on

           the news that night.



           We walked back to where the mini-bus was       parked and sometime   later we

           were picked up by the mini-bus and we returned to the Millwood Tavern

           where we had started out from.     All of the people who had started out

           from Liverpool    eventually made their back to the van, we all then

           travelled back to Liverpool,    after making telephone    calls, without

           stopping,   I got back into my house about 9 pm (2100).

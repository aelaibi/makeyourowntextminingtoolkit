          HILLSBOROUGH: TAYLOR: RECOMMEHDATIOH 4

You wrote to me most helpfully on 2 October 1989 in
connection with the above matter and I was able subsequently
to copy your letter to all Chief Constables to assist them
in their discussions with football clubs as together they
seek to give effect to Lord Justice Taylor's sensible and
thoughtful recommendations.

I regret to say, however, that the situation is still unclear
and other problems continue to arise.  I am being requested
in my capacity as Chairman of the ACPO Sub-Committee to give
a better steer on the difficult matter of 'written agreements'
or 'statements of intent'.  As things stand at the moment it
is virtually impossible to do so.

When I met Lord Justice Taylor on 18 October to be examined
upon the ACPO submission to his Inquiry I explained the
legal and practical difficulties we face and he was very
sympathetic to our predicament.  I highlighted in particular
the keen interest which Police Authorities are taking and
the pressure which some of them are bringing to bear upon
Chief Constables not to enter into any kind of arrangement
unless suitable indemnities are obtained.

Following upon the Hillsborough case, Police Authorities are
now pondering the prospect of huge civil claims for damages
arising from alleged police failures or neglect, and are
fearful of the possible consequences of that.

In this connection I have received the enclosed correspondence
which is self-explanatory.  In light of the concern now being
expressed by the Association of County Councils perhaps I could
suggest it might be productive and helpful if a meeting were
convened as soon as possible at the Home Office at which
representatives of the ACPO, the Home Office, the Local Authority

                              THEDREAM
Associations and Police Authorities could discuss all the
implications of this issue.

It is far too complex and important to be left to local
interpretation, resolution or agreement.   There are
substantial ramifications for the future which must be
settled now.

Perhaps you will consider this as a matter of urgency and
let me know what you think.  In the meantime I am copying
the correspondence to Bob Whalley, Secretary of the
Hillsborough Inquiry for his information.

.Dear George

AGREEMENTS BETWEEN POLICE AUTHORITIES AND OTHER PARTIES RELATIVE TO
THE POLICING OF PUBLIC EVENTS

We have been consulted by Municipal Mutual, the insurance company
set up by local authorities as e mutual company to provide a
standard and reliable level of insurance for local authorities.
You will no doubt know that most police authorities use the
 unicipal utual as their insurance company.

They have pointed out that in the wake of the Taylor report into
the Hillsborough stadium disaster considerable attention is being
focussed on agreements entered into by police authorities and those
organisations for whom they provide crowd safety and crowd control
functions. There does not appear to be any standardisation of such
agreements and, whilst MMI in its position as the public liability
insurer of a large number of police authorities is able to comment
where appropriate on the wording of individual agreements there
would seem to be considerable merit in their view in the wording of
such agreements being considered on a countrywide basis.

My Association would support the idea, I think, of a standardised
agreement. I believe that the issue may have already have been
considered by ACPO, and any information which you can provide would
be appreciated.
                                                                              *


I would, of course, expect to involve chief police officers in any
drafting working party that might be set up.
Yours sincerely

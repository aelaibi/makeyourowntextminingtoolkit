burnerous fans            came    by us     drinking,        ti*y*se being Liverpool                     fans,

    de nt if ie d by scarves,            shirts and accents,                from      cans of beer and

carrying          full    cans,    as well       as a Mil        that      had o b viously              been drinking

and    it was       obvious       to me     that a /arge amount               were         drunk       but    it was

pointless          as far as       I could sear to try to stop                       these       people       going        to

the    ground as          there    were     just/too       many      of them.             The    fans as a whole

were     very boisterous            and a I p t were           shouting,            but    I would         not    say they

were at       this       point a gg re s s i X e    or threatening,                 more    highly e m o t i o n a l .

            I live at the above address and I am a life long Liverpool supporter

            About a week before the Semi Final between Liverpool and Nottingham

            Forest at Hillsborough,            I bought a ticket from a lad in a pub,                    I

            paid £ 6 for it,       it was for Leppings Lane Terrace.



            On Saturday        15th April      1989 (150489)        I set off to the match with
                 N IT
                                  ^ho lives    in                        , in Liverpool-

            borrowed a car / rom a f r iend and we all                   1 eft/lli ve r poo 1 at about       10.

            the motorw/y, we were held up for about one hour to one and a half

            hour.       We/ f i na11y arrived in Sheffield at about 2.20 pm (1420).                          We

            parked right by the ground,               near to some garages.            We walked to the

                                                                                     S1943

          Leppings Lane entrance and we waited outside,        because I wanted to

          get a stand ticket.      I couldn't get one so after      I had spoken to
                                                        m                   N S S I 6 %H
          some friends    I spoke to a lad I know ______________     and Peter TOOLLE

          who was with him.                   was happy and looking forward to the

          match.    There was no crush outside at this time, and I

          made my way to a turnstile,     entered and I waited inside the ground and

          had a cup of tea.     At this time it was about 2.40pm (1440).        It

          appeared to me that the crowds were normal for a big match.           1 did not

          know where to go so I saw all the people going into a tunnel, so I
                                                                   N&ST
          joined the crowd and went into the tunnel.  I walked along the tunnel

          with no difficulty until     I got to the end, there were a lot of people

          standing on the terraces, another group of supporters          came behind me,

          and I got pushed into the terraces about,40ft,        from the end of the

          tu n n e l , I was then suddenly pushedyforward from behind,     I lost my

          footing and fell to the f 1oory / b e f ore I could do anythi ng I felt

          people standing on me and/peopie grabbing my clothing, I could feel

c a   T   the weight of people standi ng on my back,      I managed to climb up

          someones legs unti1 I was in a kneeling       position.     I then started to

          panic,   because   I knew that I had to get up there were bodies pressed

          tight all around me,     I began to fight and punch out to get some space

          to get up.     I managed to get to my feet,    I then realised how tightly

          packed in we were,     I again panicked and began to fight my way up the

          terrace towards the tunnel and the stand.         I was going sideways

          fighting my way up the terraces, and at this time the players were on

          the pitch but the match hadn't started.        I saw a flood of supporters

          coming out of the tunnel     pushing into the crowd,      this was sending

          everybody on the terrace forward.      The supporters      coming from the

          tunnel were not walking but were jogging onto the terrace being pushed

          by the people behind them,     they were constantly coming out of the

          tunnel and flooding onto the terraces.        I knew then that I had to get
                                                                            PAGE      3
                                                                            SI 943

out,    I managed to get past the main flood and I got to the wall           by

the tunnel entrance.     There was a Cockney lad behind me pushing me,

this stopped me being    carried away with the flood of people.            I stood

by the corner of the tunnel elbowing people.^'ft'ast me I managed to push

/ny way into the tunnel,   I did this bepa'iise the people coming out

of the tunne1 had slowed down due/CcT the terraces be i ng full.            I could

hear people shouti ng in distr,^s people cryi ng and people

screaming to get o u t , I atft into the tunne1, it was dark in the tunne1.

I could feel more th-ajjrsee people still      coming down the tunnel,       I had

both my arms raisao in f ront of me and I was wardi ng people off with

my elbows and fp rearms, I was standing sidewards with the wall of the

tunnel against my back.         I was edging my way sidewards along the

tunnel towards the light        I could see at the end of the tunnel.       As

people came past me I was       constantly being pushed against the tunnel

wall,   there were people behind me doing the same as me and they

stopped me being carried along with the flow of people back onto the

terraces.    I had got halfway along the tunnel and then I found that I

had come up against a solid wall of people,           I began to get crushed

against the wall and I was gasping for breath.            I managed to push

myself away from the wall and I remember trying to leaver myself above

the people that were around me to breath air into my body.            There was

a point where   I found myself with both feet off the floor and my

weight was being supported by the pressure of the crush.            People all

around me were shouting and calling out names of there friends.                  It

was dark and I was very confused and distressed.           It was utter    chaos.

My whole    purpose then was just to keep breathing and to remain

upright.    This continued for what seemed to be a long time.             I then

found myself being    carried    along towards the    end of the tunnel,

towards the turnstiles.         I could feel myself   being carried by the

crowd and I could feel     people on the floor and I could feel       people
                                                                          PAGE         4
                                                                          SI 943

under my feet,    I could not avoid stepping on these      people because I

had no control over my movements and the cjtdwd crush dictated where               I

went.     I believed that I was going to"'die the only thir^j I could think

of was getting out of the tunnaKT        Through all this my weight was

supported by the crowd cru^ff,    I   could feel   people moving under my feet

and around my legs.     I/«as constantly being turned around as we we re

travelling along the tunnel. Suddenly I was         in day light,   but I found

that    I was still trapped in the crush and could not move freely.          I

was panicking but I noticed that I could breath a bit more freely and

I saw that even as I was out of the tunnel,         I was still surrounded by

a large crowd.     The pressure had eased and I got both feet on the

floor but I was still being buffeted by the crowd.          My biggest fear

was that I would be pushed back into the tunnel.          I had the

impression that people were still trying to get into the tunnel            to go

through tosee the match.      I saw people helping other people holding

them up and trying to get them out of the crush.          I was in a bad way

myself   I felt very weak,   I managed to stay on my feet,     I got to some

stairs leading to the stands,     there were    people standing around the

bottom of the stairs,    other people and me tried to/push our way

through these people but we all fell over,         I racily pani eked then and

scrambled to my feet,    I ran up the stairs and into the West Stand.

Even at this stage I did not realise what/nad happened.             I could see

people standing on the pitch,     I sat dowp and I could feel my lungs

collapse, a short time later I began / o       breath properly and I could

see a lot of people on the pitch but I still did not realise what was

going on.     I stayed there for nearly one h o u r . I saw people walking

onto the pitch and collapsing.        I saw bodies being carried away but I

did not believe what    1 was seeing.     I left the ground at about half

past four, with someone I knew in the Stand and walked back to the ca r.

The people    I travelled with were waiting for me near the car we stayed

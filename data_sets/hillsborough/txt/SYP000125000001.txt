    Q'17

     G49

     DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS        A   FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

| INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

i THE MAIN FACTOR BESIDES THE OTHER POINTS I HAVE MENTIONED IS THAT WHILST THE

     PENNED AREAS 3 & 4 WERE EXTREMELY FULL AND PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER THE

     FENCE WAS THAT PEOPLE WERE STILL COMING INTO THAT AREA THROUGH THE TUNNEL.

     Q51

     DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

     SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

     AFTER HEARING THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SAID TO REMAIN IN THE STAND FOR A WHILE TO

| ASSIST THE EMERGENCY SERVICES,            WE THEN LEFT ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER.


    Q1S

     •
     DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

     NO.

* Q53

• DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE           WAY THE   INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

’ AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

     INITIALLY I D O N ’T THINK THE POLICE KNEW WHAT     WAS HAPPENING.   THE SUPPORTERS

     WHO GOT ONTO THE PITCH WERE OBVIOUSLY DISTRESSED AND THE MATCH WAS THEN

:   S T O p p E D By   A POLICEMAN, SO FROM THEN ON THEY MUST HAVE REALISED WHAT WAS

     HAPPENING,         THE ONLY PEOPLE APPEARING TO HELP WERE THE FANS THEMSELVES AND
                                                                                 PAGE   9

  THE ST JOHNS AMBULANCE.     ALL THE TIME THERE WERE A GREAT AMOUNT OF OFFICERS ON

  THE PITCH, SOME FORMED A LINE ACROSS THE PITCH, WHILST ALL THE TIME IT WAS

  VERY OBVIOUS THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG.        SO OBVIOUS THAT THE SUPPORTERS WERE

  RUNNING WITH BOARDS RIPPED UP FROM THE GROUND.        THERE WERE NO ANNOUNCEMENTS

  MADE,    IF THERE HAD BEEN, THEN THE LINE THAT HAD BEEN FORMED WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

  NEEDED AS THE NOTTINGHAM FANS WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS HAPPENING.          ALSO

  THE PERIMETER FENCE WAS PULLED AWAY AND THIS WAS INITIATED BY THE FANS AND IT

, ■WAS ONLY AFTER SOMETIME THAT THE POLICE ASSISTED THEM.       IT ALSO SEEMED A LONG

. TIME UNTIL THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ARRIVED,        I THINK ABOUT   1330 HRS (1530).



        THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IB VITAL TO THIS

        ICIAL INQUIRY?

  NO.

 PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING ANYTHING       WERE THE FANS.    NUMEROUS POLICEMEN WERE

STANDING AROUND DOING NOTHING.

 OFFICERS WAS INADEQUATE.

 T^J^CHLiNE LEAVING IHIS ARLA VERY CL.U!TERED,

 Q34

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1. AT A FEW MINUTES PAST THREE 0 ’CLOCK (1300)        IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT

 SOMETHING WAS SERIOUSLY WRONG IN THE MIDDLE PENS AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND

 WHY THE POLICE AND STEWARDS DIDN'T.

 2. THE ENTRANCE TO THE TURNSTILES AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END IS VERY POORLY

 DESIGNED FORMING AN ENCLOSED AREA INTO WHICH MANY 1000'S OF FANS HAVE TO

 G^INTO,   IT SHOULD BE RE-ASSESSED.

  WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

  1620-1630 HRS (1620) - (1630)

  G51    DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A

  LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 POLICEMAN CAME ROUND WITH A LOUD NAILER BUT I D O N ’T KNOW WHAT HE SAID


G18

 GS2

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH HAS STOPPED?

 THE FOREST FANS WERE JEERING AND CHANTING AT THE LIVERPOOL FANS ON THE PITCH.

 THE POLICE PUT A LINE ACROSS THE HALFWAY LINE AS THEY WERE.. OBVIOUSLY

 E J E C T I N G CROWD TROUBLE AB I THOUGHT THERE WAS.    THE LINE OF POLICE    IN THE

 MIDDLE STAYED FOR A    WHILE,    AFTER A BIT SOME OF THE POLIC^ IN THE MIDDLE WERE

 HELPING TO CARRY THE BOARDS AND SLOWLY THEY WERE HELPING/INJURED FANS.

 POLICE AT THE OTHER    END WERE HELPING AS WELL.        THERE APPEARED TO BE   A

 LACK OF STRETCHERS,    OXYGENAND BASIC FIRST AID EQUIPMENT

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 LAST YEAR THERE WERE A LOT/MORE POLICE ON THE ROADS AROUND THE GROUND

 q J p K I N G TICKETS, SEARCHING YOU AND GIVING/ DIRECTIONS,

 LAST YEAR IT WAS BAD OUTSIDE THE TURNSTli/ES AND EVERYONE ENDED UP IN A

 MASSED QUEUE.     NO PROPER LINES AT ALL.

 QUALITY OF WITNESS     (TICK BOX APPLICABLE)

- THIS YOUNG MAN STATES THAT THE POLICE OFFICERS WHO FORMED A CORDON ACROSS THE

 CENTRE LINE OF THE PITCH DID HELP WITH THE INJURED FANS WHEREAS MOST SEEM

 TO SAY THEY DID NOT.      (HIS FATHER IS A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER THOUGH!)

QUALITY OF WITNESS

 I NOW BELIEVE THAT THE GROUND WAS WRONG.   LAST YEAR THERE WAS TROUBLE AND

DISTRESS WHEN SUCH A LARGE CROWD OF SUPPORTERS LEAVING THROUGH THE SAME

GATES.

LIVERPOOL HAVE MORE SUPPORTERS AND EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN NOTTS FOREST AT THE

LEPPINGS LANE END THE SAME SITUATION COULD HAVE ARISEN DUE TO POOR POLICE

^pANISATION.

    W ^ p i D N ’T REALISE THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION UNTIL LONG AFTERWARDS ALTHOUGH

    WE DID KNOW THAT THERE WERE DEATHS FROM THE BODIES ON THE PITCH.

    I WAS NOT AWARE AT THE TIME JUST HOW THE POLICE WERE HANDLING THE SITUATION I

    CAN ONLY SAY THAT ON THINKING ABOUT IT AFTERWARD^ IT MUST HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

THE SAME VENUE WAS CHOSEN !rOR TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS INVOLVING THE SAME TWO

CLUBS WHEN LIVERPOOL F.C. THEMSELVES>ftNP SUPPORTERS REPRESENTATION              HAD

COMPLAINED TO THE F .A . OF :

1) THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION 01^ THE VENUE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE FAIR <2

HOURS FROM NOTTS) 4 HOURS FROM LIVERPOOL TRAVELLING TIME.

c^pfJNFAXR TICKET ALLOCATION A.E MORE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS THAN NOTTS FOREST

YET LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WERE GIVEN LESS TICKETS.

LIVERPOOL WAS GIVEN FOR THE SECOND YEAR RUNNING THE LEPPINGS LANE END.                  WHEN

A SIMPLE TRAFFIC DIVERSION COULD HAVE GIVEN LIVERPOOL THE SPION KOP END.

THERE WAS ONLY ONE APPROACH WAY INSTEAD OF USING VERE ROAD, FIELDING ROAD AND

8 ICKERTON ROAD WHICH WOULD HAVE FORMED AN IDEAL FILTERING SYSTEM,

ON ENTERING THE GROUND THROUGH THE CONCERTINA GATE I WAS RELIEVED AND BADLY

SHAKEN AND THERE        WAS A LINE OF POLICE OFFICERS.    I ASKED ONE OF THEM IF I

COULD SPEAK TO ASUPERIOR OFFICER.        HE DIRECTED     ME TO AN OFFICER WHO WAS STOOD

BEHIND THE LINE.         I WENT AND SPOKE TO HIM SAYING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO COMPLAIN

I ^ i H E STRONGEST     POSSIBLE TERMS ABOUT THE CROWD CONTROL OUTSIDE.     HE SAID

"WE HAVE A PROBLEM, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO".           AT THIS I LEFT AND WENT TO MY

SEAT,         V           7/

ON THE DAY THE CROWD CONTROL WAS VERY POOR BEFORE AND DURING THE GAME/                  CRO^

CONTROL,     I FEEL SHOULD ENCOMPASS, ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT GO WITH A FOOTBALL ^

CROWD,      IE LATE COMERS, T ICKETLESS FANS, DRUNKEN FANS, CRIMINAL IF ALL OF THESE

ARE -ACCOUNTED FOR SAFETY SHOULD FOLLOW ON AND BE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE.

I DID NOT ATTEND LAST YEARS SEMI-FINAL.

IF THE GATE WHERE I WAS HAD NOT BEEN OPENED, WHICH IS ENTRANCE A OF NORTH

STAND.      THE CRUSH WAS SUCH WITH HIND SIGHT I FEEL THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
                                                                               PAGE 10

 FATALITIES OUTSIDE AND CERTAINLY INJURED PEOPLE, MYSELF INCLUDE

 I ALSO THINK THAT THE KICK OFF TIME SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT OFF KVEN IF IT MEANS

 DOING IT SECONDS BEFORE THE KICK O F F .   A SIMPLE SIGNAL SYSTEM BETWEEN THE

 REFEREE AND A SENIOR OFFICER WOULD HAVE MADE THIS POSSIBLE.      THIS BEING

 COMMUNICATED TO THE CROWD OUTSIDE WOULD HAVE RELIEVED CROWD PRESSURE

 INSTANTLY.     THIS WAS DONE AT TRANMERE A FEW DAYS BEFORE AND ALSO AT ARSENAL A

 WEEK OR SO BEFORE.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOj^TEEL 13 VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?                        _ ^

 ^ T T E N D E D LAST YEAR WITH TERRACE TlCi^fs AND ARRIVED LATE.   I WENT TO GO

 DOWN TUNNEL BUT WERE DIRECTED BY U W E OF POLICE AWAY FROM THAT AREA AND TO THE

 WING PENS, EVEN THEY WERE PflQggB TIGHT, THERE WERE NO LESSONS      LEARNT FROM

 T HA T.   LIVERPOOL FANS HAD THE WRONG END BEARING IN MIND THE LARGER NUMBERS

 OF SUPPORTERS.     THERE WAS NO MARSHALLING OF THE FANS FROM THE CENTRE PENS TO

 THE SIDES.     INSUFFICIENT WARNING TO TRAVELLING SUPPORTERS ABOUT ROADWORKS

 CAUSING DELAYS.     ALL 24,000 FANS WERE TRYING TO GET THROUGH A SMALL NUMBER OF

..TURNSTILES IN A SMALL AREA.    GEOGRAPHY INSIDE THE GROUND MADE IT DIFFICULT

 TO GET TO SIDE PENS, NOT JUST SIGNS, THE LAYOUT IS POOR.       THE POLICE DIDN’T

 R ^ C T TO THE RAPIDLY INCREASING NUMBERS OUTSIDE THE GROUND FROM 2 PM (1400)

 ONWARDS.     THERE WERE INADEQUATE MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM THE TERRACES ONTO THE

 PITCH.     NO ATTEMPT WAS MAKE ON TANNOY TO MOVE FANS BACK OR ANY OTHER ACTION.

 THE KICKOFF SHOULD HAVE BEiEN DELAYED.

             drinking               from       c a h s , but           I didn't             see      anyone        dr un k.     I t ’s u s u a l        to    have

             at a b o u t           g.IPpm           (1 41 0) .        There          were       quite       a    lot    of    p e o p le    about.          A few

             were         by the          chippie.              The     main          b lu e     gates       were       open and          I could        see

             I saw P o l i c e Officers                           at    each          t u r n s t i l e,     they were          patting           people        down

             as     they went              through.               We    h a d our           tickets          checked          by P o l i c e as we came

             again.            I had       no        trouble           entering             the      ground        or    getting          through        the

             terrace            turnstile.                 I handed           my       ticket         in a n d         had    the    stub       handed        back.

             I have            the       stub       somewhere,               I can          produce          it    if    I'm     required          to    do     so.

             On     t he       other       side          of     the     turnstiles                  I saw about              5 Stewards           by the

             steps         leading             up     to      the      stands.             It w a s       quite        empty    in the          forecourt,            a

             few      people             were       walking            by    the       toilet         and a few              people       were    walking           up

             and      down.          I c an 't           r e ca l l     seeing             any Police             in the       courtyard.             I wanted

             to     get        over       to       the     scoreboard                 for      my    spec,        but w h e n y o u         got    into       that

             courtyard               the       sides          look      as    though             they      go     to a d e a d       end,       there's

             nothing            to       say you           can       get     round          to      the    side        pens    from       the     courtyard.

             So,      I thought                I'll        go     down       the m i d d l e          and        try    to go       through/the              c en t r e

             p en s       by    the       gate        at      th e     back.          There         were     no P o l i c e     or S t e w a r d s       at     the

             entrance               to    the       tunnel,            when       I walked            through           the    t u n n e / it w a s          really

             p a c k e d,       again          there          weren't         any Police                  or S t e w a r d s    in the          tunnel.         I

             stood         on a          railing           at     the       end       of    the      tunnel        to    see    if    I could           find a

I could           see     t his      from       standing             on the        rail.         This      is a b o u t         g.aQ/m

( •1420).         I got         down      off      t he    rail      and       pushed           my way      i n t o P e n y a nd

pushed my way                   down      to a b o u t         the m i d d l e        of     the    pen.        I managed             to    get       in

front        of a b a r r i e r .          I thought              it w a s        almost         full      then,          with    people

swaying           and     jostling           to      get       their        spec.         It w a s n ' t    uncomfortable                   at

that     point,              it w a s     j us t     like m o s t          matches,             before      the          kick    off.        I met

up wit h          a    chap        I k n o w as                . I know           him      through         the T r a v e l        Club,          he

comes        from Warrington.                      He     stood       by me        fo r      about       10— 15 m i n u t e s .            We

commented              t ha t      the    crowd was              like       it w a s       at    Tottenham               last    year.          We

s a i d we        probably wouldn't                       se e    much       of    the       game .      The     pen w a s        still

filling           up a n d         the    pressure             was    building             up.     At a b o u t          2 . 4 0- 2. 45pm

( 1440--1445) , p e o p l e                were         trying        to get          to     the    sides        to       get    out       into

the     emptier              pens.       I thought             I'd    be a l r i g h t          although         it w a s        getting

very     hot          in t h e r e       and you          could       hardly          move.        It w a s      packed          but       the

crowd        didn't             really       seem         bothered,           there         was singing and                   that

u s u a l l y at        about        2.45pm          (1445)          the      team        c ome out        for       a    little       k ick

about,        but        I      couldn't           see     them.       We s e e m e d         to be      getting           pushed          down

a n d we       could            only      see      the     person           in f r o n t.        Iju st     fe lt         it w a s

getting           tighter           and     tighter            in the re .            We w e r e      only swaying               forward             but

not     coming          back        like     you        usually         do at         a     m a t c h . At a b o u t          2^o0pfn        (1450)

I could           see        people       t r y ing       to     climb       o ve r       the    front      perimeter             fencing

and     I could              see    the P o l i c e        gesturing              fo r     people        to get           back.       As     the

crowd        pushed           forward,          my      f ee t    were        off the           floor      most          of     the    t im e a n d

I had        no       choice        but    to      go     forward.            I e n d e d up a b o u t           4       people        away from

th e    front          fencing.           I could          breathe            out but           I couldn't                breathe          in. It

was     hurting           my       throat       and       chest.        I     was sweating,                I could            feel     my

hair     was          damp.        I had     been         keeping           my arms          up a n d      on    the        shoulders            of

people        in f r o n t          of me,         not     by     c ho ic e.

As     I got          nearer        the    fencing             I managed              to put a n a r m           out a n d        my       hand

was     grabbed.           I don't              know who             by,    but       I couldn't           get       lifted         up     because

my     body was           wedged             in by        other       p eo p le .      Everone          was      screaming,              "We

can't     get          back,"           as    t he P o l i c e        told       us    to    push       back.        I reckon            this was

happening              j ust       as    the        m a t c h was      getting             stopped.        I didn't               see    the

k i c k — off      or a n y         of       the     play.       I could          feel       t h at     I was        standing            on

bodies,           they weren't                  moving          at all,          people        had      been       fainting             and       then

just     dropping              where          they        stoo d.      I could             feel    myself          getting          dizzy and

light     headed.              I wasn't              aware       of    the       barrier          having         broke,           it w a s        j ust

that     p a c k e d at            the       f r o n t ,I c o u l d n ' t        feel       any    r u sh of         people         coming          in

behind        me.        There          was     panic        in the         crowd and             I was       scared          I was        going

to     die.       After        a    couple           more       minutes          I think          the P o l i c e         realised            it

wasn't        a    pitch           invasion and                 they       began       to    help       p e op l e       o ve r    the

fencing.           I had           to    keep my            head      down        as       such    because           of     pressure from

behind with               people             climbing           over       us     in the          panic       to    get      out. I

couldn't           really move                  my     head      to    the        si des ,        out    of      the      c o rn e r of       my    eye

I could           s ee    people             by me        had    turned           white        and      then       t h e y w e n t blue.             I

don't     know           if t h e y w e r e            dead      or a l i v e .        By    this       t im e     I had          lost               1n


th e    crush and              I s t i ll           don't       know       if h e ' s       alright.

Next     thing           I remember                 I was       in the          air    being       lij^fed up             into      th e      W

Stand.        I don't              know        if    I'd      passed        out       or    I'd^fust          blanked             this     out      of

my mind.           I remember                 t h at      a front          p e r i m e t e r Ai ate      had       been       opened          by

someone           for     about          a rninute a n d              so    people          got    out a n d         then         it w a s

closed again.                  There          was      no    chance         of    getting          out,       we w e r e          only about              8

feet     a wa y,         but       it m a y w e l l          have      been a mile                because          it w a s        just       as

pa ck e d,        it     didn't          seem        to     h a ve    relieved any                pressure           at all         in P e n 3.

When     I came           to       in the           W Stand,          I was        in a s e a t         about        3    rows      b ack.         You

were     s t i ll        quite          em pt y .      I could         feel        p ai ns     in m y      chest and across                        the

top     of m y         back.        About           5 minutes          l at er        I go t      into     the       W Stand            I saw an

am bulance             arrive           on    the      pitch.         I hadn't             heard any          public a n n o u n c e m e n t s

made      about           about       what         was    happening.             The       tannoy          s y s t e m w a s n ’t v er y

loud anyway,               the      crowd was             quiet         then.     The       first          one     I heard was              about

3.45pm         (1545)         when       D A L G L I S H j/sked all              the       f a^ s     to    keep        calm.        Th e

crowd went              quiet       to     listenXo               him     but    it w a s        s t il l       poor.

The      Police         seemed        to      be    useless          on    the    pat ch ,          they        seemed        to    be

standing           there        and      it w a s        the      fans     who    seemed            to     be    doing all           the

mouth       to m o u t h a n d           carrying            the     injured          on    the       hoardings.              There       were

lots      of      people        on the         pitch         running          about,        the F o r e s t         f ans      had       begun

to    c h ant      something             and       so me L i v e r p o o l       fans       on the          pitch        began       to     ru n

to    the      forest         end.       If    the       tannoy         system        had     been         better        and       someone

had      informed          the F o r e s t          f an s     of w h a t       was     going         on,       t hat    w o u l d n ’t h ave

happened.

The      Police         were       telling           people        to     get    of f      the      pitch and            back       into       the

pens,       but      the      pens       were       s t il l      quite       full      and      people          d i d n ’t w a n t       to go

b a ck    th er e.

I think           the S t e w a r d s         could       h a ve     lined       up     in the           tunnel         and    told        people

which way            to    go a n d        the      Police         at     the    front        of      the       pens     seeing          they

were      getting          full,         should          h a ve    been       in c o m m u n i c a t i o n w i t h            the

Stewards,            and      told       them       to    stop any more                 people           coming         into       the     centre

pens.

Some      official            made       an announcement                   that       the     g am e       had     been a b a n d o n e d

and      I decided            to    l ea ve        the    s ta n d .      I walked          back         down      the       steps       and

through           the C o u r t y a r d ,          I could         see     a few        fans        shouting            at    the P o l i c e .

By    n o w we       heard         from       people         t hat      had     been       lifted          into     the       stand       that

some      gates         had     been       opened and              people        had       flooded           in,    but       I d i d n ’t

know about              that,      you        d o n ’t k n o w       if    its    getting             exaggerated              in the          heat

of    the m o m e n t         because          people          were       obviously           very         ups et .      There       were

Police         in the         courtyard.                They were          standing           in a         line     outside          the

ground         it w a s       very       q u i e t.      I made         my way        back       to      the     coach,        everybody

got      b ac k    on     our      coach,          we    were      waiting        fo r      the       driver        who       had    been       in

the    ground.       We m u s t     have         been     one       of    the    last     coaches       to     leave,     at

about    5.30pm       (1730).         On     the S u n d a y         night       at    home     (16.5.89)(160589)                  I

was    having      pains     in m y         chest,        and       trojjrole b r e a t h i n g , it f e l t         like a

heavy weight          on m y      chest          ar^t a c r o s s        my   shoulders,




When    I went       to    last     y e a r ’s         senyAfinal               I was seated        in the         N Stand. I

was    supposed       to    be    sitting               t his   ye ar,          but    I left   it too       late a n d        I

could    only      get     a ground          t i c k et .      We    travelled          again with           the    Travel

Club,    we    didn't       get     ou t     tickets           checked          last    year     but    the P o l i c i n g        wa s

about    the    same.       I d i d n ’t se e           t hat       many Police           about.       I just       t h i nk

there    was    no     communication                between          the P o l i c e      and    the S t e w a r d s      and      if

there    had    been,       t hat     would             have        stopped       it. I    d o n ’tt h i n k   there      were

enough    Stewards          anyway          to       do     that.        I d i d n ’t see a n y in the             ground.

White    m al e,     about       5 " 10 ,    slim       build,           short    mousey        hair,     I c an     o n ly

or    tracksuit       bottoms         on.

I am w illing         for    my     statement             to    be       used    in the       Inqui ry .

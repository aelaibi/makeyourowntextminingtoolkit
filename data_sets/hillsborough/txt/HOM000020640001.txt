Dear Mr Whalley


You forwarded to me a letter from Brian Thompson & Partners dated
27 September 1989, which was received in ray office on 4 October 1989.

In commenting on its content and references to HSE I should add that ACC Mervyn
Jones has already contacted me, having received a copy of the letter himself.
He is of the opinion, and I can only agree with him, that until it is decided
whether the Criminal Proceedings are to be undertaken, then all factors
concerning the investigations should be suspended and no further information
circulated.

However, since two points are raised in Thompson's letter from ray report, I can
inform you of the progress to date.

      Ref Paragraph 3.8 "Calculations        currently underway." You will be
      pleased to hear that our calculations are complete and we have been
      assisted in this by Professor Rod Smith of Sheffield University, to whom
      we sub-contracted a part of the analysis. Reports of this work are now
      in final draft form and will be sent to you as soon as possible.

      Ref Paragraph 3.9 "... remaining barriers ... tested to destruction
         " In view of the analysis referred to above, it was felt that a full
      test to destruction was not necessary at this time. However, it was
      always understood, and allowed for when we removed barriers from Lappings
      Lane, that further testing may be necessary. I have agreed with
      Professor Maunder that we will re-consider such work when the
      requirements of Part II of the Inquiry are clear.

      In the meantime, we are preparing a testing machine to bend one of the
      wrought iron horizontal tubes in the laboratory to obtain a closer
      estimate of the bending characteristics of the material, which will be
      used to reinforce our theoretical calculations.
I hope these comments and up-dating information are of use and I look forward
to attending the first meeting of the technical working party on
18 October 1989.

Regards.




DR C E NICHOLSON
Deputy Director - Safety Engineering Laboratory 1


PS I am sure you noticed the typing error where Thcanpsons wrongly refer to
paragraph 234 rather than 243 of Lord Justice Taylor's report.

           LETTER FROM BRIAN THOMPSON & PARTNERS OF 27 SEPTEMBER 1989

           I refer to your recent correspondence in which you forward a letter from
           Brian Thompson and Partners, dated 27 September 1898, to me for comment.

           As you know Mr Dear has now been asked to extend his investigation to
           consider the criminal aspects, if any, arising out of the events at
           Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. On his behalf I am charged, on a full time
           basis, to enquire into these matters.  An important aspect of the criminal
           investigation will be the barrier, its condition and the force applied to
           it. At this time the investigation is under the direction of the
           Director of Public Prosecutions and he has appointed a QC to assess the
           evidence and advise me and my colleagues as to how to progress the
           investigation.  At the same time the investigation is being supervised by
           the Police Complaints Authority.

           As far as physical evidence is concerned it is highly likely that
           existing findings will have to be considered.  It is also possible that
           future research work will have to be undertaken in respect of the
           barrier, although at this time I am not sure precisely what will be
           entailed.  However, in anticipation I have written to Dr Nicholson and
           his senior management with a view to securing his services to assist in
           the criminal inquiry.   I have also directed that the broken barrier
           should be preserved in its present form and that no further research
           work should be carried out on it until I have had an opportunity to
           discuss it with my supervising authorities. Similarly, I have asked
           Dr Nicholson to retain his findings so far made, until such a time that
           the Director of Public Prosecutions has had time to consider them.
           Given that the criminal inquiry is continuing and will not be concluded
           for some time, I would not be supportive to a suggestion that any
           barrier material or other evidential findings should be released until
           the Director of Public Prosecutions has made his decision.


  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T          .............   Llcpyd   H o u s e ,   Birmingham
I appreciate that this might frustrate Brian Thompson and Partners in
seeking the evidence to support their civil case, which I regret, but
I do feel that the criminal investigation must take precedence at this
time. Furthermore, that evidence probably will be relevant to the Coroner'
Inquiry and again this must receive priority.  It may well be that
Dr Nicholson will be called for the criminal proceedings, if they are taken
and for the Coroner's Inquest when, no doubt, the information requested
would be made available and an opportunity afforded to cross-examine
Dr Nicholson and his colleagues.

I have now had an opportunity to read David Brummell's letter dated
5 October to you on this subject.  I concur with the views expressed there.
In particular I would support his suggestion for more information as he
details in his paragraph 8.

I hope this is of assistance to you in helping Lord Justice Taylor decide
on what he would like to do in respect of Brian Thompson and Partners'
letter.  If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate
to contact me. I have copied this letter to the offices of the Director
of Public Prosecutions and the Police Complaints Authority for their
information.

              ;
Thank you for your letter of 4 September. You also copied to me
your letter to Professor Maunder of 10 August.

We discussed a day or so ago the immediate future of the remains
of barrier 124A which you currently retain. I discussed this
with Lord Justice Taylor yesterday. He takes the view that it
would not be appropriate to give interested parties samples of
the barrier or loan the samples used by HSE. Nor would he think
it appropriate that other parties should be present when you
carry out your own tests, or have access to any further results
which you yourselves might produce, either from tests carried out
to date or from further tests. He would be particularly
concerned about the distribution of any further material beyond
that on which he based his Interim Report.

That suggests that, for the present, it would probably be right,
as you indicate, for all pieces to be retained by HSE in the
condition they are now. This may sound unduly restrictive, but
the point is that the publication of the Interim Report is not
the end of the story. It may well be that Professor Maunder will
want further tests carried out which bear upon questions to be
considered in Part 2 of the Inquiry. And police inquiries will
continue for some time to come, focussing first on any question
of the commission of criminal offences, and then on the inquest
by HM Coroner.
It may well be that we should keep to this position, so far as
Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry is concerned, until after the Final
Report is published. But if you come under constant pressure, or
if our stipulation seems oppressive, perhaps you could let me
know. On the timescale, it seems likely that Lord Justice Taylor
will have completedlhis Final Report before the police inquiries
are complete. It would then be for Mervyn to say what the ground
rules should be thereafter.

LETTER FROM BRIAN THOMPSON & PARTNERS OF 27 SEPTEMBER 1989

  ank you for copying to me Brian Thompson's letter, about which we spoke earlier in
% e week.  Before advising more fully, it would be helpful, I think, to have a bit
more information on one or two points (as indicated below).  Perhaps we could have a
further chat over the telephone when you have considered my initial comments.     As
agreed, I spoke to Andrew Collins about this matter yesterday, and what follows also
reflects Andrew's views

1.    It appears from Brian Thompson's letter that one of the central issues of
fact in the civil litigation will be the effective cause of the collapse of barrier
124A. It therefore appears to be unavoidable that any relevant evidence about this
should prima facie be disclosable in the civil litigation.

2.    I note Brian Thompson's remarks on the first page of their letter about
paragraph 243 of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report.  The suggestion appears to be
that the conclusion in paragraph 243 of Lord Justice Taylor's Report is to some
extent based on evidence that was not formally submitted to the Inquiry during the
oral hearing stage.   My own understanding (as is Andrew's) is that HSE did not
provide any additional evidence (as opposed      to the giving,    for example,   of
confidential background briefings) to Lord Justice Taylor outside the formal
confines of the Inquiry.   I therefore find Brian Thompson's apparent suggestion to
the contrary (which they admittedly do not follow through in express terms) somewhat
puzzling.

3.    On page 2 of their letter Brian Thompson express a desire to have
communicated to them the results of tests which the Heath and Safety Executive have
carried out on the barrier (they accept that, in view of the current criminal
investigation, the taking of samples may not be possible), and also refer to the
fact that they have recently asked the HSE to produce "a list of documents in their
possession". The documents which Brian Thompson seek are presumably those relating
to any work undertaken by HSE on the Leppings Lane barrier(s), either during or
since the oral hearing stage of the Public Inquiry.

4.    However, before deciding how to respond to Brian Thompson's       request,I think
we really need to know what it is precisely that Brian Thompson are after.   Clearly,
as regards any information or documents formally submitted by HSE to the Inquiry,
there would be no reason whatsoever to object to such information or documents being
made available to Brian Thompson.   If what Brian Thompson seek in addition are the
test results on which the HSE's conclusions (as formally submitted to the Inquiry)
were based, then Andrew and I again consider that there is no reason why these
should not also be disclosed to Brian Thompson.
5.    As regards any other information which may have been made available to Lord
Justice Taylor, to the extent that this fell within the category of "confidential
background briefing", Andrew considers that it might be possible to claim privilege
(although he doubts whether there would be anything sensitive in such briefing
material).   However, to advise on this we would obviously need to see what the
documents were. Also, the privilege from production would have to be claimed on the
grounds of public interest ("public interest immunity"), and I gather that it is not
in fact desired that we should at the end of the day either (i) be seen to be
prepared to disclose material of relevance to the civil litigation only under the
compulsion of a Court Order or (ii) seek to resist production on the basis of a
claim for PII.

6.    Depending on what the documents in HSE's possession are the production of
which is sought by Brian Thompson, it might of course be possible to persuade Brian
Thompson that the production of certain documents was undesirable on two counts,
namely

 (a)      It might be prejudicial to the outcome of the criminal investigation (this
would have to be a rather different argument from that with regard to the taking of
samples:      samples from the barrier(s) cannot be given to the parties to the civil
litigation, presumably because the barrier(s) are still physically needed for
™ s t i n g in relation to the criminal investigation).

(b)   It might be prejudicial to Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report (though I am
not sure how far this argument would run, given that, as I understand it, Lord
Justice Taylor's Final Report will be concerned with recommendations as to the
safety of sports grounds generally rather than going over the specific issues of
fact and causation etc that were addressed in the Interim Report).

7.    Despite the slight note of doubt injected into paragraph 6 above, I would not
wish to exclude outright at this stage the possibility of putting forward such
arguments to Brian Thompson.      It all depends on the kinds of documents the
production of which is being sought, and, of course, Lord Justice Taylor and Mervyn
Jones are best placed to assess the extent of potential prejudice to the final
Report in the public inquiry and to the criminal investigation respectively.

8.   In conclusion, before giving further advice on this matter,      I think we need
to know the following

(a)    A clearer and morespecific idea of the material which BrianThompson seek;

(b)   A list of documents  in HSE's possession relating to work undertaken by them
on the Leppings Lane Barrier(s) (with, if possible, sufficient description to
indicate the nature/general content of each document), together with an indication
of those documents

(i)    which were formally   submitted to the Public Inquiry; and

(ii)   (if any) which were   submitted to Lord Justice Taylor privately.

             Dear Mr Edey

             I refer to your letter of 22 September, with enclosures, which was brought
             to my notice on return from annual leave.  I have noted the contents of
             your letter.

             I also note that you have been trying to contact me via the Liverpool
             office.

             At this time I am continuing the investigation into all aspects of the
             Hillsborough Disaster in order to determine whether there is any criminal
             culpability on the part of any person or organisation.  Part of that
             investigation is also looking at the complaints and disciplinary aspects
             which may have arisen from the Police actions. The Director of Public
             Prosecutions and the Police Complaints Authority are overseeing my
             investigation.

             That investigation will continue for some time and without wishing to be
             rude I do not feel any useful purpose can be served at this time by
             entering into discussions on what occurred.

             Yours sincerely




             J M Jones

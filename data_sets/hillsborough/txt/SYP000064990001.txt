 Dated                 280489


            At 9 a.m.    on Saturday         15th of April,         198^   I commenced duty at

            Ecclesfield Police Station to work fcyrtball duties for the Liverpool

            V Notts Forest football match.

            I was attached to serial              19 witfyPolice Sergeant Proctor as

            Supervisory Sergeant.            We wersrall        conveyed to the ground via double

                                                             ground we were briefed and told



            At 10.50 a.m.         I was   postioned on the Leppings Lane side of the

            ground.     Serial      1 9 ’s duties on the day were to search incoming

            coaches and maintain public order outside the g r o u n d .                    Shortly after

            11 a.m. a number of incoming coaches arrived at the ground.                          All were

            searched and the fans directed to go straight                        into the ground.

            At around 12 midday fans were spilling out into the road and as a
                                                                                 PAGE     2
                                                                                 S925
result,    I moved to the location of Leppings Lane and the junction with

Catchbar Lane, advising all fans to get off the road and onto the

pavement.      I remained at t h i ^ p o s i t i o n until further coaches arrived.

I then assisted in searc>flng the coaches before                returning

to the Leppings Lane><Jatchbar Lane position.

At 2 p .m. the volume of fans was such that it was impossible to keep

all the fans ofn the road and onto the pavement.                 Every effoj^t was

made to do tmis but it was        practically impossible.

At 2.45 p.m. fans were seen running down from the direction of

Wadsley Lane towards the ground.           The majority J R      fans were seen to

be carrying both cans and plastic bottles ojr beer and lager.                 Due to
                                                    —   ^                       9
the sheer numbers of fans they were turiyfd away f rom the ground. ■

S h o rtly before the start of the matchu^ans had to be separated in

Leppings Lane as fighting broke oujr between two large groups.                   It was

necessary at this stage for two^Solice Officers on horseback to to do

this.     By this time   it a p p e a r V d apparent that the situation was

beginning to get out of harvfl, there was such a large influx of fans

that they filled Leppings^ Lane from one side of the road to the other

and from the bottom of^Leppings Lane to the mouth of the junction

with Catchbar Lane.

At 3 p.m.    I heard af radio message which stated that the game had been

put back to 3.15 jp.m.        As a result of the radio messuage and in order

to slow the su^flen influx of fans into the groui>«f, I informed almost

e very   passing   fan that   the kick

                                                    y
3.15 p.m.

At just after 3 p.m.      it was apparent b</th to me and the waiting fans

that the game had in fact commenced./ I could hear the roar of the

crowd inside the ground as could trie fans outside.

A short time after this I h e a r d /another radio message            requesting all

available officers to go onto /h e         pitch.       I shouted to other
                                                                                     PAGE      3

            officers in Leppings Lane to do just this, most were unaware of the

            request as they were not equipped with a radio.
                                                                   blgjl bl£>
            Together with other officers     I joined Sergeant John Morgan on the

            pitch and with him was instructed to go to the rear of the West

            Stand.    At the rear of the stand I entered the tunnel entrance,             it

            was apparent that people were trying to get out of the stand.             Most

            were holding their chest apparently in pain.         I assisted two fans to

            the end of the tunnel where other fans assisted them.           I went back

            into the tunnel where I was confronted by one fan shouting and

            swearing.    I threw one youth over my right shoulder a n d carried him

            out of the tunnel.     It was apparent that this youth had stopped

            b r e a t h i n g , but due to the sheer number and mass of people,   I was

            unable to commence mouth to mouth until he was clear of the tunnel.

            Once outside on the ground he was given mouth to m o u t h , at this stage

            an ambulance arrived.

            Together with the ambulance     crew,   I assisted the injured and together

            with the crew,   transported injured people ferrying them to both the

            Northern General and Hallamshire Hospitals.

            At 7.30 p.m. that evening     I returned to Ecclesfield Police

            Station for other duties.

Police Inspector
h& *
ISr Division

I attended at the ground at 9*20 a.m. - 9-30 a.m. booked in and received a r

I    was     under    the    supervision         of    Chief   Inspector   Creaser   and   Superintendent

Greenwood.

At     the   briefing,      I     saw    all four Serials         and Inspector Sykes,     they were    all

present.

One change in 'E 1 Division, Police Constable Duffy.

I saw Sergeant Payne brief his men.                      He did it well, very professional.          It was

 agreed all would meet at the rear of West Stand, when Inspector Sykes would brief

 the    Serials.      He    had    worked       that   location   in the past and it seemed totally

 applicable he should complete it.

 I was aware after that about safety of the officers under my command.                               I saw

 Sergeant Payne and told him to ensure they were in pairs for the turnstile and to

 keep someone with him.

 Detective Constable Cerrone was with me.

 I saw Sergeant Whitlam.                  He had his Serial well organised, he was familiar with

 his area of responsibility.

    Sergeant Proctor was on the road with Inspector Sykes, who was in overall command

    of the road       area.     As      such,   I decided to superviseall other            Serials   on the

    turnstiles.       I had ascertained there were problems of relief.                 Serial 16 relieved

    Serial    13,    as I thought it pertinent to establish                 their    full duties.      I saw

    Inspector Bullas in the company of Sergeant Payne. We all discussed strategy for

    Phase 2.        It was a concern of mine that we had full cover on half time in that

    West Stand. This        was agreed by Inspector Bullas.

    At Leppings Lane I formed a liaison withthe horsemen, they                       were clearingthe non

    ticket holders.         There seemed to be hundreds, young and old mixed, some drunk.
ROBERT PURDY                             - ^-

The CID were there outside the gatesin the 'pull-in',     everyone seemed to gather

there. We urged people to go into the ground, they seemed reluctant and abusive.

You kept seeing the same faces again and again, some with cans of beer, some with

plastic bottles.

I kept going round all my men.       I also kept seeing the Sergeants and liaising

with the CID.

The fans were very mixed.    I talked with a London woman and her friend, they were

the Liverpool Club London Section.      They were nice but others were not,   and it

was apparent by the general attitude of some of the       Liverpool supporters that

they resented the police presence.

I don't know what time it was but we knew that the trains had arrived just after

2.00 p.m. The CID were outside the shop.     There were ticket touts I think there.

Someone said the horses would clear the pavements as they arrived.      I warned the

CID.

They arrived but it didn't seem as hectic as I thought.     The turnstiles seemed to

        Thseemed      nothing «&©■— ie- at that stage but direct people and inspect

 tickets.

 You could smell the beer in the atmosphere.

 At some stage I went to turnstile A.G.         I had kept checking the turnstile at

 regular intervals.

 Soon after that the crowds were there. All the large perimeter gates were open,

 the funnel was filling, there were others on the river side.      I knew they hadn't

 tickets.   I had that area swept by the horses to get them back out to the road.

 I knelt down on the side bar of the funnel and saw all the PC's on the gate, they

 were struggling but coping.     I checked them.    I saw Police Constable 963 Evans,

 he was red in the face, he seemed to be so busy.        The others seemed to be just

 pressed against the wall.

  I think then I saw Chief Inspector Creaser.         I mentioned my concern for the
ROBERT PURDY                                    3 -



safety of the police officers on the gate.

It was decided to leave the officers in position and to continue to monitor the

situation, which I did.

The horses were assisting us then.       I directed them to assist the turnstiles.         It

was most difficult for them due to the construction and siting of the bar which

acts to funnel them into the turnstiles. They had to start at the back.                  They

tried to get them into queues, but it was a problem.

I just can't remember what happened next.

The next thing was I looked over again.          I stood at the corner of the wall on the

bar, and then climbed up there to achieve a vantage point - I saw the two horses.

There was the 'E ' Division PC from Hackenthorpe at the far side, Police Constable

Evans     in the middle    and Police Constable       Duffy nearest.   I saw the horses go

towards     the   gate.   Police   Constable    Duffy   stumbled but quickly regained his

position.

 I think I saw Inspector Sykes again, maybe Chief Inspector Creaser, I m not sure.

 A decision was made to take the officers out of that area. I stood ort the rail.

 I told    the remaining    officers   to get    out.    They   couldn't   go up the   funnel.

 Police Constable Duffy had tried but had been forced back by the crowd.

 I think there was just Police Constable Evans and the 'El' PC.               I signalled to

 him and he went, I think through the turnstile,           I had been shouting to them, the

 public     'get back, get back.'      Police Constable Evans was left, he couldn t get

 off the wall, he was stuck.       People were just pressing and pushing.        I'm not sure

 now of the order of events.

 I could see people being squashed up at the turnstile walls, the horses had moved

 back.     I think Police Constable Evans was still there, I shouted at him.           He just

 couldn't move, and I was concerned for his safety.

 There was a strong smell of alcohol in the air.             People were throwing things at

  the horses, beer cans and such.         At some point I saw Detective Superintendent
ROBERT PURDY                                        _4_

McKay.     He was behind me           near the river barrier. I do not imagine that he           could

see the crowd to the same             extent as myself due to the vantage point I held.

At some stage I saw that Police Constable Evans got through the turnstile.

They were crushed up against the wall, the turnstile, the far wall, the barrier.

I saw people in pain, suffering.

I saw DetectiveSuperintendent McKay.               He looked        at me and said 'They     11 have to

open the gates or something will happen."

I think I just got back on the rail, but this may be out of sequence.                        There was

a child passed from well in the middle of the crowd to me on the rail.                          He was

limp.     I thought at first he              was dead.     He was limp in my hands.      I   have since

established that ‘the child waspassed tosafety and                   is now recovered.

I think a TV camera was there                 or had been, a man with curly hair,sports           coat,

 about 35-^5, perhaps ITV, BBC.

 There     was another child being either crushed or passed out. We tried to                     get to

 him.      I think Detective Constable Cerrone tried but a man was pulling him back

 saying "He's going in."

 The    pressure was so great then that people              were   crying, screaming. They could not

 move. They    were     pressed     Up   around the bar, the wall and the stiles,

 That child I thought then had been squashed or suffocated in the crush.                          I got,

 down.
 I saw, either           before or after,Superintendent Marshall on the wall                 outside the

 perimeter gate.           He had taken a vantage point to get an overall perception of the

  situation.

  I    went to him, signalled him.             All the side was full now.         I started off.          I

  shouted Detective Constable Cerrone.                   If I had any personal fear of injury this

  was the only time.
  The crowd    a p p e a r e d   uncontrollable and their behaviour was deteriorating.             I was

  pushed, jostled, punched.               Detective Constable Cerrone followed me, I never lost
ROBERT PURDY                              " 5 -

sight of him.When I got     there, I think I had   re-sweptthe side with horses, and

the side gates were     shut.   I remember a bigfat youth   in my way.     I shouted at

him to move.   I sawSuperintendent Marshall.I said "We're going           to have to do

something, someone is going to die."

We mentioned the gates.     He stopped, obviously assessing the situation.      He said

"Open the gates."

The situation was life or death for the public trapped in there.

I returned to the barrier on the side of the turnstile.

I organised the horses to block off the gates at the perimeter.          It seemed that

we could deal with the numbers in there if we contained the people outside. When

that was secure by all the horses, now five perhaps, and uniform PC's, I caused

the gate to be opened down the side.        I think Detective Constable Cerrone was

there and Police Constable Evans.

It was the only way to save life in there at that time.

A throng moved in,      I was pushed to the left. Then I ordered the gate closed,

although they may have already been closed.

 I looked, or someone did, to see if it was clear outside.     It was and I went out.

 The horses were there.

 It had alleviated the situation but people were still trapped on that side bar.

 I pulled them under. Those with tickets were filed through by horses to the open

 gates.   It was orderly. There appeared to be room now.     I then thought it was no

 longer life threatening and the gates were shut again.

 The surges were in two bursts,       the first larger, the secondshort    but a steady

 flow and controlled.

 I saw the Superintendent on the wall again. The people in the funnel had pulled

 back and it appeared safe.

 The Superintendent, signalled for the centre gate perimeter to be opened.           The

 horsemen did this.     It then filled again.
ROBERT PURDY                               - b -

I was somewhere down the side near the river now.

Then,    sometime   after that,   the gate I was   facing opened and it just emptied.

That was the gate on the left when approaching the turnstiles.        I think Inspector

Bennet was sat above it.

It seemed to empty then.      I had not ordered that or knew why it had happened but

I felt initial relief for those people.

The next thing      I can recall is a message either on the system or         radio, saying

"All officers onto the pitch."      This is the first radio message I had received or

heard transmitted for nearly one hour.      I took a Serial, under the supervision of

Police Sergeant Whitlam, around under the command box into South Stand and down

onto the track at Leppings Lane.                              a-          ;   i-

At some point very shortly afterwards I went to the centre of Leppings Lane and

behind the goal.      I saw the extent of the disorder.

Superintendent Greenwood was in the centre, there was only one gate.                There was

not physically room to do anything there.

I moved to my left,       I saw only four ways out for the trapped and injured, to the

front, to the back,left, right even perhaps up.           I decided to    go to the left.

There were no other senior officers there so I took responsibility for that area.

 I climbed on the fence and pleaded with        the fans .to move to my   left, I used my

 arms.    It worked in   part. There were some officersand people now, getting others

 out over the spiked railings.

 I was joined by Inspector Darling.       I remember trying to get a Serial into the

 pen on the left to keep the crowd back so that we could evacuate the injured.

 They did this.

 People started to come out this way.

 I could not continue where I was and I got onto the track again, I carried a

 small person from the gate on my own.      Others wanted to help but I insisted I did

 it.     I carried her or him onto the pitch.      Someone took over then.         I went back
 ROBERT PURDY                                          -   7 -

 and got another person out.

 At the track I could see              spiked railings,          fans boxedin.          No    way out and still

 hostile youths wanting to             invade the pitch and fight.

 I walked along at some point and someone said "That one's dead, try another."                                        I

 saw a blue bar (crash barrier) being hurled over the fence, I thought by the fans

 at the Police.

 I remember dealing with a lad.                    I don't know if this is the one I carried or

 after.       He had a white shirt on.               He was alive.            His breathing was short and

^ rushed.      I put him in the recovery position.                       I kept his airway open.                I kept

 talking to him.          I had to clear his mouth out, it was full of white froth.                              I was

 joined by someone.           Once I thought his breathing was increasing we placed him on

 a board.

  I went back to the gate.             I had instructed a PC to go with each person.                           I spent

  some time then I think with a man with a grey beard.                           I had seen him before but

  thought him dead, then they had attempted to start his heart again.                                       I performed

  heart massage. A doctor or surgeon did mouth to mouth.                         His lungs started to fill

  up then.         I thought he        had a chance.       We kept going for a               number of minutes.

  Someone wanted to take over but I refused.

  I   think    I    carried    him     into   an    ambulance      or     I   carried    one      person       into   an

  ambulance. Someone said he was dead. Police Constable 851 WickeAwas present.
                                                                                                  *


  I can recall an officer saying "They're picking up money." referring to Liverpool

  fans on the pitch, but I said "leave them."

  I think everyone was out now. I tried to re-group people.                              Chief Superintendent

  Nesbit was there in the middle.

  There was some trouble then in the crowd in Leppings Lane.                                 At this point they

  wanted to fight.

   I took three serials and told them to walk to Halifax Road.

   Following       that    tour   of    the    ground      I     spent    some   time        in       the   company   of
ROBERT PURDY                          -   o -

Superintendent Greenwood, concerning the welfare of the officers involved.

I went off duty at 7-30 p.m.

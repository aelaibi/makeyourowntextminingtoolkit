POLICE CONSTABLE 2603



SOUTH YORKS POLICE, ROAD TRAFFIC DIVISION, BARNSLEY



At 8 am on Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duty as MB 2-1 in company with

PC 906 Bagnall in a marked patrol car D539 OWE.                   At a briefing held at Woodall

Services,    we were   designated to cover            the   south bound       exit    slip road,       at

Junction 36, Tankersley.

At 9 am we took up position on the grass verge at the very top of the slip

road,   observing    traffic     and   stayed    in    that       position    until    approximately

2.55 pm, except for a break of half an hour to examine a vehicle in Barnsley

about 10.30 am.

The traffic flow from the motorway was moderate until 11.15 am when it started

to become heavy with private cars and coaches,                     a lot of which were easily

identified    as   football    supporters.       We     stopped      several      buses      which   were

displaying    'Notts   Forest'      signs   in   the    window,      but     which    were    conveying

Liverpool    supporters,      and   requested    that       the    signs     be   removed      to    avoid

confusion later.

Traffic was never that heavy that a back log down the slip road was caused,

and after 12 midday it became quiet again with a normal Saturday traffic flow.

About 1.30 pm traffic became exceptionally light, and I cannot remember any

coaches coming past after that time, this was something that surprised both PC

Bagnall and myself.
At 2.30 pm traffic was so light that it was suggested over the radio that an

early meal be taken, but this was decided against.

At   2.55   pm we    left       Junction    36 to travel       to Woolley     Services     for     meal.

Shortly afterwards the 'operational support' message was passed for vehicles

to attend at the Hillsborough              ground, and directed to Gate 'O' Leppings Lane.

About 3.15 pm as I drove down Halifax Road towards Leppings Lane, I saw groups

of people walking towards the ground.                    Once onto Leppings Lane we encountered

crowds of people walking away from the ground, many spat at the patrol car,

and were shouting and swearing at us.                    I parked the patrol car and we walked

into the ground at Gate 0.            I saw injured people being brought away from the

stands,     and numerous others        laid on the ground alongside               a side wall,      and

opposite,     alongside     a    fencing    by     the    river.     Some   of    these   people    were

obviously dead.

At this time supporters were coming out from the stands, many were obviously

the worse for alcohol, these were swearing and threatening police officers who

were forming a cordon to protect the injured and first aiders.

I went to a side entrance between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road, below the

police control box, and gave assistance to injured people brought                             from the

stands,     and   then    in    company     with    PC     Bagnall   and    two   Doncaster      Traffic

Officers, attempted to keep the rear access road clear for emergency traffic.

At 5 pm we left the ground and began to walk back to the patrol car, again we

were subjected to verbal abuse, and spat at, some Liverpool supporters came

right up to us swearing and pushing.                       I could smell      stale   beer    on their

breath, because of the circumstances neither PC Bagnall or I took any action

against these people, but got into the patrol car and left the scene to patrol

the A6l6 road to Flouche (Penistone).

                     Dear Lord F e r r e r s ,

                                                 Hillsborough   Inquiry

                               I am w r i t i n g you a personal letter following our
                     d e p u t a t i o n on 25th May, 1989, beca u s e I feel that the
                     issues we put to you at that meeting are not being
                     resolved.

                              The Clerk to my Authority has had a letter of
                     1st June, 1989, from Mr. Addison (copy enclosed) and has
                     ex c h a n g e d c o r r e s p o n d e n c e with the Clerk of South Y o rkshire
                     Police Aut h o r i t y (copies enclosed).                I think you will agree
                     that the current p o s it ion is most u n s atisfactory.

                          I know you are to see South Yor k s h i r e in a few d a y s .
                     I hope that as a result of that meeting you will be able to
                     clarify all those issues that we raised with you and accept
                     that the full costs of the Inquiry are a Home Office
                     responsibility.

           FAXIMILE TRANSMISSION


           Dear Mr Astiing
           HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
           Thank you for your letter of 6 June enquiring whether the Chief Constable of
           South Yorkshire had invited the Chief Constable of West Midlands to provide
           mutual aid under Section 14 of the Police Act 1964 or indeed any other
           provision.
           The stance of the Police Authority is that the West Midlands Inquiry is now
           reporting exclusively to Lord Justice Taylor. While the first Initiative to
           call in an outside force to enquire into the events at Hillsborough was made by
           the South Yorkshire Chief Constable, the circumstances surrounding this action
           could not in any case fall under either Section 14 of the Police Act 1964 (a
           point which Mr Addison appears to acknowledge) or any other section of this or
           any other Act.
           Furthermore, the subsequent action by the Home Secretary in establishing the
           Taylor inquiry, the considerably wider remit of this inquiry than what would
           have been originally entailed and the lines of reporting observed by the Chief
           Constable of the West Midlands have taken the inquiry completely out of the
           hands of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and the Police Authority.
           I sent you earlier a copy of my note of an officer level meeting held at the
           Home Office on 18 May and now attach a further copy which may be of assistance.
           Yours sincerely

     F ol lowing my telechnnp conv cr se ti nn with Hr. Walker,        I
refer to the letter dated 1st Juno, 19R9, from the Home
Office to the Solicitor to the Kent Midlands Policc
Authority, a c o d y of which is already with you.

     At the m e et in g between the Wes*- Midlands Police
Authority and the Home Office on ?5th May. we made the
point very s tr ongly that this was a Home Office Inquiry and
should be paid for e nt ir e ly by the Home Office (though we
thought that the Home Office was likely to look to your
Authority to pay costs up to n lp precpot. limit).

        'i'he main thrust of the argument was to the effect that
*he C hief C on s ta b le of the w«*st Midlands had b»en invited
to assist Lord J u st ic e Taylor by the Home Office and was
w or ki ng under the d i re ct io n    control o^ Lord Justice
Taylor.       He had not been invited on a mutual aid basis by
the Chief C o ns ta bl e of South Yorkshire. «nd was c er tainly
not under the d i re ct io n ?nd control of H ip Chief Co ns ta bl e
o^ South Yorkshire.

        It f ol lowed from this that tho West Midlands Police
Authoi'. itv had no cower," to n®et the cost.*? incurred 3 s part
of the Inquiry, nor to se<*k reimbursement froi the South
Y o rk sh ir e Police Authority.  Mr. Addison at <“he Home Office
ack no wl ed ge d that this was not » "mutual aid" situation
under the provi si on s of Section 3 4 of the Police Act, 1364,
but " something akin to mut-u«1 eld" which he could neither
de fi ne nor explain.     H« did, h o w e v e r , m ai nt ai n that the
invitation to Mr. Dear, although transm it te d by way of the
Home Office, actvial ly came from the Chief C o ns ta bl e of
South Yorkshire.       it was                  his s uggestion that all
of the bills be paid by the West Midlands Polic« Authority,
and that South Yor ks hi re b*> r es po nsible for their
reimbursement.

Barnsley,
South Yorkshire,       570 ??o
- Mr.   R. C. Johnston.

- 6th June,   1989.


          Mr. Addison's argument was and is totally
i n c o m p r e he n si b le to us, and his letter of the 1st June
again seems to miss the point of whet he r the Chief
C o n s t a b l e of West Midlands is under the dir ec ti on and
control of Lord Just ic e Taylor or the Chief C o ns ta bl e of
South Yorkshire, nor does it address the d if fi c ul t y that,
whilst the Chief Co ns ta bl e             West Midlands may have a
contra ct ua l obli ga ti on to meet the costs incurred, the West
Midlands Police Authority has no powers to meet them.

          The above is an attempt to set out shortly the
b ac kg ro un d to w he re we are now.   What I think I need from
you now, is a reply stating whet he r the Chief C o ns ta bl e of
South Y o r ks hi re had invited the Chief C o ns ta bl e of West
Midlands to provide mutual aid under Section 14 of the
Police Act, 1964, or any other provision (whatever that
might be), and whet he r the South Vo rk sh ir e Police Authority
is prepared to meet the total costs incurred by the Chie^
C o n s t a b l e of West Midlands In the conduct of this Inquiry
and to pay the bills direct.                                      " '

     I shall be pleased      if a   faxed reply could be sent to
me as soon as possible,      so the matter can be out back to
the Home Office.

                        Yours   sincerely.

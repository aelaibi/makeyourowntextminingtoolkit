              On     15th April        1989    (150489)     I a tt e n d e d the FA Cup Semi-Final                  football

              m at ch at H il lsborough,      As a result of w hich 1 completed a
                  QS(_ f5ST
              Q u es ti on na ir e w ith officers from the West Midlands Police,



               I would       like to add to the            i n f o r m a t i o r/ 1    gave on the day          1 was on the

               pitch and           I assisted     carrying      people/on a dv er ti si ng              h o a r dings across

               the     pit c h .



               The    first        person    I carried was a white male age<y about 35 years,                               abou

               5 ' 8 i!~ 5 ’9" tall,        me di um build.       He had me di um             l/ngth    curly black      hair.

               1 think       that he ha d a m o u s t a c h e .         I think         he/was wearing a maroon

               coloured shirt and grey slacks.                            cannot        rafmember      if he had shoes on

           _ or not.          He was        lying on the grass at t h e ;/ i q h t               side    of the     penalty
                                                                                                      P AGE    2
                                                                                                      S3831

     area.      I helped to      put him onto an adve r tj/gfing hoarding                  and    carried

     him wit h others        to the     other    end of tbe ground.             His    face    looked grey

     and someone        said he was      dead.     He jaid look dead to me.                Whe n we

     a r r i v ed at   the other     end of the/g ro un d we          put him onto       the     grass.

     S omeone      s tayed wit h him and time rest of us went                  back.



     I carried about another 3 m                 4 people on the a dv er ti si ng             hoardings,

     but    I cannot     remember anything about              them.       I do remember        that one of

     them had a jumper          or      blanket over      the/ face.



' T V * 1 also went     into Pen 3 and helped/io              carry someone        out of the       pen and

     onto    the    pitch.    He was a whita^ male about 43 years                     of age.      He was

     fat,    about     IS stone.      He w as /about 5 8 IQ" tall.             He just     had white

     u nderpants       on.   He was     cle/n shaven.          He   had    light   hair.       When we got

     him onto the        pitch the s j( J o h n ’s Am bu la nc e were          trying    to    revive him

     with    heart massage.



     I then went off to find the                friends   1    came   to the m atch with.             I

     event ua ll y found them all,          a nd /t he n after a while,            left.



     I have seen myself          on the JBBC helping           to   carry    people across         the    pitch.



     On the day        I was wearing a blue         shirt      that    looks    like denim.         1 had a

     g reen s weatshirt       that at some        stage   I took      off and tied a ro u n d my

     waist.        I had dark    blue    trousers and white           trainers,

     tall with dark hair and             clean shaven.

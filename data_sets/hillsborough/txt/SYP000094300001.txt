majority         of these          supp o r t e r s    sh o u l d    be    loaded on buses and escorted

to the        football       ground.          Several         buses were s u m m o n e d and as                  planned

all      the N o t t i n g h a m    fans were          placed on P S V ’y              two P C ’s being           placed on

each      bus    (unable      to      say how many P S V ’s , v<Je 1 ieved no more                         than three ) .

Having       successfully             c o mpleted this              g^e rat ion the entire                unit    then went

and      parked outs i d e          the    football         ground         in order       that the         officers who

had      t r a v e l l e d on the       bus   could be          picked up.             I believe          that    this was

shortly         before 3       pm     (1300),         at   this      time      the    units     radios were still

on Channel          43,    and      not the       dedicated             football       channel.           As we awaited

the arrival           of those          officers           I became aware             of a number          of dog vans

and      police     o f f i c e r s making        their way             hurriedly        towards       the   police

From      the obvious          urge n c y of the             officers,          I s w i t c h e d my      radio    from

C hannel        43 to the          football
                                          channel, and the first mess a g e I recall

unit was         instructed           by Insp M A R T I N           to alight, from the              van and make

their way          into    the      ground via the e n t r a n c e                1 have m e n t i o n e d       previously,

The      unit were        then      left a s s e m b l e d      t o g ether at         the entra n c e       to the

went      onto     the    pitch to e s t a b l i s h e x a c t l y what was                    happening.          I

recall       walking       onto       the football            pitch and my a t t e n t i o n s were

im m e d i a t e l y d rawn        to the L e p p i n g s Lane             end.       That are a was         crowded

myself were           approached           by a Chief           Inspector.             I ’m a f r a i d    I am unable

   With regard to Part VII, the interim report, is it agreed we see Mr

      Bownes as suggested?


      A number of Solicitors representing Police Officers have written to
      us requesting early disclosure of the Video and Photographic
      evidence we intend to refer to in interview.        They feel this will
      help the interviews proceed more smoothly.        Can we disclose such
      material now or should we only do so during interview?


      the    PUBT.TC INQUIRY TRANSCRIPTS


      These transcripts are referred to quite a lot.        The questions

      raised are;


      (a)     Can we refer to them in interview?
      (b)     Can we introduce them by asking the person eg Chief
              Superintendent David Duckenfield, "Are these accurate and do

              you agree to us referring to extracts?"
       (c)    Do we avoid them altogether in interview terms and explain
              this to the Solicitors representing those to be interviewed?



      rriRPflRATR MANSLAUGHTER


       Are there any special areas to cover in interview in this field,
       eg:    With the Directors of the Club we will need to clarify exactly
              their position but should we then attempt to obtain written
              ma t e ri a l /documents proving their position and status plus

               perhaps their responsibilities within the Club?



       CULPABLE MALFEASANCE


       As above.


       Any special areas which we need to cover to prove this offence in

       respect of all parties to whom it relates?


       After each interview the full transcript will be forwarded to you.
                  TEL: 0213596735                 11,04,90    15 :57 No .




Normally we would finish with -The facts will be reported- etc.


However,   do   you wish to read the transcripts first to see If there
.re other matter, that need clarification before that point?
we could either re-see the person and inform him, "The facts etc,
or do . formal letter to that effect as quickly as possible.


It may be that some parties do not wish to be interviewed, for
example, I have a letter from Dr Eastwoods Solicitors that arrived
today in response to a preliminary letter from Assistant Chief
 constable Hr Jones.     This   letter quotes Lord Justice Taylor, states
 Mr Eastwood wishes to help, refers to being interviewed under
 caution as causing Or Eastwood concern and disquiet and finishing
 off saying that if we send our written questions to them Dr
 Eastwood will reply in writing through his Solicitors I


 If this happens in other cases how do we approach it?


  ie/   Is the evidence sufficient to arrest?     My view is that
        not in any of the cases but we need to consider the options.


  I do not believe this will be a problem with the South Yorkshire
  police Officers because of the individual complaints made but again

  we should prepare for this eventuality in all cases.


  Advice is therefore sought at this stage.

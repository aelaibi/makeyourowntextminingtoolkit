the Ho p     I had       cause    to remove a can of beer                from one fan tho ugh it ^

was    impossible         to do a ny th in g about           the fan due to the              enormous

amo un t   of    people     in the stand and the                crush that we were               in,   the

beer    being m e r e l y       removed from his            hand an d    poured away.             Several

times      during this          jour ne y t h ro u gh the       crowd    in the stand myself and

PC B e l l e m y who was         still    w it h me were fo rc ed backwards                  by the       crowd

surging and         I was       fearful     at that        t ime a nd fans a r ou n d me also

appeared         in a similar          frame of min d to myself.                We had to fight our

way thro ug h the          crowd       in order       to   return to our serial.                 Several       times

during      the j o ur n ey a y ou ng          girl    who was     in front      of me was         forced

backwards        by the       crowd and        I had to      push her forwards             to hold her          in

an upright         position.           I was    relieved w he n we e v e nt u al l y             reached our

serial w hi ch was            now v ir t ua l ly      cut off from other           officers         in the

g ro u nd and as         far as       I could see wer e the            only officers             in the Kop.

I then became            part    of the     barrier a ga in betw ee n the two opposing

groups and         crowds       of    people were          crushed up against          us both on the

Li ve rp oo l     side a n d the N o t t i n g h a m Fo re st         side    of the human barrier.

of the      barrier       f a in te d due      to the      crush and      I pulled him to the

L iv er po ol     side    of the       barrier a n d        laid him down at the             back of the

Liverpool         s e ct io n and to gether w it h PC B e l l e m y we a id ed him.                       He   came

round after a short                  time and we       cleared a space          for    him at       the    back

and sat him down.                His    name was                from N o t t i n g h a m    he    remained

there      for a while          then    I do not       know where       he went.

AT 3 . 0 4 p m    I saw a large          number       of fans    spilling       onto       the    pitch from

the L ep pi n gs       Lane     s ta nd and     I,, thought     there     had been an            invasion of

the    pitch.        I. c o nt in ue d to w a tc h for several               minutes.        Th e m ood of the

        several                  minutes                  I heard    something          about     f atalities       in the     ground.          I

        was          then d ir ec te d                      by my S er geant        to escort            a group of L iv erpool          fans

        in our                  section out                  of the ground as                they w i sh e d to leave.           This    I did

        t ogether w ith other                                    officers a ga in        including          PC Bellemy.        We escorted

        them through the Notts.                                      Forest       fans       to the middle         entrance      into the

        Kop where we                          parted             company with them.               The     jour ne y t h rd u gh the      crowd

        this          time did not appear as when                                   I last made my way t h ro u gh the                   fans,,

        there wasn't as m uc h of a crush,                                          once you          had    cleared the section

        where           our barrier was.

        On reaching                      the middle                 e ntrance      to the Kop my self and PC B el l em y were

        approached                     by a young                  man and his father,               the younger        m a n said he was

        a Doctor and w a n t e d                                 to help on the          pitch       could we get him down

        there.                  Myself and PC B e ll e my e sc or t ed him out of the s tand and down

        onto          the         pitch during                     this journey          I recall         seeing    several      drunken

        fans          towards                the           back    of the Kop and at              the    back    of the turnstiles.

        We took                  the Doctor                  down to the          pitch together w ith his                  father

        and          I saw numerous                          people      being     carried        past me on bill            boar ds    some

        dead          person             I recal 1 ^was a large fat male w i t h an orange T shirt

        pulled over his                                   face,    I did see other             people       that a p p e a r e d d ea d but         I

        cannot                  recall           what        they    looked       like.        The    people were       being     carried

        by both fans and Police                                      officers,          the    scene was        chaotic a n d I felt

        h o r r i f i e d a t 'w ha t                       I was    seeing.        I tried to            comfort some        d is tr au gh t

        fans          that were- near me they were                                  upset        though they did smell               of drink

        I c a n Hd e f i n i t e l y say that.                              I then w al k ed         onto the       pitch a nd saw

te nd e d to the fan,          the fan was about           thirty     stocky    build w i t h jeans            on.

I then saw fans            running     down the    pitch from the d i r e c t i o n of the

L ep pings     Lane    s tand and we were         o r de re d by either an         I nspector      or

Chief    Inspector         to form a     line across       the    pitch to      prevent     disor de r

message       to   clear    the    ground w h ic h was about 40 minu te s              on the    pitch,

the scene was still               chaotic,   during     this     time    numerous L i ve rp oo l        fans

were abus iv e        towards      us and a lot were drunk.               Some    still a p p e a r e d    to

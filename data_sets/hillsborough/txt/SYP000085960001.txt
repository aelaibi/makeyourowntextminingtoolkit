and were         seeking        refuge    on the grass at            the side.



1 then saw what a p p e a r e d to be a body being passed down over people.

After       the teams          came    out and were warm i n g         up,    there was a n o t h e r      surge

forwards and            people were         clearly      in d i s c o m f o r t at   the front      of    the

terracing.            One      lad jumped out and was             tugging at Bruce G R O B E L A R ' S

shirt and then A lan H A N S O N / ' n a 11 the time,                   there was quite            clearly,

I then decided                that    it was    quite    clearly an e m e r g e n c y and         I left    the

stand and went                outside and       I saw Police         coming     in who said that           they

had    received a radio mess age                     to the effect       that    there was a riot           in

I. d is ag r e e d w ith them and              I said that      I was a nurse and             I wanted      to

I have           since f ound out               that    she has     been d i s c h a r g e d from H o s p i t a l .



Lots        of    people         had been b rought             on to the     pitch,        the Police were          just

trying           to form a         line across           the    pitch.



The Fore st              s up p o r t e r s were       just    chanting abuse and             I s t o p p e d a young

lad going              f or w a r d to    r e m o n strate w i t h them.



At     this       stage         there was a message              to the    effect that           people      should get

however,              w i th an y of the ambulances.                   There were          no r e s u s c i t a t i o n kits

that        I went         to was       dead



I then           relieved a relative,                   who was     trying     to give m outh to m outh

chance           of    r es us ci t a t i n g    this    particular       person.



I w o r k e d from              right    to     left an d      put s o m ething       over the heads of those

who were              quite      clearly dead.



I w o r k e d with __________ M for a time                        <he was      the Doctor         from Liverpool

1 was     going     from    person to^ p e r s o n doing          the best that      I could.       The

P o l i ce w ere    looking at me?           soNje of then just        idly standing        by.     They

looked at me as            I was     crazy.



It was as        if they were         shell     shocked.      Unfortunately        the St Johns

A m bu la nc e a s s i s ta nt s    were    quite    clearly out      of their     depth.



I then went         to the Forest           end of the     ground.,    I had seen that         some

people       had been taken on stretchers                 to that     end of the ground.



One P o l i c e ma n a sk e d me whether            or not a particular          person was       dead,    i.

looked at this           person      but he was      quite    clearly dead.


                                              N.       o n
I then went wit h a Doctor                  to t hb g y m na s i.u m a rea,   thinking    that     there

was    something        that   I could       possibly do for the          people who      had been

badly     injured.



I n i t i a l l y our   path was      blocked by a line of Police O f f i c e r s and we                  had

to expl a i n who we were             before     they w o u l d   let us through.

I there met a Doctor                in the gym and        I a s k e d him what     I could do to

help.



He a s k e d me to take            over    r e s u scitating a man,     but,    he had a l r e a d y   died



There were         other   people         outside   the gym who were          not being a t t e n d e d

to,    but   there did not seem to be any major                      injuries     outside    the gym,       I

just    put those        people      in a recovery        posit i o n and     I told their

relatives       M/hat    to do.

In the gym n a s i u m there a p p e a r e d to be               lots      of bodies all      covered up.



I a sk e d a Police          Inspector where           the    injured were.



He    showed me and          I com f o r t e d someone who was               concussed.       1 then saw ■■&

young     boy?                   . who    needed oxygen and               I a sked   the amb u l a n c e men to

get    oxygen       but    the ir tanks were          empt y .     E v e n t u a 11y we got a tank          that

had some          oxygen    in it,       but    it did appear        that     the amb u l a n c e    had been

returning          from H o s pital      at this time,         wit h       empty oxygen tanks.

I eve nt u a 11y got a n o x yg e n ta n k .



I also       needed scissors             to open a jacket and               I asked    the F irst Aid

people       if they knew w here               I could obtain scissors.                They   sug g e s t e d

from the First Aid               post w hich was on the other                  side of the ground.                i

saw    people a ct u a l l y      counting m oney amidst all                  this mayhem.           I went

over and         I a sked them for a pair of s c i ssors and they just                              looked at,

me as     if I was mad.             I was      so   concerned and a n n o y e d that          I ti.             over

the table with all               the m on e y on      it.     Eventually a Policeman                 qave

me a pocket             knife,   but     it was almost        impossible         to use    this      to cut

open s o m e b o d y ’s jacket w hi c h was            n ec e s s a r y    it took me a good 5 to 6

m in u t e s .



I then got an oxygen                tank       from a Doctor        who a s k e d me to make an a i r w a y

for    somebody.



All    the       time    it did not appear           that    the a m b u l a n c e men did not         know      the

order of          priorities and          they were asking           me who      they should take           next

to the       hospital.



1 then helped s o m e bo dy else with r e s u s c i t a t i o n for about 10 minutes,,
                                                                                                    PAG E           6
                                                                                                    baULC

I was       too   late however.



T here was a lad lying               on the floor w i t h a broken               l e g , there were      no

s t r e t c h e r s and the A m b u la nc e m a n a s k e d me what       to d o , I told him to

use a chair and to             put him       in a proper      p o s ition before moving            him.



It was at this stage                that    the Police Offi cers         produced their mini              bus

to take       the    people who had fractures             to h o s p i t a l .



I then       came across a man who had a f r a c t u r e d f e m u r , who was                   screaming

b oth w i t h     pain a n d despair         because    he did not know where              his    14 year

old son was and a s s u r e d me that a l t h o u g h he had fallen down,                         he had

pushed his son to one                side    in order    that   he did not fall            on top of him.



I t ried to tell            him that       his   son was alri g h t    but       really    I did not know.



He w a nt ed me to go a w a y and find his son but                     that w ould have           been

imposs i b l e .



I could not          find a n y splints at all           in the a m b u l a n c e    for    this man,         but

eventually          I found a very          large splint and        I did the best          that    I could

for   him.



1 e v e n t u a l l y went back into the ground and I met up with my boyfriend,

people      were walking        around       in a daze.



I e v e n t u a l l y got    back    to Liverpool       and   I we nt to the Ever ton Mat ch and

to the Semi Final.              I did this on both occ a s i o n s           just     to prove to

m y se lf    that    it is    possible       to go to a f o o t b a l 1 m a t c h and for there

not   to be a tragedy.
           As     a Nurse    I' felt   that    it was my duty to do all   that   I could   to he if

           those    in distress and the day          in question.

                                                                                           3 IGNED

              terminus      and up the stairs.                      There are          n o r m a l l y stewards at        the     top of

              the     stairs      to show      people where               to sit       but    on this       o c c a s i o n there were

              not and we had to find our own seats.             As p r e v i o u s l y said we were                                  in

              (■1443)      I could see that                the    ground below us was                    filling    up.    My

              b oy fr i e n d went     down to          look a r o un d and he               came    back up shor t l y and

              said that        it was a b s o l u t e l y          chocksr       block       down there.           He   had been to

              Hillsborough          the year         before,           and before           this    tragedy had even begun

              to happen,          he said that             people were           going       to be harmed as            people were

being     crushed downstairs.                     We   could see the mai n body of the                       terracing

from where we were               sat and          could see        the    two side       parts.        The    two

sides had only a handful                     of     people     in and the m a i n section was                  getting

m ore and more           packed.          At about 2 .55            pm    (1455)      we saw e v e r y b o d y

enmasse      surge forw a r d and then back.                        You    could see that            people were

u n s te ad il y moving about.                It was obvious              to me    that something was

going     to happen.           In the kop end at A n f i e l d whe n                   people        move

b a ckwards and forwards                 e ve ry b o d y    is st e a d y on their          feet     but     not at

H i l l s b o r o u g h - there were          too many         people      on the terracing.                 I saw the

players      come on and          they were kicking                 the    ball    around      before        kick-off..

Eve n before          t h e k i c k — off w h i 1 e p 1a y e r s we r e k i c k i n g the           b a 11 a r ouri d

you    could see kids            climbing           the wire m e sh tryytfij to climb over.                         In

fact    I saw some          climb over            on to the        space bef o r e      the    pitch.        You

could see       people       helping         people        I saw      a / m a n who    looked dead being

passed over and             I saw a St Johns A m b u l a n c e ma n trying                     to    resuscitate

him.     This was         before       the    kick off. / T hen they had the kick                          off and

after a couple            of m in u t e s     I could /see an awful                surge      forw a r d and        panic

As    I have said,          I have   been to tjne kop before, when everyone is pushed

but    it was     nothing        like that it, was panic.  Sheer pandemonium.  I told

rny boy f r i e n d              to    look and more            people were           trying    to get        out.        I

said    something was            really wrong,             people were         spilling        out on to          the

pitch.       I saw one         lad     run out and he was                 pulling at A l a n H A N S O N ’S

shirt and was            pointing       towards         the   crowd to show what was                   going      on.

He g ra b b e d at Bruce G R Q B B E LA R and                 I saw      p ^ p l e being      resuscitated.

Peo p l e w ere       screaming        all   ar o u n d rne              I knew something was wrong.

The    referee        blew his w hi s t l e and thsr players went                       off and        the    c rushi n>:

was    still    going      on.        1 then h e a r y a m e s s a g e       over      the ta n n o y telling

people     to get off          the     pi t o h .      Jr saw Po l i c e of f 1 cers rush i ng t o t he

fence.       I initially thought                  limat they were           going      to help the           people

but    in fact        they were        telljmg         them to get         back.       It was       too    late     for

that.        I saw one         lad      pulling at       the wire meshing and                 I saw a P o l i c e m a n

trying       to stop him.               By then,     1 had well         had enough.             I ran down the

stairs and dawn another                     set of stairs         to the       gates where you               come        in.

I saw Police            officers         there and       I said that          I was a nurse and asked

what       I could do to help.                At that         point    one officer          said that he heard

that       there was a riot              going    on and       I told him that            it was       not    so,        and

ex pl ai ne d what was            happening.           I then went           with the Police O f f i c e r

a r o u n d to the        pitch and saw that              police       officers       were making a i i ne

across       the     pitch.       As     I got    onto    the    pitch towards            the Forest          end

there was a girl               on the ground.                  I said    I was a nurse.                I could see

that       she was      unconscious.             Beca u s e    of her    state       of u n c o n s c i o u s n e s s     and

the    state of her eyes                 I a sked whether         or    not    she was epileptic.                    1 was

told       that    she was      not and       I pinched her            ear to br i ng her            round .         I

s t op p e d an a m bulance             man for an air way as                she was      'gagging'          and he

didn't       have     one.      X then a s k e d ar o u n d       for a comb or something,                       ana

told her that             I was      going    to do.          1 had her on her            side and         I tried         to

pull       her tongue        forward.         Then     I saw three           lads    came     running        up wit h a

board.        I stopped         them and told them to                  lift    her     sideways        on to keep

her a ir w a y       clear and          I told them to tell             the a m b u l a n c e men that              she

m ig h t    need sucking          out      but w ould     certainly          need oxygen.            I got         up and

went       towards      the goal        mouth.       There was a man who                looked       like a Chiet

A m b u l a n c e m a n there,       and    I said that         I was    there       to help where             I    cou   Iq .

It was       i n s t i n et f.hat was        driving me forward.                Then,       right      in front           of

the    g r o u n / t h a t 'do 1 lapsed,         I saw someone who was                 being      r e s u s c i a t e d by

a doctor.          \ H e J > o l d me    to take     over,      but    there was        nothing        down        for him

or the other            people,         there was      nothing        that    could be done.               Wh i l s t     i.

was    resusciting,            the Po l i c e were        still mak i n g a line across                    the      pitch.

 The Forest           fans were          chanting.        I saw a lad start               to run

towards       to Forest         crowd and         I caught       hold of him before he got                         passed,

me.        I told him not to go there and he said he w a n t e d                                to get at           the

             X was           just      going     from body to b o dy until                   e v e r y b o d y that was       injured

             was    seen to and                 it seems         to me that          the    people who were            left      on the

             pitch were a c t ua ll y dead                       people*           E a c h time    I saw an a m b u l a n c e man,

             w he t h e r         it was a hospital               am b u l a n c e man,      or someone        from St J o h n ’s

             Am bu la nc e Brigade,                  they d i d n ’t seem to have                  enough equipment,               0 a ygen

             tanks were                empty and there was                no r e s u s c i t a t i o n equipment         and      really

             nothing              to assist.          E v e r y b o d y was        compl e t e l y out    of their        depth.         1

             went with a doctor                      to the       gym.        He    in fact was asked           to go to the             gymn

             and     1 w ould say that this was well after 3 . 3 0                                     (1530)       or 3 . 4 3    pm

             (1545)          and by then             I just       say that          I had    lost all       sense of time.               As

             we got          towards        the gym there were                     policemen      standing      outside          in a
                                 /
             row.           It w ould appear               that       they were        blocking      the way,        blocking          people

             who    hid w a n te d to get                  in.        After we e xp l a i n e d who we were and what we
                        j
             w ere/doing,                they   let us         in.      I a sked        a senior       police       off icer what
                    /
             was ^vappening and he said that                              the       "dead are       there"     pointing          to the

             bodies          "and the w al ki ng w o un de d are that way."

             The    gym was split                 in to two and               I left       the dead,      and went        to assist

             the wounded.                  I star t e d        to resuscitate a y oung                 lad.     There was an

             a m b u l a nc e          outside       the    gym       parked up and there was a                surg e o n helping

             out.           There were          loads and             loads    of bodies        lined up       with     their      faces

             covered.                 There must       have       been at          least    thirty or forty bodies                 easily.

             By    then          it was     towards        4     pm    (1600).        There was        just    no organisation.

             The a mb ul a n c e men d i d n ’t know M/ho                          to take     next and       there was a group

             of about                eight medicajt         students          also assisting.             There was a surgeon,

             there was                 a Doctor ^shtort and he is the                      g e n t l e m a n that   I went       in with,

             a Chinese                 House 0 f J i cer from the hospital.                        I think a l t o g e t h e r     there

             were       about          ten or/ f if te en doctors.                   I only ever met           one other          nurse

             and    by co i nc i derj/ce she                lives       not very far           from where       1 do.         In so far

             as    the       dead arj$/ con c e r n e d           it seemed to me              that anyone          with any

medical       knowledge was           certifying         people dead.              There was       no one

specific,          there was       no time for that.                 Someone       was   checking     the

injured       to see who        sh o u l d go first           into    the amb u l a n c e    but    it w a s n ’t

until      m uch    later on that anyone was                   checking          on the dead bodies.



So far as those             that    I had a t t em pt ed        to    resuscitate         I simply      reached

the    c o nclusion that they were                  dead and suppose               in a way,       although        1 am

not s u p p o s e d to,      was    certifying          that    people were          dead.      I really think

that    people were          f ri gh t e n e d    to take      the    initiative.           We were at        the

oppastie       side of       the St Johns Amb u l a n c e             room and the a m b u l a n c e         men

just    didn't       seem to know what              they were         doing,       they d i d n ’t seem       to be

able    to assess       what was          going on.           There was          no oxygen,     airways,

s u c t i o n machines       and    they had been to and                   from the Hospital          and just

s eemed      to be    coming       back wit h nothing.                I certified some             people     dead

a n d as     I said    I am     not    s u p posed      to do this,          but    no one     else was

availabl e.          I w ould      simply        feel   the    neck for a pulse and that                 sort          of

thing.        I had helped          the     injured      in the gym.              Then   I saw a young            lad

w ith broken         ribs    gasping        for    breath.          What    was    happening was        that       I

was    following       the    doctor        around,      he w ould say what was                needed go on to

the    next    injured       person and           2 would do what            he said.       E v e r y time    I

a s k ed for something             I c o u l d n ’t get       it.     I was       in the gym until           about

3.30    pm    (1730).        A fter we       had    cleared all            the    injuries we were           then

going      through the        pockets        of the dead to            put       their   belongings      in

plastic       bags and       left     the    plastic      bags on top of the bodies.




                            1 met     some N o t t i n g h a m stude n t s         outside who       gave me a

cup of tea.           I s u dd en ly      realised that my b o y f r i e n d was               not wit h me.

He had my tickets             home and m oney etc.                   I asked       someone     if they had

seen him and          if they       could do anything.                 No one       could help me,           no one

             knew whatto           do.         W hen    I e v e n t u a l l y went back       out to the      pitch there

             were     only about          twenty       people       there.      I     c o u l d n ’t work out how to get

             home and that           is        what was        on my mind at that             time.     I spotted my

             b o yf r i e n d   in the         far     corner and shouted towards                him.     I met a young

             man who was           hysterical          because       he had     lost    his mates.                    my

             bo yf ri en d offe r e d to take              him home.          I never      realised until            I was

             about      to leave the e n or mi ty              of    it all.         I looked aro u n d me and all               1

             could see was           that      the     fencing was wrecked?               there were         personal

             b elongings        and debris all             a r o un d me.      I w a l k e d out      of the g r o u n d and.

             was walk i n g        up and e v e nt ua ll y got on a bus an d by then                         it was aoout

 ^           3.4 0    pm    (1740)       and   I still      d i d n ’t know just          how m any     people were

             dead.         We were herded off              the bus and          in to the       station       like    cattie

             and the        phones were         just     too    busy but       police      officers at the            station

             were     very kind and they kept                   telling       people      to phone      home?       to make

             sure     that      relations        in Li v e r p o o l   knew,        that at    least,     we 'were alright.

             At trie gym we did all                  that we        could but        I cannot    say wit h         c e rtainty

             who     the    dead    people were          that       I had cer t a i n l y said were          dead and         I do

             not     believe       that a ny b o d y else would              n e c e s s a r i l y be able    to    identify

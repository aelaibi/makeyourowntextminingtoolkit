FA/HILLSBOROUGH

              telephoned. He had looked up Kelly's evidence
at page 49 day 25 letter D and he would prefer that there
was Q0| element of unfairness^in selecting Hillsborough for
the second year running.   He agreed he was wrong to say it
had something to do with geography.   I said I would mention
it and put it in if we agreed.

Subsequently attending John Dyson and saying that we had a
fax from the FA on comments. Most of them were dealing with
semantics and I had either incorporated them or felt they
did not need to be dealt with. The principal point that was
being made was that the document should be sent from the
Football Association and the Football League.  I thought
there were problems with that because a lot of what we were
saying in   document was only FA material. JD entirely
agreed and said the way to deal with it practically would be
for the Football League to write in and say that they
endorsed all the comments made on interim recommendations.

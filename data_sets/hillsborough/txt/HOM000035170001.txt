     Dear Sir Patrick,                                            ,


     Please find enclosed a copy of a letter sent to the Rt Hon
     Kenneth Baker M.P.     the 22;;,QQ*|<
                                         b ber 1991 a copy was also sent
     to Mr Peter Kilfoyle M.P. I am writing this letter to you because
     I have had a prompt^tfeply to all my previous correspondence to
     you.

     I have yet to receive a reply from Mr Baker and I wondering if
     you could prompt him into replying ,you will no doubt read the
     letter I sent Mr Baker in it I stated that Mr David Duckenfield
     the man in overall charge would exercise his rights and retire,he
     did.

     I know Mr Baker is extremely busy but to take four months to
     answer a letter I think is disgraceful,I just hope being his
     superior you can at least get him to reply.



     Y^ui^s sincerely

                                                       22 October 1991

    Dear Mr Baker

    I have enclosed an article which I cut from a newspaper in 1989 I
    kept this article because some months previously my 14 year old
    son Philip was killed in the Hillsborough Disaster.

    I am therefore very concerned to what,if anything,has been done
    to achieve the improvements requested by the Home Affairs
    Committee, as mentioned in the enclosed article?

    Two and a half years after an inquiry by the Rt.Hon.Lord Justice
    Taylor found that the main cause of the disaster was due to lack
    of Police Control and Leadership,both outside and inside the
    ground, We the bereaved,are still in a situation which is
    allowing,(1) people to exercise their right to early retirement
    and (2) the man in overall charge Mr.David Duckenfield to
    postpone his hearing before the Police Complaints Authority due
    to the fact that he is on sick leave,suffering from a stress
    related illness.

   Mr.Duckenfields 90 days sick leave is up on the 24th October
   1991 and I am certain he is going to exercise his rights and
   retire so he will not have to face any charges.

    I would also like you to explain to me how an officer can be
    considered 'on sick leave ' when he was suspended on full pay on
    4th August 1989 and as far as I am aware,is still not reinstated
    if a man is not on duty,how can he be considered on sick leave?.

   In my opinion the Home Office has dragged it feet over this
   issue,and I firmly believe believe that it is in the Public
   Interest to know just how the requests for improvements to enable
   the Police Complaints Authority to discipline Police Officers and
   therefore make them accountable has been dealt with so far,it
   begs the question,has it in fact been shelved in the hope that
   the public will forget it ?- or has it in fact been implemented
   without public knowledge thereby allowing the police to use the
   outdated system,knowing that the public are unaware that the new
   system exists?.

    Either way, I feel it is now time that we had some answers,
    because if Mr.Duckenfield is allowed to retire on medical
    grounds,and I have stated my feelings of this, it must also be
    remembered ,and fully taken into account,that he was not ill on
    the day of the Hillsborough Disaster,it should also be taken into
    account that he lied,and admitted that he lied about the cause of
    the Hillsborough Disaster,and in my opinion,everything he has
    handled throughout his Police career is now open to question.

    I look forward to an early reply.




    Yours sincerely

 Stronger
 police
 watchdog
 urged
 by Peter Archer
MEASURES to strengthen
th e P o lic e C o m p la in ts
Authority were urged yester­
day by its chairman and a se­
lect committee of MPs.
   The all-party Home Affairs
Committee says improve­
ments in the system of deal­
ing with complaints against
police would reinforce public
confidence.
   Liverpool-born Sir Cecil
Clothier QC, who retires to­
day after four, years as the
authority’s first chairman,
also called for changes in the
authority’s role.
   Sir Cecil has castigated
some police forces for delay­
ing disciplinary proceedings
and failing to prosecute them
with vigour. He has accused
others of “trying every con­
ceivable tactic" to dissuade
the authority from pressing
charges,
  Tlie MPs’ repqrt says the          I
loophole in police regu«             I
lations which allows officers        j
to e s c a p e d is c ip lin a r y   ■
charges by retiring on medf-         ,
cn l g ro u n d s onoKld be          1

        Freedom
    Other recommendations in-
                                     ,
                                     |
 elude:
    O Freedom to supervise all       |
 cases involving issues of           !
 public interest;
   O Time limits, to be intro­
duced by the end of the year,        ;
to eliminate delays in disci­
plinary proceedings;
   • Powers to keep PCA
inquiries confidential.
   The MPs shared growing
concern over the increase in
the cases of officers retiring       ;
while under investigation,           i
The com m ittee said the
Home Office should set up a
board to review all such ap­
plications for medical retire­
ments.
   Tougher action should be
taken even when an officer is
found to be unfit and granted
medical retirement.
   Judge Francis Petre, who
has sat at the Old Bailey
since 1982, is to be the new
chairman of the Police Com­
plaints Authority, Oownlqg
Street announced yesterday.

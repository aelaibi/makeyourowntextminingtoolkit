                  At S. Q O a m on S a t u rd ay       15 April      1989    I had    commenced duties at

                  H i l l s b o r o u g h Football     Grou nd    for the semi        final      matcfy between

                  Liverpool            and N ot ti n g h a m Forest,       I was    part of Ser/al                 13 under     the

                   command of           Inspector Bui las.         By   11.15 a ,r n I had taken up my

                   d e s i g na te d    position    in the West S tand w hich was at the bottom of the

                   steps     on the stand,          on the walk w a y       in front        of   row' number          o n e , and at

      W           a position above and. s l i ghtly to the, left' d~f the Leppings Lane

                   entrance        tunnel»                                  -

                   H a v in g worked at this           location -on numerous            occasions             in the       past my

                   initial        thoughts were        that   the terracing          had begun to fill                 up
                                                                                                        ..     /                      /
                   ex tr em el y quickly.           i had been       informed that           the g a t ej( w ould be oPvg/ned.

                        12 noon and the first              trickle      of supporters            came        into    the    stand and

                   onto     the    ter rac i ng shortly after           12 noon.        Most      of the supporters
                                                                                                      SI 091

coming       onto the terracing             stayed on the          central    portion       leaving ample

room on the flanks.                 with up to an hour             before    the s'tart of the match

the middle          section of the          terracing was          considerably^fjrfl1 , however               I

w o u ld   not     consider a n y t h i n g wrong with this              or be     in any way unusual.

The    crowd was quite             noisy but g e nerally           in a good mood.           W i t h fifteen

minu t e s    before     the start         of the game       the    central       area had become            quite

compact       but yet a gain there was still                  large areas unused on the

flanks.          By this     time    I had been standing with                Inspector B u l l a s for

quite      some time.

I had been a p p r o ac he d         by members          of the Liverpool          crowd who    had told

me    on two separate             occasions       that    there was a build up of             people at

the Leppings Lane             entrance and that             the turnstile          operators were

taking       ten    pounds    in the hand for             people who      had arri v e d w i t h o u t

tickets .          On one o c c asion       I had seen a s u p p o r t er who was            in the s t a n d

who    I had seen earlier                in the ter r a c i n g and had gained entrance                  to the

stand by c limbing            up the barrier wall.                 He was taken out          of the      stand

and    placed back in the                te rracing where         he took up position at the

Pront.        He was not drunk             but had o b viously been drinking.

\t a p pr ox i ma te ly 2 . 5 5 pm f rom my          position       looking onto the terracing                     I

sensed and          could see an          increased a g i t a t i o n     in the    crowd,     The

supporters were            being     i n c r easingly      crushed and were          compact     right to

the    front.        At this       point    Inspector Bui las            left to go to the        back        of

the terraces and see what                   the    problem was.          At this     point    the gates on

the    track were        not open but          people were a t t e m p t i n g      to   climb the

perimeter          fence and also          trying    to climb the wall             in front    of me to

the West Stand.              My    initial     reaction was         to    prevent    this    but as      I

looked down towards                the    entrance       tunnel    I could see a large number                  of

fans       pouring     in from the         back.     By this time          I could see the        body of a

person being          passed overh e a d towards             the    front    of the      crowd.and       I was

being       inundated w ith         cries from d i s t r e s s e d       people    in the terracing and
in the stand a p pealing            for me         to help them.          At     this       point I r a d i o ed

to    controI     saying    that a      large number           of people         were       down and       injured.

I heard over the air             that    the match had been delayed and very shortly

after     that    the    players    emerg e d .      Lots    of      people were      climbing and

being a s s i s t e d    in to the West Stand and                 I assisted        in this.         I took

hold    of one man that was             particularly ser i o u s l y           injured a round the

pelvic       region,     together w i th another            supporter we took him out of the

stand to the          reception are a at the              back of the Leppings Lane

entrances.       After     leaving      the    injured man           I immediately          returned to the

stand and found           it impossible            to make my way to             the front. As           I tried

to force       past     I was   receiving          lots of threats          to my person and being

called a murderer.              Because       of this      I thought       it prudent         to stay at

the    back    of the stand        in the      bar area.          In the bar area at the                back of

the    stand     I saw two      injured       people      being      tended by Police Officers.

After     consultation with these                I went     to the      reception area             in an

attempt       to seek medical        help.        This was        not forthcoming,            so    I returned
                                                //fill*
to the bar area and with PC                   1423 N e w b o u l d    carried an injured w o m a n to

the    reception area.

W hilst      in the bar area we          received several              calls   of    'murderers.5

The    first     trip to the       recept i o n area        I saw three        bodies        laid out with

blankets       over them and two          other       people were        obv i o u s l y badly       injured

who    had blue       coloured faces and were               being a r t i f i c i a l l y    resu s c i t a t e d

by am b u l a n c e   crew and     police      officers.          I returned to the             bar a rea for

a third time and a s s i st ed PC 928 Pa r k i n                  in carrying a third               injured

person to the           rear.

At    this    point a call went          out     that a man was          going berserk             in the West

Stand.        I went     back   up the steps         to be met         in the bar area             by four

men.      They    confronted me shouting               in a hysterical           manner at me            calling

me a murderer and saying                that     I was     to blame for the           incident.

Their manner was           such that      1 was       beginning        to fear      for my safety,            but
                                                                                                         PAG E        4
                                                                                                         S1091

            it had so m a d d e n e d me that       I shouted back at the men telling                 them to

           make     themselves       useful    and to    stop hanging around-             This seemed     to

          ^work     and they      left to go down
                                                the stairs.
                                              ! voc^n  o
       ^j£,Once     in the stand a gain wit h Inspector Grace and                      part of his    serial     we

           went     to a young man by the          stairway who was          in a very distressed,

            irate,       emotional    mood,    by the    look on his       face he was no       longer    in

            control       of himself and from what             people ar o u n d him     later said he had

            been    lashing out and hitting             everyone and anyone            in sight.     He was

           even t u a l l y   convinced he should         leave the ground and was            escor t e d out

            by his friends.

           At     this    point   I could see the mayhem on the              pitch,      people aro u n d me

           were     showing m ixed emotions,            some    crying    openly and others        shouting

           and abus ing        the   police    or stewards       or anyone    in authority.          i stayed

                         ar o u n d the back   of the West S t a n d until       it cleared and        returned

           to the de-briefing           point    in the N o r t h Stand.       Although      I was aware

           that     in the     region of ten people            had died,    I heard of      countless

            numbers       of bodies    being    taken across        the   pitch and did not        learn of

            the    true    severity until       later.

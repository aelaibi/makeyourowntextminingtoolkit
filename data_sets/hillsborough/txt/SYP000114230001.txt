                  At/ 8 . 3 0 a m S a t u r d a y                          I went        on duty at D o n c a s t e r Po lice

                  S t a t i o n where      we wer e all       paraded.

                  At 8 . 45am same            day we were       transported            to H i l l s b o r o u g h Football

                  Ground Sheffield              by double       decker         bus and dep o s i t e d at           the N o r t h Stand,

                  U p o n arrival        we were       given a hot drink.

                  At    10.00am we were              brie f e d about      the Semi         Final.

                  I was a s s i g ne d to Serial             no.    28 w i t h PS 2 408 Wilson,               Supervisory

                    t 11.15 myself             and PC 212 7 Smart              took    up our a l l o t e d        position,      this

                 was P e n i st on e Roa d          j u n c ti o n with B i c k e t o n Road.

                  1 stayed at           that    positi on all           day,    from     11.15am to a p p r o x i m a t e l y

                 5 . 0 0 p m when       I made my way to the N o r t h Stand.

                 At the start            of    my duties,          at   11.15am there was very               few      fans of      any

                  s up p o r t i n g   team    to be seen.

                 At about m i d d ay           fans     s t a r t e d toarrive.          All fans     were         in good spirits

                 wit h     no hint       of    trouble at all.

                 S o o n after m i d d a y          I noticed man y more              fans arriving.              To me    they

                 seemed        to be going          in a n y d i r e c t i o n wit h Liverpool            fans walk i n g         from
                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                             .R350. .

the are a of the gr o u n d towards                       Claywheels           direction.

Many    fans were as k i n g           if there were               pubs    open and where          t h e y were.

I also       n ot i c e d fans      of both           p e r s u a t i o n having    no tickets and asking

where     they     could get the®.

At about        1 2.30pm      I n ot i c e d a lot of fans were                     carrying     drink.         1 saw

four youths         in parti c u l a r who each had a six                          pack a piece.          Another

g r o u p each had a 2 litre                   plastic       bottle       of    cider   each.

There were also a few fans who were                               d e f i n i t e l y drunk and were         being

h e l p ed by friends.              But        still     the moo d was          good.

At a b o u t 2 . 3 0 p m PC 212 7              left for       his meal         break    planning    toreturn           at

about 3 . 3 0 p m      so    I could           have      a meal     break.

At a bout 3 . 0 0 p m        I h eard          a huge      roar    from the        crowd inside     the ground,

so      I a s su me d the game            had started.

At      this     time the streets                       were     still full      ofpeople,      this     time    ina

h u r r y to get       to the       ground.

F r o m my    p o s ition     I could see the                other      end of the street,             w h i c h was

also    patrolled,           and    I could see all               the     fans were      rushing       to get to

the ground,         this      being       the L e p p i n g s     Lane     entrance.

At about 3 . 3 0 p m         I r e a lised som e t h i n g was             not     right at the ground as

the    crowd were           quiet    but       I did      not    know what.

S ho r t l y a fter L i ve rp oo l         fans were            coming     up to me and saying             things

like    "How does           it feel       to be a m u r d e r e r ? "          The fans were        o b viously

very upset and              in tears.

At      one    point 1 could see                        a lot of a m b u l a n c e s     leaving     the         ground, fr

the    point P e n i s t on e R o a d passes               the ground,           about Gate 0 on the

a t t a c h e d map,   all     of these a m b u l a n c e s          were      speeding a w a y w i t h their

driver,       a t t e n dants,      giving       heart m a s s a g e .

1 then       realised       so m e t h i n g    serious         had o c c u r r e d and was about          to   leave

my    post to go and as s i s t when a Fo r e s t                       fan a p p r o a c h e d me and asked

what    had happened.               I told him            "I don't        know because we h a v e n ’t been
                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                    R350

 issued w ith          radios."

 At    this     point we were                j oined by an upset Liverpool                    fan who        said    Lhene

 was    h u n dreds     dea d        in there and then had a go at the Fo r e s t                            fan.         I

 s to p p e d   them f rom           f i g h t i n g .    This     changed my d e c i s i o n to go and               I


 d ec id ed to stop            in case som e t h i n g            similar      occurred.

 This     sort     of o cc ur r e n c e          happened        re g u l a r l y after w a r d s    until

 a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4.13pm.             I. a ss u m e d by that all          the     rival f ans        had

 dispersed.

 uje were       i ns t r u c t e d     to     return t o the No r th S t a n d at a bout                     »0 0 p m .

 At 5 . 2 0 p m we       w e r e     d e b r i e f e d about       the    incident and it was only then                       I

 new what         had happened.

 At 6 . 0 0 p m    I m e a l e d at C l a y w h e e l s           and at 7 . 1 0 p m we wer e         transported

  back    to D o nc as te r          where at 7 . 4 3 p m          1 went     o ff duty.

 MY FEELINGS

 At the         time   I was          confused as to what                 to do for the             simple     reason 1

  had    no     idea what was               happening        due    to    MOT having a                radio.

  Afterward         I was a n g r y at my d e c i s i o n to stay at my post and                               not go

  and help        inside a lt h o u g h             I know    I could have           done    very     little.

  I never        once went            into      the      ground    during     the    incidents        so     1 can't

  ■comment on the             s t e wards         actions an d nor did              I have any        involvement

  w i t h any bodies.

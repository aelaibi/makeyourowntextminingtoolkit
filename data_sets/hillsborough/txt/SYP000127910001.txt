            fetched packed meals and we sat in back of van and ate them,             After

            meal we walked around the perimeter track to the Leppings Ln end.                At

            this stage we were only a stand-by unit,          (pnce there we stood there

               akinq the Ellss 1 i k e.I I remember the gaf f er messing about with the

            gate on the fence which at the time we found quite amusing.             After

            being there for a short time we were asked by Ground Control to go to

            the turnstiles on Penistone Rd so as to assist with the incoming Notts

            Forest fans.        We walked around by the back of Leppings Ln which was

            clear of fans at this time and then out into Penistone Rd,              It was
                                                                       PAGE      2


also relatively clear of fans as well,        We were also posted to a

turnstile and me a nd Andy took the last turnstile to the K o p r thinking

these would be the quietest,

They turned out to be not very busy and we spent most of the time

either chatting amongst ourselves or to the stewards or the Notts

Forest fans,    who all seemed in good spirits.

Up until about    1400 hours the spectators    came in dribs and drabs but

they slowly increased in numbers,       however,   there were no real problems

apart from having to take beer off one or two,         but even this was taken

in good spirits.

As kick off drew nearer one or two started turnstile hopping and one

or two got   locked up from the turnstiles higher up,        Throughout all of

the time we were approached by a good few Liverpool fans who had all

gone to the wrong end and we kept telling them to go back to Leppings

Ln.

As kick off time drew nearer these fans seemed to increase in numbers

and there was a greater urgency in them to get down to Leppings Ln,

I remember as kick off got close,       me and Andy watching a couple of

scousers who had been wandering up and down for a while without a

ticket and it looked like they were going to try and jump the

turnst i l e , however,   it was then that Andy^EDDIiSON shouted to us to

come down to the gym entrance,       which we did,   and once there we were

told to get straight       round to Leppings Ln as there was trouble with

the fans.,

The Unit went straight away and on getting out onto the perimeter

track I looked down towards Leppings Ln and I saw a number of fans on

the edge of the p it ch r the perimeter track and stood on the fence.

We turned down and walked past the North Stand,          As we did I recall

seeing a bobby struggling with a fan on the track and And^EDjDISON^and

Dave FROST went to help,        I decided to carry on,    I was convinced
                                                                                                 P AG E         2


         at this time that the fans were fighting, as they appeared to be doing

         j ust^ t h a t *

         Once at the Leppings Ln end I remember the gaffer telling us to form a

         single line cordon along the touchline,                    I did that and looked towards

         the crowd and I saw them still                  climbing over the fence and running

         towards us.          The terraces    looked absolutely packed,             A man came

         screaming up to us saying a man was dead in the crowd and screamed at

         us to do something.            At first        I just d i d n ’t believe what he was

         saying,       thinking h e ’d probably fainted or something like and I

         remained in the cordon.             But this man came back to me and Andy again,

         shouting and swearing for us to do something*                       This time we went with

    . him,       that's me and Andy did.                We went to the fence and jumped up on it

         and looked a t the crowd,           people were reaching out towards us and

         begging us to get them out,            but I just c ou ldn ’t think how we could as

         I coul dn ’t see how we could get in or them get out*                      I felt absolutely

         h el p l e s s ,

         The next thing I recall was seeing a man being passed down the crowd

         above their heads,                                       a °d had                       hair
H
         with               cords on*   They passed him right down to us on the fence and

         held him up,          but we c o u ld n ’t get hold of him because of the fence and

         he fell down onto the steps,              people moved back for him,          somehow,     and

         he just lay there.             I looked at him I knew he was dead,

         I ran back for some reason to tell Martin and then ran back again*                                By
    %■                                             ■—                .

         this time Andy and some other bobbies and fans w e r e                    pulling at the

         fence and fans were pushing at it from inside*                        I joined in

         frantically trying to pull it free,                  but it just w o u l d n ’t give way,        it

         seemed to take for ages before it did but eventually it did and we

         pulled it back,          somebody I think it was Andy,              tried to get in, but the

         fans inside were still trying to get out so it again delayed things*

         We did eventually get in and they tried to give him the kiss of life.
                                                                        PAGE     4


It was then that I noticed that somebody had opened the left gate and

fans, were trying to get out,      but they were all trying to get out of

this gate so nothing much was happening,       nobody getting in or out.

The fans slowly started to part and leave a gap on the terrace and I

recall    looking up the terracing and seeing bodies strewn all over the

steps,    there were about twenty or so,    none moving,

I couldn't    comprehend what    I was seeing and I stood there just staring

until somebody shook fne,       I moved back towards the fence and

to the gate which I stood up on, whilst the crowd continued to stream

out they seemed oblivious to the bodies that were laid out only a few

yards away and just seemed intent on getting out.

Somebody then started passing bodies out and a human chain was formed.

I stood on the track and passed the bodies on.        I didn't   look at them,

just passed them on,    it seemed to last a while but I don't think

it was.    When it had stopped I turned and went out onto the pitch and

saw bodies just laid out, with people walking around them.

Me and Andy WEST went to one of them, a young lad about 20, who was

laid next to another    lad about the same age and we started to give

mouth to mouth and heart massage to him.        I did the mouth to mouth.

We went at it hell for leather and at first we thought he was coming

round.    As we did this to this lad I recall feeling somebody kick me

in the left side and I looked round cos I thought they were trying to

attract my attention and as I did a fan spit in my face and called me

a Bastard,     I couldn't take this in at first and I just wiped it away

and carried on with this lad until eventually we decided it was no

g^ood^n^jM^^pa^ck^^^^K^

As we d i d r I looked up and saw somebody picking money from the side of

the other lad who was laid out,       it obviously having fallen out,

then just walk away with it,        I didn't take this in either then and

instead looked down at the lad we had been trying with and then we
                                                                                             PAGE           5


turned him onto his side in the recovery position for some reason

and I   wiped my mouth clear of the vomit that the lad had brought up.

I recall how this tasted of beer and I couldn't get rid of this taste

for ages,   despite any drink I had later on.

A board was brought over and we laid the lad on it.             Andy took his

coat off and covered him with it.      We then sprinted across the pitch

with him and to the avm.

When we got there we saw bodies just laid out and somebody said leave
                                                       —   a—   —a —   —   ■ anagB a— e a m p y   Ill "HI



him so we did     and we went back to the crowd-.

As I ran back     across the pitch I recall seeing three people struggling

across the pitch with a board with a young lad on it.                  I looked at him

and saw his Liverpool scarf tied around his wrist and neck,                         he was

only a young lad, a young teenager,     and he was dead.

I helped carry him to the gym area and left him there.

When I got back all the bo-dies seemed to have gone and fans and

bobbies were just walking around,     most of them in a trance,

I stopped once near the net at the Leppings Ln which had been taken

down,    I just   looked around me and at myself,   I recall               trying to wipe

the spit off the arm     of my tunic until somebody came               upto talk to me

and then I thought about my helmet which I

PC J e n k in s ,
                    With regard to your undated note received on 11.7*89.
                    Having put some thought between us,PC Grant and I can only say that the
person in question was a white male in his late teens or early twenties.You will note
that the statement goes on to say that this ’incident' happened on a dozen or so
occasions and it is obviously therefore very difficult to be any more specific.
                    If the incident is captured on video tape I am prepared to attend at
Furival house in order to identify myself and if possible the youth in question.I am
on 1GPM - 9AM nightshift until l6.7.89.Unfortunately PC Grant is then on annual
leave for a period of 1 month.
                    In relation to the matter being of some urgency,the first I knew of this
matter was at 1GPM Monday 10th July 1989 when I received the message which you had
left.I am unaware of any conversation or correspondence in relation to this particular
matter prior to this as is PC Grant.

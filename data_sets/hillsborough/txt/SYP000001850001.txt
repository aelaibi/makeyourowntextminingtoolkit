            all     of a sudden        the      crowd m oved         ri< ^ ( t     and    I was    carried on w ith them

            then we went           forw a r d    t i y r ough a n / o p e n g a t e-        W h e n we got      inside        every­

            one was        heading     thro u g h t(?g~ f u n n e l        under         the West Stand.           Me and

            stood for a couple               of seconds at the                   back     of the     turns t i l e s    then we

            went     through the         tunne 1 .          There was         np    prob 1 ern g o i ng thro u g h the

            tunnel      but when we got               out    in the open            it was     like      coming    up agai n s t a

            brick wall.            Im not       that    tall     an y w a y but          I c o u l d n ’t see the       pitch all

            I could see was a large stand,.-' As more                                people       came    in behind us we

            were     slowly     c rus h e d t o w a r         t h e p i t ch .       We    came    to a crush barrier                  and

                     pushed me under             iy    as    I was ge11ing               cru.shed.       I stood       up the

            other      side   thery- the r t f was an extra                crush and          I lost my footing.                 This

            was     j ust after! k i g f c      off.        1 fell       to the floor          and    I was    ki c k e d avid

            w a l ke d over while          I was       down on the            floor       I remember       a face       next     to

            mine     I couldn't        tell      if    it was male            or female.           I just     remember         it had

            wide     staring       eyes.        There were         others          on the     floor      round me       but    its all

            a blur      from then on.             I remember             coming      round on the football                pitch




                                                                                              (S g d )

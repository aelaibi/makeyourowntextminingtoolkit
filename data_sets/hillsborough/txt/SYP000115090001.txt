E N D OF   REPORT
               LIVERPOOL   V   NOTTINGHAM FOREST FOOTBALL MATCH

                          H
I am Pc 3110 Edwards, currently stationed at Askern Police Station
In the A3 Sub-division*

At 8 00am on Saturday 15 April 1989* I commenced duty at Adwick le Street
Police Station. From there myself and other officers were transported to
Hillsborough Football Ground where we were br fed about the forthcoming
event.

After the breifing and a meal myself and the rest of my serial, No. 32,
took up our positions on Penistone Road North between the traffic island
junction with leppings Lane and the travellers Rest Public House. The
serial supervised by Acting PS 2895 Thomas and Insp. Millet, was split
into pairs of officers, myself beingpaired with PC 201 Olney.

We took up our position diredly outside a row of shops not far from the traffic
island at approximately 11.20am. At this time there was already a
number of Liverpool fans wandering about, some making there way to the
ground, others walking in competely the opposite direction. We were asked
by quite a number of these fans where the nearest Public House or Off-Licence
was.

At 12.15pm we were requested by our serial Inspector to the junction
of Penistone Road and a small road I beleive is a part of Clay WheelsLane.
I there assisted in the direction ofLiverpool coaches to the parking
area on Clay Wheels Lane and -private vehicles up Penistone Road and under
Wadsley Bridge. By this time the number of supporters on Penistone Road
had increased quite considerably. I noticed that quite a majority of the
younger fans were carrying cans and bottles of beer, the requests for open
Pub' s/Off-Licences also grew.

The steady stream of fans continued to grow until at about 2.15pm a large
group of supporters came down Penistone Road escorted by officers both on foot
and mounted. Most of these fans were in very high spirits, shouting and
chanting and running about. A number of these fans were also carrying packs
of beer, drinking it as they walked a few spraying it over other other
members of their 'group'. After this group, the number of fans travelling along
Penistone road never really decreased the majority headi ng towards the
ground, but quite a few walking against the flow asking " any Spares Lads?"
" Any spares?".

As time went past the gensral demeanour of the crowd became more excitable
and a number of the fans were running or jogging I was constantly telling them
to slow down as some were falling over in their haste to get to the ground.

At about 2.^0pm we were approached by our serial sergeant who was in possession
of a personal radio, he told us that it sounded like there was fighting in the
ground.
At about 2.^5pm the last coach arrived and at 3•00pm I began to make my
way towards the ground with the rest of my serial and members of serial 33.
It was as we were walking towards the ground A/PS Thomas informed us that
there was some sort of trouble at the Leppings Lane Stand and we were to make
our way there.

As I arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, there was a large
number of officers, both on foot and mounted outside the turnstiles and
gate area there was also a number of fans willing around, some trying to
gain entry to the stand but were being prevented by the officers there.
We were instructed to form a cordon across the entrance to the stand.
A few moments after we did so an ambulance arrived and was allowed through the
cordon. It was only acouple of minutes after this we were called into the
enclosure at the rear of Leppings Lane stand. As I walked towards the
gate, past the ambulance there was people lying on the ground at the rear of
the ambulance, some apparently lifeless.

I walked through the gate into the enclosure. There was a lot of Liverpool
fans most in a very distressed state, wandering about, some crying, some shouting
at other Police officers. There was also quite a number of people lying
on the ground. I went to the nearest person on the ground who was lying on
his back unconscious. An ambulance man arrived at the same time with a
resusitating machine, myself Pc Olney and the ambulance man carried the youth
through the gate and he was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.
By this time there was four or five bodies lying alongside the ambulance
dead.

I went back through the gate. Myself and Pc Olney then carried another
unconscious male to another ambulance with the help of some of the civilian
supporters.

I cannot remember much detail about what I did after this time, it is
a bit   Off a blur. I do remember carrying quite a number of injured people
from the back of the stand and the tunnel mouth down through the gate
and either placing them in ambulances or alongside the wall of the enclosure
which had become a collecting area as there was not enough ambulances to
carry the injured straight to hospital. During this I assisted with PC Olney
to carry a man from underneath the steps of the stand who was complaining
of some sort of back injury. He was placed onto a stretcer and straight into
an ambulance. Whilst I w*s carrying these injured people to the ambulances
I was   aware of some of the fans shouting abuse at the Police, infact as
I was   helping to carry an injured man one of the fans grabbed hold of
my arm and tried to drag me away from him. He said M Leave him alone
you've done enough damage opening that fucking gate". One young man I saw
lying on his stomach*with another fan with him I turned him onto his back
as he was not breathing byself and that fan then tried to resusitate him,
without any success an ambulance man and two other fans carried him
to the ambulance area.

When all the dead and injured had been removed we formed a line to direct
the rest of the supporters from the stand. A lot of the fans coming down the
steps from the stand were very hostile, shouting and swearing I heard the
comment or comments simalar to " The Liverpool fans will get the blame
for this, they're blan»d for everything " more than once.

After all the supporters had left the ground we   wentback to theNorth Stand
for a de-brief, then to Clay wheels Lane garage   from there we were transported
back to Doncaster to go off duty at 8.00pm.

                   In w r i t i n g        this     report,          I intend            to    be as       accurate           as    possible        but      in

                   purposely           not       thinking           or    talking          about         what     occurred          that    day,       it

                   has     become          difficult           to    r ec a l l       with     great       accuracy,           minor       detail.

                   This     report          will       be m a i n l y       about        general          recollections.

                   At     about       3.00       pm S a t u r d a y       13 A p r i l        1989,       I was        on d u t y w h e n    I went          to

                   th e    Hillsborough                Football           Stadium.             On    arrival           I went       straight        o n to

                   the     pitch,          along       with       many      other        Police          Officers.            I immediately             saw

                   that     the       game       had     been       stopped.             I saw       four        men    including          one

                   policeman           carrying             a man        towards         the    exit       from        the    pi t c h .    That

                   person        I assumed             to    be     dead,        at     least       he    certainly           looked       that     way.

                   I saw     the       line        of P o l i c e        across        the     pitch       in f r o n t       of a     chaotic         scene

                   in f r o n t       of    the     Leppings             Lane     end.         I merely           joined       in t r y i n g     to

                   help,     comforting                people       trying            to a s s i s t      in     reviving          victims       and

                   although           I did        not      a c t u a l l y * deal * w i t h a d e a d                 person,        I helped carry

                   many     out       to    th e    gym,       both       on     proper        stretchers              and   on m a k e s h i f t

                   stretchers.

                   I remember              the     shock       I felt          when      I thought              how unusual          and    shocking

                   it w o u l d       have       been       n o r m a l l y to    have        just       on e    person       killed       at a

                   football        match and                there        we w e r e     with    dozens.                Each     time       I went back

* I"                                                                                                                               R565

 t            to    the    gym,       bodies       were   literally          being     piled       up o u t s i d e   and     inside           I

              had    indescribable                feelings      when    I saw       numerous        bodies      lined        up.

              I remember           walking         back   towards       Leppings           Lane    end across         the     pitch

              and    bending          down    to a s s i s t    one    man and       being        kicked      in th e    side        by

              another          then    pushed aside.              I remember         immediately after                that

              stopping          a fight       in t h e     crowd      in the    terrace           to t h e    right w he n         facing

              Leppings          Lane    in w h i c h a n u m b e r      of m e n w e r e      beating         one.

              I remember           that      whilst       I was      helping     carry       one    body      out,     that     as    I

              was    approaching             the    pitch      exit,    I was       hi t    on the      side    of     the    neck        by

              a    flattened          tin    can w h i c h     hurt    considerably.

              I remember           that      as    I waited with            a body     outside        the     gym that        I was

              urinated          upon    by a       number      of y o u t h s   standing          on th e     gantry above.                I

              looked       up a n d     they       laughed      before       running        away.       I remember           the a w f u l

              smell       as    the    urine       dried.       It    had    run d ow n my         neck      soaking     my     coat,

              shirt       and    underclothes.

              I remember           that      as    things      settled       down    towards        the      evening,        many

              officers          were    walking       around apparently               aimlessly           looking       fo r m o r e

              to    do.        We w e r e    eventually         debriefed       and        I left     a short         time    later.

0 D    OF   REPORT
In writing this report, I intend to be as accurate as possible but in purposely
not thinking or talking about what occurred that day, it has become difficult
to recallvith great accuracy, minor detail. This report will be mainly about
general recollections.

At about 3*00pm Staurday 15 April "989, I was on duty when I went to the Hillsborough
Football Stadium. On arrival I went straight onto the j>itch, along with many other
Police Officers. I immediately saw that the game had been stopped. I saw four
men including one policeman carrying a man towards the exit from the pitch. That
person I assumed to be dead, at least he certainly looked that way.

I saw the line of Police across the pitch in front of a chaotic scene in front of
the Leppings Lane end. I merely joined in trying to help, comforting people trying
to assist in reviving victims and although I did not actually â€™deal' with a dead
person, I helped carry many out to the gym, both on proper strecthers and on makeshift
stretchers.

I remember the shock I felt when I thought how unusual and   shocking it would have
been normally to have just one person killed at a football   match and there we were
with dozens. Each time I went back to the gym, bodies were   literally being piled up
outside and inside I had indescribable feelings when I saw   numerous bodies lined up.

I remember walking back towards Leppings Lane end across the pitch and bending down
to assist one man and being kicked in the side by another then pushed aside.
I remember immediately after that stopping a fight in the crowd in the terrace to
the right when facing Leppings Lane in which a number of men were beating one.

I remember that whilst I was helping carry one body out, that as I was approaching
the pitch exit, I was hit at the side of my neck by a flattened tin can which hurt
considerably.

I remember that as I waited with a body outside the gym that I was urinated upon
by a number of youths standing on the gantry above. I looked up and they laughed
before running away. I remember the awful smell as the urine dried. It had run down
my neck soaking my coat, shirt and underclothes.

I remember that as things settled down towards the evening, many officers were
walking around apparently aimlessly looking for more to do. We were eventually
debriefed and I left a short time later.

                                 O f r
 I THINK THE POLICE WERE SLOW IN REACTING TO WHAT WA                 A LOT OF THE

 POLICE OFFICERS WERE WASTED WHEN THEY PUT A LINE OF          S ACROSS THE PITCH

 WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING THE DEAD AND INJURED.     THERE DIDNT SEEM TO

 BY ANYONE IN CHARGE.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE ALLOCATION OF THE ENDS WAS TOTALLY WRONG.     THE FANS SEEMED TO BE DOING

EVERYTHING FOR THE DEAD AND INJURED.     IT WASN'T UNTIL THE FIRE BRIGADE

 T ^ N E D UP THAT THINGS SEEMED TO BE UNDER CONTROL.

  ONCE INSIDE THERE WERE NO SIGNS OR STEWARDS DIRECTING PEOPLE TO THE OUTER

  TERRACING.     THERE ARE CROWD CONTROL CAMERAS WHY WERE THEY NOT USED TO EASE

  THE PROBLEM IN THE CENTRE PENS.      USE OF THE LOUD HAILERS/SPEAKERS TO TELL

  THE CROWD WHAT WAS HAPPENING WOULD HAVE HELPED.        THE OVERALL VIEW IS A TOTAL

  LACK OF ORGANISATION/MISINFORMATION.

 BAD COO R D I N A T I O N AND COMMUNICATIONS W ITH GROUNDSTAFF AND POLICE INSIDE AND

 OUTSIDE THE GROUND, THEY WERE STILL LETTING PEOPLE IN AFTER THE GAME HAD

 STOPPED.     FANS WERE COMING IN FASTER THAN THE ONES AT THE FRONT WERE GETTING

 OUT.    ONCE THE SITUATION WAS REALISED AS VERY SERIOUS THE POLICE & ST JOHN

 AMBULANCE DID THE BEST THEY COULD, ALSO LIVERPOOL FANS W^RE VERY GOOD IN

 FERRYING THE INJURED ON HOARDINGS.          A LOT OF FANS WEiJE SHOUTING AT POLICE

 IN FRUSTRATION.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH /OU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 T^p POLICE SHOULD HAVE BETTER SYSTEM OF CHECKING SUPPORTERS TICKETS PRIOR TO

 THE ARRIVAL AT THE TURNSTILES.          ALSO TUffhlSTILE SUPERVISION/FACILITIES LEFT

 A LOT TO BE DESIRED.      THERE WERE NO STEWARDS AT TUNNEL ENTRANCE TO DIRECT

FANS TO THE WINGS OF THE TERRACE WHE^Q THE MIDDLE SECTIONS WERE FULL.            ALSO

 THE REMOVAL OF THE FENCES WHICH SECTION OFF THE TERRACE WOULD HAVE AVERTED

 THE CRUSH AS THE FANS WOULD HAVE SEEN ABLE TO SPREAD ACROSS THE TERRACE

 EASILY.  ALSO THE TANNOY SYSTEM WAS USELESS, NOBODY COULD HEAR ANYTHING OVER

 IT.    WHY WASN’T THE ELECTRONIC SCOREBOARD USED TO RELAY POLICE MESSAGES.

 PUSHED ME FORWARDS.   I JUST COULD NOT M O V E N d ^ J U M S AND I COULD NOT STOP MOVING

 DOWN THE TERRACE.

 G45

G16

 G46

 |JP e YOy INJURED IF SO DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NO.

 G47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 YES I WAS ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE TERRACES WHEN A FELLA JUST COLLAPSED IN

 FRONT OF ME.   HE WAS A FUNNY COLOUR, HE DIDN'T FALL DOWN ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE

 WE WERE ALL SO TIGHTLY PACKED AROUND HIM.

 I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE HIM AS A WHITE LAD AGED 18 YEARS I D O N ’T KNOW ANYTHING

 ELSE ABOUT HIS FEATURES OR CLOTHING.     I DIDN’T HAVE ANY FURTHER DEALINGS

 WITH HIM AND D O N *T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

Q17

 G48

 ALSO ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE TERRACE I HELPED A KID OFF A CRUSH BARRIER.

 HE HAD GOT HIS LEGS TRAPPED,     I P^KED, HIM OFF AND HE WAS KISSING HE FOR

 HELPING HIM.     I ALSO HELPED A LAD LYING ON THE GRAVEL TRACK IN FRONT OF

 PEN 4, HE WAS BLUE WHEN I SAW HIM.     HE CAME AROUND LUCKILY,

 Q49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY^R£RSGN?

 m      TO THE MASS OF PEOPLE ATOO THERE WAS NO WAY OUT FOR THEM, WE WERE ALL

 TRAPPED.     THE POLICE REFUSED TCXOPSN THE GATES TO LET PEOPLE OUT AND THEY

 PUSHED FANS OFF THE FENCES BACK           \E CROWD.

 Q30

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 I D O N ’T REMEMBER THE EXACT TIME BUT IT WAS ABOUT 5-6 PM (1700) - (-1800),

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 S H A K E R ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OF MY OWN ACCORD.

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 I SAW A SUPPORTER HIT A       ICEMAN THROUGH FRUSTRATION BECAUSE IT SEEMED THAT

 THE POLICE OFFICERS WEREN’T D&JNQ ANYTHING WHILE THE FANS WERE RUSHING AROUND

 DOING ALL THE WORK.


Q 19

 G 33

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,
                                                                                PAGE    9

 AFTER,THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE ON THE WHOLE DID N ’T DO ANYTHING THEY WERE STANDING IN A LINE

, ACROSS THE PITCH.   THEY LOOKED YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED AS IF THEY COULD NOT

 COPE WITH THE SITUATION.     A FEW OFFICERS HELPED THE INJURED GIVING THE

 KISS OF LIFE AND THAT.     MAINLY IT WAS THE FANS RUNNING AROUND CARRYING

 FANS GIVING THE KISS OF LIFE.        ONE OFFICER STOOD ON THE GATES ONTO THE

 PITCH WHICH IS SITUATED ON THE FAR LEFT HAND SIDE NEAR THE NORTH STAND. HE

 REFUSED TO MOVE OR HELP ANYONE

  IT WAS PATHETIC THAT THERE WAS ONL

 SO THAT FANS RIPPED UP HOARDINGS TO USE AS STRETCHERS.

       LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT WAS USELESS.      THERE WERE NO ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE

 POLICE OR AUTHORITIES.     IT TOOK KENNY DALGLISH TO GET ON THE SYSTEM ASKING

 EVERYONE TO GET OFF THE PITCH AND ALL THOSE UNHURT DID AS REQUESTED.


Q20

 Q54                          \

  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU W I S H E D ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?                       \   \

 THERE WAS NO POLICE ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND AT ALL AND NO ORGANISATION

 OF POLICE OR STEWARDS INSIDE.    IT DID NOT SEEM THAT THERE WAS ANY COMMUNICATION

 E^p^lEEN OFFICERS INSIDE THE GROUND, SOME WERE HELPING THE FANS WHILE OTHERS

 JUST STOOD ON THE HALF WAY LINE AND OTHERS WALKED AROUND.       IT WAS IF THEY

 DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON AND THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS A FIGHT

  IN ACTION.

  IT SEEMED TO TAKE AN AGE FOR THE FIRST AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE.       ST JOHNS

 AMBULANCE TRIED, BUT THEY WERE MAINLY KIDS AND WHAT CAN THEY DO.

4 W I C X A L INQUIRY?    ^          _

 IN 1988 (000088), THE STEWARDING AND SHEPHERDING OF THE FANS OUTSIDE THE
                                ________
 GROUND WAS A LOT BETTER.            LAST YEAR THERE WAS A CORDON OF POLICE ACROSS

 LEPPINGS LANE, WELL AWAY FROM THE GROUND, CHECKING P E O P L E ’S TICKETS.      IF THEY

 H A D N ’T GOT ONE THEY WERE TURNED AWAY, AND THE QUEUES FOR THE TURNSTILES WERE

 ONLY 6 DEEP APPROXIMATELY.              THIS YEAR IT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

 THE ARRIVAL OF FANS LATE FOR THE MATCH WHETHER DUE TO TRAFFIC DELAYS OR

 P E O P L E ’S CASUAL APPROACH TO GETTING TO GAME WAS DEFINITELY A FACTOR IN THE

 CRUSHING OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR       IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 <351

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A

 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 I HEARD A TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT SAYING THE GAME WAS ABANDONED AND ASKING FOR

 FANS TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES TO ALLOW EMERGENCY SERVICES TO OPERATE.        I LEFT

 ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER.

 <352

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 Q#

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE REACTION SEEMED DIRECTED MORE AT A NON EXISTANT CROWD PROBLEM

 THEN ASSISTING THE DEAD AND INJURED.        ABOUT TWO HUNDRED POLICE CAME ONTO THE

 PITCH AND JUST LINED UP ACROSS THE PITCH AND THE FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND.

 IT ALSO SEEMED TO TAKE A TIME FOR AMBULANCES TO ARRIVE AND ALSO FOR FIREMEN

 WITH BOLT CUTTERS TO ARRIVE.

 D^YOU      ATTEND THE GAME LAST YEAR?

 YES

 Q53B

 CAN YOU COMPARE THE POLICING OPERATION.     fCXoo    C ,
                                              \&oo          I
 IT SEEMED EASIER IN 1988 TO GET INTO THE GROUND.  THERE DIDN'T SEEM THE

 BUILD UP OF FANS AT THE TURNSTILES,        THAT WE HAD THIS YEAR.

 <354

 IS     THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOUR FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IT SEEMS THAT THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT VAST AMOUNTS OF FANS WERE

 DELAYED AND GOT THE GAME D E L A Y E D .

 I C A N ’T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS EXPECTED TO PROCESS SO MANY FANS THROUGH SO
        £-       .
 FEW TURNSTILES IN THE ALLOCATED TIME.

 I ALSO FEEL THAT LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE LARGER END OF THE

 GROUND.

 THE FANS TOOK THE I N I T I A T I V E      AND BEGAN HELPING THE DEAD AND INJURED WHILE MOST

 OF THE POLICE STOOD AROUND.               THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED A

 LOT BETTER TO MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF HOW SERIOUS THE S IT U A T IO N WAS.               THE SOUND

 QUALITY OF THE SYSTEM WAS VERY POOR.

 T ^ ^ MEDICAL F A C I L I T I E S WERE VIRTUALLY NO N-EXISTENT AND I T      TOOK A LONG TIM E FOR

 EMERGENCY SERVICES TO A R R IV E .

 IT    TOOK EVEN LONGER FOR THE F IR E BRIGADE TO ATTEND AS IF              THEY WERE CALLED FOR

 AS AN * AFTER THOUGHT’ ,

 THERE WERE NO HIGH RANKING OFFICERS DOWN ON THE P IT C H CO-ORDINATING WHAT WAS

 GOING ON.           IT   WAS AS IF   THEY WERE ACTING B LIN D WITH NO-ONE G IV IN G   INFORMATION

 OR ORDERS.

 EVEN WHEN THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE IN C ID E N T BECAME APPARENT TO THE POLICE THE

 DEPLOYMENT OF OFFICERS D ID NOT CHANGE THEY WERE S T I L L KEPT IN CORDONS ON THE

 P IT C H AS CROWD CONTROL AND AT ONE PO INT DOGS WERE BROUGHT I N .

 T ift   SEEMED TO BE A N T IC IP A T IN G CROWD TROUBLE BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF ANY

 THE POLICE           IN GENERAL WERE VERY IN S E N S IT I V E TO FANS WHO WERE OBVIOUSLY

 EXTREMELY DISTRESSED,

 AFTER THE SAME MATCH LAST YEAR I T               WAS OBVIOUS THAT LIVERPOOL FANS SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN ALLOCATED THE SPION KOP END.                 I T STANDS TO REASON THAT IF    LIVERPOOL

 HAVE A MUCH HIGHER AVERAGE ATTENDANCE      AT HOME MATCHES THEY SHOULD BE ALLOCATED

 A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF MATCH TICKETS      AND PUT IN THE END THAT WOULD COPE WITH

 THE LARGER NUMBERS OF FANS.

 PROBLEMS VIA THE MEDIA.

 POLICE SEARCHING VEHICLES ON THE ROUTE MADE CONGESTION EVEN WORSEl.      EVEN WHEN

 BY VIRTUE OF THE TIME IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT FANS WOULD 8E LATE THE POLICE

CONTINUED WITH THE SEARCHES.     IF THEY MUST SEARCH AND CAUSE THE DELAYS THEY

S i ^ L D PUT THE KICK OFF TIME BACK AND NOT TRY AND MAKE A LAST MINUTE DECISION.

 WHEN WE PARKED THE CAR UP IT WAS IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS THAT THERE WERE LARGE

 NUMBERS OF POLICE OFFICERS STANDING ABOUT IN GROUPS DOING NOTHING.       BUT WHEN

 WE GOT TO THE GROUND THERE WAS A DISTINCT LACK OF POLICE AND T H A T ’S WHY THERE

WAS NO CROWD CONTROL.    THERE WERE MORE THAN ENOUGH OFFICERS ON DUTY THEY WERE

 JUST NOT UTILISED CORRECTLY.

 THE DESIGN AND GEOGRAPHY OF THE LEPPINGS LANE END OF THE GROUND IS TOTALLY

UNSUITABLE FOR LARGE CROWDS I.E. THE LAY OUT OF THE TURNSTILES IS INADEQUATE.

 (TOO FEW TURNSTILES SERVING SUCH A LARGE AREA).

 THE TUNNEL UNDER THE STAND S L O P E ’S EXCESSIVELY ENCOURAGING A CROWD SURGE

F C ^ A R D WHETHER THEY WANT TO OR NOT.

 I D O N ’T THINK THAT THE OPENING OF THE CONCERTINA GATE IN ITSELF WAS A ’WRONG

 THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL FIRST.     THERE WAS OBVIQUSLYyf/TOTAL LACK OF

 COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OFF ICERS OUTSIDE THE GROUND             INSIDE THE GROUND.

 I C A N ’T SEE THE POINT OF SEGREGATING FENCING ON THE TERRACING THIS WAS

 OBVIOUSLY A MAJOR FACTOR   IN WHAT TOOK PLACE AS IT PREVENTED THE CROWD FROM

 SPREADING,

 THE TANNOY WAS TOTALLY INEFFECTUAL,          I D O N ’T KNOW   WHETHER   IT WAS USED

 BUT I C O U L D N ’T HEAR IT BEING USED.      ALSO THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS A

 LITTLE RIDICULOUS,     ALLOCATING THE FOREST FANS THE LARGER TERRACE AREA.

G53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

HANDLED,         AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

•1.       WHY     WERE THE POLICE DEPLOYED LINING THE NORTH STAND,

2.        THERE WERE TOO FEW POLICEMEN          DEALING WITH/THE R E S C U E ,

3.        THE     RESCUE BY THE POLICE WAS INEFF ICIEj/T, THERE DID NOT SEEM TO                 BE

ANYONE WANTING TO TAKE CHARGE OR CAPABLE OF IT,



IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL                     IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

1)        WHY WAS HILLSBOROUGH USED WHEN OLD TRAFFORD WAS AVAILABLE AND HAD

BEEN OFFERED,               OLD TRAFFORD HAVING BETTER FACILITIES.

2)        THESE WERE 3 SETS OF ROAD WORKS ON M62 THAT WEEKEND,                   TO BE USED

BY BOTH LIVERPOOL AND EVERTON FANS               (EVERTON AT VILLA PARK) WHY WERE THERE

ROAD WORKS AT ALL WHY NOT USE A TIDAL SYSTEM.

3)         I BELIEVE THE 'LIONS S H A R E ’ OF THE TICKETS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED

TO LIVERPOOL F.C. THE BETTER SUPPORTED TEAM AND NOT NOTTS FORREST,                         WHICH

B ® ; N F E R E N C E MEANS THE      ’K O P ’ END SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO LIVERPOOL.

4)        THE     COACHES WERE NOT ALLOWED TO UNLOAD AT OR NEAR THE STADIUM,               SO

CAUSING FANS A LONG WALK AND CAUSING THEM TO BE LATE. THEREBY                        WHY    NOT A

SHUTTLE SERVICE FROM CAR PARK TO STADIUM.

5)         IF PUBLIC HOUSES IN THE VICINITY OF THE GROUND WERE CLOSED,                 WHY NOT

THE       'OFF L I C E N C E S ’.   WHEN FANS PURCHASE FROM    'OFF L I C E N C E S ’ THEY BUY 4 PACKS

WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF ENCOURAGING THEM TO DRINK 4 DRINKS BEFORE ENTERING

THE GROUND WHICH DELAYS THEM.

6)         WITH THE AMOUNT OF VIDEO EQUIPMENT I.E. TV SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS WHY

COULD THEY NOT INTERPRET WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE.
                                                                                    P AtaE
                                                                                    GSL341

 7)     I BELIEVE FANS WITHOUT TICKETS WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR        IN THE

 TRAGEDY.      THOSE LOOKING FOR   'SPARES’ WILL GENERALLY STRAND AWAY FROM THE

 GROUND FACING INCOMING FANS AND ANY PROCEEDING TRANSACTIONS ARE DONE AT

 A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE G R O U N D .

 8)     WHY WAS AN INEXPERIENCED SENIOR OFFICER PUT IN CHARGE OF THE OPERATION.

 9)     TICKET ALLOCATIONS PUT PEOPLE IN AN UNACCUSTOMED SITUATION I.E„ A

 STAND SEASON TICKET HOLDER MAY BE ALLOCATED A TERRACE TICKET.

 10)   STEWARDS AT ANFIELD FOR     INSTANCE KNOW THEIR CROWD AND CAN SENSE THE

 MOOD OF THE CROWD.      AT NEUTRAL VENUES I.E. HILLSBOROUGH/WEMBLEY THEY

 COULD BE USED TO ASSIST THE LOCAL POLICE/STEWARDS.         IT WOULD:

 1A    GREATLY ASSIST LOCAL POLICE/STEWARDS,     SENSING THE CROWD MOOD,

 KNOWLEDGE OF HOOLIGANS ETC.

 2.    GREATLY REWARD LOYAL STEWARDS      AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO AN EVEN

 BETTER JOB.

 3.    RELEASE TICKETS THAT THOSE STEWARDS WOULD NORMALLY OBTAIN FOR THE

 NEUTRAL V E N U E .

 I    AM A                                        I   HAVE BEEN A Q U A L IF IE D F IR S T AIDER Atil)

 SUBSEQUENTLY LAY INSTRUCTOR FOR 2 4 YEARS IN THE ST JOHN AMBULANCE ANy LATELY

 THE TE R R IT O R IA L ARMY.       I   HAVE TEN YEARS EXPERIENCE OF DEALING WITH LARGE

 CROWDS WHILST ON DUTY WITH THE ST JOHN AMBULANCE AT LIVERPOOL F . C . ,                             EVERTON

 F.C.,       AINTREE RACE COURSE AND NUMEROUS POP CONCERTS.

 ONCE THE GAME HAD BEEN STOPPED DUE TO THE CROWD THAT HAD S P IL L E D ONTO THE

 P ITC H BEHIND THE GOAL,           I   WAS PREVENTED FROM SEEING HOW SERIOUS THE S IT U A T IO N

 WAS.        IT   WAS ONLY AFTER R E A L IS IN G THAT TWO OF THE CASUALTIES WHO WERE

 E^lcUATED, ONE WITH A SERIOUS ARM INJURY AND THE SECOND DEAD THAT I REALISED

 HOW SERIOUS THE S IT U A T IO N WAS.

 I DECIDED TO GO ONTO THE P IT C H TO A S S IS T T H IS WAS APPROX TEN MINUTES AFTER

 THE GAME HAD BEEN CALLED OFF.                I   SAW AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO

 RESUSITATE CASUALTIES WHO OBVIOUSLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING,                                     BUT

 BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF TRAINED PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE THEY WERE TRYING

 ANYTHING TO R EVIVE THEM,               IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THE TWO THEY WERE WORKING

 ON WERE BEYOND HELP ANYWAY I               NOTICED I      THINK    IT    WAS A POLICE OFFICER AND I

 THINK       IT WAS A TRAINED NURSE ATTEMPTING TO RESUSITATE A YOUNG WOMAN.                             I    ASKED

 THE PERSON WHO WAS G IV IN G MOUTH TO MOUTH RESUSITATIO N                        IF   THEY WANTED R E L IE V IN G
                                                                                               PAGE    S
                                                                                               GSL3422

AND TOOK OVER MOUTH TO MOUTH RESUSITATION.

I KEPT T H IS UP FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE CASUALTY.

I   CHECKED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NURSE FOR ANY V IT A L SIGNS FROM THE CASUALTY

AND AS THE NURSE HAD BEEN WORKING ON THE P A TIE N T LONGER THAN MYSjSLF *WE DECIDED

THERE' WAS NOTHING MORE THAT COULD BE DONE.

I   THEN MOVED TO ANOTHER CASUALTY WHICH WAS A MAN AT A QUESS IN H I S EARLY

TW ENTIES,     AGAIN AFTER A NUMBER OF MINUTES            I   AG AIN GOT NO RESPONSE FROM THE

CASUALTY.       AS I       WAS CHECKING FOR V IT A L SIGNS MY ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO A

FURTHER CASUALTY WHO WAS BEING L IF T E D FROM OUT OF THE TERRACING,                  HE APPEARED

TO HAVE SOME COLOUR SO I             DECIDED TO CHECK TO SEE I F      THERE WAS ANY CHAN/E

OF RESUSTATING HIM WHICH I              D ID AND FORTUNATELY THE CASUALTY RESPONDED),          I

        LISTED IN PLACING HIM        IN AN AMBULANCE WHEN HE LEFT ME HE WAS S T I L L A L IV E .

THERE D ID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY OTHER CASUALTIES THAT I                  COULD G IV E P O S IT IV E

HELP TO,      SO I   RETURNED TO MY SON IN THE STAND.

I   FEEL THAT IF       SOME FORM OF ANNOUNCEMENT HAD BEEN MADE ASKING FOR THE

ASSISTANCE OF PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE THEN ASSISTANCE COULD HAVE

BEEN GIVEN BY MYSELF AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GROUND.                     THE SERIOUSNESS

OF THE S IT U A T IO N MUST HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO WHOEVER WAS JW CONTROL BEHIND THE

GOAL AND REQUESTS FOR HELP SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCE!

PHRASED IN SUCH A WAY SO AS NOT TO CAUSE PANIC AMONG THE CROWD.

 NO.

 Q53

 HANDLED,   AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE

      kUATION AND REACTION TO THE SITUATION.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS WAS THE INITIAL PROBLEM,                 THE F .A . EXPECTING PEOPLE

 WHO DID NOT HAVE TICKETS NOT TO ATTEMPT TO TRAVEL AND GAIN ADMISSION

 TO THE GROUND.     THEY SHOULD HAVE REALISED WHAT FANATICAL SUPPORTERS THE

 PEOPLE OF LIVERPOOL ARE.         THE ALLOCATION SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AVERAGE

 HOME ATTENDANCES.

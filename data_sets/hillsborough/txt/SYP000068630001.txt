      reality      that       it took at         least    half an hour             to    realise         that     there was

      even serious            injury.          1 could see m o u t h        to m o u t h       being attempted, by

      Police,      A m bulance          and    even other       s p ectators           but    there was an air                      of

      such      calm that         1 and others          thought      the worst           of what we were                  seeing

 Sheffield         reporters          but       not    to myself       appeared        from time        to time        in

 the    press      box    to tell          us    there w ould        be an official            statement,.           He

 con f i r m e d to us off            the       record    the m o u n t i n g    toll    of    deaths      but was

 unable     to make any details                       known    other    than     the    calling       of a press

 conference at a nearby                     police       station at 7pm.               we also       had   c onflicting

 arguments         sug g e s t e d    to us       by fans,       by police and           indeed by the              gate m a n

as to what          had h a p p e n e d         outside,        1 am not        competant        to make any first

 hand     observation           on that          except       to say that        it was       sug g e s t e d at     one

 point    that      the gate          outside          had been s m a s h e d open by unruly                  supporters

and that         inspecting           the       gate myself       it was        obvious       that    no damage

w h i c h might       have      c o r r o b o r a t e d then was        evident.         The S h e f f i e l d Ch.

Supt      later     confirmed at                his    press    conference        that    the     gate     had      been

o p e n e d on     i nst r uct i on f r om a senior               p o 1 i ce of ficer .

To     return      to events          that       1 could see         the acti o n s      following         the      opening

of     the small         gate    to a l l o w spect a t o r s          onto     the    field was        followed          by

 confusion,         we were          now    looking at          some    two     thousand       people      on the

 playing area.             Nottingham             fans a r o u n d     us were        shouting abuse           relating

 to Heyssl         and    clearly          still       c o nvinced     they were        watch i n g     the    results

of anot h e r Liverpool                crowd          riot.

Again     this was a b s o l u t e l y ^in c o n t r a d i c t i o n to the                non a g g r e s s i v e

Two ambul a n c e s        appeared          on the ground,          one     inched       its way thro u g h the

L i verpool        s u pporters        behind what         had    been G r o b b e l a a r ’s goal,         the    other

remained         close     to    the    entrance at         the opposite            end of the          ground,     yet

still     because        the a m b u l a n c e     the    goalmouth         remained        on the      scene     rather

than    rushing away,             we did not          suspect      really       serious         casualties,         The

police         had visi b l y     been having            difficulties          with      their    radios     but    bv

now    policemen were a s s i s t i n g             the w o u n d e d and the shoc k e d              in every way,.

of ar o u n d ten off            the    field and the distress                  in that         officer's       eyes

s i g n a l l e d to me     that       the    policeman       himself        was    shocked       by what       he was

hav i ng to deal          wi t h .

At    this      point,     p o s sibly       twenty five minu t e s           after       the    game    had been

interrupted,            I saw D a l g l i s h and B r i a n C l o u g h         standing         on the field

near    the half way             line      in con v e r s a t i o n w ith a senior              policeman.         It

was    obvious         from their          demeanour       that    they were          being      told something

quite     d istressing          and D a l g l i s h who       had shown so much emot i o n                  during

M y opin i o n with              hindsight        and after         speaking both              to   police

and to fans              caught      up in the trag e d y            is that          there was         no deli b e r a t e

cause      that       I know of          c o n t r ibuting     to    this       but that         several       factors       d:id

so and should be                 changed       instantly.

between H e y s e 1,             B r a d f o r d and H i l l s b o r o u g h     is that because              oflocked

doors      there was             no escape        when      panic    sat       in.I am aware            there         was no

perimeter           fence at B r a d f o r d         but    crucially           the    doors      behind       s p ectators

were    locked arid the                instinct       in panic        is to flee             the way you            earns in,.

b rav e r y    by p o l icemen           to   pull    people        out    of    the      crowd and to attempt

first    aid.            I believe        however       they a cted as             individuals           and that

whatever           orders were           served      came    'too late          for a c o o r d i n a t e d     pre-'emptus

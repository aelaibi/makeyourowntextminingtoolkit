                  F.C.          Suppo rt e r .

                  On     Saturday                  150489       I travelled                       to Hi 1 1 sf a o r o u g h       to    see         the          match.            I

                  t rave lied                 by   car        with         four       friends who                are    Nott ingham              Forest

                  s u ppo rt e rs .

                  I did             not       have       a    ticket         for       the        match         but     I managed            to       buy          a   ticket

                  from          a     young        lad w i t h         a    man        close          to    the       ground.           I do/f*t                  think       he

                  was       a       ticket         tout,        just         someone              who      had    a    spare       tiyffet.                   I    paid       £10

                  for       it.

                  At     the          match         I separated                from        my        friends          and    they       went         to           other       areas

                  of     the          stadium            for    the        Nottingham                 Forest          supporters.                                         /

                  Before/We                   went       to    the         ground          we      went         into    a    p u b , the         N o t t i nsrnam

            On      Saturday          8th April          19 8 9    (080489)          I went         toy^-Theffie 1 d as        a Liverpool

            and Nottingham                Forest.




             I did     not       h a ve    a ticket         for     the       game     but        I knew   from    previous

            experience            that         there    would       probably           be    someone       in the a r e a       of   the

            ground       who      would         be     prepared        to     sell     me    a ticket       although       I mi ght        have

    to      pay o v e r         the      odds




    I arrived                in S h e f f i e l d         wi th^sorae         friends              at a b o u t       1 1 . 4 5 /km.         I believe

    the       ground          o p e n e d at         abjret       1 1 . 0 0 am.              I managed          tjj^miy a t i c k e t              from a

    man       about          10 m i n u t e j ^ r o m            the    ground.               T h e j**5n h a d w i t h          him     his       so n

    and       he     h)$d a £ 6 jfca n d i n g                 ticket        at        t HV'1_i ve r poo 1 e n d           of    the     ground.               I

    paid       £10        Aoryjjft.            I could           see    that           there       were       other       people       also

    selling             tickets          but        I did        not    see       any        forgeries.




    I entered                the    ground           at     about       S . 20         pm.     The       turnstiles             were     already
\jj.T s ~
^   pusy       but        I was       surprised                how     few    police           there          were     about.          I had        no

              iculty          getting           in the           ground and              unlike          my    previous          experience               at

    the       semi        finals         there         was       no    "screening'                 as    we a p p r o a c h e d       the     ground

    to    ensure             that     we       had     tickets.




    Having           entered          the       ground           I wa s      able        to    go       to    the    front       of    the     terrace

    directly              against          the       wall        and    the a n t i           hooligan          fencing.              The     wall        was

    between             knee       and     waist          high        and    the        fencing          was    fixed       on    to     the       top     of

    the       wall.           Gradually              the       crowd        began        to    grow and             I di d at         on e    point

    think          of     going       into          the    wings        of    the>terr^€e                    because       they       were     empty

    but       to     do      that     I would             have        had    to    go        over       the    top    of    the       fencing        of

    the       p en      or    out     of       the     central          terrace              and    round       to    the       side.




    I was          on     the      front        ro w      of     the    central              terrace          about       10 or       13 f e e t     of

    the       right          hand     goal          post       facing        down        the       pitch.




    When       I first           went          on    to    the        terrace          some        of    the    players         were         out   on

    the       pitch          having        a    kick       about        but       they        soon      went        in.




    As    3    o'clock           drew          near       th e    names       of       the     teams          were    announced              and   there
                                                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                                                        S53A

was    general        cheering.                I cannot              remember          the    actual            kick       off     and    so       I

believe        that      the     incident             of       the     pressure         on me        took        place        at    about




At    first     I. s i m p l y      felt       a    big        surge        of   the    crowd        corning          from       the     back.

I expected          it    to     recede            because           sometimes          when       the      players           c om e     out

the    crowd moves             forward             but     almost           inevitably         start            to m o v e       back

easing       the    pressure             on    those           at    the     front      once       they         have       seen     the

players        warming         up     before          the m a t c h          starts.




On    this     occasion          however            the        pressure          did    not    ease         and       I became

increasingly aware                    of      pressure              from     the      back    p u s h i n g me         forward.               1

became       pinned       to     the       fence         straight            ahead      of    me.          I wa s      not       pushed           to

the    side     at all.             At     first         the        pressure          was    on m y        back,       then        it    got

worse     and worse            until          after        a        few m in u t e s        X wa s     numb          in m y      left     arm.

I ha d    put m y        left       arm       on    to     the       fence       to    try    to     stop myself                 being

pressed against                it a n d        I could              not m a n a g e     to    pull         it    back.           I was        not

able     to m o v e      my    b o d y at          all.



The    match       was    still          going        on a n d         I could         hear     people           screaming              around

me.      The    crowd were               calling           to       the     police      to    open         the       gates       in the

fencing        to a l l o w      us      on    to     the       pitch        but      nothing        seemed           to    be

happening.            Some       of      the       crowd were               worried         about      children             who     were

with     them and were                calling            to     the       police       and    people            on    the     side       of       the

pitch     for a s s i s t a n c e .




At    first     the      police          did       not     seem        to    realise         that      a    serious           p r o b l e m M/as

developing.              I di d       not      se e      the        policeman          run    o n to       the       pitch       and     stop

the    game     whi ch        I have          later        been        told      happened.

                   I only       became            aware        of     the       f a ct      t h at    the       match          had        stopped          when     people

                   started          climbing            over        the     f en c e .         I could              still          h ea r    people          screaming

                   to    the    policemen               and      other          people         to     open          up    the       gates.             I did       hear      a

                   St    John       Ambulance             man       tell        us     that        the     gates          in the            fencing          had    been

                   opened       and        so we        could         take       it      easy        since          we    would           be a l l o w e d       out      but

                   no-one       was        stopping            to a l l o w          anybody          else          through.                I believe            in fact

                   that    the          number       of      people         was        so    great         and       t he      pressure               so   heavy       t ha t

                   the    only          change       of      getting            out      through           the       gate          wa s     to    be       directly         in

                   front       of       it.



                   I could          not       move      my     head        or a r m         since         it w a s        heavily             pressed against

                   the    fence.              On my       right        was       a     lady who            had       put       her a r m          across         the

                   fence       to       ease      pressure            on    herself            a nd my          head and              throat           were      pressed

                   against          he r      arm    which          c a u s e d me          difficulties                  in b r e a t h i n g .




                   On my       left        wa s      a man          w ho    looked            to     be a b o u t         19 y e a r s            old.      He     wa s

                   screaming             all      the     time        until          suddenly             he    threw          up a n d           wassick          all

^                  over    me.           I could          then        feel        him       urinating               over       me     on m y          back    and      legs

                   believe          t h at     he    died        at    my       side        when      he       fell.

          •L q .   I do    not          know      how     long        1 was          pinned          to    the       wall          and      fence          before      I

                   Before       I got          out      I wa s        conscious               of     the       police          trying            to    pull      the

                   barriers             down      but     I was        standing               right        next          to    a    post         w h i c h wa s

                   holding          a    barrier          up a n d         I knew           th a t    if t h e y          got       the      fence          down    they

                   would       not       be a b l e       to     pull       the        post        down.            Additionally                  I k ep t       thinking

                   that    if the             barrier          came        down        I would            not       be a b l e        to     get       over      the       wall

                   since       I wa s         pinned         right         to     it     by my        legs          and       I wa s        afraid         that     people

would       be     trampling            over       me.




I kept        hearing            wires        ' p o p p i n g ’ and       knew          that       I had       to    get     out      if     I was

to    survive.              I managed             in the       end      to     pull          myself       up the          fence       w ith my

right       hand and             I could          feel       somebody          above          me    trying          to    lift       me    out.

I have        s i nce       seen       on    television             news       a    policeman             pulling          me    over        the

fence.

At    first        I could            not    get       over    the       fence          because          my    left a r m        was       pi n n e d




Then     my      jeans       caught          on    the       spikes       in t h e w a i s t b a n d               and    I had       to     l ower

myself        down      to       release          the    spike          then       be    pul led f u r t h e r            only       to    find

that     my      jeans       had       caught          in the       sp i k e .          My    jeans       and       shirt       were       badly

torn     but       I was         eventually             pul led o v e r            the       fence       and went          on    to       the

pitch.



The    people          on    the       fence       who       were       lifting          fans       over       were       too    busy

lifting          fans       to    deal       with       those       who      ha d       been able             to    get    over.           At

first       I stayed             on    the     floor         for    a few moments                   but       I wanted          to    get       out

of    the w a y        of    the       first       aid       and    police          who       were       dealing          with       fans       more

seriously           injured            than       me    or    those       who       had       died.           My    legs     ha d     been

pressed          against          the w a l l          and were          cut       and       bruised.               I had       no    feeling

in m y      left       arm       but     I    could walk            slowly and                so    I went          down     the      pitch

towards          the    centre           circle         and walked             towards             the    Forest          s i de.         There

was    nobody          telling           us w h a t      to    d o , nobody              seeemd          to    know what             to    do

even     though         I kept           looking         for       someone          to       give    directions              which would

give     guidance            as       to w h e r e      the    fans       who       had       been       involved          should move

or    sit     or    rest.              I therefore             climbed             into       the    seating             section          o v er

the    bi1lboards.                    I was       looking          to    see       if    I recognised anyb od y who                             may

be    able       to a s s i s t .            I had      gone       to    the m a t c h w i t h            my       fiancee's          sister

and    he r boyf r i e nd a n d                her      friend and             husband             and    as       I walked          down       the
                                                                                                                                  PA G E         6
                                                                                                                                  S53 A

side    of     the    pitch         I looked            for       someone        I had       seen with           them     earlier           in

the    Nottingham             Public       House,            Sheffield           which       wa s    a    public       house       near

the    Hospital          n e ar     th e   ground.                A rnan 1 h a d        seen        there       r e c o g n i s e d me

although          1 do       not    know        hi s    name       and     wiped       the    sick        f r o m me.




I also       sa w a      friend who              had        travelled        up w i t h       me     in m y      car     (she w a s m y

f i a n c e e ’s s i s t e r ’s g i r l f r i e n d ) .             She     asked       if    1 was        alright        but       I

could     not       remember         my     reply.



I had      climbed           back    by     this        time       over     the       billboards           and     was    walking

along     the       touchline            down      towards          th e    Forest       K o p End.            There      was      a     good

deal     of a b u s e        from    people            as    I walked        down       since        they       did    not    seem         to

know     the      extent       of    the        tragedy.            Someone           shouted        to me,        "We'll         never

get    into E u r o p e        n o w ” and         "its       always        you       scousers."




I c 1 imbed         back      over       th e    seats        and went           to    the    toilets           in the       stand.

There      wa s     still      no    feeling            in m y       left    arm.        I filled a sink                  with          water

and    d u ck e d my         head    into        it.         I knew        that       people        were       staring       at    me

because        my    jeans         and     shirt        were       torn     and       I washed           off    the    dirt       as     far

as    I could.



I went       back      into        the     ground           and    climbed        over       the     billboards           and       I

could     hear       Forest         fans        shouting           about     Liverpool              in a w a y w h i c h

indicated           they      did    not        know what           was     happening.               Liverpool           fans      were

still      being       blamed and               taunted           in the     ch a n t s .           1 also      heard a       roar

from     the      Liverpool          end a n d              I could        see    bodiesbeing              brought        out      on

bill b o a r d s     and      fencing           and         laid     on t h e     pitch.            I saw      people being

given      the      ki s s    of    life        all     over       the     pitch.




Eventually           the a t m o s p h e r e           c h a n g e d as     the       Forest        fans       realised       t h at

                                                                                                                                S 53A

something           very       serious           had    happened.          At       first         it    seemed       to    be   only

those       in the        seats       down        the    side     of    the       pitch who             realised what            had

happened           but    then       those        standing       at     the       end       knew       there    had       been a

great       tragedy.




I climbed           b a ck     over       th e    billboards*           went        up      the    passage          through      the

seats,        past       the    b a c k of       the    stands     and     left          the       ground.            1walked       to

the    car a n d         could       see     ambulance           men,     ambulances and                  police

everywhere           controlling                 the    traffic        flow.




I went        to    p h on e    my m o t h e r         from a shop         to       tell       her      that    I was       alright

but    she     had       not    heard        about       the    incidents              at    the       ground.        I got      back

to    the     car    between          4.15        and    4.30    pm a n d       my       friend who            had    travelled          up

with     me    came       back       at      about       5 . 0 0 pm.




We    listened           to    radio         Hal lam a n d at          f i r st     I. o n l y h e a r d       of    a few

casualties           but       gradually           the    figure        kept        going         up.




I could        not       drive       home        because       I physically                 unable      and     so m y      f i a n c e e ’s

drive       anyway        as    I was        in    no    c o n d i t i o n to     do     that.




We    listened           to    the    radio        and     I could        hear         them appealing                for     off d u t y

police        and medical             staff        to    report        in as      s o o n as       possible.

    because       it w a s    a Liverpool            shirt       and     people         were     taunting         it.

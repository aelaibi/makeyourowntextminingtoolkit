As you know, I have been considering whether there is a case for a further public inquiry
into^ the Hillsborough disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved
received renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama
“Hillsborough” last December.

I have had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been put forward,
calling for a new public inquiry. I have decided, in all the circumstances, that there should
be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked before a
final decision is taken. I have, therefore, announced in the House today that there will be
an independent scrutiny by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of
Appeal. I enclose for your information a copy of my statement to the House, which
includes Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s terms of reference. You will see that I have
undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives me.

I hope that this examination will enable us to establish conclusively whether or not
material evidence about the causes of that terrible afternoon at Hillsborough has been
overlooked, and to take action if it has.

HILLSBOROUGH DISCIPLINE PROCEEDINGS

I attach a copy of a letter      dated 19 July 1991 from South
Yorkshire Police Authority in     anticipation of a request for
financial assistance to engage   legal representation by Ch Supt
Duckenfield and Supt Murray in   the disciplinary proceedings.

2.   There is an exchange of correspondence between FI and F2
leading to the issue of Home Office Circular 77/87 Financial
Assistance to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings and it is
clear from the F2 "line to take" (copy aside) that discipline
proceedings fall outside the scope of this circular and that
payment for legal representation in legal proceedings was not
meant to come from public funds.

3.   I attach a draft reply to South Yorkshire Police Authority
and should be grateful for your comments in view of your recent
conversation with South Yorkshire on this matter. A quick reply
would be appreciated as the police authority request a response
by the end of the month.

Thank you for your letter of 19 July regarding a possible request

for financial assistance to engage legal representatives by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray at the
discipline proceedings relating to the Hillsborough disaster.



It is clear from the background papers leading to the issue of

Home    Office   Circular   77/87   Financial   Assistance   to   Police

Officers in Legal Proceedings that discipline proceedings were

not intended to fall within the scope of this circular.             Such

expenditure would not therefore rank for police grant.

    Dear Sirs
    HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 77/87 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
    I am anticipating a request for financial assistance to engage legal
    representatives by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent
    Murray. This will be for represenatation at the Discipline Proceedigns
    which are now to be brought and arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy.
    Whilst the circular does not specifically cover such proceedings I assume
    that the central principle applies equally to them as it does to any other
    form of legal proceedings. However, I shall be pleased if you will confirm
    should the Police Authority decide to provide funding that such expenditure
    will be eligible for grant.
    Because of the urgency in this I shall be pleased if you will reply before
    the end of the month.
    Yours faithfully

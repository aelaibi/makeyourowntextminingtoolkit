Dear Mr Croston

David Duckenfield - Hillsborough Disaster

Thank you very much for sending the further copy correspondence under cover of a "With
Comps" slip.

The letter of 24th August 1998 from HFSG to yourself refers to a file of questionnaires,
statements and matters under various TAB numbers. The enclosures were not with the copy
bundle, and if it is not too difficult I would be grateful if you would send us a copy so that
we can cross refer to the references in the letter.

Many thanks.

Yours sincerely




 SIMON EASTWOOD

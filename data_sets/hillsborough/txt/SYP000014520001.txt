    Dear Rogan,

    Following my telephone conversation with your wife on Thursday 20th April, I
    am putting in writing for record, if required, facts which we feel are a vital
    contribution to the Public Enquiry following the Hillsborough Disaster.

    My wife and I travelled to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final by car and leit the M1
    Motorway at exit 36. We then followed the signposts for Shexiield North, A61,
    leading off the first roundabout from the M l . Several yards along this road,
    the Police were stopping all football coaches, which is usual practice noted
    from our previous visits to Hillsborough, thus delaying the arrival time of
    these coaches at the ground.   We then approached the next roundabout, where
    Police were stopping all traffic except traffic coming from the^MI direction.
    However, whilst following the road around the roundabout, a Policeman was
    standing next to a large traffic indication board, complete with directional
    arrow, directing traffic to the Hillsborough Ground. As I approached this
    board, I hesitated and almost stopped as the arrow was incorrectly pointed,
    thus sending traffic down the Manchester/Stockbridge road. ^ Fortunately,
    because of my previous visits to Hillsborough, I realised just m time that
     the arrow on the board was pointed in the wrong direction. The Policeman
    in question noticed my hesitation, quickly glanced at the board and
     immediately moved the arrow to the correct direction of Sheixield North.
     Certainly the two cars in front of me were football spectators and were
     clearly directed away from the ground, the approximate time being 2.00
     2.10. p.m. We both looked down the Manchester/Stockbridge road and as^far as
     our eyes could see, all the cars were held up in a traffic jam and Policemen
     were not allowing traffic from this road into the roundabout.

    We ask ourselves, how many cars were sent in the wrong direction and for how
    long were they held up?

    Obviously, we both feel very strongly and passionately about this tragedy
    and if you require any further details orconfirmation  of these facts, please
    do not hesitate to contact us.

    We wish you all the very best in yourefforts to see that this time the
    truth is told to the public, not only for the families of the bereaved and
    injured, but for all decent people.

     Yours sincerely,________

At    8.30 am        ( 0830      h r s ) Superintendent                   Brougham        opened        the    briefing         and

generally          outlined          his    o v e r a 11    requirements.




The    briefing          then      split        into    two     groups           -   I continued         to    brief      the

Officers          detailed         to    perform        duties           in    relation         to the      fans      travailing

allowed          them      to     do    this        on t h /             roadside           a n d as     they      did       not    appear

Junction 33 Catcliffe.                              This         was       to     relieve           c o n g e s t i o n at     Tinsley.

The     d iv e rs i o n w o r k e d well                 and Tinsley                   quickly cleared whe re upo n                       the

traffic.             Reports           were        received               of    some        c o n g e s t i o n at      Park Square            and

in the A t t e r c l i f f e            a r e a as          a    result           of    the      diversion             but m o t o r c y c l i s t s

had     been        deployed           to a s s i s t           on       these       ro ute s.




Between          1330           14C       there          was         a    noticable            drop      in t r a f f i c      on t he

motorway            north      J b o u nd.         In    particular                  there      was      little         or    no    football

_At    1 420     I had         cheeked with                 Inspector                Cawthorne          M1      Junction           34,

was     some      reports         from      th e m o t o r c y c l e     wing      of       residual       traffic        in the

Burngreave            area      but     they were          dealing        with         it.




Shor tly after              t ha t     t i m e Jrffi cers      on d u t y        on     the M1       south       of S h e f f i e l d

At     1430      we    a t t e n d e d at      Woodall        Police          Post.




At a r o u n d     14 50 we          went     to   the     service        area         on    the   north        b o u n d at

At     sometime        around          1505 -      1 510 w h i l s t      in the            service       area     for    m e al

ground        control        requesting            do g    handlers           i n to    the     gr o u n d .

Together         with       Inspector          Cawthorne           I made        my way         back      to    the P o l i c e

affirmative.               At     around       1 5 2 0 we a t t e n d e d        at     the F o r c e      Driving        School

where       I liaised           briefly with Superintendent                             Brougham          ( O H X 1).     We       then

    At    approximately             1530 -      1533 after          Superintendent               Brougham             had

    deployed motorcycle                  patrols        I was      deployed with              Inspector           Cawthorne             to

    ensure      the m o t o r w a y      to    the    south was          clear.




    J u n c t i o n 3 4 at     Tinsley         was    checked.           Lane      one w a s      coned         off    to a l l o w

    in    charge   .


    At    1 5 5 5 we    checked Woodall               service       area       south      bound and             found       no

    I r e m a i n e d at W o o d a l l        south     bound and            noticed a heavy               volume       of

    football       supporters            entering          the    services.




    Operations          asked      via    radio       if    I required a              police      presence            from

    Derbyshire          Police       at W o o d a l l .      I agreed          that     if D e r b y s h i r e        could

    The    service          area    continued         to    fill    with       football         supporters             in the

Re I Meeting         Of ■ficers of All Party Football Committee
and Lord Justice Taylor, Home Office, 14 November 1989



Tom Pendry MP, Chairman of the All Party Football Committee
and who led the delegation of Officers to give further
evidence to Lord Justice Taylor before he completes his final
report on the Hillsborousk tragedy, was disturbed to read the
comments made in several newspapers by John Carlisle
concerning this private meeting.

Mr John Carlisle* MP for Luton North, was specifically
invited by me in order to give the kind of broad
r e p r esentation requested by Lord Justice Taylor, to present
the view in favour of ID cards, Hr Simon Hughes was also
included to give the delegation greater political balance.

The Officers of the Committee regret very much that Lord
Justice Taylor has been embroiled in such an unnecessary and
unwarranted dispute.  This is all the more true since the
Officers felt the even-handedness shown by the judge was
exemplary and that the remarks published in the press bore
little resemblance to what actually happened in what was a
constructive two hour meeting.

Mr Carlisle, who is a member but not an Officer of the
Committee,  seemed to be somewhat confused as to the actual
terms of the e n q u i r y ’s remit.

            constables           and    above       had      no     idea     of    what        to     do,       Many      were        unable       i

            work    without           being       told     exactly where                 to    go     and     what       to    do.      withou

            personal        radios          directions            were       limited.           Hany         constables           were       too

            concerned about                 finding         their        serials,         than         trying       to     help       the

as    fans    were        now    openly           drinking          and        sunbathing              on the         grass       verge

outside       Halford^           off       Penistone              Road.         Officers             from       the    Mounted

Branch were              delegated           and       together          with        officers            from my           serial        I

attended           on    the     industrial                site    as    potential              trouble          was       reported a

peaceful           if    noisy.        Most           were    under        the       influence             of    drink;       several

fans     were       at    the     doors       to       the    Gateway           Supermarket.                    The    special           tra

arrived        slightly           ahead       of       schedule          and        we    were       informed          that       there

were     approximately                 430       on    board.           All     were        quiet,         well       behaved and

 presented          no    problems           whatsoever.                  It    was        decided         that       my    serial '

would        tag    along        the       rear       of    the    fans        to    ensure          their       entrance           to       th

 ground.           By    this     time       fans          were    still        walking           away         from    the    directi

 of    the    ground,           looking          for       drink,        pubs,        etc.,          together         with    other

 officers          we    attempted           to       turn most           of    the        fans       b a ck    towards       the

 ground       but       despite        our       assurance            that      no       pubs were             open,       fans     stil!

The    fans     from          the       special             train were          escorted             by       other          serials       and

match.

The     time       would          be     approaching               1450       hours       en    route          to       the    g r o u n d we

Claywheels              Lane       after             fans    had     started         fighting                inside.           Several           fa

were     injured             but       were          ushered       away       by    friends.                 The    incident          was

calmed and              we     continued                towards         Claywheels             Lane.           Again          I was

monitoring              requests              for      a gate,          Leppings          Lane          end    to       be    opened.

Several        such          requests                were    made       before       I heard             the       instruction             for-

the     gate       to     be      opened.              By    this       time       three       of       my    serial          t hat was

were    directed                 toward        the    injured.

Doctors        came          forward           also       and       were      utilised             accordingly.                      I still           at

this    point           had        no     idea        of    what         had          happened,              many     constables                    were

walking        aimlessly                  about        having            been         separated               from        colleagues                  anc

were    in m y          opinion           lost       as    to       what      to      do.

Radio     transmissions                    at     t his        time      were          few     and       still       th e          full       tragedy

was     no t       known.                 I,     at       no        time       handled             any        bodies,               other           than

directing               where        to        place       persons            for       treatment.                   A l l the            bodies           I

directed           as       such,        had     police          officers              or     civilians             with           them.

Once     I     entered              the        area       A/G       I    went         towards            the        tunnel,             many        fans

were     there              crying,        upset,          angered.               I     attempted             to     move          the        f ans    tc

what     now       was           becoming         a    sterile              area.           (Area        1-16).               Many        moved        or.

and     were            appreciative                  of       what         everyone               was        t r y i n g to              do,       many

refused        to           move    and        showed          their         anger           towards           me    and           other        police

present.                I    was        unable        to       clear          t he       tunnel          of     f a ns. The                  area     A/C

apart        from       the        tunnel        area          was      almost          cleared.              Then        I    directed             five

constables                  up     the     stairs           to        the      seating             area        of     the          West         Stand,

where        in         the        passageways                 behind,            people           were        stood, awaiting                        the

game     to    restart.

At     this    time              I was    not        aware       of      whether            the        match       had        been       abandonee

but     decided              under        the     circumstances                       that        it    would        be.            I    therefore

instructed                  the     constables                 to       quietly             ask        who     was        present              to     get

their        families,              friends,               etc.,         and       to       leave       the     stand.                  Surprising

the     fans       left           peacefully,              many         asking          how    many          were     dead,             to    which         I
                                                                                                                                                       i

could        not    answer.                The       match       had        not       been     officially                 called             off,     but

fans     accepted                 that     it    would           be     and       left.        The       odd       on e       or    two       passing

comments                about            Police            inadequacy                   and            that         the            Police            were

repsonsible                  for     what        had       happened.               The       vast        majority              however              being

 stunned          and        shocked,           left       the        stand       with        little          fuss.           It    was       at     this

point    I was    able     to   enter    the   seating        area    of   the    West    Stand    and    saw

the     commotion     on    the    field.         The    bodies       of    the    dead        having    been

already     cleared      from     the    pitch.     I    helped      to    clear    the    seating       area

fully     and    after     which    I    decided    to       make    my    way    back    to    Claywheels

Lane,    where    I was     able    to   re-group       my    serial.

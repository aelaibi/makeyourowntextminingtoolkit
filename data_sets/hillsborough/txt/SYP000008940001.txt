                I am a Po 1 ice Sergeant        in the South Yo rkshi re Police            presen11y

                stationed at Attercliffe Pol Stn as uniformed                    patrol    sergeant.



                On Saturday     15 April      1989   (150489)     I was on uniform patrol          duty-

                working 6am to 6 pm (0600 to 1800)                covering Attercliffe DS Division,



                At 3. 05pm    (1505)   this date     I was at Attercliffe Pol Stn having my

                second meal watching what appeared to be a public orders situation on

                the television at Hillsborough Football                   Ground.       Immediately I was

                informed that operation support was                 implemented and together with

                Police Sergeant HANNAN and PC                          (POL PS HANNAN and POL PC

                                 1 went to Hillsborough Football Ground travelling along

               Herries Rd onto Penistone Rd arriving about 3.10pm                        (1510)   this date.

I saw numerous              public          vehicles          and o f f i c e r s who           had a t t e n d e d and were

making      their      way       into       the    ground.              I entered         the     ground       via a gate

near    to t u r n s t i l e      number          88.          'I went      i m m e d i a t e l y onto    the    pitch

between        the S p i o n Kop and               the N o r t h S t a n d .             I saw what a p p e a r e d          to be

a large        disturbance with                   supporters           spilling          onto     the    pitch at          the

opposite        end of          the    football           gro u n d L e p p i n g s      Ln.          I saw numerous

officers        in that a rea a n d a further                           line      of    officers        in a semi          circle

across      t h e pitch.



A Po l i c e    Inspector was                positioned             in u n i f o r m at         the entrance          to the

pitch      re s t r i c t i n g access.                  He    i n s t r u c t e d my s e l f    and other       officers

attending        to    return          to    the     g y m n a s i u m w here we would                 be formed       into a

serial      and deployed.                    I     the r e f o r e     re turned        to t h e g y m n a s i u m at       thi s

time     I saw no          casua l t i e s         leaving         the     pitch.



On a r r i v i n g    at    the       g y m n as i u m    I saw and          joi n e d DS Crime and Vandal

Unit,      who were         positioned             in front           of the       gymnasium.



As   I waited         I saw       injured          people         begin to         leave        the   pitch being           taken

into    the gymnasium.                      At     first        it was a slow            stream and then              it

increased.             People          were        being a s s i s t e d         by officers and football

s u p p o r t e r s ca r r i e d o n h o a r d i n g s .



As   the    number         of    c asualties             inc r e a s e d    I r e a lised        some were       dead.



I went      back      to the          pitch to           reassess          the    s i t u a t i o n and saw disaster,

people      lying      or being             carried all             around        the    pitch,       both     inju r e d and

dead.          I saw one          officer a p p r o x i m a t e l y              thi r t y yards        onto    the    pitch

attending        to a s e r i o u s l y           injured male.                   I went        to assist       him and

together        with       three L i verpool                  supporters          placed him onto a hoarding
an d    carried him              into    the    g y m na s i u m w h i c h was          the are a d e s i g n a t e d for

On e n t ering           the     gymnasium       1' was a s k e d          injured         or dead.            I shouted

injured and              carried him to the                 central          a r e a at this        time       I saw no

medi c a l        staff.          1 therefore          instructed             one       of the     suppo r t e r s     to

remain w ith the male                    to    comfort       him.



I left        the    g y m n as i u m    intending          to    return          to the      pitch at 3 . 4 0 pm           ( 1540)

this        date.         On     leaving       I saw numerous                people        queue i n g    carrying          dead

and     injured          people      on hoarding.                 1      then saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y four             yards

directly           in front        of this       door       the       body    of a young man              lying      on a

s heet       of    boarding.             At    this    dista n c e         he a p p e a r e d dead.             I went       to

him an d saw that                 he had an a i r w a y           inserted,             I checked his           pulse       looked

into        his eyes and           looked for any signs                      of    life.         There were          none.          1

therefore           ga i n e d    the a s s i s t a n c e    of       three L i v e r p o o l      s u p p o r t e r s and

carried           body    into     the     gymnasium.                 On e n t e r i n g    I was a s k e d      the

q u e s t i o n alive          or dead.          I shou t e d          dead and was            d i r e c t e d straight

ahead, where             I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y     thirty          other       bodies.          On    placing       the

body        onto    the     floor       I was a p p r o a c h e d        by a man who            i d e n t i f i e d himself

as a D e t e c t i v e         Superintendent           w e a r i n g a black              coat.         He    i nstructed

me     to    remain with           that       body and       that        I was      respon s i b l e      for

i d e n t i f i c a t i o n and      property.              I again          checked the body for                 signs       of

life a nd fo u nd none .



After        a short        time we were           ha n d e d a piece              of    paper and        i n structed        to

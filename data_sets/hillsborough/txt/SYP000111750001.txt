                   •11.15am (1115)                 that    date,     I took       up my position to direct                  the

                  w i t h i n this          industrial          estate.

                   The    football           fans       that    I saw were         c o nducting    themselves           in a good

                   n a t u r e d and        l i g h t h e a r t e d manner.        The m a j o r i t y had parked up and

the ground but the                 numbers were           not so great as to          cause any     problems.

The     next stage          of our duties was              to a t t e n d C l a y w h e e l s Lan e Traffic

Office       for a cooked meal                an d fol l o w i n g this,    we were to be on standby

o utside the gr o u n d on the Pettis-tone R o a d end.

At about 3 . 0 3 p m          <1305)       that date,       I was stood wit h the             rest of my

serial at the              corner of P e n i s t o n e R o a d an d Herries R oad outs ide the

C h a r l i e B r o w n shop.         We were a p p r o a c h e d    by a S u p e r i n tendent,    who had

just     emerged from the              football          ground,    he   i mmediately o r d e r e d us into

the g r o u n d .

At this        time    I had no            idea what was       happening,       I ente r e d the    ground

w i t h the        rest of my serial              t o g ether w i t h PS Taylor and           Inspector

N e w e y who were          both in posse s s i o n of           police     radios.      As    I approached

the     playing are a from the entrance                       b e t w e e n the N o r t h stand an d the

S p i o n Hop,       I saw the        players        leaving the         pitch and a large        crowd of

s p e c t a t o r s on the         pitch a r o u n d the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the           ground.

My     immediate       r e a ction was         that there had been a pitch                invasion by the

L iv e r p o o l   fans.       I then ran across              the   pitch to offer my assistance,

there wer e some              pollce officers             present    but not many.

As "l                        the L e p pings Lane t e r races             it became obvious         to me

ran towards           the f e n c e d a r e a near         to Gate 4.       The gate was open and

several        o f f icers wer e           pulling   people      from the gates w ith great

difficulty,           due to the fact that                 people were we d g e d together across

the small          exit gate.              I realised that the sit u a t i o n was             very serious

a nd    I could not get              into the gate w a y to help.               I looked towards          the

fence and           I saw that        people were          crushed against         the   perimeter

fence.         I was       f aced w i t h a s i t u a t i o n w here      I could not get to anyone

               ‘ trying to look at the sit u a t i o n behind the fences.                           I saw that the

                crush was          present a long the             length of the terrace and some               15 to 20

                deep    in people.              Pe o p l e were    pushed up against        #alch other and gasping

                for breath.           It seemed to stre t c h for about                 10 feet back along the

                terrace a n d then              I saw a gap of about 3 feet and from that                      point

                   though      it was       crowded       people were       standing      in an Upri g h t     position

    yr^-^A^and         looking towards              the pitch.

                repea t e d l y to the           people at the        back to      "Move back,      walk     out of the

                response       I got from the             people at the          back was obscene        language,       "V*

                signs and spitting                 towards myself and the officers near                     to me.

                Whi l s t    on the w o od e n        ledge youths were           r e peatedly    climbing     onto the

                heads of the          people        being    crushed and         I a s s i s t e d them over the

                perimeter          fence and onto           the ground,      several      of these     persons        fell

                onto    the    playing are a and a p p e a r i n g          to    collapse they sought assistance.

                I don't think             the    people at the back          r e a lised the s e r i o u s n e s s    of the

                incident at the front.                    I was in a h e l p l e s s s i t u a t i o n so    I then

                s t a r t e d to    speak       to the    people     crushed into the fence.                I saw m any of

                them still          conscious wit h their heads                  pushed to one      side and their

                ears    crushed a g a i n s t        the fence.        I e n c o u r a g e d them to keep their eyes

                open and to try and move                    their    limbs and as the         crush became           easier

                to move b a c k w a r d s        if they     could or just to stand still.

                Du r i n g the      incident        the wo o d e n h o a rding     broke and m y s e l f    and other

                officers       fell       to the ground.            I was   still     able to     climb up onto the

                fence       by using       the     supports       of the number 4 gate.            I was a w a r e that

                several       bodies       had been placed onto the                playing area.         I could not

believe at first             that many were          dead,     my initial      thoughts were           that

m a n y had been        pulled t h r o u g h the gates and over the fence were alive

and w e l 1.

The    crowd at the          back did ease at one             stage and     1 noti c e d 2

po l i c e w o m e n a p p e a r i n g from the tunnel       at the back.         I shou t e d to them

to e n courage        people     to leave the t e r r a c i n g an d for them to make                  their

w a y to the back         of the      crushed fans and to pull              them b a c kwards and to

safety.        A fter    great     diffi c u l t y   I n o t i c e d that the two      police w o m e n

had m o v e d t h r o u g h the     crowd and were           now into the      crushed area.              They

a p p e a r e d to be    receiving       the same       response    from several          of the fans.

It a p p e a r e d   to me    that the fans did not want to move                    in case they

lost    their v iew of the            proceedings        or the p o s s i b i l i t y of the m atch

being     played.        I also      noticed one P o l i c e S e r geant mo v i n g        thro u g h the

crowd and down to the                front,      he a p p e a r e d to be caught     up    in the      crush

at one stage and from                my position at the top of the fence                    I directed

him to pull          back and try and           pull    others back w i t h him.          Anot h e r

incident       I remember was whe n             I saw Po l i c e Con s t a b l e A l a n Davies,          a

m e m b e r of C D i v i s i o n moving        down t h r o u g h the   crowd a s s i s t i n g    fans       in

carrying a man.              The man a p p e a r e d    to be u n c o n scious about 43 years of

age a n d of good build.               The y    c o u l d n ’t get thro u g h and     I was       trying       to

tell PC D a v i e s      to go back up t h r o u g h the fans and out the back way.

I could see quite well                that they        could go back,       but PC Davies

o b v io u s l y did not      have the same          view as    I did and t ried to bring                 the

m a n thro u g h the      crush and pass him t h r o u g h the Gate number 4.

W h e n the a rea near to Gate 4 had partly been                        cleared,      I saw Police

officers and fans pull i n g at the fence a r o u n d the terrace.                                I thought

t h a t ’s a good       idea a n d w h e n     it had been pulled a way           people were

pulled through,           however,       the people at the front had great                    difficulty

in climbing          up t h r o u g h the fence from the drop behind the wall.

been in and          I could not believe' that such a small a r e a had been able

to hold so m a n y persons.

W h i l s t at G a t e 4 I cannot             recall     seeing any        person who was dead being

carried from that area,                     except    for the man PC Da v i e s had been with

who a p p e a r e d u n c o n s c i o u s    to me.

I m o v e d back      onto the         pitch a n d t ried to assist any                persons who had

obviously        been     in the       crush.        M any   people were being            r e s u s c i t a t e d by

P olice     o f f icers and amb u l a n c e          crews and also fans.             M a n y fans were

s houting and s w e aring              on the    pitch blaming            the Police        for the       crush

but    I just      couldn't        comment      because       from entering         the     pitch are a to

leaving       it I did not          receive any          i n f o r m a t i o n via radio     or w ord of

m o u t h as to the         cause of the         crush.

I must      have     spent     some     15 to 20 minu t e s walk i n g a r o u n d the              crowd

p reventing        fans     from fighting amon g s t              themselves,       firing       insults

t owards other          officers,           myself and       persons      in general        who were

present on the            pitch.

I saw many fans and officers                      carrying         bodies away on a d v e r t i s e m e n t

boards and         leaving       the    pitch via the exit to the gym.                       I only saw one

ambulance        o r i g i n a l l y on the     pitch and then after 20 minu t e s another

came.       I was a m a z e d that 20 or 30 had not been d i r e c t e d onto                           the

playing area.             I kept thinking where are all                      the a mbulances,           has

anyone a s k e d for more.

M a n y fans on the          pitch were a s k e d to              leave and get out of the way.                        I

was met w i t h the          reply "I'm looking               for my brother"          or    "mate".

S everal     were     o b v i o u s l y d i s t r e s s e d and   I spent time       speaking         to them

to try to help and all                  the    persons       I spoke      to on the       pitch a p p e a r e d

to have been drinking,                  to some degree.              I found     it i m possible         to

reason w i t h m a n y       of the fans and             I am sure that they did not know the

full    extent      of the tragedy.              I c e rtainly didn't knaw so man y                     people

had died.          In fact       I made a remark             just after 4 o'clock              <1600)      to one

                                                                                                                   R1Q4

              of my colleagues,            PC Humphries,             to the effect that         I thought there

              had been about 8 fatalities.                      He    replied    "More   like 50".         I was

              numbed by this an d           realised       in my own m i n d that         I should have done

              more     to heI p.

              I later joined a number               of officers who had formed a line across                         the

              pitch.      I was     then d i r e c t e d to assist            in crowd contrfll outs i d e         the

              gr o u n d and assist        re the N o t t i n g h a m Forest         supporters,     who    left the

              ground with o u t an y        incident.

              I was joined by the other members                        of the serial      and    I a g a i n a s s isted

              in the R a w s o n S p ri n g Roa d area.               After    the   crowds had cleared        I went

              to C l a y w h e e l s Lan e and tra v e l l e d back to CS Sub D i v i s i o n for debrief.

              I went off duty at 8 . 0 0 p m             (2000).

              I have a t t e n d e d two      other      semi    finals at Hillsborough.              The    last one

              in 1988 whe n        I was    on duty before             the m a t c h at the L e p p i n g s Lane     end

              turnstiles.          A l t h o u g h the   crowd were        generally     rowdy and      in high

              spirits     there was        no serious       crowd disorder            or any    crushing     near    the

              gates.

            David Charles HUBBARD DC 877,
                          \ .             *

            Rawmarsh Polio^ Station.
            C Division;
With reference to the enquiry headed by Chief Superintendent WAII> I ®an answer

his questions as follows;
1. I reported for duty at Rawmarsh Police Station at 8*00affi on Saturday 1,t.h
   April 19S9, at thio time, I was in full police uni far©. I was to be conveyed
   directly to Hillsborough Football Ground by force coadt* tc be briefed for

   the days duties.
2 . I was part of serial 56 under the leadership of PS 21*0 TAYLOR from w * Me were
   under the direct responsibility of Inspector N&iSY*
J. Following the briefing in the North Stand at the football ground, I was deployed
   with the rest of my serial to Rswson Spring Road, an industrial estate wear
   to the bottom of Herries Road. At 11.15a® that date, I took up ffij position
   to direct the Nottingham Forest contingent, to suitable parking places allocated

   within this industrial estate.
   The football fans that I saw were conducting themselves in a good natures and
   lighthearted manner. The majority had parked up and entered the ground at an
   early stage. On the approach of 3.00pm, the roads around Penistone Road, Herries
   Road and Rawson Spring Road, were almost deserted. There were the odd late
    commer to the grounfi, but the numbers were not so great as to cause any problems.
    The next stage of our duties was to attend Claywheels Lane Traffic Office for
    a cooked meal' and following this, we were to be on standby outside the ground

    on the Penistone Road end.
    At about 3.05pm that date, I was stood with the rest of my serial at the corner
    of Penistone Road and Herries Road outside the Charlie Browns shop. We were
    approached by a Superintendent, who had just emerged from the football ground,
    he immediately ordered us into the ground.
    At this time I had no idea what *as happening, I entered the ground with tne
    rest of my serial together with PS TAYLOR and INSPECTOR NS'/EY who were both in
    possession of police radios. As I approached the playing area from the entrance
    between the North Stand and the Spion Kop, I saw the players leaving the pitch
    and a large crowd of spectators on the pitch around the Leppings Lane end of the
    cround. f'y immediate reaction was that there had been a pitch invasion by the
    Liverpool fans. I then ran across the pitch to offer my assistance, there were

    some police officers present but not many.




                                I
           As I approached the Leppings Lane terraces it became obvious to me that
the situation was not of public order but of public safety. I ran towards the
fenced area near to Gate        The gate was open and several officers were pulling
people from the gates with great difficulty,due to the fact that people were
wedged together across the small exit gate. I realised that the situation was
very serious and I could not get into the gateway to help* I looked towards the
fence and I saw that people were crushed against the perimiter fence. I was faced
with a situation where I could not get to anyone to help. I was at this time with
Police Constable Reeves* Situated to the immediate right of the gate I saw some
wooden holdings. I climbed onto the hoardings with PC Reeves doing the same and
I was trying the look at the situation behind the fences. I saw that the crush
was present along the length of the terrace and some 15 to 20 deep in people.
People were pushed up against each other and gasping for breath. It seemed to
stretch for about 10 feet back along the terrace and then I saw a gap of about
3 feet and from that point although it was crowded people were standing in an
upright position and looking towards the pitch.
           I thought that if I could encairage the people at the back to move further
back    and out of the exit tunnel to their right that the crush of people directly
infront of those people would lessen. I shouted repeatedly to the people at the
back to 'Move back, walk out of the ground, and that people were being crushed
at the front. * The only response I got from the people at the back was obscene
langue,V   Signs    and spitting towards myself and      the officers near to me.
           Whilst on the wooden ledge youths were repeatedly climbing onto the heads
of the people      being crushed and I assisted them over the perimiter fence and
onto the ground, several of these persons fell onto the playing area and appearing
to collapse they sought assistance. I dont think the people at the back realised
the seriousness of the incident at the front. I was in a helpless situation so
I then started to speak to the people crushed into the fence. I saw magty of them
still concious with their heads pushed to one side and their ears crushed against
the fence. I encouraged them to keep their eyes open and to try and move their
limbs and as the crush became easier to move backwards if they could or just to
stand still.
           During the incident the wodden hoarding broke and myself and other officers
fell to the ground. I was still able to climb up onto the fence by using the supports
of the number      gate. I was aware that several bodies had been placed onto the
playing area. I could not beleive at first that many were dead, my initial thoughts
were that many had been pulled through the gates and over the fence were alive and
well.
           The crowd at the back did ease at one stage and I noticed 2 policewomen
appearing from the tunnel at the back. I shouted to than to encourage people to
leave the terracing and for them to make their way to the back of the
crushed fans and to pull the* backwards and to safety. After great
difficulty   I noticed that the two policewomen had moved through the
crowd and were now into the crushed area. They appeared to be receiving
the same response from several of the fans it appeared to me that the
fans did not want to move in case they lost their view of the proceedings
or the possibility of the match being played. I also noticed I Police
Sergeant moving through the crowd and down to the front, he appeared
to be caught up in the crush at one stage and from my position at the
top of the fence I directed him to pull back and try and pull others
back with him. Another incident I remember was when I saw Police Constable
Alan Davies a member of C division moving down through the crowd assisting
fans in carrying a man. The man appeared to be unconcious about *+5 years
of age and of good build. They couldnt get through and I was trying
to tell PC Davies to go back up through the fans and out the back way.
    I could see quite well that they could go back, but PC Davies
obviously did not have the same view as I did and tried to bring the
man through the crush and pass him through the ^ate number *f.
    When the area near to gate k had partly been cleared, I saw Police
Officers and fans pulling at the fence around the terrace. I thought
thats a good idea and when it had been pulled away people were pulled
through, however the people at the front had great difficulty in climbing
up through the fence from the drop behind the wall.
    When all persons had been cleared I looked at the area where I had
been in and I could not beleive that such a small area had been able to
hold so many persons.
     Whilst at gate b I cannot recall seeing any person who was dead
being carried from that area, except for the man PC Davies had been
with who appeared unconcious to me.
     I moved back onto the pitch and tried to assist any persons
who had obviously been in the crush. Many people were being resusitated
by Police Officers and ambulance crews and also fans. Many fans were
shouting and swearing on the pitch blaming the Police for the crush
but I just couldnt comment because from entering the pitch area to
leaving it I did not receive any information via radio or word of mouth
as to the cause of the crush.
     I must have spent some 15 to 20 minutes walking around the crowd
preventing fans from fighting amongst themselves, firing insults
towards other officers, myslef and petsons in general who were present
on the pitch.

       I saw many fans and officers carrying bodies away on advertisement
    boards and leaving the pitch via the exit to the gym, I only saw
    one ambulance originaly on the pitch and then after 20 minutes another
    came* I was amazed that 20 or 30 hadnt been directed onto the playing area,
    I kept thinking where are all the ambulances has anyone asked for more.
        Many fans on the pitch were asked to leave and get out of the way,
    I was met with the reply ’I'm looking for my brother * or ’Mate', several
    were obviously distressed and I spent time speaking to them to try to help
    and -   all the persons I spoke to on the pitch   appeared to have been
    drinking, to some degree. I found it impossible to reason with many of
    the fans and I am sure that they did not know the full extent of the
    tragerdy, I certainly didnt know so many people had died,in fact I
    made a remark just after k o' clock to one of my collegues PC Humphries
    to the effect that I thought there had been about 8 fatalities. He replied
    •More like 50*. I was numbed by this and realised in my own mind that
    I should have done more to help.

        I later joined a number of officers who had formed a line across
    the pitch. I was then directed to assist in crowd control outside the
    ground and assist re the Nottingham Forest supporters, who left the
    ground wihtout any incident.
        I was joined by the other members of the serial and I ag*ia assisted
    in the Rawson Spring Road area. After the crowds had cleared I went
    to Clajrwheels Lane and travelled back to C2 division for de brief.
        I went off duty at 80puu
        I have attended two other semi finals at Hillbbrough. The last one
    in 1988 when I was on duty before the match at the Leppings Lane end
    turnstiles. Although the crowd were generaly rowdy and in high spirits
    there was no serious crowd disorder or any crushing near the gates.

        I submit this report for your information.

            w a y.     We w e r e          encouraged             to a s k        fans     who    were     standing         around          to m a k e

            their      way        into      the       ground,           I also asked           to    look at        their       tickets

            firstly          to m a k e      sure           they had          one a n d    secondly          to    establish          that,      they

were     in the          correct             area.         .                  ,

Directly           in f r o n t         of       th e    turnstiles               I saw       several           Police         Officers

stopping           fans          and    searching               them.         Items          removed         from        them       could       be

collected after                    the m a t c h .              It    seemed         to me         t ha t    th e       organisation                at

Leppings           Lane       was       working            well,           I d i d n ’t see a n y o n e                 being       arrested,

and apart           from          the     occasional                 group        of 2 0      to 30 y o u t h s           singing          and

shouting           at    various             times         as    they appro a c h e d                the     ground        the       f a ns

behaviour           was          very     good.

I noticed           the          odd    group           of 3 to        10     people          walking           around         obviously

without          tickets,              they       appeared            to     be     looking          for     friends           who    ha d

arranged           to m e e t          them       outside            the     ground          to    receive          their       tickets             or

wanted       to     buy a ticket                    on the           day.         Immediately               before        the       kick       off       I

was     s t i 11    outside             the       ground         and       n ea r    to      the     turnstiles,               there       was       no

overcrowding                 at    this          time,         and    only a few              latecomers                making       their          way

i nto    the       ground.

Shortly          after           the    kick        off        X went        into       the       gr o un d ,     I s aw       no

overcrowding                 in the          open area               behind         the      stand       and      no a p p a r e n t

Stewards.

During       the m a t c h             I took           my m e al      with         the      other       members          of    our       se r i a l

                SUBJECT:      Duty at Semi Final Hillsbrough 1988 .



                   Sir,
                          I have to report that I attended the Hillsbrough Semi final in 1988
                and was a member of D.S. Tissington's serial. Our duties before the match
                included crowd control at Leppings Lane end of the ground. I commenced my
                duties shortly before 12 noon on the day of the match, I was responsible with
                other officers for crowd control on the bridge near to Leppings Lane. At
                this location coaches were allowed to pull up and allow fans off to go to the groune
                and also normal public service vehicles which had travelled from Sheffield with
                Liverpool fans were allowed to stop at this location. The vehicles did not
                cause great problems and the flow of traffic along Leppings Lane was only
                slightly impeded.
                          The fans on this day were in a good   mood, several high spirited and
                many had been drinking. Any fan who turned up at our location carrying beer
                cans or Cider bottles were told to put them down and get into the ground. Only
                      a handful wanted to argue the point about standing around drinking but
                these persons were dealt with in a firm way. We were encouraged to ask fans who
                were standing around to make their way into the ground, I also asked to look
                at their tickets firstly to make sure they had one and secondly to establish
                that t|*ey were in the correct area.
                          Directly infront of the turnstiles I ^saw several Police Officers
                stopping fans and searching them. Items removed from them could be collected
                after the match. It seemed to me that the organisation at Leppings Lane
                was working well. I didnt see anyone being arrested, and apart from the
                occasional group of 20 to 30 youths singing and shouting at various times as
                they appraoached the ground the fans behavious was very good.
                          I noticed the odd group of 5 to 10 people walking around abwiuosly
                without tickets, they appeared to be looking for friends who had arranged
                to meet them outside the ground to receive their tickets or wanted to buy a
                ticket on the day. Immediately before the kick off I was still outside the
                ground and near to the Turnstiles, there was no overcrowding at this time,
                and only a few late commers making their way into the ground.
                          Shortly after the kick off I went into the ground, I saw no overcrowding
                in the open area behind the stand and no apparent problems.No tunnels or gates
                had been blocked off by Police or Stewards.
Gen/2
                          During the match I took my meal with the other members of out serial
                and at the end of the match I assisted in crowd control. I saw no incidents
                                                                            <? !0 M ^
                               2



           After the match of a disorderly nature. The only incident I recall after
the match was the fact that someone had been stabbed ina nearby Park after the
game. The only real danger of fighting after the match was confined around
the gymnasium area where rival fans had gathered to collect items taken from
them before the game, however incidents were minor.
           I did not arrest or assist in the arrest of any person at the match in
1988   .
           I submit this report for your information.

the    kick     off       -    that          I was          looking           down          at       the       crowd        from          a       position

push    forward           down          the       terracing              -    pushing                the       people           that          were          already

standing        there          forward.                  The      scene           reminded                me    of        the    type             of    pictures

that    are     seen          on       television                   -        in       the       nature          programmes                    -    when            *

This    wedge        of       people             seemed        to       go    forward                down       the        terracing,                   but

unlike       the     swaying                motions          that        had          taken          place           earlier          on          did       not

                     Hillsborough,                  Sheffield.

                     I drove         to       the    ground       in a      company        motor       vehicle       arriving          at       about

                      I actually              entered       the    ground       at    about          1330    hours,      via     the    Penistone

Rd    photographers             entrance*              J     went      to     the       Press      Photographers"                      room

situated          in    the    North        Stand      and        exchanged             my    ticket        as       per    the        usual

procedure          for    a yellow             press        photographers                bib*

At    1340    hours,          I took        up my      viewing           position             by    t he    wall       in      the      frtiftv-

of    the    South       Stand       in     line      wiTft t h e        penalty area                of       the     West      Stand.

Up    until       about       1440     hours,         I spent           my    time       talking           to    other         press          ...

photographers*                 I then          left    my        position and                walked        to    the       mouth        of

the    players'          tunnel        intending             to    take       a    picture          of     Brian       CLOUGH.

Whilst       at    the    mouth        of      the    tunnel           I became          engaged           in    conversation

with    Glenn          KIRTON,       I think          he     is    the       Assistant             Secretary           of      the      F.A.

I would       consider          Mr    KIRTON          as     a    friend/colleague*                        After       a     few

minutes       of       conversation             with        Mr    KIRTON,          a    ground         official            carrying             a

walkie       talkie       came       up-to       us*         I do       not       k n o w this       man's           name      but      he

was    smartly          dressed        in      dark    coloured              blazer,          collar          and     t ie .

This    ground          official          in m y      presence           and       hearing          said        to    Mr     KIRTON,

"I    think       we    still    have          between           fifteen          and    twenty          thousand            people

outside       the       ground",          at    which        point       Mr       KIRTON       replied,              "Well        do    you

want    to    delay       the    kick          off."                                          ^
The    Official          said,       "I     don't      think           it w i l l       be    necessary*"

We    all    then       went    our       separate           ways.           I tried          to    find        Brian        CLOUGH           bu

never       saw    him    once*

At    1501    hrs ,      I walked           back      to     behind          the       goal    West        Stand        end       near        to

emergency          gate       number        three      to        set    up a       remote          controlled              camera*

I heard       screaming          from          behind        me    on     the      terraces.               I turned            round          an

saw    people          crushed       up     a ga i n s t ' t h e       perimeter             fence       of     Pen     three*            I s

that    one_ g i r l ' s       face       had    gone        blue,        obviously             th e     pressure            on     these

people       at    this       stage       was    massive*               I realised              something             awful         was

happening,             people    were          starting           to    climb          over     t he     fence.            I finished

the    film       I had       in m y      cameras*               There       was       nothing          I could         do     to      help

                  serious.           I was       shocked             and    felt       completely             helpless.

                  The    Police          did    not       seem       to    appreciate              what      was    happening.               I think
                                                                                                                                                             -% _
                  they    initially             they       thought          it    was       a    pitch       invasion           or    trouble

                  starting*                                                                                                 y
                                                                            " *                                      *T.


                  I then       retrieved             my    remote          colVtrol l e d          camera      from         behind       the      goal.

                  I was       standing          in    the       goal       six    yard          box    when    a    Police           Officer       wearinc

                  a    flat    cap       came    onto          the    pitch.           I grabbed             hold    of      him      and    pushed          hin

                  across       the       penalty          area       towards       the          referee       who    was        standing          in    the

                  corner       of    the       penalty          area       towards          t he      North    Stand,           saying       to    him,

                  "Fuckin'          stop       the    game."

                  I must       have       screamed             these       words       at       him    at    least         three      times.           The

                  Police       Officer          then       went       up    to    the       referee          who    I think           was    in a n y

                  event       about       to    stop       the       game.

                  I then       walked          back       to    my    original          viewing             position         in a      deep       state       o-i

                  Leppings          Ln    end.        I knew          because          of       what    I had       seen        and    felt       I had       t<

                  of    your    brain          takes       over       and     I took            one    more    picture            from      the    North

          MR. COLLINS:     One thing I forgot to ask.   May I jusc
     quickly do so?
                 Further Re-Examined bv MR. COLLINS:

Q.   Can I ask you to look at this photograph,* which is composite 2
     1/7A. - A. I have it here.

Q. I am asked to ask you this. Do you see the Inspector at the
   bottom in the middle, or rather, not an Inspector necessarily
   but a Police Officer with a flat cap? - A. Yes.

Q. I don't think it is you, but perhaps you can help me.       Is it?
   - A. I don’t think that is me, sir, no.

Q. No. I think it is Mr. Greenwood, is not it? - A. It could well
   be, yes.
          MR. COLLINS:   Mr. Kallipetis shakes his head, but
     actually it is Mr. Greenwood, because it is quite clear from
     1/lOA.
          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I think it was put to him he was
     on one of those.
          MR. COLLINS:     He was in 1/lOA. I think, sir:

0. In fact, it looks as if whoever iz is has a loud hailer or
   something? - A. Yes, sir. At some stage I know someone had a
   loud hailer. I can’t recall.

0. Anyway, it is not you.      It does not matter whether it is Mr.
   Greenwood or not.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you very much.

                     INSPECTOR DAVID BULLAS Called

                         Examined bv MR. PHILLIPS:

0. You ate Inspector David Bullas? - A. Yes.

Q. And on 15th April you were the Inspector in charge of Serial
   13? Is that so? - A. That is correct.

Q. Serial 13 is the one which is in the West Stand over the
   Leppings Lane terraces? - A. Yes.

O. Do you have there the first volume of the South Yorkshire
   Police documents, at Tab 14, the entry in relation to Serial
   13 in sub-sector 6, perhaps a third of the way through the
   documents in the tab? - A. Yes. sir.

Q. It is right, is not it, that that was the only serial with
   which you were concerned? - A. That is correct.

 0. Your superior would be Superintendent Greenwood? - A. Yes,
                          94




   sir.
Q. The information that we have here, did you have a copy of
   that? - A . I did. sir, yes.

G. Did you give a copy of this to any members .of your serial? -
   A. When I briefed the serial I made reference to this copy,
   and I know the Sergeant of my serial also had a copy of this
   document.
0. You have two of your Officers at each of the entrances to the
   West Stand. Would they be at floor level or up in the stand
   itself? - A. All the serial was in the stand, sir.

0. So they would be at the top of the entrance stairs to that
   stand? - A. No. the two Officers you are referring to at the
   emergency exits, they would be at the bottom of the stand
   itself, the lower portion of the stand, in each corner.

0. The concourse and bar area, that is inside the stand itself,
   is it? - A. Yes, at the back of the stand, sir.

0. Then there are 6 Officers at the front of the stand? - A. Yes.

0. They seemed to have the job of preventing missiles being
   thrown or stand tickets being dropped? - A. That is correct.

0. And to prevent people from climbing up? - A. Yes.

Q. There is no mention in that set of instructions to keep a
   particular eye on the size of the crowd in the terrace below,
   is there? - A. There is no particular instruction, but it is
   common sense that one does look down, looking down az the
   crowd all the time if you are stood at the front, and
   obviously you will be monitoring the people in the stand .with
   regard to exits and emergency exits, etc. But the Officers
   are the front are obviously constantly looking down because
   one of the problems in that stand is that people do tend to
   climb from the terracing into the stand.

Q. Were you yourself briefed by a more senior Officer? - A. i~
   was, sir, yes.              -
0. By whom? - A. I was at the briefing on the Friday and also the
   briefing on the match day. Superintendent Greenwood i think
   it was.
 Q. Did you receive specific instructions to monitor the crowd in
    the terraces below the West Stand and to pass information on
    to control so it could be transmitted to Officers in the area
    behind the stand? - A. No, I did not actually receive specific-
    instructions to monitor the crowd in the terracing. Our
    duties specifically were to deal with the people inside the
    stand, but obviously part of your duties, because you are
    looking down constantly, is to monitor the crowd both in the
    stand and on the terraces.
                          /Q. Yes. What I am interested in....

                                      D.   BULLAS


Q. Yes, what I am interested in is what instruction you received
 / in the briefing that you had either from a more Senior
   Officer or from Superintendent Greenwood in relation to the
   terrace below. Did you receive any specific instruction
   in relation to that terrace? - A. I didn't sir, no.

Q. Did you give any particular instruction to* the Officers in
   your"Serial in relation to the crowds in the terrace below
   the Viest Stand? - A. No I gave the general briefing in
   relation to this document and part of our cuty is to monitor
   the crowd in the vicinity in which we work. I didn't
   specifically direct their attention to the people in the
   terracing or anything like that, no, but it is understood
   that we do monitor all the crowd.            —

Q. Yes, of course. Your prime concern of course was what was
   going on in the West Stand itself, wasn't it? - A. V,Tell
   it was my prime concern what was happening in the ground.
   Obviously our duties concern the WestStand in particular,
   yes, because we were located there.

Q. You say you did not see fit then to say to your Officers:
   "y?ell if you see the terraces getting a bit full make sure
   that you tell me or that you tell Ground Control*'? - A. No,
   I did"not say that. I should imagine the Officer would use
   his initiative. I would use my own initiative if I saw
   any problems and draw it to someone's attention.

Q. You see the reasons I ask you these questions is that
   Chief Superintendent Duckenfield gave evidence that your
   Serial had the duty of looking out over the terrace from
   the Stand and that you were under instructions to look out;
   these instructions would have been given to you by Super­
   intendent Greenwood. That was the evidence that we had
   from Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. From what you say
   you did not get those instructions at all? - A. Vie got the
   instructions to monitor the crowd underneath but not with
   regard to the climbing of people into the Stand if that
   is-what you mean by instructions regarding the people on
   the terracing.
q   . You say you got the instructions to monitor the crowd under­
       neath. What was actually said to you about that? - A. Kell
       as it says on the document that obviously people do climb
       uo from the terracing; missiles are thrown and there are
     . one or two problems caused by people in the terracing and
       also people in the Stand dropping missiles down on to the
       top of them.
 Q. That is part of it certainly. You had your written instruction
    about that? - A. That is right.

 Q. And they were not amplified in any oral instructions? - A.
    I think they might have been, yes, but the general
    instruction that we monitor the crowd beneath us for that
    purpose.

0 . you of course did end up on the West Stand close to the
   front of it, didn't you? - A. I did sir, yes.

Q. You were able then to see over the front wall into the
   terrace belov;? - A. Yes.

Q. What time would you say that you tool; up tlvat sort of
   position? - A. I was obviously in the Stand itself from
   being deployed, from about quarter-to-11 we were in the
   Stand. I remember going to near the front, it would
   be about half-past-2.

Q. Did you stay in that sort of position where you could”see
   the terraces below fro*?, about that tine onwards? - A. I
   was in that vicinity the majority of the time. I was r.ct
   constantly stood in one position all the time looking
   if that is what you naan, no.

Q. But you did look down from time to tine when you vere there
   at-the front? - A. I did.

Q. It is right, is it, that if you go a little way bach fre.a
   the front wall of the 'west Stand you can't really sec meek
   of the terrace at all? - A. Probably so, yes.

Q. You have really got to bo at the front looking over the
   wall? - A. Yes.

Q. And even then there is an overhang, is there not, of the
   West Stand so that you can't see the back vail of the terrace
   can you? - A. Yes, I think you can wore or less sac the
   back wall,by leaning over.

Q. You-have got to lean over to   do that? - A. That    isright.

Q. Did you in fact do that? - A. Yes, several times.

Q. Did you at any stage notify either Control or the Serials
   that were in the concourse behind the Stand of any crcccinc
   in Pens 3 and 4? - A. Ko, I didn't, the reason being that
   there was nothing unusual in that crowd beneath    me
   to cause me to do that. There was nothing that drev; i n ­
   attention to any overcrowding at that time.

Q. V?ere you aware of the fact that Serials 14 and 15 had the
   duty of maintaining order on the terraces? - A. Yes.

Q. They of course were not under your command, they were under
   the command of Inspector White. Is that right? - A. That
   is correct, yes.

Q. And they would have to receive information from Control
   in order to go on to the terraces from where they were?
   - A. I don't know exactly where they are positioned but
   presumably so, yes.
       V


                                                                   D . BULLAS
                     A
                             0. You certainly never sent any messages or passed any messages
                                on to Serials 14 or 15 did you? - A. X didn't, the reason
                                being there was not any need to in my opinion to pass any
                                messages.
                             Q. Now what would you say then the situation was like when you
                     B          looked over the front wall of the West Stand at let's take
                                2.30 as the first time or thereabouts when you cic look?
                                - A. There was no problems. The crowd ' seemed to be in a
                                good type of humour. I remember there was a large beach
                                ball or something being knocked about. There was a large
                                inflatable type of thing just more or less below from where
                                I was standing. There were no problems. There was no
                                overcrowding by any means.
                         C
                             Q. Did you lean over and look to the back of the terrace? - A.
                                A couple of times I shouted down to some youths, they vere
                                standing on each other's shoulders. They were kir.cl cf
                                chant leading, acting the goat. I told them to get dev;::,
                                this type of thing.
                             Q. At that time at 2.30 how would you describe the fulir.sss
                     D          of Pens 3 and 4? - A. 3 and 4 were not full by any "ear.s.
                                They were no where near being full.

                             Q. Could you say how many more people they would take or would
                                that be impossible? - A. I think that would be impossible
                                sir.
                             Q. All right. When was the ne::t time you looked cov;n, he.;
                         E      long afterwards? - A. I don't know. I was looking about
                                me, looking down constantly.

                             Q. As you were looking down during the next, shckll we take the
                                next quarter-of-an-hour, did you see the pens filling
                                - A. Yes, the central pens were getting wore people in
                                than t’.e two outside pens. There were people coming through
                         F      the central tunnel walking beneath from my right ar.d they
                                were crossing from the two central pens into the Pen 5 I
                                think it is.
                             Q. Could you see the people walking along the back wall through
                                the gates? - A. Yes, definitely.
\
                             Q. Again you would have to lean over to do that? - A. Kb,
                         G      not necessarily. As you look down you can see people
                                moving across from my right to my left and they were just
                                moving across the terrace without any problem.

                             q   . vihat was the situation in your assessment at a quarter-to-3
                                   then? - A. At quarter-to-3 there was no problem.

                              Q. Still room for more people in Pens 3 and 4? - A. Yes.
                     H
                              Q. Did there ever come a time before 3 o'clock when you thought
                                 really there is not much room for more people in Pens 3 and 4

                               - A. No, it never crossed my mind sir.   It never occurred.
                               If I had seen that situation I would have done something
                               about it but there was no danger; there was no one looking
                               up to me crying out for assistance, it was just a normal
                               type of football crowd, no problems.
                       B   Q. You had a good aerial view of v;hat was going on in the
                              pens below you, didn't you? - A. That is right.

                           Q. You could see hox* tightly packed the people were? - A. roll
                              I am telling you they v/ere not tightlypacked at that time.

                           CT. At quarter-to-3? - A. Yes, it was gust   a normal type.* of
                               build-up.
                   C
                           Q. i/ere you able to see what the crov/ds were like in the vine
                              pens in numbers 1 and 6? - A. Yes.

                           Q. How did you see those crowds there? - A.    Kell they were
                              filling up as well. Obviously they were     not as full as the
                              two central ones but they were filling.      I could see people
                              walking away from   me going into the far   wing pen as     well
                   D          obviously as they   come down the tunnel.

                           Q. v/ere you concerned with the relative absence cf people in
                              Pens 1 and 6? - A.     !:ct at all. I was not concerned -.;ith
                              the build-up in 3    and 4 either, I was not concerned at ell
                              at that stage.

                   E       Q. Did you not think: "Isn't it time that these pens became
                              a bit more full"? - A. I did not have cause to think that
                              sir, no. There was no problem at that time.

                           Q. You appreciated, didn't you, that this natch had been a
                              sell-out? - A. Yes.
                           Q. So all of the standing areas would be expected to be full?
                   F          - A.. Yes.
                           0. Could you say that the condition of the wing pens was such
                              Ehat you expected them to fill up to capacity? - A. As
                              I say the wing pens v/ere filling up. There was nothing
                              untoward that I could see. There v/as no problem in the
                              central two pens and the wing pens v/ere filling as far
                              as I could see.

                           q   . what was the first thing that you saw then that gave you
                                 any cause for concern? - A. The first thing that I noticed
                                 the teams, both Liverpool and Nottingham Forest were out
                                 on the ground. They were kicking-in at the time. I don't
                                 think the match had started. There v/as a bit cf trouble
                                 in the Stand about three rows from where I was standing. .
                                 There was some dispute about who was sat in what seats. I
                   H             stepped briefly back to deal with this. I sorted that out
                                 to a degree. The two seats in particular were occupied by
                                 two people already and there v/ere.two more peep la trying

                                 to get in. They were arguing whose seat it v/as. I stepped

                            back and I spoke to these people and then I stepped back to
                            the front to the railing, if you like to call it. I remember
                            looking down at the crowd ....

                         Q. Before you go any further can you tell us where along the
                     B      length of the West Stand you were in relation for example
                            to the tunnel? - A. Yes, if you look at the tunnel frees, the
                            pitch slightly to the right.

                         Q. So you would be in front of Pen 4? - A. Yes.

                         Q. Is thcrt right? - A. Yes.
                     C   Q. Yes, very well. I an sorry, please, tell us what you caw?
                            - A. As I stepped back I glanced down to the crowd. My mind
                            v;as still on the. person or the two people that had been
                            having a few problems. To put it mildly one of them ;;as
                            drunk. I v/as still glancing back at him. I got back to
                            the railing. I glanced down and then I noticed an unusual
                            movement in the crowd.
                     D   Q. Can you give us any idea what time this was? - A. I can't
                            honestly say. I don't know if the teams had kicked off
                            or they v/ere still kicking out, I can't say. It would be
                            somewhere around 3 o'clock.

                         Q. Either just before or just after kick-off? - A. I can’t
                            honestly r^-ammber.
                     E   Q. Yes, what v/as this unusual thing you sa-.-; in the crowd? -
                            A. I think I saw from the direction of the tunnel a kind cf
                            movement down the terracing. I think I described it in my
                            statement the type of thing that you see on the nature
                            programmes, the molten lead flowing down the side of the
                            mountainside, the molten lava.

                     F   O. You iuentioned a "river of people"?- A. That is right.    Yes,,
                            it stuck in my mind as being that type of motion.

                         Q. Can you tell us please ’whether that river of people, that
                            stream of people v/as going directly down towards' the pitch
                            or whether it was going at some angle from the tunnel? - A.
                            It seemed to be going directly towards the pitch but there
                            again spreading.
                     G
                         Q. Spreading out? - A. Yes.
                         Q. Can you say whether it was in both Pens 3 and 4 or in just
                            one of them? - A. I can't honestly say. I just saw this
                            movement.
                         Q. Well was this movement that you saw to your right or tc your
                     H      left or directly in front of you? - A. It was to my right.

                         Q. To your right? - A. Yes.

Kow far dov;n the pen did it go? - A. I can only estimate.
It was just an unusual movement. The thing that stuck in
my mind, all afternoon I had watched the people beneath-
me swaying forward, the normal type of sway. They go forward;
there is a gap open; then they come back without any problems.
This one the movement was forward but i f did not see:?, to go
back and that is what drew my attention to it, I think.

When it got towards the pitch, as it got down towards the
bottom of the terracing can you say whether it was aimed
at any of the gates in the fencing? - A. I don't know. The
part of the _crowa I saw was in the centre towards the rear.—
I did not really notice towards the front._£encinc. The part
that sticks in ay mind is the centre of the movement ar.d
back towards the tunnel.
What effect did you see this have this street of people?
- A. Well obviously the people who wore in this stream, the
people that were there were getting shoved together, getting
pushed together- I must admit I looked at it and my mind
did not quite understand straightaway what had happened.
It was the first time I have ever seen it. I hope it is
the last, but as I say it was an unusual type cf sway.
That is what drew my attention to it. It just went forward
and it did not come back.
Did you see any people going down or disappearing from vie./?
- A. Ko, I did not see anyone go down or disappear. ’ I could
see there were people in distress obviously having been
pushed together.
Did you look when you sav; it at the centre and towards the
rear, did you look forward towards the perimeter fence?
- A. Uo, I do not think I did initially. It sticks in
my mind I sav/ the centre of the movement more than anything.

What d’d you do when you saw this? - A. As I say the time
lapse now, it seems to bo in slow motion, but I remember         i
looking down and thinking that something was wrong. I            I
don't know how long it_y/as until I fully realised what had
happened. I can't say that. I remember thinking to myself
"There is something happened here" so I got the radio and
tried to contact the Police Control Room.

Viere you successful? - A. Ho, I tried three times I think
it v/as. In fact I looked across at the Control Bo:: that
was more or less on a level where I v/as standing. I can't
tell you why I did not get through. I presume because
other Officers v/ere using the radio, I don't know.

 Had you had a radio with you during the whole of the time?
 - A. I had sir.
Had you heard radio messages? - A. I had heard some radio
messages. Obviously when you are in the Stand you are
dealing constantly with such things as I have mentioned,
people arguing what seats they are sitting in, this type
of thing.

                            Q. Had you heard anything about the gates? - A. I renenber
                               hearing something about -the gates but it had no significance
                               to ne at the ti.ne.
                            Q. Can you say how long that v/as before this river of people
                        B      appeared fron the aouth of the tunnel?    A. I can't re::ie:T.bcr
                               sir.
                            Q. You say you could not get through to the Police Control on
                               your radio? - A. That is correct.

                            Q. Did you see_anybody else doing anything about this? - A.
                               Kell just to set the picture I was not stood in isolation,
                               there were obviously the people in the Stand. They were
                               standing at the time. I don't know whether the teams had
                               just kicked off and there was a lot of noise, the build-up
                               to the match. I v/as surrounded by spectators.

                            q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Sorry, standing did you say?
                                    Did you say something about    people standing? - A. Oh yes,
                                    they were all stood. It is     a nonaal thing before the
                        D           kicic-off that the people in    the Stand do stand up ur.ti 1
                                    the kick-cff takes place.

                            Q. So this v/as pre-kick-off you think? - A. Well I don't know.
                               It was the build-up. It v/as somewhere around 3 o'clock I
                               would say.
                            Q. Well do they noraally sit down v/hen kick-off starts? - A.
                               Well after a few minutes, it is not instant. Ycu u s u a l l y
                               get a lot of people shouting: "Sit down", this type cf
                               thing and then eventually they sit down’in ones and tv;os
                               and eventually they all sit down.

Q.   What did he do by way of taking notice?     A. I
     remember him walking towards the fence arid he was stood
     looking into the crowd.   My natural reaction at that
     time was to turn and go down below and see what the
     problem was, which I did.                 .
Q. Did you see any of the perimeter fence gates open?
   A.   Yes, as I got to the exit, I made my way up through
   the Stand, up the steps.     I turned, just as I was going
   to leave.    It was a difficult job, actually getting up
   the steps because the people were still milling about,
   people stil-i coming in.   I got to the exit.    I turned and
   looked back towards the pitch and I remember seeing that
   one of the gates - I cannot remember which one it was -
   one of the gates was open and I also remember seeing
   either one or two bodies on top o f     ■ by "bodies", I
   mean people climbing over the fencing.
Q. Did you at. any stage see a heap of bodies       by any of the
   gates?    A.  I didn't, sir, no.
Q. You went out of the West Stand, I think, then and into the
   tunnel, did you not?  A.   That's right.
Q.    Were you the first Inspector into the tunnel?
     A.    I don't think I was. . There was definitely Officers
     in front of me on the terracing by the time I got there.
Q. Did you recognise anyone in particular?   A.   I didn't,
   no. There were a lot of obviously spectators about.
   There were people still going forward. There were people
   trying to come up the tunnel, get out of the tunnel, so
   there was definitely Police Officers, I think, in front
   of me on to the terracing.
Q.   What did you observe when you went into the tunnel?
     A.   I o b s e r v e d -- The first thing that struck r.e as I
     entered the tunnel was a strong smell of intoxicants.
     That is the first thing that hit me as I went into the
     tunnel.       I was in a confined space. There was s let
     of noise, a lot of confusion, and I remember going slightly
     into the tunnel and at that stage I remember the crowd kind
     of parting and the first injured person was passed back.
Q. Were people still going down the tunnel towards the terrace?
   Ar    There was one youth in particular who was still pushing
   his way forward.    I took hold of him by the clothing and
   dragged him back and told him to get back.    I remember doinc
   that.    But it sticks in my mind there were people coming
   out of the tunnel as well, so there were people going in
   and people coming out.
 Q. Did you see Police Officers getting people out through the
    back, through the tunnel?   A.   The first person that was
    brought out was brought out by -- there was definitely one
    Police Officer there, probably two, carried out.
 Q. I think then a number of people were brought out who were
                                      0.   BULLAS


plainly affected by injuries and so on;      is that right?
A.   That is correct, sir, yes.
How many people did you see brought out that way? Have
you any idea?   A.   I can't really say.'. I think it
was the third or fourth person I attempted to give
assistance to, a youth, obviously I was seeing to him
for quite a long time - it seemed quite a long time -
I can't say.   I would estimate somewhere probably in
the region of 20.
The injured people in the tunnel that you saw are people
who had been brought from the terraces back?   A.   Yes.
As far as I could tell and as far as I am aware there was
no-one injured actually in the tunnel.   They had been
brought from the terraces.
And then you took part, did you, continued to take part in
getting people out of the terrace?    A.   No, this youth
in particular, he was only a young lad about 1 4 - 1
assisted with the mouth-to-mouth, myself and another Officer,
for quite a long time.   Unfortunately an Ambulance Officer
later told us that he was dead.    I can't really assist.
                 Cross-examined by MR. HYTNER:
Hr. Bullas, in all the briefings that you had, did     anybody
tell you that there was a limit on the capacity of     Pens
3 and 4 imposed for safety reasons?   A.   I don't     think
anyone had directly told me, sir, but I had worked     the
ground before and I am aware - the Department that     I am
in, I am aware of the capacity in those pens.
You .were aware that one was 1 ,000 and the other 1,200?
A.    Something like that, yes.
Were you aware that there was no mechanical means of
monitoring when those capacities had been reached?   A.       Yes.
You were?   A.     Yes.                                  _
If a senior Officer had said to you, "Hr. Bullas, the
capacities of those pens are 1,000 and 1,200 respectively;
it is your responsibility by visual monitoring to ensure
that those pens do not contain more than 1,000 or 1,2C0
each", what would your answer have been?   A.    Are you
saying that if I had been given the job to make sure
they did not overfill?
Yes.   A.   Obviously I would do my best t.o.make sure they
did not over-fill.
That is a very polite answer.     Would your answer not have
been something to the effect, though putting it very politely
"How on earth am I, with my eyes, to ensure that     there is
exactly 1,000 and exactly "1,2'0G in each of those pens? It
is an impossible task to give me."     A.   I agree.
                                    D.   BULLAS


That would be the fair answer, would it not?      A.   Yes.
And accurate answer.    Nobody in their right mind could
expect a Police Officer, however experienced, to judge
to within a hundred people or more whether those capacities
had been reached.    A.   If you are asking me if on the
day in question --
No, I am asking you in principle.       I will come to the day
in question.    A.   I c a n ’t really say.   It depends on the
individual, doesn't it? ' If somebody had given me that
task, I would- have endeavoured to carry it out, yes.
But it would have been an impossible task, would it not?
A.   I don't know.   It depends how you went about it.
You see, it may be - I am not suggesting for a moment that
it was your task to do that but it may be suggested that
it was your task.   Just think carefully.   If somebody
else were to suggest that it was your task to ensure that
no more than 1,000 and 1,200 were in each of those pens,
would you have regarded yourseIf as capable of carrying
out that task efficiently?   A.   I am not saying I
would have been capable of looking at the crowd and
distinguishing exactly the number but I would have been
capable of looking at the crowd and distinguishing if it
had been over-filled to have caused danger.
That is a different matter.   You could not possibly tsks
on the task of monitoring the numbers, could you?
A.   Not from the position I was in, no.
What you were in fact doing, whether it was your specific
task, or not, was you were applying your own criteria of
safety and deciding when the pens would become full to
dangerous?    A.   Nc, I was looking at the crowd and I
couldn't see any problems.    That was my criteria to danger.
Yes, that is what I mean.    You were applying your own
criteria as to when a .pen was full or over-full.
A.   I was applying my own criteria if anyone is in danger
of being crushed, receiving injuries or asking for assistance,
and they wasn't.
You see, that is a very interesting answer because has it
occurred to you before or since this tragedy that safety
capacities are imposed to ensure that there never remotely
becomes a situation where people are being crushed, that
there is a safety margin? A.     The time until I saw that
flow of people, there wasn't anyone getting crushed.
I will just press the question once more and then I
will leave it.   Has it occurred to you that a safe capacity
is imposed so that there is a margin between the capacity
and the time when people are in danger of being crushed?
A.    I can only reply to that,   the capacity at the time,

   there was no danger, there was no-one being crushed and
   there was no concern to me until I saw the movement in
   the crowd.   That is the only way I can reply to that.
Q. I have to just put one matter to you in Challenge because
   it is unfair if things are said behind your back that
   have not been put to you in person.    You see, what I have
   to suggest to you is that in the best of faith and doing
   the job as best you could, nevertheless your perception
   of what was crowded was not necessarily the perception of
   those within the crowd and that you made a mistake.
   A.   I did not make— any mistake.   I am an experienced
   Police Officer.   I have worked that match -- that ground
   numerous times.
Q. Can I just read out to you some of the evidence that hss
   been given?   Of course, may I make it clear, it is for
   the Tribunal to decide whether the evidence that has been
   given is accurate or not; do you follow?    A.   I follow,
   yes.
Q. And it may well be that the Tribunal will reject that
   evidence and accept yours but can I just read out SGt ne
   of the evidence so that you can comment on it?      A Mr.
   Hicks at 2.45 said that people were in distress in Pens
   3 and 4.   At 2.50 he said there was such a crush that
   people were being pulled over - that is the radial fences.
   A Hr. Hennessy at 2.50 said that he was concerned and'he
   was being tightly squashed.     At 2.30 - going back z bit -
   a Mr. Perry was already jammed.      2.30-2.45 a Mr. Lowe
   began to worry and the girlfriend of his friend was feeling
   sick with the crush.      2.30 a Hr. Postlethwaite said Pen 3
   was fairly full.   By 2.40 it was uncomfortable and he
   tried to get out.     At2.45-2.50 a Hr. Matthews said the
   crowd was very compact; he could not move back and he was
   being crushed against the barrier.      Now, that is seme
   of the evidence that has been given.      I hope I have fairly
   summarised what has been said by those witnesses.       Frorr.
   your recollection, must they all be wrong?




                                 /A.   From my recollection.
                                       D.   BULLAS



A. From my recollection there was no crushing in that
crowd.   There was no-one taken out prior to the times I
have mentioned, the flow of people.    There was no-one
carried out.   No-one asked for assistance', medical
assistance, and that includes all the pushing and
crushing you have just mentioned.   No-one asked for
assistance and no-one was taken from the crowd with
injuries, as far as I am aware.

Is that your yardstick, Mr. Bullas? - A. Not at all.
You have just highlighted all this crushing and pushing.
I am saying no-one was injured.   No-one asT<ed for
assistance of the Police.   No-one asked my assistance.
As a matter of 15 feet above the crowd there was no-one
asking for my assistance.   That was not the picture I
saw.

Mr. Bullas, you have actually answered a question I nave
not asked you.    I have not suggested to you that anybody
cried out to the Police for assistance or that anyone was
being carried out injured.    I have asked you first of
all, if those witnesses are right, must your perception
have been wrong? - A. I was not wrong.    I have told you
what I saw.    There was no any crushing in the crowd as
far as.I could see.

Secondly, from the last answer you gave, may we take it
that your yardstick of whether a pen is crowded is
whether people have cried out to the Police for help anc
whether people have been carried out injured? - A. No,
that is not my yardstick, sir.  I was just trying to
answer the question you put to me via these people's
statements.   If there was all this crushing and pushing
going on, why wasn't anyone injured prior?

Now the last thing is this:   it is merely to see if we
can refresh your memory as to whether you have the right
recollection as to time.    You say that at the time of
the kick-off, round about three o'clock,“there was this
river of people coming down and people were still
standing in West Stand? - A. Yes.

The evidence so far has been pretty firm thatthis river
of people came down five minutes before kick-off. - A. I
said somewhere around kick-off.   It was somewhere around
three o'clock.   To the exact minute, I do not know.

 What may well be right, indeed, it would be accepted, is
 that when the river of people flowed through pens 3 and
 4, people were indeed standing in West Stand because it
 would have been five minutes before kick-off.   Do you
 follow? - A. I cannot honestly answer the question
 because I do not know exactly what time it was.    It was
                            107



                                           D . BULLAS


   somewhere round three o'clock.    I know there were people
   standing still in the West Stand.

Q. Could you look at compact bundle 2 and look at photograph
   DB 17/14? - A. Yes.                       -

Q. That photograph we know was taken at three o'clock and as
   one would expect at kick-off people are sitting down all
   over, so far as one can see, in the West Stand, do you
   follow? - A. That is right.

Q. So it rather confirms the fact that if people were
   standing when you saw the river come througTi it would
   have been before kick-off, which fits in with everybody
   else's recollection? - A. Probably so, sir.    As I say, I
   could not honestly say.  I know it is somewhere around
   three o'clock.

               Cross-Sxa.nined by MR. GLASGO W:

Q. Mr. Bullas, one matter.   Does your Police experience of
   the ground go back to the 1935 division of the terraces
   with the radial fences? - A. I think it may do, sir, yes.

0. In that case you may be one of the Officers who can help
   us on a matter that has not been covered with others.
   Do you remember when they first went in, the radial
   fences, attempts were made to divide the terrace up into
   either three or four sections, with separate numbers? -
   A. I cannot honestly remember, sir.

Q. Let me press you just a little harder.    Would you go to
   the .West Midlands bundle 2?   Would you go to photograph
   17, or any photograph of the tunnel, but I think 17 is
   convenient.    Do you remember when the big figure "2" w^s
   put up over the tunnel? - A. I do not, sir.   I a;it sorry,
   I cannot help you.

Q. You cannot remember that at all.   I will just put it to
   you again, Inspector, just to see whether there is any
   recollection, that there was a time after the radial
   fences were first introduced that the terrace tickets
   were divided into either three or four numbers, but that
   those who had the responsibility of packing found that
   very inconvenient and asked the club to stop doing it? -
   A. I am sorry, sir, I cannot help you at all.   I cannot
   remember at all.

0. Can you remember the alternative, that when you first did
   become responsible for any work on those terraces,
   everybody was arriving with the same sort of ticket, is
   that your recollection? - A. I am sorry to be vague, but
   I just do n o t . ...
No, I am taking you back a long way, I appreciate that..
Were you ever responsible for the serials which were
physically involved in the packing work, as distinct from
that of monitoring from above? - A. No, sir.

You never did that job yourself? - A. No.

You were aware of the fact that others did it, were you?
- A. Yes.

■When-I say " o t h e r s —, I mean other serials and other
Inspectors. - A. What, the packing of the-terraces?

Yes. - A. I did not know it was the police's duty.   I
thought it was the stewards' duty to pack the terraces.

Did you work on League games as well as semi-finals? - A.
I have worked League games, yes.

However, even on League games your understanding was that
it was the stewards who packed the terraces? - A. Yes.

You are sure about that? - A. As far as I was concerned,
I cannot remember it being the direct or specific duty of
the Police to pack the terraces, if that is what you are
asking?

Yes, I am.   I wondered how clear your briefings had
been.   Are you saying that as far as you are aware the
briefings you received, insofar as they dealt with the
terraces at all, were the same at League games as the
semi-finals? - A. I am sorry, can you repeat that?

Are you saying that insofar as you recollect the
briefings that you have received over the years from the
senior Officers, the briefings relating to the packing of
the terraces, were the same at semi-finals as they were
at League games? - A. As far as I can recall there was
not any difference between the League and the semi-final.

       MR. GLASGOW:      Thank you.

              Cross-Examined by MR. WOOD W A R D :

Mr. Bullas, may I just ask you a little bit about that?
Did you ever regard yourself as having any role or
responsibility for the packing of the fans in the
terraces?  - A. Not the actual packing, sir.  Obviously
the safety etc., that was our responsibility, but the
actual packing, no.

Of course, the Police would keep an eye out for whatever
might happen? - A. Yes.
                                                 D.   BULLAS


G.   And respond accordingly? - A. Yes.
Q. Depending on what it was they   observed? - A. Yes.

G. But so far as the packing, the arranging of where fans went
   and whether they went into a particular terrace or not. that
   was not something which you regarded as part of your
   responsibility or that of the men under you? - A. No, sir.

G. i'ou agree? - A. I agree.
G. Were there stewards on the .West Stand in 1989? - A. There
   were, sir, yes.
G. Whereabouts were the stewards in 1989? Were they at differen*
   parts of the gangways on the West Stand? - A. Yes. they were.
   I had been round each steward in turn and spoken to them.
   There was at least steward on each exit out of the stand. I
   made sure there was always a steward, and I stress this, that
   there was a steward at either end of the frontage of the stan'
   where the emergency exit gates are. I told them there must
   always be someone there, and I also directed a Police Officer
   to stand there as well.

G. If we have a look, for example, at the photographs, the
   composite bundle, the one to which you have already been
   referred. DB.17/14. That is one taken and timed at 3 o'clock
   You were asked a few moments ago about people standing up. D
   you follow, by Mr. Hytner. and he was kind enough to lend vou
   his bundle. Is that a steward in a yellow waistcoat? - A.
   That is right, sir.
G. There would have been a steward at the other end? - A. Yes.
   that is correct. I went around each of the stewards, and in
   particular I told them that one must always remain at either
   end at the emergency exit gates.

G. You have been asked about your view of the crowd in the
   terraces, and it would appear you were not doing a head count
   but simply looking and observing what the state was? - A. The
   is correct, sir.
G. You have policed this ground on many occasions, have you? - t
   I have, sir, yes.
G. And have you policed other football grounds? - A. I think I
   have policed every ground in South Yorkshire and some other
   Forces as well, sir.
G. Do you have considerable experience accordingly in looking
   at and watching crowds? - A. Yes.
 G. Up to the time that something appeared to be wrong, which yo>
    would put at round about the kick-off? - A. I can’t be exact
    to the time. Somewhere around 3 o ’clock. That is all I can
    say.

                                                 D.   BULLAS


G. What was it that occurred to you that drew your attention to
   something being not right? - A. It was the movement in the
   crowd.
G. Up to that time had you observed any problem or distress in
   the crowd on the terrace? - A. Not at all.

G. Had you observed any people trying to get up from the terrace
   on to the West Stand? - A. There had been a few but this was
   solely with the intent of getting into the stand so they coul
   have a seat.                               _
G. Was there any indication from the people on the terrace below
   the West Stand that they needed to get out^of the terrace for
   reasons of safety? - A. Not at all.

G. For reasons of difficulty? - A. No.

G. You were at the front watching? - A. That is right.

G. What were you looking for? - A. I was looking for people
   climbing up, I was looking for things being thrown down and    I
   was also just monitoring the crowd in general.

G. Of course, it would depend upon what the attention of others
   in the front of the West Stand was focused on. but did anvboc
   along the front row of that West Stand, all those supporters
   that were along there, draw your attention to a problem in tr
   terrace below? - A. No, they did not, sir.

G.    Anyone say. ’’Look, they have got to come up. There is a
     problem. They are crushing” , anything like that? - A. Before
     the movement in the crowd, no, sir.
G. Your evidence is of movements in the crowd in the terrace
   below. - A. Yes.
G. You speak of surging and swaying, the crowd moving about. O:
   course, that may be something which people accept and expect
   perhaps even go to enjoy? - A. Yes.

G. I suppose it might be said that movement in itself is highly
   dangerous? - A. I should-imagine it could be. yes.

G. All it needs is something to miss a footing? - A. I think th
   has happened quite regularly, but what I sawon that Saturda
   was taken in good humour. They just swayed back without any
   problem.
G. But this is habitual conduct amongst supporters? - A. Yes.

G. You saw it happening? - A. Yes.

G. Did anything about it strike you as being unusual? - A. Not
   the least.
G. Or against that which might have been expected? - A. There v.
                               Ill

                                                   D.    BULLAS


     nothing unusual at all.
Q. The crowd or the surge that you saw which came, the river as
   it has been described as, was that in pen 3 or pen 4 or are
   you unable to say? - A. I can’t exactly say, sir. I know it
   came from the direction of the tunnel, going forwards, kind c
   spread out. I can’t really say.               .

G. Of course, there are crush barriers in the terraces? - A. Yes

0. And those crush barriers are intended to prevent people bein^
   embarrassed by others_ coining on from behind them? - a. Yes.

G. And depending upon their arrangement thaf tnay be successful c
   not successful? - A. yes.
0. The surge or crowd that came down, its general direction was
   forwards and seemed to be directly in front of the tunn-l? -
   A. It did. yes.
0. Did you see it extending far to the right-hand corner of pen
   No. 3. or not? - A. I would say no. not to the far corner.
   No.
G. The effect of that movement forwards seemed      io   be more towan
   the centre, did it? - A. It did. sir. yes.
0.   That is the rail that runs down between pens 4 and 3? - A.
     Yes.
G. Rather than spreading out and oppressing people who were mor
   distant, particularly down towards gate 3, let us say? - A.
   That. is correct, sir.
G. So your view, watching what was happening, and your attentio:’
   drawn to that, was not that the movement of those people, th
   river, that influx, was having any obvious effect upon people
   distant down towards the corner of pen 3? - A. It didn't
   appear to be affecting the people in the far corner, sir, no

                              Q. Very quickly you made your way up the steps of the V?est
                                 Stand to go down to the terrace? - A. As quick as I could,
                                 yes.
                              Q. Did you observe any Stewards as you made your way up to
                                 go out? - A. There was a Steward stood at the exit from
                          6      which I left.
                              Q. What was he doing? - A. Ke was still stood at the e::it.

                              Q. Arid you went down very quickly to the tunnel? - A. Yes,
                                 I went down the back steps,_yes.                            ~
                              Q. Would this be right: it \;oulc be a matter-of uouients only,
                          C      despite the difficulties you had, before you got down tc
                                 the tunnel? - A. It would net be very long fror.) when I
                                 had seen the movement in the crov/d to coing down the back
                                 steps.
                              Q. vie arc- not talking of five/ten minutes or anything like
                                 that? - A. iio.
                      D       Q. Certainly shorter? - A
                              q   . 3y the time you got to the tunnel you observed that there
                                    were already Police Officers in there? - A. Yes sir.

                              q   . Kot only that but those Police Officers were engaged’ir.
                                    endeavouring to help people tc clear them out. Is that
                          E         right? - A. Well the first person I saw being brought cut,
                                    there was either one or two Officers assisting to bring
                                    the first person out.
                              Q. So those Officers must have been very quickly into the
                                 tunhel to be able to do that before you got there? - A.
                                 Well they got there before I did sir, yes.

                          F   q   . it must have been in a very short space of time? - A. Yes.

                              Q.    Is thatright? - A. Yes.
                              q   . I don't know whether you can help on this, but did you
                                    notice amongst some of the fans at the tunnel as the tunnel
\
                                    gave on to the terrace, a reluctance on their part to
                                    come out? - A. I can't really answer that one, sir.
                          G         I.did not actually go on to the terracing. I was in
                                    the mouth of the tunnel and then I went back with or.c
                                    of the injured so I can't really answer that one.

                              Q. When those who had been hurt were being brought out from
                                 the tunnel was there some sort of organisation in train
                                 to help deal with them? - A.Ko.
                      H        Q. What happened to them? - A. They were taken to the n;outh
                                  of the tunnel at the back of the tunnel to the concourse.
                                  .They were placed on the floor and they were assisted
                                  bv Police Officers.

                        Q. So those who were brought out v/ere being attended to? -
                           A. Yes.
                        Q. They did not lack attention? - A. Not by any weans. In
                           fairness as the numbers mounted there v/ere not only Police
                           Officers attending there v/ere also members of the crowd.
                    B
                        Q.   Of course at that stage it was not necessarily apparent
                             how small or how large the problem was going to be? - A.
                             You could not tell at that stage sir.

                        Q. Quite whcTt it vvas that one was going to have to      cope with?
                           - A. Ko.                    ~
                        Q. But your recollection is that there v/ere Officers very
                           quickly on the scene in dealing with it? - A. There were

                                   Mil. V.'OOD'.JARO: Thank vou sir.

                    D                         P.c-S.vamined bv         COLLHIS:

                        Q. Can I iust ask you what is or would be your yardstick fcr
                           deciding when a pen was over full? - A. I think visually
                           sir if you are given a figure then you should be able tc
                           tell within a reasonable amount if it is over full. ..If
                           you are in earshot of people; people askir.c for assistance;
                           you can see people getting crushed; people asking tc be
                           moved out. There was none of that prior to the nove.nent.

                        Q. So you would not act or would not consider it necessary
                           to act until you saw people already in distress? - A. Oh
                           no,-I v/ould not say that. It is a yardstick by visually
                           looking at a crowd you can tell if it is overcrowded, to
                           a certain degree.

                        Q . You v/ere mentioning cries of distress and people in trouble?
                            - A. Yes.

                        Q. Does it have to reach that stage before you act or is there*
                           something before that? --A. You use your initiative and
                           you do something before that.

                        Q. I see. When you came out down the back of the Stand in
                           order to go down to see what you could do to help, can
                           you remember whether the turnstiles v/ere still open,
                           whether you noticed? - A. I don't know sir.

                        Q. The only other thing I want to ask is this: you have told
                           us there v/ere one or two people you recall trying to cli:r.b_
                           up just in order to get to seats in the Stand. How do
                H          you know that was their aiotive rather than trying to
                           escape from problems in the pens? - A. When I mentioned
                           that that was prior to the problem that I had seen in the

                           crowd. In fact I took two of the people concerned out
                           myself and ejected them down the back steps. I think
                           other Officers did as well. It is a regular thing to
                           clinb up on the wall.

                        Q. What tirae are we talking about when this -happened? - A.
                    B      1 o'clock onwards.

                        Q. VJe know that there were people cli.tibing up and being
                           helped up after the trouble had arisen in order to get
                           out of it. Did you see any of that? - A. I didn't sir,
                           no.                        _
                                 MR. COLLI IIS:    Yes, than’: you.   I have no no re

       Thank you for your letter of 24 April to the Prime Minister
      fering assistance in preventing another tragedy such as that
    which took place at Hillsborough.                   I have been asked to reply.


        As you may know, an Inquiry under the Chairmanship of Lord
    Justice Taylor has been formed to investigate the events of
    Hillsborough and to make recommendations.                          I have therefore
    forwarded your letter to Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the Inquiry
    who can be contacted at this address.




                                                            MISS C J BANNISTER

                     I am a supporter of Liverpool Football Club and have been for a

                     number of years.

                     On the morning of the 15 April                    1989 (150489)          I had a phone call from

                     a friend who had been able to get me a six pound t icket for the

                     Leppi ngs Lane terracing at Hillsborough Stadium for the F .A . Cup Semi-

                     Final Match to be played there

                     I travelled with a friend
                                                                      A             and three others, who were

                     friends of                         ^/We" went    in a car , trave 11 ing along the M62 &

                     M1,    leaving Livery6ol at             11.30 am.         Traffi c was heavy but we did not

                     have any major ^ o l d u p s .              I did not see a n y p e o p l e drinking on the

                     travel journey to S h e f f i e l d .

                     We arrived in Sheffield at 2 prn                     iround the ground. There were a few

                     people drinking alcohol                         ca n s , but no more than you would expect
                                                                                     PAGE
*                                                                                    S33E

at a match of this t y p e .

We parked our car in Winn Gardens and walked to the ground.                       There

were    large numbers of people making towards the stadium.                     I did not

see or receive any Police direction or escort from parking to the

ground,    but I did not n e e d a n y as I have been b e f o r e . The crowd was

boisterous but w e l l j ^ n a v e d .

At 2.10 pm I a/cnved at my e ntrance              point to the g r o u n d .   There were

no Queues>K e r e , just a mass of people trying to get in.                    I joined at

the \haKh: of the crowd, whi ch would put me about               15 yards from the

turnstiles,     it was filling up rapidly behind me.

The only Police directions           I witne£>*d rrOXSide the ground were two

Police horses who were                    to organise queues, but it was too

late then anSi t h M ^ w a s n ’t enough Police trying to organise the

crowds    in the compound.

I found no difficulty getting to the entry point,                   but having got

there    it was difficult to get into the g r o u n d .          This was because of

the numbers of peopie         in the compound outside the turnstiles

attempting to get in.          When you actually got         into the turnstile       ’h u t *

there were further        pr o bl em s.   The pressure behind            forced you

against the t-urnstile b a r , which seemedj»ff^create dj.f f i cul ty for the

man to open the bar.          This was sj^gtfxng the entry of people             into the

ground.     I was queueing toyg€t into             the ground for 30 m i n u t e s , and

during this tike I w^r^squashed.                At notime did I     see any gates         open

other than turnstiles.

Three or four teenagers scaled a fence between the entries to the

West Stand and terracing turnstiles but I think they were only trying

to get out of the crush and not to gain unauthorised entry,                       one of

these was actually trying to show his ticket to the Police.

My ticket had a letter          ’B ’ on i t .

Once    inside the ground I saw on thewall above                the centre tunnel         the
                                                                                                      PAGE       3
                    *                                                                                 S352

                    letters A and B.        I assumed this was my entry to the ground so I made

                    towards   it.

                    There were a number of people aroundj/lfut I had a free walk down the

      ($-
           V        tunnel.     When I got to the pitcjy'end of this tunnel             I made towards
    'I '
                    Pen 4.    It was full\in this^pen near to the rear and c e nt re .               Slowly

                    I made my way t h r o u g ^ ^ m e   crowd to find a match viewing         pos ition on

                    the front of pen 4 near to the side fence by the North S t a n d.                 On

                    arriving in this position I was fairly comfortable and had space to

           yflf     stand on.       This was at about 2.45 p m .         I could see in the pen next to

                    me near to the North Stand masses of empty s p a c e s , but I could not

                    see a way into this        pen.

                    At the tunnel      1 never saw any Police directions or s t e w a r d s , and no

                    signs directing anyone to the side terracing,               if there had of been

$                   signs or X had been made aware            I could have gone to the side

                    terracing    I would have done so, as that              is where   I normally make to.

                    Having got to my viewing            position I was      in enough space      to be

                    comfortable,      but then it rapidly filled           up and I became        cr u sh ed .

                    There were a few small surges,            but instead     of returning       back after

            »       going forwards we remained forwards.

       J r ''       I was crushed almost solid at kick off t i m e , then there became a
     i              small gap which allowed me to assist a man in getting                  two teenage

                    girls over the side fence towards the side pen. Then I became

                    crushed again. Then a small gap appeared,               I don't know how and I got

                    pushed and fell over        into it.

                    Fortunately two men immediately picked me up again.                  I was then

                    crushed solid aaain.        I ended up jammed in the corner of the front
            I                                              --------------------------------------
                (   and s ide fence.      I put up my arms and managed to pull myself up the

                    grating of the front fence and then climb into the side p e n .

                    There was no way the fences could be opened or broken to allow

                    people out of the terracing quickly enough.

      «   The Police stood on the perimeter track in front of the fence were

          telling         people to go back and not to climb over the fence.

          There should have been more control and directions of people at the

          entrance to the Police.

          The design of the fences are completely inadequate.                  should be

          more       communication between Police,   Stewardg^afTa f a n s .

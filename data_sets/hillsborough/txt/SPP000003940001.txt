     You will recall that I mentioned the question of the judicial inquiry into the
     Hillsborough inquests when we met the other day.

     I enclose for your private information the documents that I have received from the
     Deputy Solicitor to the West Midlands Police Authority. I will give you a couple of
     weeks to digest them and then I would propose to make contact with you with a view to
     arranging a meeting.

     With best wishes.

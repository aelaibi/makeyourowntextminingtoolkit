  This morning-Jacques                 Georges sent a message   of condolance to The
  Football Association                 on. the tragic incident  at Sheffield, He
  »-Gated in that telex                that "once more our sport has been victim to
  the folly of certain                 spectators".


  Ife immediately responded thanking him for his expression of
  sympathy but pointing out tht there was absolutely no evidence to
  indicate that the tragedy had in any way been caused by violence
  or misconduct #among supporters,


  I was dismayed therefore to hear of the quotes attributed to
  Mr, Georges early this afternoon,  if the comments have been
  translated accurately they are untrue, disrespectful to t h e c is a a
  and utterly insensitive.  If this strong condemnation o r o u r p a r - :
  offends Mr. Georges and thereby prejudices the possibility of our
  clubs returning to European Competition that will have been a
  small price to pay for having set the record straight*

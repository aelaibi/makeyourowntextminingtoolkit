             Saturday,         15 April          1989 Serial No. 3 with PS 577^ G^fr dne r .      Commenced

             duty at 9am for briefing at                      10am at tMe SWFC Ground.        Was on serial 3

             with PS 577 Gardner                      in the South S'land.      Covered turnstile no. 28

             inside the stand.                   No problemsyalthough after 2 . 1 5 pm was q^ite busy.
             “                           ‘ J kI                         \ '
             At 3pm together with PC 26i>€ooper escorted the man from Betting

             Office w i t h money outside the South Stand for security reasons.

             Just after 3pm heard from someone on turnstiles say that                            "they were on

             the pitch".           So with PC 261 joined PS 577 and others from serial                          in

             upper level at rear                      of South S t a n d . At that stage did not really know

             what was happening.                      Just thought it was a pitch invasion.        Then

             noticed a PC on pitch giving mouth to mouth to a person and realised

             then that something                      was wrong.    Then found out that there were

             problems and people                      were being terribly crushed and PS 577 directed                us
                                                                                                p
                                                                                    S1378

down onto the pitch to do what we could to help.                   This was about

3.10pm.     On the pitch was told by a ’Boss',                can't remember who,    to

help move the ones who weren't                 injured to one side,   so people   could

get out the ones that were.              Moved quite a few plus helped others

slightly injured to their feet and their friends then moved them.                          By

now Liverpool      fans were getting very antagonistic towards Notts.

Forest fans and were starting to make their way/towards them in a
                                                         f t ?£%
threatening manner.          Then told by Chief         Insaector Beal   to form a line

across    centre of^tfrtch to stop them r eajchi/ng Notts. Forest            fans.        Was

in t h a t l i ^ / f C o m then o n wa rd s.    A lot of the fans were obviously

upset,    but others were just stood shouting threatening things towards

Police and N o t t s . Forest.        Was impressed how many fans did he 1p but

disgusted with others who smelled of drink and were asking when replay

was and would they get their money back.                  (Can't   remember what time

this was)       Remember seeing Liverpool             fan running towards Notts.

Forest fans "taunting" them.              He was eventually "escorted" from the

pitch by police officers.             At this stage although I. knew people had

been killed and had seen a lot stretchered from the pitch I still did

not know the extent of the tragedy as I did not have a radio,                     the only

one on our serial with a radio was PS 577 and I had got split up from

him since being cun the pitch.             After ground had cleared,       together with

PC 261 and 70 y who were also on serial 3, we went to the rear of

Leppings Lafte end where we found the rest of our seriate                   Were then

just stood holding        crowds back to allow emergency vehicles access.

Then eventually directed to North Stand for^a ^ - b r i e f i n g and

eventually were stood down at 7pm.

The mood of Liverpool          fans I would say was mainly f rust rat ion and

upset,    but there were others who smelled of drink and seemed not to

care less.

I did not, have any contact with stewards at Leppings Lane.
                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                  SI 378

         I did not have a radio,         so d o n ’t know if there was any break down in

         t ransmissions.

         I did not handle any bodies.

         My feelings are that      I was stunned by what was happening and felt

         frustrated in that I could not do more to help.           I felt so helpless

         stood in the      ’line a c r o s s ’ the pitch, also 1 did not know exactly what

         was happening as I did not have a radio, where as usually you do at

         work.     I was   impressed by most of the fans who did help,      but disgusted

         by others who appeared the worse for wear for drink, and appeared no

         to care less, more      concerned with getting their money back.

                                                                                 SIGNED

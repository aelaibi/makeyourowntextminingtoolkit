  NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                    Date                        19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.
3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.
4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re
      C.D. died from the industrial disease o f



                                                                                                           •
      C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
      on drugs.

      C.D. died from want o f attention at birth.

      (In any o f the above cases, but in no other, it is
      suggested that the following words may, where
      appropriate, be added:
      "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                   Cause of death
      care/self-neglect').

   b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
     infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
     of the following forms be adopted:
      C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
      his/her mind was disturbed).

     C.D. died as the result o f an attempted/self­
     induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
     C.D. died as the result of an accideni/misadventure.

     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause o f death
     arose.

  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.

  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
    complete the remainder of the form.

Dear Sirs,
                                     I
Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a n atre or
names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

 I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
 heard from you by the end of Septefltfer I will assume you have no names to
 submit.

 Yours faithfully,

         Dear Sir,

         Limited Resumed Inquests - Hillsborough

         Your letter of 14th March has been referred to our client. We ought to tell
         you that we represent the interests of the parents of Peter Andrew Burkett
         deceased and it was not their intention to be represented at the inquest since
         we understand that the relict of the deceased may alrady be separately represented.

         We are only concerned to see a copy of the post mortem report and that will
         no doubt be available in any event in the ordinary course.

Dear Sir

RE:   HILLSBOROUGH


Many thanks for your letter of the 27th July enclosing copies of the Post-Mortem
Reports.

I will certainly make clear to my clients the conditions under which these
Reports have been released.

A cheque for £26.95 to cover your copying charges is attached, might I trouble
you for a receipt for accounting purposes.

Since I gave you my list of deceased a further one has been added, he is
John McBrien                                                 might j please
have a copy oi m s Keport to complete the set.

Yours faithfully

Dear S ir s ,

You will he aware that I do not normally release post mortem
reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
in fact put in as evidence.

However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
end the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
report of your slisnt(s).

The release of these post mortem reports are cn the basis that:-

       a.     They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
              subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
              they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

       b.     They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
              conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
              legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
              in which solicitors may be engaged.

       c.     Subject to thfi,~a’
                                8S'5J§, they are to be kept confidential until
              they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
assumption that you will confirm that the. report in respect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

The cost for the copy post mortem raport(s) is   * 7 ' per sheet (total
Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

Yours faithfully,

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent

following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

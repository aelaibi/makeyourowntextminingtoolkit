               TWENTY FIRST DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                 MONDAY, 17th DECEMBER 1990

      THE CORONER:  Miss Steel, I have not met you I
don't think but I have corresponded but you are standing
in, if that is the right word, for Mr. King I understand?

      MISS STEEL:  That is so. He is unable to be here
today, so with your permission I will.

      THE CORONER:  You are very welcome and I am sure
you will see very soon how it works.  I don't know, have
you been here during the hearings at all, I can't remember?

      MISS STEEL:     No, I have not been here, not until
today.

       THE CORONER: You may remember, ladies and
gentlemen, that Mrs. McBrien wanted to ask Mr. Milton
a couple of questions and she did very kindly let me
have the questions and although I did not consider them
necessarily vital I know that they are very important
to Mrs. McBrien and they may in fact be important so I
decided to get Mr. Milton back just to deal with that
point.

      Mr. Milton, I think you had better take the oath
again because we did discharge you.


                      COLIN MILTON Sworn

         Further Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

      THE CORONER:  There are just a couple of things,
Mr. Milton, that Mrs. McBrien wanted just to check out
with you.
      Mrs. McBrien, do you want to      ask the questions?
Shall I read the little bit of the      transcript to Mr. Milton
which I think deals with the first      part of your question
and then you can ask the question,      okay?

       m s.   McBRIEN:    I have written them all down sir
now.

       THE CORONER:      Okay then, you go ahead.

      MRS. McBRIEN:  Mr. Milton, on Thursday, the 13th
of December you told the Court that a Police Officer
instructed you to let Kop ticket holders through your
turnstile, that was Turnstile G, and you said to them:
"I can't let you through" but the Police Officer said
that you had to let them in. You thought that you should
                              C. MILTON


not be doing this but when a Police Officer told you to
do it you felt you had to do it. Is that correct? - A.
That is right, yes.

Can you remember what, time you were first instructed to
let Kop ticket holders through your turnstile? - A. It
was quite early.  I would say round about half~past—1,
quarter-to-2 when I was first asked.   You know, it is
difficult, it is a long time since.

And then you said it became busier afterwards and you
were still getting Kop ticket holders at your turnstile
and you were having to let them in until it peaked at
2.45? - A. Yes.

Do you know that the Spion Kop has standing places for
22,000 fans whereas the Leppings Lane terrace has only
room for 10,100.  Did you know that? - A. I have’a rough
idea, yes.

Also are you aware that the Spion Kop is an open terrace
area whereas the Leppings Lane terrace ....

      THE CORONER:  Mrs. McBrien, those were the questions
I saw and I don't think they are relevant.  It does not
matter what the Spion Kop is like or how big it is. He
was a turnstile operator at Leppings Lane.  His evidence
is that he allowed Kop tickets through and he says that
he did so on authority from a Police Officer.  Pursue that
if you like but it does not make any difference how many
people you can get on to the Spion Kop.  Take your time.

      MRS. McBRIEN: I don't think I will be able to
ask which is the most popular area of the terrace will I?
No.

      THE CORONER:  No, not of this witness because he
does not really know.  Well he may know but it was not
his task at the time to deal with.

      MRS. McBRIEN: I don't know if this one is appropriate.
Did you find that by having to admit Kop ticket holders
through the Leppings Lane turnstiles it was slowing the
progress of the genuine Leppings Lane ticket holders? -
A. No, I would not say it would slow it down at all.

It wasn't? - A. It was just continuous, same thing.  It
did not make any difference because once I had been told
to take the Kop tickets I did not ask questions I just
took them on the same procedure.

What I was wondering you were having to admit greater
numbers through.  That is what I was thinking,  these
additional Kop ticket holders? - A. Well yes.  I can't
                                                            3.


                                  C. MILTON


     see that it slowed things down.  If it had been on a
     normal basis it would not have slowed anything down.

Q. You said you weren't happy about letting the Kop ticket
   holders through.  Can you tell me why you say that?
   A. Well for a start I don't think they should have gone
   to Nottingham to get the tickets.  I think if they had
   not got the tickets they should not have been there.   That
   is it. They got the tickets under false pretences.

Q. I know we had evidence in Court here of Kop ticket holders
   being in Pen 3.
           THE CORONER:   No, Mrs. McBrien, deal with what this
     gentleman can do which is turnstiling, if I can use that
     word, not what happened to them afterwards.   That is not
     his task.  He says that he was told that he was allowed
     to let Kop ticket holders through and he did.   He has
     also given you an answer which I think you did not expect.
     He gave you an answer as to why he did not want them to
     come through but you asked the question and he is entitled
     to answer that.   It was a legitimate question and he has
     given you his answer.

Q.         MRS. McBRIEN: Do you know the name of the Police
     Officer who instructed you to do that? - A. No, I don t
     know the name.
Q. Or have you a description of him? - A. Phew, no.   I see
   that many every week.  You don't take much notice.

Q. You don't know whether he was a senior Officer or a
   Constable? - A. I think there was a Senior Officer there.
   There was a Senior Officer and a Constable there at
   the front on the outside.

Q. You said when Gate C was opened there was a surge and
   thousands went through and you said:  "What are^you
   doing that for? What are you opening them for?" You
   said you had never seen anything like this before
   happening.  Can you tell me why you said these things
   please? - A. I just thought it was peculiar opening
   the gates when there were thousands of people outside
   waiting trying to get in. Obviously when they open
   the gates they are all going to surge through and that
   is why I said that.

 Q. Who did you say that to please? Who did you speak to
    when you said that? - A. Well I just shouted it to the
    Police who was opening the gate:  "What are you opening
    them for?"

 Q. And what was his response to it? - A. Well I said it
    on Thursday.  He just said:  "There will be somebody
    killed outside if we don't."
                                                                4.


                                    G. MILTON


           MRS. McBRIEN: Yes, I think that is all.  I am
     much obliged to you for coming, Mr. Milton. Thank you
     very much.

          THE WITNESS:    Right, thank you.

          MRS. McBRIEN:    Thank you sir for recalling Mr. Milton.


                     Further By THE CORONER:

Q. I just want to check this business about the Police Officer
   again because we have got to try and make sure we have got
   this right.

           First of all the Officer who told you to let the Kop
     ticket people through, was he on the inside of the turnstile
     or was he on the outside of the turnstile? — A. The outside.

Q. Definitely the outside? - A. Yes.

Q.    Was he an Officer, you have already said you don't know
     who he was, does that mean that you cannot recollect
     now whether this was a regular Officer who was there
     normally or somebody whom you had never seen before? -
     A. Well I can't recollect seeing him before.    I think
     he were a regular chap because he seemed to know what
     he was doing.

Q. But you don't remember seeing him before? - A. No.

Q. And I think you did tell me last Thursday but I will
   just double check this, that in fact you were only told,
   he only told you that once, you did not ask every time
   you let Kop ticket holders through.  That is correct,
   isn't it? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. And you took it that if he had allowed one lot through
   he would allow the others through.  That is what you
   are saying? - A. Correct, yes.

Q. You are quite sure he was a Police Officer and not
   somebody else? — A. Definitely a Police Officer.

Q. You are satisfied he was a Police Officer? - A. Yes,
   because I shouted him into the gate.  He came to the
   turnstile because it was early doors when it first
   happened.

           THE CORONER:  Anybody want to ask Mr. Milton
     anything arising out of this?



                          Further Cross-Examined by MR. HALE:
                                                                  5



                                                            C . MILTON




                   Further Cross-Examined by MR. HALE

    Q.   I would just ask this, Mr. Milton:  you have said you
         never experienced anything like the crush outside the
B        turnstiles before? - A. That is right.

    Q. Have you any previous experience in any shape or form
       of fans getting mixed from two opposing teams? - A. Oh,
       yes, it happens nearly every week actually.

    Q- What happens if they do get mixed? - A. They just
       either let them in, or sometimes they won't bother
       letting them in.

    Q- What I meant was, have you any experience of fans being
       mixed on any sort of scale? - A. Oh, yes, I have seen
       the fans mixed in the Kop, everywhere, you know.

    Q. How do they usually get on together? - A. They have
       seemed all right.  There has been no problem.

D   Q. Does it depend on which teams they are? - A. Yes,
       definitely.

                      Cross-Examined by MISS STEEL

         Mr. Milton, I don't know if you knew then but do you
         know now that there are Liverpool fans who live in many
         different parts of the country? - A. Oh, yes.

    Q.   I don't know whether you knew then but do you now that
         there are some Liverpool fans who live in the
         Nottingham area? - A. No, I didn't know that but I
         suppose there is - I mean, there is some live in
         Sheffield.

              THE CORONER:     Mr. Milton, thank you very much.

                        IAN MARSH Called (Sworn)

                              By THE CORONER

    Q. You are Ian Marsh,     that is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.

    Q.   I think you have moved from thf a d d r e s s I haye got, so
         give us your new address. - A.
         Cambridge.

    Q. And what is your job in Cambridge? - A. Postman.

    Q.   I take it then having moved to Cambridge you no longer
         work for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club? - A. No.




H
                                                      I.       MARSH




Q. When did you move approximately, not to the date? - A.
   29th October.

Q. This year? - A. Yes.

Q. On 15th April 1989 though you were a steward, I think,
   with Sheffield Wednesday, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.   Had you been a steward for any length of time with them
     before that? - A. Yes.

Q.   How many years? - A. About four years.

Q.   Did you tend to do the same job when you were
     stewarding? - A. Yes.

Q. What was that? - A. Gateman on Gate C.

Q. Gate C? - A. Yes.

Q. In fact, you did that on .... - A. The day.

Q. On the day as well, yes.  Did you only work on semi­
   final days, or did you also work on league days? - A.
   On league days.

Q. League days as well, so very approximately how many
   days did you attend to operate Gate C in any season? -
   A. Well, whenever there was a home match.

Q. Whenever there was a home match? - A. Yes.

Q. And you did that for about four years and     it was always
   Gate C? - A. Yes.

Q. Of course, I think I am right in saying you were not
   the only steward on that gate? - A. No.

Q. There were two others, I believe, is that right?        -    A.
   Yes.

Q. On 15th April, that is? - A. Yes.

0. Was that Richard Beadsley, was that one of them? - A.
   Yes.

Q. And the other one was Malcolm Bain, is that correct? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Did you always work with those two?    Were you a team
   for Gate C? - A. Yes.

Q. That is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.
                                                    I.   MARSH




Q. As part of your uniform you are give a sort of yellow
   jacket? - A. Yes.

Q. Does it have steward written on it anywhere as far as
   you remember?  Does it have anything written on it? -
   A. No, only advertising.

0. Only advertising, I see, but it is a bright yellow
   jacket? - A. It is a bright yellow one, yes.

Q. Very   briefly, what was your task with regard to Gate C,
   what   were you supposed to do there if anything? - A. To
   open   and close to Police, club officials and that is
   all,   not to admit the general public.

Q. Not to admit the general public? - A. No.

0. So it was intended then - this is pre-match we are
   talking about at the moment, aren't we? - A. Yes.

0. Of course, when the match was over you opened it so
   that people could get out, that is right, isn't it? -
   A. Yes, as an exit gate.

Q. So the object of this gate was exit, and to allow
   people to enter in and out who did not need to come
   through turnstiles, that is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. The gate pulls open, doesn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. Once you know how to undo the clasp it is a relatively
   simple matter to open and shut it? - A. Yes.

Q. Would the normal practice be only to open it a little
   way so that whoever wanted to come in could get in, but
   nobody else? - A. Yes.

Q.    Why do you have three stewards on the gate? Have you
     any idea why there were three of you? - A. It is just
     in rotation - quarter of an hour to have a break.

Q. Are you all there up to the beginning of the match or
   do you rotate? - A. No, we are all there.

Q. So up to the beginning of the match you are all there?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Once the match is on you rotate? - A. There is always
   somebody on the gate.

Q.   And the other two can do whatever they want? - A.   Yes.

Q.   Can you remember whether you were at the match in   1988,
     the previous semi-final? - A. Yes.
                                                             I.   MARSH




     0. Same job? - A. Yes.

     Q. We will talk about 1989 first of all, this is the year
JJ      when the disaster occurred, okay? - A. Yes.

     Q. I think you got to the gate at about 11.30, perhaps a
        little bit later? - A. Yes.

     Q. Fairly early? - A. Yes.

     Q. Prior to that had you received any briefing from
        anybody? - A. No, we only get them on the day.

     Q.   Yes, and what briefing did you get on the   day? - A. As
          normal.

     Q. What is the normal briefing? - A. Just not to let
        people in.

     Q.   What you have just told me, in fact? - A.   Yes.

     Q.   Open and shut it when required? - A. Yes.

     0. Don't let people in, have it open when the game is
        over, and are you also told that if an emergency occurs
        you have to do anything? - A. Yes.

     Q. How is that communicated to you? - A. It is relayed
        over the tannoy:  "Mr. Meadows is required at the
        Police room".

     Q. When you hear that you know that something has
        happened? - A. All three of us go to the gate and open
        the gates.

     Q. Just to get that quite clear, you didn't hear that
        message in 1989? - A. No.

     Q. In fact, you didn't hear it in 1988 either, did you? -
        A. No.

     Q. You can look out through a little window      through this
        gate, can't you? - A. Yes.

     Q. In the beginning it was fairly quiet, wasn't it? - A.
        Y es .

     Q. Did you and your colleagues go outside from time to
        time and look around and see what's what? - A. Yes.

     Q. Did you have to help anybody - I mean fans? - A. Yes.

     Q. In what respect? - A. People who had never been to the
        ground, to direct them to wherever they wanted to go.

                                               I.    MARSH




When you went outside, I am interested in how far you
went away from the gate.  Did you stay just by the gate
or did you walk up to the perimeter - when I say the
perimeter gates, do you know what I mean? - A. Yes,
Leppings Lane.

Did you walk right up to there? - A. No.

How near to those did you get? - A. We just stayed
outside the gates.

Just stayed outside the gates? - A. Yes.

And people might come up to you and say, "Where do I
go?" or something like that? - A. Yes, "Where’s North
Stand?", "Where's South Stand?".

And you would pointed them .... - A. Which direction.

Did you have loads of people like that? - A. Yes.

Quite a lot.  At what time was that - up to about what
time, do you know? - A. It started about half-past-2,
about quarter-past-2, half-past-2, it started getting
crowded, really.

Q. Were you still outside the gate? - A. No.

Q. What I am interested in is how long were you...   What
   time did you go back inside and not come out again? - A.
   I could not really say.

Q. Before half past two, though? - A. Yes.

0. These people who asked you for directions, all these were
   asked while you were outside or also on the inside? - A.
   No, they were all outside.

0. So requests for directions outside only, correct? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You can't remember what time you actually went in but it
   was certainly before half past two? - A. Yes.

Q. You have already said the fans seemed to build up between
   quarter and half past two, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. You could see them through your little spyhole, or how
   did you know that? - A. We could see them through the
   turnstiles.

Q. What impression did you form of the fans at that stage? -
   A. Well, up to then they had been fairly good humoured.

Q. Did that change in any way? - A. Yes.

Q. What was it that changed, can you remember? - A. Well,
   there just the build up of people trying to get into the
   ground.

Q. Could you see that? - A. Yes.

Q. Through the turnstiles or through the gate? - A. Through
   both.

Q. Could you see - we know what the answer is, but I am
   interested in what you saw - could you see whether the
   fans were being squashed near the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. You could see that with your own eyes? - A. Yes.

Q. In the meantime this gate was being opened and shut? -A.
   Yes.

Q. That is quite normal practice? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it being used to throw people out? - A. Yes.

Q. To eject people? - A. Yes.

                                                      I. MARSH


Q. Who does the ejecting, is it stewards, turnstile
   operators or police? - A. Police.

Q. Give me a typical ejection.   Not one which is unusual
   but just what happens when somebody gets ejected. - A.
   They just throw them out.   They just walk them down and
   we open the gate and they just put them outside.

0. So the policeman comes with a man or woman.   You can see
   they want them out.   You open the gate... - A. And
   that's it.

Q. They are out and you shut the gate? - A. That's it.

Q. That's what happened? - A. Yes.

Q. I don't suppose for a minute you know how many times it
   happened, but can you hazard a guess? - A. No.

Q. Not at all? - A. Not at all.

Q. But more than once? - A.   Yes.

Q. Most of these ejections, did they work satisfactorily in
   the sense the fan was ejected and nobody else came in
   other than authorised people? - A. Yes, apart from once
   when there was this surge through the gates.

Q.   Yes, we will come to that in a moment.    We know several
     people did come in later on but I am trying to find out
     what happened in the beginning.    Perhaps we will deal
     with that now.   Do you know what time that was when fans
     came through? - A. No.

Q. Do you know the times of any of the openings   of the
   gates? - A. Ten to three the main one.

Q. This opening where some people came in which you have
   mentioned, how long before the main opening would you
   say? - A. I really couldn't say.

Q. Tell me what happened on that occasion? -A. As far as I
   can recall we opened the gate and fans came through - 1^
   don't know how many - and then we shut them as soon as it
   was safe to do so.

Q. Can you hazard a guess as to how many   fans came through?
   - A. Not that many I don't think.

Q. In your statement you said about forty.  Would you say
   that was right or do you think that is too low or do you
   think it is too high? - A. There might have Deen a few
   more come through but there weren't many more than that.

0. Can you remember whether you managed to      get the gate
   shut?   You said when it was safe to do      so.   Did you
   notice whether a police horse stationed      itself across the
   outside of the gate at that point? - A.      I can't remember.

Q. How long would you say it was open for? - A. Not long.

Q. Do you remember whether you opened it or your colleagues?
   - A. No, I can't remember.

Q.    None of these questions is threatening.  I am simply
     trying to establish... - A. Well, I don't know.   Whoever
     was nearest to the gate opened it.

Q. You can't remember now?    - A. No.

0. Can you remember whether after this gate was open and
   people came through whether it was opened again before
   the main opening without people coming through? - A. No.

Q. You can't remember or it wasn't? - A. It wasn't, only for
   ejections.

Q. It was not? - A. No.

Q.   You are sure of that? - A. I am certain.

Q.   The reason why I ask you is because in your statement
     there is an implication it was opened forejections but
     without any problems? - A. Oh, yes,that is   whatI said.
     It was opened for ejections, but...

Q.   But nobody else came in? - A. No.

Q.   Do you remember how many times it might have been opened
     for ejections as far as you can recollect? - A. I have no
     idea.

Q.   After that incident? - A. No, I have no idea.

Q.   Did things get even busier outside then? -A. Yes.

Q. What   did you see or notice? - A. Pardon?

Q. What did you see or notice about what was happening
   outside? - A. Well, there was just a steady build up of
   fans.

Q. Had you seen that sort of numbers before in that
   situation?   You have been there for four years. - A.
   Yes, I have seen a lot of people in that enclosure
   before, but this was spreading outside the enclosure as
   well.

                                                      I. MARSH


Q. What happened with regard to the gate after you notice
   there was a build up, you told me it was opened, forty or
   perhaps a few more fans came through, what occurred after
   that as far as you were concerned? - A.About ten to
   three we were told to open the gate.

Q. Who told you? - A.   The police officers.

Q. Just describe to me what happened?     Which officer?     Did
   you know him? - A. No.

Q. Had you ever seen him before? - A. I don't know.        Just a
   police officer told me.

Q.   You had been there for four years? - A.   Yes.

Q.    You had been there for every home game, which is maybe
     twenty/thirty a year, so that is about one hundred and
     twenty.   You may not know the police officers by name, I
     don't expect you to do that,  but was it a police officer
     whom you had seen before, as  far as you can remember? -
     A. No.

0. So you are saying it was a stranger to you? - A. Yes,
   they were all strangers on that end of the ground.
   There was no regular police who normally patrolled that
   ground there at all on that day.




                0. So you say that
>1                                                                     14

              So you are saying that each match you get a completely
              different batch of officers? - A. No.  Just on that
              day there was a different batch.  It was different to
              normal.
     B
         Q.   You are sure about that? - A.        As far as I know, yes.

         Q.   What did the officer tell you? - A.        He just said, "We
              are opening the gate".

         Q.   Did you do it instantly, or what? - A. No, the Police
              did it.  The Police opened the gates.

         Q.   The Police opened the gates?    - A.    Yes.

         Q.   It was not a    difficult thing to do because it was    not
               locked? - A.   No.

         Q.   Can you remember if it was opened wide, or just a
               little way? - A. No, both*gates were opened.

         Q.   Wide? - A. Yes.
     D
         Q.   Did a lot of    people come in? - A. Yes.

         Q.   Did you hear any shouts from anybody about notopening
               the gate? - A. No.

         Q.   You never heard that? - A.     No.

         Q.   Which side of the gate were you standing, the
               turnstile side or the other side? - A. The other side.

         Q.   The people who came in, how did they come in? - A.
               Just rushed through the gate.

         Q.   Pardon? - A.    Just come through the gate.

         Q.   Did they fall through the gate, did they run through
               the gate, did they walk through the gate? - A. Most of
               them walked through it.

         Q.   Where did they head for? - A. Most of them for the
               tunnel.

         Q.   Did they ask you, or did anybody ask you, where they
               should go? - A. No.

         Q.   Did anybody ask you? - A. No.

         Q.   Nobody asked? - A. No.

           Q.   Before the gate was opened on this occasion, was it
                being shaken, or was it completely steady? - A. It was
                steady as far as I know.

       B   Q.    Was the wall moving in any way? - A. No.

           Q.    It was not? - A. I don't think so.

           Q.    You are sure? - A.   Well....

           Q.   Did you think it was a wise decision from what    you had
                seen outside to open the gate? - A. Yes.

           Q.   Why do you say that? - A. Well, because at the time we
                thought people would get killed outside.

           Q.   Could you see them then? - A. You could see them
                getting crushed, yes.

           Q.   The danger which you perceived for the people outside,
                what was it? X^hat was endangering them as far as you
                could tell? - A. Just the sheer volume of fans.
       D
           Q.   You were not scared that there would be collapse of
                any structures which might hurt them? - A. Not at that
                time, no.

           Q.   The gate was open for how long? - A. About five
                 minutes.

           Q.   Then what happened to it after that? - A. It was
                 closed.

           Q.   Did the Police tell you to close it, or did you do it
                yourself? - A. The Police told us to close it.

           Q.   Was it opened again after that? - A. Yes.

           Q.   When was that, can you remember? - A. I can't remember
                the exact time.

           Q.   Who authorised that opening, as far as you knew? - A.
                The Police.

           Q.   Did it then stay open? - A. No, we closed it again
                 later on.

           Q.   When you opened it this last time that you have
                described, did you open it wide that time, or was it
                 only partially open? - A. Only partially opened.

           Q.   On this last opening that we are talking about, were
                 tickets being checked at that stage? - A. Yes.
to                                                                 16

         Q.   By whom? - A. By us, the stewards.

         Q.   The tickets, I assume, were not being checked at the
              main opening, is that right? - A. Yes.
     B
         Q.   Why was that? - A. There were just too many.

         Q.   I want you to turn your attention now away from the
               gate for a moment and I want you to think about the
               tunnel - okay? - A. Yes.

         Q.   Was the entry to the tunnel in 1989 unobstructed?
              Could people go freely down it? - A. Yes.

         Q.   Was the entry to the wings of the terrace round by the
              south block unobstructed as well? - A. Yes.

         Q.   You have been there before and you know to get to the
              other wings, pen 7, you would have to go through a gap
              in the wall, would you not, do you remember that? - A.
              Y es .

     D   Q.   Was that unobstructed? - A. Yes.

         Q.   You may not remember, but there were not any signs
              over that gap in the wall, were there? - A. No.

         Q.   Is it that you can't remember, or that there weren't
               any? - A. There weren't any.

         Q.   Think back now to 1988 - okay - semi-final 1988.   Tell
              me what the position with regard to the tunnel was
              that year? - A. I think it was the same.

         Q.   Can you remember whether the side entrances to the
              terraces, pens 1 and 2, you know down the south side,
              and pen 7, were obstructed in any way in 1988? - A. I
              don't think so, no.

         Q.   You do not think so? - A. No.

         Q.   You have no recollection of any barriers      or anything
               of that sort? - A. No.

         Q.   Have you ever seen the tunnel barriered off? - A. I
              can't remember seeing it barriered.

         Q.   I am not talking about a semi-final;  I am talking
              about any match.  Have you ever seen the tunnel
              barriered off? - A. No.

              Have you ever seen the side entries barriered off? -
              A. Yes.
                                I. MARSH


Tell me a little bit about what happens in those
circumstances? - A. You just put barriers across and
stop people going round the sides.

Would that be done to stop people going round the
sides, just the south side, or also towards the north
side, can you remember?   I am interested to know
because you are on the gate, you see, you are on the
inside. - A. Yes.

I want to know what you can remember as to not semi­
final day now, just general? - A. Yes, I think both
sides.

Does that mean that people tend to go down onto the
terracing through the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Do you know which matches that is done, and if you do
not know, please do not answer? - A. Just very little
supported teams.

Little supported teams? - A. Yes.

I see.  I just want to be quite sure about this. You
have told me that you can remember the sides being
barriered off. - A. Yes.

Has it ever happened in your recollection that the
people having been directed towards the tunnel, a
barrier was then put across the tunnel and the side
barriers moved? - A. No.

You do not remember that? - A. No.




                           /Q. You never went
                                                                  18



                                     I. MARSH


Q. You never went on to the terraces that day, did you? -
   A. No.

Q. You    just stayed in your area? - A. Yes.

Q. And although you did not hear the message about Mr. Meadows
   you did eventually open the big gate to let ambulances
   through and so on.  Is that right, or to take people out?
   - A. To take people out, yes.

Q. Can you remember a Land Rover entering?      - A. No.

Q. Did you see a Land Rover as a matter ofinterest?        - A.   I
   c a n 't remember.

Q.     It didn't actually enter the concourse area but I just
      wondered whether you had seen it. Did you hear any Tannoy
      messages? - A. Only right at the end when it said the
      game was abandoned.
Q.    Oh right at the end,   not at this time which we are talking
      about? - A. No.
Q. Did you hear any other loud speaker announcements of any
   sort? - A. No.
Q. Did you hear or see any Police Officers give instructions
   about allowing people in with wrong tickets or without
   tickets? - A. No.  That is nothing to do with us.

Q. I realise that but I am just wondering whether you
   happened to have heard it? - A. No.


                    Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE;

Q.     When you   were asked to come and give evidence at this
      Inquest did you make a statement to somebody? - A. What
      just now you mean or earlier?

Q. In preparation when you were being asked to come? - A.
   No.
 Q. Did somebody take down a statement from you in writing?
    - A. Not today, no.

 Q. At some earlier time did they? - A. Yes, just after it
    had happened, yes.

 Q.   You were asked by the Coroner about the wall moving.
      Now this Gate C is set in a brick built wall, isn't it?
      - A. Yes.
                                                           19



                                     I. MARSH


Q. Well just thinking about it, have you ever said at any
   previous time that the wall was moving or being roc e
   or anything like that? - A. Not as far as I am aware,
   no.
Q. Have you ever heard anybody else say that? - A. No.

Q. There is another gateman called Mr. Bain, isn't there?
   - A. Yes.
Q. Have you ever heard him say that he saw the wall being
   rocked? - A. No.
Q. What about the gate being shaken or moved.     Have you
   ever said anything about that? - A. No.

Q.   Have you ever heard anybody else say that? - A. No.

Q.    Now when the gate was opened and the crowd       came in,you
     have told the jury that stewards were checking    for tickets.
     Have I got that right? You are frowning. When     the gate
     was opened and some people were coming in? - A.   Do you
     mean the last time?

Q. That is right? - A. Yes.

Q. They were? - A. Like an auxiliary turnstile.

Q. How many stewards were checking for tickets? - A. Three.

           MR. PAYNE:   Thank you.


                  Cross-Examined by MISS STEEL:

Q. Mr. Marsh, compared to a normal league game I think there
   were more people coming through turnstiles A-G than usua .
   - A. Yes.
Q. Because on a normal league game more turnstiles serve
   that area whereas at the semi-final some of them were
   being used for the North Stand? - A. I don't know about
   that.
 Q. Now from the number of enquiries that you had outside
    the ground, where to go etc., did you form the view that
    a number of people were unfamiliar with the ground and
    possibly coming for the first time? - A. Yes.

 Q. When you come in through the concourse, whether through
    the turnstiles or a gate, there is a very clear notice
    "Standing" above the tunnel area? - A. There was then,
    yes.
                                                                20



                                      I. MARSH


Q. So is it usual for you to be asked for directions by
   people inside that concourse? - A. Sometimes, yes.

Q. But is it more usual that if they have got standing
   tickets they would go to the area marked "Standing"?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And the two side wings are not marked clearly at all.

         THE CORONER:   That is not a question.

         MISS STEEL:    I am sorry.     Indeed.

         THE CORONER:  I did deal with the marking on the
   one so I don't think you need to do that.  I don't mind
   you asking about the marking on the other if you wish.
   I don't think there is any controversy about it.

         MISS STEEL:    No, indeed.

Q. Can I turn to the semi-final in 1988.          You were on the
   same duty then? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall any time when people were stopped going
   down the tunnel and redirected to the side wings? - A.
   I can't remember it, no.

Q. Can you remember that happening on any occasion? - A. No.

Q. Now did you attend the briefing at 11.30 that morning?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And that briefing was given by the Police, was it? - A. Yes.

Q. Did that cover your specific duties or merely emergency
   procedures? - A. Both.

Q. Now you have seen the video? - A. Yes.

Q. On the video I think there appears one steward walking
   across towards the turnstiles just before Gate C is
   opened.  That would not be you, would it? - A. I don't
   know.

Q. And later there are two stewards seen by Gate C itself.
   One of those would be you, would it? - A. Well I could
   not say.

Q. At that time how many Stewards or Policemen approximately
   would there be in that concourse area? - A. Possibly
   about 20 stewards.  There are not many Police though
   because they were round the other side as well so I can't
   say.
                                 I. MARSH


About 20 stewards between the turnstiles and the tunnel?
- A. No, on the bottom of the stairs and the gates.

About how many would there be in the area on the flat?
- A. Well there would be those many, yes, because they
stand at the bottom of the stairs.

      THE CORONER:  I   think, Miss Steel, it is not an
improper question but   it is very difficult for him to
answer and I think it   would be perhaps if I suggest:
could you ask him how   many he saw rather than how many
were there?

      MISS STEEL:   Certainly.    He would not know exactly..

How many did you see can you remember? - A. What, Stewards
or everybody?

Well let's start with Stewards.  How many Stewards did
you see in that open area? - A. Probably about 13/14.

Were any of them directing people where to go? - A. No.

About how many Policemen did you see? - A. I have no idea.

And were any of them directing people where to go? - A.
As far as I am aware, no.


            Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLE:

Mr. Marsh, can I just deal with the sequence.  You have
described three openings of Gate C in which people came
in. The first one was when a fan was ejected and about
40, perhaps a few more came in? - A. Yes.

The second one was what you described as the main opening
and the third one was when it was opened partially and
then the Stewards checked the tickets? - A. Yes.

This may sound obvious.  I don't want there to be any
mistake about it. When the Police opened Gate C fully,
the main opening, how did those fans come in. How would
you describe it. Were they walking slowly? Were they
rushing in? - A. They seemed to be walking in an orderly
fashion.

How many were coming in, lots? - A. Yes.

Was there any chance you could have checked those tickets?
- A. No.

Are you positive about that? - A. Certain.
                                I. MARSH



Just on where Stewards were behind Turnstiles A-G.  Now
I appreciate you would not have known the numbers but
do you know roughly where those Stewards are? - A. Yes,
they are at the bottom of the stairs.

Do you know what their job is? - A. To check tickets
going upstairs.

That is up to the seated area, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Is there one also I think on the gate between, sorry
on the gate and the wall that runs between the turnstile?
- A. I don't know whether there was anybody on that day,
no.
Would there be   Stewards on the other gates,   Band Gate A,
like you? - A.   Yes.
Is that the normal deployment of Stewards, is that normally
where you find them? - A. Yes.

Do you ever have Stewards deployed near     the tunnel to
direct people? - A. No.
And in all your experience you have never seen a Steward
there? - A. No.
So when you were answering questions from the lady just
here, whether you saw Stewards directing, you would never
have expected to see Stewards directing.  Is that fair?
- A. Yes.
In relation to the briefing do you remember the briefing
you had on the day.  Was that the briefing that was held
in the West Stand? - A. Yes.

And were all the Stewards for that area present at that
time as far as you could tell? - A. I assume so, yes.

Do you remember, you said it was a Police Officer who
gave the briefing, do you remember whether he was an
Officer you recognised before? Can you remember what
he looked like? If you can't .... A. I can't remember
who it was, no.  I have seen him before though but I
don't know who it was.

 You have seen him before.  Do you know whether he was
 a senior Officer? - A. A senior Officer, yes.

 So there was at least one Officer that you recognised
 as having been there before on duty at that end of the
 ground? - A. Yes.
                               I. MARSH


Just to get the picture of what you could see through
the turnstiles.  The learned Coroner used the word
people getting "squashed" in there and you agreed with
that.  Is that a fair description of what was happening
when the crowd was really dense outside? - A. Yes.

So really your impression was one of intense pressure
against those turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Just one final question.  When the gate was opened for    ■


the last time and you only opened it a fraction, I think
you may have said, how many people do you remember coming
through at that stage? - A. There wasn't many.

And the three Stewards you said were there, were they
the gatemen? - A. Yes.
      MR. CATCHPOLE:   Thank you very much indeed.


             Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Mr. Marsh, were your instructions to open the exit
in the event of an emergency in the ground only? - A. Yes.

It would not apply to an emergency outside the ground?
- A. Not normally, no.
Have fans been constantly ejected through Gate C on a
normal matchday? - A. They are ejected, yes.

How do they slip through the net to start with?

      THE CORONER:  I don't think he can answer that.
All he can say is they are ejected.
      MRS. McBRIEN:    But it is being used for that purpose.

You said you thought it was a wise decision to open the
exit gate to let people in. Don't you think there has
to be a limit on the numbers going into a football stadium.
- A. Yes.
 You were saying that the danger outside was the sheer
 numbers of people so was it wise to allow unlimited numbers
 on to the terraces?
       THE CORONER:  I think you are treading on not only
 thin ice but jolly dangerous ice as well.  He has told
 you he agrees that there are limited numbers.  You are
 now asking him to draw the conclusion from it.  I think
 the jury will draw the conclusions.  It is difficult ror
 him to answer this - I am not knocking you, don't mis­
 understand me - but if you are asking him to draw a
                               I. MARSH


conclusion what value has it? Do you see what I mean?
He has already given you an answer and the jury can make
up their own mind.
      MRS. McBRIEN:   Right, thank you, Mr. Marsh.


                      Bv THE CORONER:

I have got two or three things from the jury which I
will ask you in a moment, but I think I ought to just
deal with this wall because I raised it and I have got
a copy of your statement.  I want you just to look at
this here.  Let me explain to you, as I have already
said once.  We are not trying to catch you in any way.
All we are trying to do is to establish the facts to
the best of our ability and in this case to the best
of your ability.
      Can you just read, I have marked it so you can
find it easily, it is what you said when you gave the
statement right at the beginning. - A * Yes.




                         Q. Now what I want to know
                                                               25



                                                         I.   HARSH




    Q. What I want to know - that is slightly different to
       what you have told me - what I am interested in is
       which, having looked at it now again, which is correct,
       what you told me today or what is written down here? -
       A. I think both of them, because if they had kept
       coming through as they were, there was a danger of a
       wall collapsing.  I didn't see it moving or anything,
       but the sheer number of people, if they had continued
       on, not opening the gate could have caused the wall to
       collapse.

    Q. Read out what is said now that you have explained to me
       and then we will leave it at that. - A. It says:

              "At this time there was a mass of supporters
              outside attempting to gain access and impatient.
              I agree that the gate needed opening as there was
              a danger of walls collapsing and people being
              seriously injured outside.  As the gates opened
              there was a mass of fans surged into the ground
              through them.  The sheer number coming through
              frightened me enough to move away from the gate
              and seek protection by the crash barriers by the
              programme sellers."

         That is what I meant by that.

    0.   And you would stick by that? - A. Yes.

    Q.   And you would stick by your reply today? - A. Yes.

    Q.   What you are saying is this is a deduction from the
         numbers? - A. Yes.

    0. Let me ask you   this - you have half answered it already
       - this is from   the Jury.  When the gate was opened, and
       I think we are   talking about what I call the main
       opening, where   did you stand? - A. At the side of the
       all behind the   crash barriers, about ten yards from the
       gate.

    Q. When this happened, when the gates were opened and
       people were coming in, did you see anybody directing
       the fans to the other entrances to the terraces? - A.
       No.

    Q. Finally, did you see any Police Officers at the
       entrance to the tunnel when the crowds came in,
       directing people in any way? - A. No.

    Q. Did you see them at any time that day directing people
       at the entrance to the tunnel? - A. No.

                                                                  I.   HARSH




          Q. And you didn't see any stewards because you have just
             told us that already.

                    THE CORONER:   Anything else that anybody wants to
               ask arising out of what I have said?

                    MR. PAYNE:   I wonder if I might ask a question
               arising out of those last questions?

                     THE CORONER:   Yes.

                        Further Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

          Q. That was not unusual was it? You have said that you
             did not see the Police directing people to the pens? -
             A. No.

          Q.   That is what you have   said just now? - A. Yes.

          Q.    That was not unusual?  You would not normally see
               Police directing people to the pens, would you? - A.
      D        No*
                    THE CORONER:   Miss Steel, is there anything you
               want to ask? He is going back to Cambridge, so we are
               not bringing him back.

                            Cross-Examined by MISS STEEL

          Q. You have been asked what was usual as far as the Police
             directing was concerned.  The numbers that came in and
             the method of coming in that day, was that unusual? -
             A. Yes.

          Q. I think you said in answer to me earlier that there
             were a number of Police Officers in that area? - A.
             Y es.

                      Further Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLE

          Q. Obviously your job does not involve you going to look
             at the terraces, or go round to see from the pitch side
             - it just doesn t involve that, does it? - A. No.

          Q. There may be evidence that comes before this Inquest
             that in the past there are various different systems
             adopted for filling the pens on the terraces.  That
             involves some degree or some system operated behind
             those terraces in the concourse area. Would you take
             any notice of what people were doing in that concourse
             area, as to how to fill those pens? Would you have
             taken any notice of that? - A. No.

Q. So when you are doing your job on Gate C what do you
   normally concentrate on, on any match day? - A. Just
   opening them and letting people in, club officials.

Q. You concentrate on doing your job properly? - A. Yes.

Q. Thank you very much.

         THE CORONER:    Does anybody else want to ask him
   any questions?    It sounds like an auction, but it is
   not!   Mr. Marsh, thank you very much indeed for coming
   from Cambridge.    I appreciate it and wish you all the
   best.

                    (Short Adjournment)

                ANDREW BEST Called (Sworn)

                      By THE CORONER

Q. You are Andrew Best I believe, is that right? - A. That
   is right, yes, sir.

Q. P.C. 1715? - A. Yes.

Q. I want to turn to 15th April, 1989, and you were
   detailed, I think, to work on the A-G turnstiles at
   Leppings Lane, is that right? - A. That is right, yes,
   sir.

Q. Can you remember which serial you were in? - a. Number
   16.

Q. In fact, you were positioned at the turnstile which was
   nearest the barrier? - A. That is right, sir, yes.

Q. Which barrier are we talking about? - A. It is the
   funnel bar.

Q. In other words, G? - A. That is right, yes, sir.

Q. We have already heard from other colleagues of yours,
   but just in two or three sentences tell me what the
   objective of your positioning was? What were you
   supposed to be doing at that point? - A. ensure that
   the fans queue orderly; enter the ground in an orderly
   fashion; to prevent offences; prevent alcohol and other
   prohibited articles being taken into the ground.

Q. The way you do that is mainly by searching? - A. That
   is right, sir, yes.

Q. I think in the beginning that was not a problem because
   there were not enough fans .... - A. As the gates
                                                            28



                                                      A . BEST




     opened at round about 12 o'clock onwards, the fans
     arrived gradually and I think just about every fan was
     searched as they went in.   As it got busier later on
     the searching became more selective until we were
     unable to make any searches at all.

0.    In the initial stages, when you were searching
     everybody, can you remember, and if you can't say so,
     whether you actually found anything of any moment, or
     in fact whether you found anything? - A. Yes, sir.
     There were people on our serial, Police Officers on our
     serial, found alcohol, drugs ....

Q.    Did you find anything? That is  what I am interested
     in. - A. Initially no, sir. As the time approached the
     busy time, people were stopped in possession of
     alcohol.   They were advised they could not take it in
     and many did leave it. Obviously if people refuse to
     hand it over then action was taken, but the people I
     spoke to did surrender it.

Q. So they either had to drink it up or leave it outside?
   - A. Preferably leave it outside, sir.

Q. I think certainly in the initial stages everybody was
   very good humoured and it was quite a pleasant day,
   wasn't it? - A. It was, sir, yes.

Q. Not only for the fans but also for yourselves? - A.
   That is right, yes.

Q.    You said the searching became more selective.  Can you
     say from about what time that would have been? - A. I
     think from about 2 o'clock onwards to search everyone
     would have caused undue delay.   We then obviously pick
     out people that we think may be carrying that type of
     article, and we would search them.

Q.    You have already mentioned that members of the serial
     did find various prohibited articles.   Did that mean
     that when they found something they had to leave their
     post, shall we say? - A. If they arrested someone, sir,
     yes, they would leave their post and go with that
     person through Gate C, round the back inside the
     concourse to the Police room.

Q. Can you remember whether the build up from 2 o'clock
   onwards was gradual or not? - A. It was not gradual in
   the sense that it was a steady, progressive build up.
   There wasn't a mass march on the turnstiles but it was
   very quick from about 2.20 to 2.30/2.40 that the crowd
   did build up.
                                                                  29



                                                          A . BEST




     Q. What did you notice about that crowd at that stage? -
        A. The people at the front who had been there sometime
        queueing, they were fine.  It was the people at the
|J      back that were doing the pushing, they were chanting
        and what have you, which we expect at most games, but
        it was the pushing and the sheer volume of people at
        the back.

     Q. Had you been on this duty before, you yourself? - A. I
        have worked at Hillsborough most weekends.   I do work
        normally at the Penistone Road turnstiles on the far
        end of the ground, but doing the same duties.

     Q. So you can't compare very well previous    . - A. No,
        sir.

     Q. At Leppings Lane? - A. That is right, yes, sir.

     Q. Because the configuration is, of course, different? -
        A. That is right.

J)   Q. The geography I meant.  You said people at the back
        were pushing.  Was that a deduction you made because
        you could see what was happening at the front or was it
        something that you were able to see with your eyes? -
        A. I was able to see it with my eyes and also you could
        feel the pressure as it came to the front.  It would
        come in waves.  It wasn't a gradual pressure increased,
        it would come in waves then relax, and come in waves
        and relax, but each time it would get more intense.

     Q. And could you feel that on yourself? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. You were initially how many yards out from the
        turnstiles when you first started? - A. When I first
        started I would be at the turnstile itself, when the
        people coming to the turnstiles were few.  As the build
        up occurred I would move perhaps two or three yards
        away from the actual wall, from the turnstile.




G                    /Q. Were you able to
                                                            A. BEST



Q.   Were you able to maintain that position? - A. No.

Q.   Where did you finish up at   the end? -A. Pressed up
     against the wall.

Q. At that stage did you say that you could not do any
   effective searching at all any more? - A. I was neither
   use nor ornament there.    I was just squashed up against
   the wall.   It was no good trying to convince the people
   near to me to stop pushing because they were being pushed
   by the people at the back.    The other officers on the
   Serial managed to get through the turnstiles and come out
   through Gate C.   I managed to go underneath the barrier
   to the side of me out of the crush.

Q. Where did you head for at point? - A. I was up and down
   on the barrier, basically.   Walking up and down trying
   to convince people to stop pushing.

Q. Did you actually ask them to stop pushing? - A. Oh, yes.

Q. Were the people you spoke when you said, "Stop pushing,"
   in fact capable of responding to you?   You have already
   said that people right at the front couldn't respond. -
   A. That's right, people at the front couldn't, no.

Q. What I am interested in is: were the people who you were
   talking to able to respond or were they already
   themselves in a situation where they couldn't do anything
   about it, whether they wished to or not? - A. As you
   said, the people at the front couldn't, no, but the
   people at the back they could have, but they didn't.

0. You spoke to those people? - A. Oh, yes.

Q. What response did you get?    What was your feeling or ^
   impression with regard to those people?    Not "feeling",
   that's the wrong word.   What did you observe about them?
   - A. A lot had been drinking.    I think it was
   approaching the kick-off time.    It was apparent the
   crowd wasn t moving fast enough for their liking and
   their only purpose was to get in for the kick-off.

Q. What makes you say they were drinking?   What evidence
   have you got? - A. Some were still drinking from cans.
   There were numerous cans on the floor.  Some people were
   actually drunk, staggering about.   It was obvious they
   had been drinking.

Q. Did you see any without tickets?   If you didn't, don't
   guess.   I just want to know whether you yourself
   established it. - A. I know people did turn up at the
   turnstile with no ticket.   I noticed mainly at the early
                                                           31

     stages where they would approach and try and pay for a
     ticket or they would try and offer money to get in or
     they would try and argue that they should be allowed in.
     Many appeared with the wrong ticket, the ticket for the
     Nottingham Forest end, and tried to get in.

Q. What happened to the ones that came with the Nottingham
   Forest Kop tickets? - A. In the early stages they were
   allowed through.   I got the impression in the later
   stages when the crush started that they were refusing
   them and that helped with the slowing down of the people
   going through the turnstiles.

Q. Who authorised - as far as you know, and if you don't
   know I don't want you to guess - who authorised the Kop
   tickets going through? - A. At the turnstile I was stood
   at, nearest the barrier, the first gentleman who came
   with the wrong ticket, he was arguing with the turnstile
   operator and he was then told from a person inside the
   ground to let him through and after that they were all,
   as far as I was aware, let through.

0.   Did you see who the person was on the inside of the
     ground? - A. It was a steward with a tabard on.

Q. You are quite sure about that? - A. I am positive.

0. The reason why I ask is because we have heard from the
   turnstile operator twice, maybe three times, and he is
   positive that it was a police officer on the outside who
   authorised that? - A. Yes, I was aware of that.

0.    How certain  are you that in fact the authority came from
     the inside? - A.The turnstile I was    stood at, it
     defiriitely came from the inside.    The steward on the
     inside said, "It's OK letting them through."     Whether he
     had been told by somebody earlier I don't know, but at
     that turnstile where I was.

Q. Did you hear any police officer authorise turnstile
   operators in general terms to allow Kop people to come
   through? - A. No.

Q. With the pressure on the turnstiles which you have
   mentioned, was it in fact a practical proposition to send
   people back out? - A. It was only adding to the build up
   because there was nowhere for them to go.   They were
   crushed up against the turnstiles and there was no...

Q. Did you see any of them actually exit out of the
   turnstile towards you, towards the Leppings Lane end? -
   A. I can't remember anybody getting out.

Q. Would it be fair to say that you saw people who were
   distressed? - A. Yes.   There were two particular ones.
   There were two children where the funnel bar was at the
   same height as their neck and they were being pushed up
   against that.   The adults with them couldn't push back
   to let their heads out so with a little help from us we
   managed to get the kids out on to our side of the
   barrier.

Q. You brought them to your side, to the River Don side? -
   A. That's right, yes, and there was one from the middle
   who was carried out, who was passed overhead.

Q. Did you see whether people were joining just from the
   back or whether they were also joining from the sides? -
   A. There were numerous people - again, this drunken rowdy
   element who weren't happy at the speed they were going
   through and they were corning straight down the side of
   the barrier into the front.

Q. Do you mean they were ducking under the barriers? - A.
   Yes, or they were attempting to. This caused some
   scuffle in between those people, us and the people who
   were already in the queue.   Obviously they were already
   crushed and they had been waiting there some time and
   these people were trying to push in at the front to get
   through.

Q. Was this a concerted effort or was it just the odd
   youngster? - A. They all arrived together, but whether
   there was an organised element I don't know.

Q. We are not talking about hundreds coming underneath the
   barrier, are we? - A. No, there would be thirty or forty
   stood about, but at any one time there would be perhaps
   three or four trying to get through.

Q. You were involved with one particular person? - A. That's
   right.

Q. I know you know his name but there is no point in
   mentioning it.   Just describe to me how that affected
   you? - A. Well, he was so drunk he had no idea where he
   was, to be honest.    He had a blind desire to get through
   the turnstiles.    He had been pulled out two or three
   times by myself.    He had been pushed out by people at
   the front of the queue on numerous occasions.    For his
   own safety, he had been assaulted two or three times by
   people at the front as he tried to get through, I had to
   arrest him.

Q. Did that mean you then had to go away from the scene? -
   A. That's right.  I took him back round through Gate C at
   the side.

Q. So he and you disappeared from Leppings Lane? - A. That's
   right.

0. Did you manage to take him on his own or did you have to
   get an officer to accompany you? - A. Normally there are
   two of us who take a prisoner back but the situation was
   such outside that obviously more police were required
   there.   This man was no trouble.   He wasn't violent at
   all.   He was just so drunk he had no idea what he was
   doing.

0. You took him down to the police room which was on the
   other side of the ground? - A. That's right, yes, under
   the North Stand.

Q. Can you remember at the point when you effected this
   arrest, had Gate C been opened yet? - A. From where I was
   stood, sir, I couldn't tell.   It was opened for me to go
   through and I went through quite easily without people
   trying to push.

0. So you and your prisoner managed to get through? - A.
   Yes.

0. You didn't have crowds going through with you? - A. No.

Q. Would I be right in thinking that at that point there
   were still substantial numbers outside? - A. Oh, yes.

Q. You then went and dealt with the case.   Have you any
   idea what time that was? - A. I think it was about 2.40.

0. Having finished with the procedures do you know
   approximately what time you finished in the police room
   or detention room? - A. At about five past/ten past
   three.

Q. So you were away then during that period from Leppings
   Lane? - A. Yes.

0. Had you in the police room had any intimation of any
   problems? -A. I hadn't a radio myself.   I don't think
   anybody else in the police room had a radio.^  It was the
   prisoner reception room.   It wasn't the police control
   room.

Q. Yes, I understand. - A. It was where the prisoners go.
   I don't think there was a radio there and I certainly
   wasn't aware of what was happening in the terracing.

Q. You left and I think you were intending to return to
   Leppings Lane to join your Serial? - A. That's right.

Q. If all had been well you would then presumably have gone
   off to have a meal or something? - A. No, my meal was
   taken at half past eleven after the briefing.   My next
   duty was to go to the West Stand with the Liverpool
   supporters in the seating area.

Q. So you wanted to rejoin your Serial and you would have
   gone off to do that? - A. Yes.

Q. Which way did you go round to... - A. Back under the
   North Stand, under the walkway.

Q. At the back? - A. That's right.

Q. So you didn't go on to the pitch side? - A. No.

0. So you didn't know what was going on on the pitch? - A.
   That's right.

0. Have a look at the model.   Perhaps you can turn round
   and show us which way you came. - A. I went with the
   prisoner through Gate C there and then round back under
   the North Stand and then came back the same way, round
   the concourse and then back through the gate there.

0. So you came through that little gateway in the wall and
   into the concourse area, is that right? - A. Yes, sir.

0. On your way back? -A. Yes, sir.

Q. So now you were in the concourse area, is that right? -
   A. Yes, sir.

0. Did you at that point know what was happening on the
   pitch? - A. On the pitch, no.

Q. Did you know whether the game was in progress or not? -
   A. I had no idea, sir.

0. What met your eyes briefly in the concourse area? - A.
   When I came back there were police officers and members
   of the public carrying people from the back of the tunnel
   out through Gate C to the service road area.   There were
   two or three people struggling to carry this particular
   chap who was quite heavy.   I took hold of him, helped to
   carry him down to the service road outside Gate C.

Q. Out through Gate C and along by the River Don there? - A.
   That's right, sir.

Q. Was an ambulance already in situ at that time? - A. I can
   remember an ambulance man, but I can't remember the
   ambulance, where it was.   Certainly there was an
   ambulance man there.

Q. However, you don't remember the vehicle as such? - A. I
   couldn't remember where it was parked, sir, no.

Q. Of course, he may have been there without a vehicle? - A.
   That's right.   I can remember the ambulance man because
   I remember speaking to him, but not the vehicle.

           Q.   When you came out to the River Don area, were there
                people already lying there? - A. There were, yes.

           Q.   Do you know about how many there were? - A. In the
       B        confusion, sir, no, I couldn't tell you.

           Q.   But there were some? - A. Yes, more   than a dozen.

           Q.   Really?   As many as that? - A. Yes.   At that stage,
                 sir, I was under the impression that they were
                 receiving medical attention.   I had certainly no idea
                 of any fatalities at that stage.   It was only when I
                 returned after bringing another person out when I
                 asked as to the well-being of this first person that I
                was told that he had died, and I looked at where he
                was and then there were several laid there and they
                were all covered.    That is when I realised that people
                 had died.

           Q.   When you took him out, you did not have the impression
                 that he was dead as far as you were concerned? - A.
                 No.
       D
           Q.   How firm was that impression, as a matter of interest?
                - A. It is not something you expect at a football
                match.  It never entered my head that somebody would
                be killed at a football match.

           Q.   Were you saying that the ambulanceman was actually in
                 the area where you laid this man down? - A. That is
                 right, yes.  The first man we brought out was laid
                down.   There were some police officers giving first-
                 aid.  Somebody came straight away to aittend to him. I
                went back towards the tunnel to help other people
                 coming out.

           Q.   Then you came back? - A. I asked where he was.  He had
                 been moved from where I had put him and I was told
                 that he was dead.

           Q.   In fact, I think you helped to carry one or two
                 others? - A. Yes, that is right.

           Q.   Did you go right down onto the terracing? - A. No sir.

           Q.   Where did you pick them up from? - A. They were on
                 their way out of the tunnel.  There were more people
                 coming out than going in, so I was assisting the
                 people coming out.

           Q.   So you went up to the tunnel entrance? - A. Yes sir.

           Q.   And then assisted? - A. I never got as far as the
                 actual terracing.

           Q.   So you have no idea what happened down there? - A. No
                sir.

                           Cross-Examined by MR. HALE:
       B        Officer, on the question of being able to control or
                arrest or guide a man, you said that the man who was
                extremely drunk was no trouble at all to you? - A. To
                me personally, sir, no.

                Would a man who had only had two pints, say, be easier
                or more difficult to control?

                     THE CORONER:   I do not think he can say that.

                     MR. HALE:  Have you experience of arresting
                people who are not fully drunk? - A. It depends on the
                person.  This man was so drunk he couldn't control his
                limbs properly.

           Q.   Have you arrested people before who have had some
                drink but were not that drunk? - A. At that game?
       D        I do not mean on that day, I mean at any time in your
           Q.
                career? - A. Yes.

           Q.   Is such a person more difficult or easier to arrest
                than the man who is fully drunk? - A. It depends on
                the person.

                Suppose it was the same person exactly and you managed
                to catch him a little earlier before he had become
                fully drunk? - A. Again, sir, I can't answer that.

                     MR. HALE: It is too hypothetical, all right, I
                accept that.


                           Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

                Did you notice any particular cause of hold-ups at the
                turnstiles? - A. I think it was the sheer weight of
                people.  If a queue is orderly and in a straight line,
                they can go through quite quickly.  They hand over
                their ticket.  The pressure of people on the turnstile
                was such that people were having to struggle to fight
                free to actually get through the opening.  They were
                passing through the turnstile far more slowly than
                they would in normal circumstances.

                          Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING:

           Q.   Is it a statement, so far as you are concerned,
                officer, of the obvious that if people stand in an
                                  A. BEST


orderly queue they get through that much more quickly?
- A. Yes sir, they would have gone through far more
quickly and I think the problem outside would have
resolved itself and hence the problem inside would
also probably not have occurred.

Your clear sight was that you could actually see
people pushing at the rear? - A. Yes, from the back,
sir.

Having extricated yourself from being crushed up
against the wall yourself, you actually went to the
same sort of area where you had seen people pushing? -
A. Yes sir.

And saw people pushing? - A. Yes sir.

And asked them not to push? - A. Yes.

Although I use the words fairly gently today, asked
them not to push, was there any doubt in the way in
which you were talking to the crowd as to what you
wanted them to do? - A. Yes, I mean I was explaining
that people were in difficulty at the front and that
somebody would get hurt, but they were after getting
into the ground for 3 o'clock.

Your evidence is, in answer to the learned Coroner,
that those people that you spoke to could have
responded to your requests not to push? - A. Yes.

And that they chose not to do so? - A. Yes sir.

     MR. PAYNE:   I have no other questions,   sir.

          Cross-Examined by MISS STEEL:

May I follow that   last point.At the time you came
out you were not in the crowd itself? - A. Yes.

All the officers that were on that serial were outside
the crowd itself,   outside the barriers? - A. I know
the other members   of the same serial as me had gone
through the turnstiles, and there were people I
recognised of that serial that were outside with me,
yes.

Were you the only officer in that serial to arrest
somebody that day? - A. No, madam, no.

So the serial would be depleted by people who had
arrested people and were away for that reason, is that
right? - A. That is right, yes.
H&                                                               39

              Can you remember approximately how many of your serial
              were outside on the river side of the funnel barrier?
              - A. Half-a-dozen or so.

     B        Now when you say you asked people at the back to move
              back, how far did you have to walk away from the
              turnstiles before you found people with sufficient
              room to move back? - A. The people I spoke to were at
              the end of the funnel bar, pushing into it.  There
              were people behind them but there was space to relax
              there, although they themselves were surrounded by
              other people.

              So if we look at the plan there, that dotted line, is
              that the funnel bar on that plan? - A. That is right,
              yes.

                   THE CORONER: Would it be easier if you put the
              plan up on the screen, rather than the model?

                   MISS STEEL:   I think it probably would, sir, yes.

     D             THE CORONER: We have got one, so let us put it
              up.   Just look at it and make sure you are happy with
              it - 274.   It is not working, and in that case we may
              be stuck.   Open that folder, 274, and everybody knows
              this plan.  We will lend you our copy, Miss Steel.
              You know which plan it is, do you not, you have seen
              it? - A. Yes.

                    MISS STEEL: I have got it now, thank you very
              much.
              So if we are all looking at 274, I think you were
              pointing, were you not, there is a line which runs
              parallel with the river which contains Cate C? - A.
              Yes.

              And from the point of the turnstiles towards the
              Leppings Lane entrance, that extends for some
              distance? - A. That is right, yes.

         Q.   That is the funnel barrier that you are talking about?
              - A. Yes.

         Q.   So at the point when you went to ask people to move
              back, am I right that you had to go to the end of that
              funnel barrier before there was space to move people
              back? - A. Yes.

              Does it follow from that that there was a tightly
              packed crowd the whole length of the funnel barrier? -
              A. Yes, and beyond.  The crowd extended well into
              Leppings Lane, but the crush was only inside that bar.

Q.   Can we get an idea of time.  You went back and pulled
     people away from your side of the funnel bar, stopping
     them going into the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q.   How long were you doing that before you arrested the
      man you did arrest? - A. 10 or 15 minutes.  I pulled
      that man out personally 2 or 3 times myself.

Q.   You think you arrested him    at about 2.40? - A. About
      that, yes.

Q.   So that when you went to the end of the barrier to ask
     people to move back, that would be some time before
     half-past 2, 10 or 15 minutes, 2.25/2.30? - A. Well,
     it was up to 2.40 when I arrested that man, I had been
     going up and down the barrier.

Q.   You had been going up and down? - A. Yes.

Q.   But about half-past 2, would it be about that    packed
      at that stage? - A. That is when the problems   began,
      yes.

Q.   At that time in the solid crush you were taking
      children out through the barrier, those two children?
      - A. The two at the front, yes, and one over the top.

Q.   When you are normally on duty at the Penistone Road
      end, there is a wider area there and more turnstiles,
      are thejre not? - A. Yes, there are.

Q.   So I should not think, but have you ever seen a crush
      like this at the Penistone Road end? - A. No, never.

Q.   Is it normal or not normal for people for a 3 o'clock
      kick-off to come between 2.20 and 2.40? - A. Yes.

Q.   I phrased the question wrongly.   Is that a usual
      occurrence? - A. It is a usual occurrence, yes.

Q.   The difference being that at Penistone Road they would
      be able to go in fairly easily compared to Leppings
      Lane where there are fewer turnstiles?

          MR. CATCHP0LE:  Sir, I hesitate to rise.  That is
     actually asking the witness to express an opinion.

           MISS STEEL: Yes,    I withdraw it.
Q.   Turning to queues, part    of your instructions, I think,
     were to maintain order    and ensure orderly queues were
      formed, is that right?   - A. Yes.

Q.   At any time was there an orderly queue going to each
      turnstile in Leppings Lane? - A. Yes. When the
                                                        41




                                       A. BEST


     turnstiles opened at 12 o'clock, the supporters turned
     up in dribs and drabs and went straight through.  As
     time approached 2 o'clockish orderly queues would be
     formed, and there was no problem then.

Q.   Can you give any idea as to approximately when the
      number of people coming prevented orderly queues? - A.
      Between 2 and half-past.

Q.   Was it any part of your instructions to deal with the
      situation beyond the funnel barrier? - A. No.

Q.   Can I deal, with your permission, sir, in relation to.
      the man that you helped to carry out, the first man
      that you saw. You took him out? - A. From the tunnel?

Q.   From the tunnel.   I am now going back.  You took him
      out from the tunnel and put him into the care of
      someone? - A. Yes.

Q.   Can you recall whether that was the ambulanceman or a
      police officer? - A. Offhand, I can't remember, no.  I
      put him down and someone came to give him first-aid.

Q.   Can you give any idea as to how long it was before you
     brought the next individual out? - A. Five minutes at
      the most.

Q.   Was it on that occasion that you were told that he had
      sadly died? - A. Yes.

Q.   At that time were you aware of any doctor being
      present amongst those giving first-aid?

          THE CORONER:   What is that going to do as far as
     enabling the Jury to establish how the deceased came
     by their death?




                                 /MISS STEEL:    It is not.

                                     A. BEST


        MISS STEEL:   It isn't sir and I would ask permission
  if I might on this.   There is a specific point which is
  raised by the family of this particular individual.

        THE CORONER:  I am very conscious of this and
  that is why in fact I did explore the matter with this
  witness but we are not going to go down that road and
  I have explained it - you weren't here - but I have
  explained why the time of death certification, which is
  what you are driving at I know, is not in fact relevant
  to the cause of death.

        MISS STEEL:  I wonder sir if I might, only with
  your permission, ask one more question because the doctor,
  who certified death in this case some time after 4 o'clock

        THE CORONER:  Yes, that is right, about 10-past-4
  he told us.  I think it was 10-past-4, wasn't it. We can
  look it up. Anyway it was well after 4 anyway.

        MISS STEEL:  If I can establish from the point of
  view of the relatives as to whether or not that particular
  individual was around at that time, that particular doctor
  was around that area where these individuals were.  That
  was the line of my questioning.

        THE CORONER:  That is fair. Miss Steel, the problem
  is that if I allow it on this witness then what is the
  logic for not allowing it on everybody and I can't see
  any point as far as the Inquest is concerned but I know
  that the family are very anxious about this matter, so
  by all means ask that question.

        MISS STEEL:     I am very grateful to you.

Q. Do you recall seeing around in the area behind the tunnel
   a doctor who was a Liverpool supporter? - A. Yes, I do.

Q. His name was Dr. John Ashton.      Did you know his name?
   - A. I didn't, no.

Q. Did you see that particular gentleman at the place by the
   river where you had taken the injured man? - A. Yes, he
   was attending to the people there.

         MISS STEEL:    Thank you.

         THE CORONER:    It was 16.25 actually.    I got the
   time wrong.


               Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLE:

Q. Can I just go back to the evidence of the turnstile
                                       A. BEST


     operator and him letting in people with Kop tickets.
     You said you were aware that the turnstile operator had
     himself given evidence that he got an instruction from
     the Police Officer.  Were you aware that other turnstile
     operators on that bank of turnstiles have also given
     evidence they had been instructed by a Police Officer,
     not necessarily the same one.  Obviously the evidence
     you can give is only what you saw and heard on that
     day? - A. That is right.

Q. You have no doubt taken enough statements in your time
   in the Police Force to know there can be differences of
   opinion, honest differences of opinion between people
   who saw the same event? - A. Yes, there can.

Q. Do you remember giving evidence to the Taylor Inquiry?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Some time ago now.   Sir, perhaps I could just refer very
   briefly, it is page 101 of the transcript.   What I
   propose to do Officer, unless I am told the contrary
   is to read you this.   I don't want you to necessarily
   agree with it until you have listened to what is said?
   - A. Right.
              THE CORONER: Mr. Catchpole, I think it is preferable
        if you let him have a look at it first of all and see
        whether he accepts it.  If he accepts it then I think
        it is in order to read it but if he does not accept it
        then we have got to deal with it.

             MR. CATCHPOLE:     It is page 101.

              THE CORONER:    The whole of it?

              MR.   CATCHPOLE:  No, it is really from 'F'. The
        passage I   am interested in is 'H' but to give the full
        flavour I   think Mr. Best ought to read it from 'F'
        down.  It   is the answer given at the bottom of the page.

Q.            THE CORONER:  Take your time and read it. - A.
        Sorry which part is it?

q   .         MR. CATCHPOLE:  If you read from 'F' down.  It
        is really your answer given at letter 'H' that I was
        interested in. — A. Yes, I would agree with that.

Q. You would agree with that? - A. Yes.

Q. Perhaps you can just read? - A. The question was asked:
   "Were you aware whether the turnstile operators were   ^
   doing that on their own initiative or on instructions?
   I answered:  "It was certainly decisions made by them
   and not by us. The Stewards were behind them and aware.
   Whether they were ordering the turnstile operators or
   not I don't know."
                              A. BEST


And this is where I want to get the proper flavour of
your evidence.  Your evidence as far as that is concerned
is that as far as you knew no one had given them an
order, you could not say either way. What you did know
was that the turnstile operators were letting in people
with Kop tickets? - A. That is right, yes, and the
Stewards behind them.

And that they knew about it? - A. Yes.

So when you gave the evidence earlier on today that you
were positive about a Steward giving an order, is it
right to say what you meant was that you were positive
the Stewards on the other side were aware that Kop tickets
were being let through? - A. I never read the order made.
The Steward did say that "It is all right, they are
allowing them through." That was to me personally.

That was to you personally? - A. Yes, but who made the
decision I don't know.

      MR. CATCHPOLE:   Thank you very much.


            Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Mr. Best, is it usual to search selectively later in the
day at any match? - A. Yes.

So would you agree that people may come later to avoid
being searched? - A. I don't know. We search selectively
not due to the volume but we are not going to search an
old man with his grandson or a husband and wife coming
into the ground.   There are particular types of supporters
that we do search.   They would get searched selectively
throughout the build-up to the game.

But you said earlier on in the day you   search almost
everybody, don't you? - A. Yes.

Whether it is an old man or not? - A. Perhaps that is
misleading.  We would search everybody that fell into
that category to be searched.

Don't you think the ones who arrive earlier are less
likely to cause trouble than the later ones though? -
A. They are, yes.

So there is more reason why they should be searched
surely? - A. I am sorry?

Isn't there more reason for them to search the later
people than the earlier ones? - A. It does not normally
come to the time of when they arrive. We were restricted
                                                          45


                                    A. BEST


     in searching people later in the afternoon due to the
     volume of people as the crush built up in the area outside
     the turnstiles.  We could not search anybody although there
     were people there that we would have normally searched we
     could not search them at all.

           MRS. McBRIEN:   Right, thank you.


                  Cross-Examined by MR. RUSSELL:

Q. Officer, can I just clarify one part of your evidence
   dealing with the time which you turned to the concourse
   area having finished the documentation of a person whom
   you had arrested? - A. Yes.

Q. As I understand your evidence you put that time between
   5 and 10-past-3? - A. There or thereabouts, yes sir.

Q. And by then the evacuation of fans from the terracing
   via the tunnel was in progress? - A. Yes, there were
   numerous people outside on the concourse obviously
   shaken, obviously I had no idea why at the time and
   Police Officers and other supporters were helping to
   carry people out.

Q. Your first action on arriving on that scene at the time
   you have estimated was to assist carrying one man.  Is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q. And can you please help me with this, the position
   to which you helped carry that man. Where was it? - A.
   We came down the tunnel, out of the tunnel entrance,
   across the concourse, out of Gate C, out of the gate
   we would turn slightly left where the people were
   receiving first aid on the little lane outside.

Q. Looking at 274, which is the plan on the screen I hope
   in front of you, we can see Gate C marked there? - A. Yes.

Q.    We can see the word "embankment" written? - A. Yes, it
     would be about there.

Q.   So in that part, just outside Gate C and turning left
     as if going down towards the South Stand? - A. That is
     right, yes.

Q. And when you carried the first or assisted in the first
   person that you helped carry down to that end, he was
   not the first person to arrive in that area? - A. No,
   there were numerous people on the ground, some in
   difficulty, some being attended to.  Some were sat up.
   At that stage I had no idea that anybody had died.
                               A. BEST


And that is the number that you now estimate is about a
dozen? - A. Yes, at least that.

      MR. RUSSELL:   Thank you very much.


                     Bv THE CORONER:

Can I just ask you something, this comes from the jury.
What the jury are interested in is this: when you got
into the concourse area were there many fans who weren't
injured or who weren't helping who were coming out of
the tunnel at that point.  Can you remember? - A. The
fans, there were many stood about that were obviously
distressed.  Some were assisting each other.  I can
only recollect the ones that were helping to carry people
out.

What they are interested in is whether the majority of
the fans were still on the terraces or whether they were
in the concourse area. Where were they? I am not asking
you to give me an exact number but how many fans would
you say were in that concourse area at the time? - A.
In the concourse area I could not be sure but outside
on the lane there were a lot that were stood about that
were abusing the ambulanceman and Police Officers.

When you say "a lot" do you mean 50, 100, 500? - A. It
was a confined area but there was certainly a crowd
on the edge of the area that was being used to give first
aid.

So you can't say how many there might have been? - A. I
could not say how many.

      THE CORONER:  Do you want me to pursue that?   I
don't think we are going to get very much further.   A
difficult question actually.

      Now, Miss Steel, I think you have got something
else have you or not? Yes, go ahead.


               Re-Examined by MISS STEEL:

Can I take you back to the embankment area.  You say
that there were some people there who were clearly
still alive, they were sitting up? - A. Yes.

And receiving attention.  Were there some people there
who were having mouth-to-mouth or resuscitation.  Did
you see anybody there being treated in that way? - A.
There were certainly people lying down who were being
treated.  I can't visually recollect anybody receiving
mouth-to-mouth.

                                      A. BEST


Q. Now I know it is difficult to think back.   You recall
   seeing one doctor there. Dr. Ashton? - A.I saw one man
   who said he was a doctor.  I did not     know hisname at
   the time.

Q. Was he there on the embankment when you took the first
   man out or was he in the concourse then? - A. I didn't
   notice him when I took the first man out.   It was after
   I had helped two or three people come out that I noticed
   him there giving attention to people.

Q. So that when you first took people out there were Police
   first aiders there, were there? - A. Police Officers,
   yes .

Q. And one Ambulanceman that you saw? - A. I saw one yes,
   definitely.

Q. And some minutes later, you say it would be about five
   or ten minutes going back and taking the next person out?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Was it the next person you took out or two after, three
   after or can't you remember that you first saw the
   doctor? - A. I can't remember.  I remember being out there
   with the people and this chap was organising attention
   to be given to people, organising Police Officers and
   supporters how to administer first aid to people.

Q. I suppose everybody was trying to help? - A. Yes.

Q. But it was not immediately that the doctor was there
   but it was a little while after? - A. It was a little
   while after that I noticed him.  He may have been there
   all the time, I don't know.

         MISS STEEL:    Thank you.




                       THE CORONER:    Thank you very much indeed.
     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much indeed.  Hiss
Steel I feel for the families in this situation which
is why I have allowed us to deal with Mr. Best in the
way we have done, but I want to say that I treat this
as an exceptional case.  For the reasons which you
yourself also recognise, I have got to draw the line
somewhere and I have got to draw the line how they came
by their deaths, and whilst it is very interesting and
may be very important, it may be very relevant, it is
not terribly relevant to this Jury.  I want to say that
because I don't want us to start going down a track
where I have to put my foot down and say stop, I am not
going to permit it.

     I do want to draw your attention, I am sure you
have seen it, to the transcript of the evidence of the
person whom you have in mind, and there is quite a bit
about timing and causation and so on in that.  It is
the April/May time.

     MISS STEEL:    Yes.

     THE CORONER:    I am sure you will be aware of it.

     MISS STEEL:   That is so.   I am grateful to you
for allowing me that indulgence.   It was, as you
appreciate, because of the time that elapsed, as in
many cases, until the actual certification.

     THE CORONER:   We will break for lunch then, and
come back at 2 o'clock.

                                 By THE CORONER
     B   Q. You are Malcolm France, is that right? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. Police Sergeant 1829, is that right? - A. Yes.

         Q. You were part of a serial which was initially deputed
            to be away from the ground, I think, that is right,
            isn't it? - A. Yes, sir.

         0. What number was it, can you   remember? -    A. 36.

         Q. You with your serial attended the briefing at the
            stadium at about 10, 10.30, something of that order, is
            that right, on 15tn April, 1989? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q.   Then presumably you had some further individual
              briefings, or you may have given them to your own
              serial.  Were you in charge, I can't remember? - A. I
     D        was in charge of Serial 36, but I was part of asector
              and that sector got a separate briefing by theside  of
              the gymnasium before we were deployed.

         Q.   In principle what were your duties? - A. We were to
              meet special trains at Wadsley Bridge railway station
              from Liverpool and escort the spectators on those
              trains down to the ground.

         Q.   In fact, you made your way to Wadsley Bridge in due
              course, is that right? - A. Yes, we deployed there at
              about half-past-10.

         Q.   When you got to the station I think you discovered that
              there was, in fact, only one special train, is that
              right? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. And you were a bit surprised, I think, at that? - A. I
            was, yes.

         Q. Had you policed the 1988 match, the semi-final? - A.
            Yes, but I was at the other side of the ground, Catch
            Bar Lane end.

         Q. At the Catch Bar Lane end? - A. Yes.

         Q. Still policing Liverpool supporters? - A. No, I was at
            Catch Bar Lane and then the road into the city, past
            the park into the city.

         Q. So your experience in 1988 is quite different from what
            you were doing this year? - A. Yes.  I did police the




     H

                                                      M. FRANCE




     Liverpool/Coventry semi-final and I was at that time on
     duty at the turnstiles in Leppings Lane.

Q. Which year was that, can you remember? - A .     I believe
   that was 1987.

Q. Did you stay up around the station area until the train
   arrived or did you ...? - A. At one time just before
   the train arrived there was a report of a disturbance
   at a trading estate area just up from Wadsley Bridge
   and I did attend there.

Q. Is that where the Gateway store is? - A. Yes, where the
   Gateway supermarket is.

Q. I think by the time you got there whatever had happened
   had sorted itself out, is that right? - A. Yes, there
   was a call that no further assistance was required,
   that the matter had resolved itself.

0. So you went back? - A. Yes.

Q. It was a lovely day, I think we know that already? - A.
   It was, yes, sir.

0. Until the train arrived did anything happen of any
   moment as far as you yourself were concerned? - A.
   Well, we were between the ground and the main coach
   parks on Claywheels Lane for the Liverpool supporters,
   and there were large numbers of Liverpool supporters
   making their way up the hill away from the ground, most
   of them asking where they could get a drink or where
   there was a pub open, because the public houses in the
   immediate vicinity were closed.

Q.   It was, as I say, a warm day? - A. It was, yes.

Q.   How far did you think they would   have to walk to find
     anything? - A. I am not familiar   ....

Q.   You are not a Sheffield man, are   you? - A. I am not     a
     Sheffield man, no, sir.

Q. Forget it then because your guess is probably as good
   as mine.  Is it right that in due course the train
   arrived? - A. It did, yes, sir.

Q. What did you see then?   - A. I think it was in the
   region of about 500 supporters, Liverpool supporters,
   got off the train and   we marshalled them    intoonegroup
   until we got them all   together, and then    escorted them
   towards the ground.
                                               M. FRANCE




I just want to go back to this disturbance which you
were called to.  Did you actually go to the trading
estate? - A. Yes, sir.

You did go to it? - A. Yes.

But it was resolved? - A. The actual disturbance   had
been resolved, yes, just as I got there.

Do you know what time that was, about? - A. It was just
prior to the train coming.  I should imagine about 20-
to, quarter-to-2.

Yes, and were there a lot of supporters there that you
could see? - A. Yes, there were a lot of supporters
sitting on the grass banks at both sides of the
entrance to the small trading estate, and a large
number inside it as well.

So back to the train, okay? - A. Yes, sir.

You thought about 500 or so got off, as a guesstimate?
- A. Yes.

I think you escorted them, together with some mounted
Officers? - A. Yes.

No problems? - A. No problems at all.

You got them to Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.

Again, no problems? - A. No problems at all.

Having got them, they presumably disappeared or most of
them disappeared into the turnstile area and into the
ground? - A. Yes, they went straight to form the queues
at the turnstiles.

What did you do then? - A. Because there were no
special trains - our brief was to go and meet the next
special train and then come back, but because there
were no more special trains we deployed in Leppings
Lane, as an extra public order ....

Where did you take up your personal position? - A. I
was originally in Leppings Lane near the junction with
Vere Road, by the shops there.

This would be about what time, just approximately? - A.
We would get there shortly after 2 o'clock.

How many supporters were around at that time - not the
train contingent. - A. It was busy but no problems at
all, it was quite orderly.
                                                                   52



                                                      M. FRANCE




Q. Did they come and ask you for directions, some of the
   supporters? - A. Yes.

0. What sort of problems were they experiencing? - A. They
   were coming and showing me their tickets and asking me
   which gates they should use to gain access to the
   ground.

Q. Did you know how to direct them? - A. Yes.

Q. They accepted your guidance? - A. Yes.

0. So it would be fair to say that you were not having any
   problems with them at that stage? - A. At that stage,
   no.

Q. Did you also see people who were looking for tickets? -
   A. Yes.

Q. How did you know that that was happening? - A. They
   were approaching the oncoming spectators and running up
   and saying, "Have you got any spares?  Got any spares? '

Q.   You could hear that? - A. Yes.

Q.    Again, I don't want to pin you down to detailed numbers
     but are we talking about large numbers or handfuls? -
     A. I should say personally I heard in about the region
     of 20 spectators doing that.

Q. I think the first that you knew that something was not
   quite right was when somebody came to you and told you
   somebody was hurt, is that right? - A. Yes.

0. Do you know approximately what time that was? - A. It
   would be shortly after half-past-2.

Q.   Was it a spectator who came to you and    said,"There's
     somebody hurt"? - A. Yes.

Q. It was a lady, I think? - A. There was a lady who had
   hurt her leg, yes.

Q. Do you remember which part of      the turnstile area this
   lady was supposed to be in? -      A. Yes, she was in the
   region of the perimeter gates,      the raetal gates, leading
   towards the North Stand, Gate      A.

Q. So your side of the ...? - A.      Yes.

Q. I think you then approached a mounted Officer and said,
   "There is somebody hurt", is that correct? - A. Yes.

Q. That Officer already knew about it? - A. He did, yes.
                                                 M. FRANCE




Did you, in fact, try and help? - A. Yes, I tried to
get through but it had started building up.  It built
up very, very quickly and we could not gain access to
her, but I could see her, she was safe, she was in the
lee of the gate, so she wasn't in any direct trouble
from the crowd.  She had managed to get to one side
from the general surge of the crowd.

So in fact she had managed to put herself into a
relatively safe position? - A. Yes.

You say that you could not actually get through at that
point to her? - A. No, sir.

What happened after that? - A. We then were asked to
form a cordon across the entrance to Leppings Lane
turnstile, to try and prevent spectators going through
and getting onto the back of the crush there.

Was this a cordon of Police Officers, or Police
Officers and mounted Officers? - A. Mainly it was the
Police horses.  We tried to go in the gaps between the
horses.

Do you know ~ I keep on asking you what time it was -
do you know what time that was? - A. I think it might
have been about 20-to-2.  I am sorry about the times
but ....

Was it right across from the shops right up to the
bridge? - A. It came in from the other end, from the
other side ....

     MR. MANNING:   Excuse me interrupting, but the
Witness said 20-to-2.  I am sure he meant 20-to-3.

     THE CORONER:      I am sure he meant 20-to-3:

That is right, isn't it, 20-to-3? - A. That is right,
yes.

     THE CORONER:   I think I read that as 20-to-3, but
thanks for pointing it out:

You were telling me where this cordon as being formed
from? - A. Yes, it came from the bridge side across, to
try and prevent any more people entering the area.



                    /Q. Do you remember
                                                         54




                                                       M. FRANCE



    Q. Do you remember whether it held or not? - A. No, it was
       totally disregarded.   There were people going under the
       bellies of police horses and brushing past.    They tried
B      to tell them to keep back.  The thing that strikes me,
       they didn't look at you.   You couldn't catch their eye.
       It was as though they were avoiding eye to aye contact.
       It was as though you were speaking to them specifically,
       so they would have to do something.   They just
       completely ignored us.   They brushed past us.

    Q. This was on the outside of the perimeter gates? - A. Yes,
       sir.

    Q. What I am interested in is whether the people you have
       just described - you said they rushed past - but did they
       rush past under their own steam, under their own
       volition, or were they propelled through you by pressure
       from behind? - A. In the initial stages they were just
       brushing past us and ignoring us, but the crowd was
       building up behind them and as the crowd really built up
       behind them I should imagine they didn't have much option
D      but to push past use.

    Q. When you formed the cordon in the first instance did you
       manage to create a gap between the cordon and the
       perimeter gates at the rear of the turnstile crowd? Can
       you remember that? - A. It was only momentarily if we
       did.

    Q. Do you remember a Land Rover arriving? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. In relation to the cordon can you place it? Was it
       before, after or about the same time? - A. It was before
       the cordon of police horses was formed.

    Q. Did you hear any public address announcements from that?
       - A. Yes, the public address system on the Land Rover was
       used asking the crowd to keep back away from the
       turnstiles and that if they were more orderly they would
       get in a lot quicker.

    Q. How close to the Land Rover were you yourself, can you
       remember? - A. At one stage I was standing next to it.

    Q. You were quite close to it? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you by chance hear any announcements to the mounted
       Inspector or a message to the mounted officers from the
       loudspeaker system? - A. No, I can't specifically
       remember any, sir.

    0. You did have a radio, but you had difficulty hearing? -
       A. Yes, sir.

                                                     M. FRANCE


Q. Why was that? - A. I had the radio mounted round my neck
   there, and the noise of the crowd was such in that area
   that it was very difficult to hear messages.

Q. Did you hear any messages before kick-off at all? - A.
   Yes, I specifically remember hearing them closing
   Leppings Lane off to traffic and then I heard a message
   that somebody said there was going to be a catastrophe,
   which I related to Leppings Lane, the crush at the
   turnstiles there.

0. Do you know when you heard that?     Again, I realise you
   would not have been standing there   with your watch in
   your hand, but if you could relate   it to something like
   the cordon or the Land Rover? - A.   I think it was shortly
   after the cordon was formed.

Q. You don't know who said that? - A. No, sir.

Q. You just heard it, because you were on talk-through,
   weren't you? - A. Yes.

0. Did you see any gates open? - A. No, sir.

0. Did you notice any increase in pressure at any point in
   time? - A. Yes.  At one point there was a large cheer
   from inside the ground and at that particular point there
   was a very big surge forward from the turnstiles.

Q. Where were you at that point? - A. I was still in
   position outside the metal gate there.

Q. Cordon still in place or had it gone by then? - A. It had
   fragmented quite a bit by then, yes.

Q.   You heard a cheer, I take it? - A. Yes.

Q. You didn't actually know what it was? - A. No, I take it
   that they had actually kicked-off, or something like
   that, because it was very close to three o'clock.

Q. It could have been, of course, the team coming out? - A.
   It could.

Q. If you aren't there you don't know, but you did hear a
   loud cheer? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.    Are you saying there was an increase in the people
     becoming even more anxious to get in at that stage? - A.
     Yes, sir.

0. What happened then?   This was just either at or just
   before kick-off time.   You are still outside the
   perimeter? - A. Yes, suddenly I realised there had been a
                                                         56




                                                       M. FRANCE


     sudden decrease in the pressure of fans there and we were
     just stood there momentarily and then we were called to
     go into the ground to help to assist inside the ground.

0. Which gate did you enter?   How did you get into the
   ground? - A. We got in the ground through Gate A, sir.

Q.    Did you go on to the pitch or did you stay at the back? -
     A. I went to the back of the North Stand and got on to
     the pitch through the first aisle on the North Stand.

Q. When you first exited on to the pitch, when you first got
   out, what did you see first of all on the pitch? - A. As
   I got on to the pitch I saw there was a cordon of police
   officers forming on my left.   The game had stopped and
   there was a large number of Liverpool spectators coming
   on to the pitch from my right.

Q.   You are certain   the game had stopped? - A. Yes, sir.

0.   Did you see any players walking off? - A. There may well
     have been but I didn't notice them.   I was immediately
     drawn to the Leppings Lane end.

Q. You could see there was quite a lot of officers at the
   Leppings Lane end of the ground? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. I think initially you stayed more distant, is that right?
   - A. I went to the fence,sir, in the region just by the
   goal.

Q. By the goal? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Do you remember which of the pens you went to?   Was it 3
   or 4? - A. I was at the gate just to the right of the
   goal as you looked at it, sir.

Q. To the right of the      goal as you look at it from the pitch
   side? - A. From the      pitch side, yes, sir.

0. Were you the first officer there or were there other
   officers already there? - A. No, there were already
   officers there, sir.

Q. Was the gate open or shut when you got there? - A. The
   gate was open and spectators were already coming through
   it on to the...

Q. You were in fact trying to assist people to come out or
   what did you do yourself personally? - A.    We were trying
   to get them to...     The pressure was such  onthe fence at
   the front it was impossible, and we were trying to get
   them to go over the dividing fence into the almost empty
   pen next door and then come through the gate on our side.

                                                   M. FRANCE


  Then as it eased a little bit more there were spectators
  coming over the fence so I got up on the fence to help
  them over back on to the pitch.

Q. You are saying that initially people right at the fencing
   could not really climb over because it was too tight, is
   that right? - A. Impossible for them to mova.

Q. But they were able to get out   sideways, some of   them
   were? - A. The ones towards the middle and the back were
   managing to get over into the adjoining pen, so relieving
   the pressure on the front.

Q. Did you notice any movements backwards out of the pen? -
   A. No, none at all, apart from ones climbing up on to the
   stand behind, into the seated area behind.

Q. That relatively empty pen is a very narrow one, isn't it?
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you notice whether people were coming down to get on
   to the pitch from right up at the top end?    You may not
   have done. - A. I think a lot   of people who had beenin
   that pen didn't remain there,   they just came on  to the
   pitch as well.

Q. What I am trying to find out is whether the people who
   exited out of pen 5, which is the narrow one, all climbed
   over the fence or whether they got into pen 5 from any
   other direction or area, as far as you could see? -
   A. Not as far as I could see, sir, no.

                                M. FRANCE


           Cross-Examined by MR. HAL E :

Sergeant, I do not want you to draw any conclusions,
and I am sure the Coroner would not want me to ask you
to draw any conclusions, but would you just deal with
the facts for me about trains.  You were surprised
there was only one train on that day? - A. Yes sir.

In your experience, how many trains would you have
expected? - A. Four or five, sir.

Is there a difference in the way that people who
arrive by train get their way to the ground compared
with those who arrive by other means of transport? -
A. Yes, the special trains are always met by police
officers and the fans escorted straight to the ground.

The difference is that people who come by their own
transport can make their own way to the ground? - A.
Yes sir.

         Cross-Examined by MR. COUGHLIN:

Just one question, Sergeant. When you arrived at the
ground after having escorted the fans from the train,
you were with your serial.  How many officers was
that? - A. I had eight officers with me, sir.

When they were deployed in Leppings Lane, when you
decided to remain, did you actually organise where
they went, or how they were deployed? - A. They were
deployed within sight of me on that side of Leppings
Lane.

Was it your direction as to where they went, or what
they did, or how did they know where to go? - A. They
were deployed by me, yes sir.

Then left to react as things developed? - A. Yes sir.

         Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Sergeant, when the cordon was formed at 20-to 3, were
the main perimeter gates open? - A. I am not exactly
sure.  Some attempt had been made to close them at
some stage, but I don't think we ever really got them
properly closed.

So I presume if they saw the gates open beyond the
cordon, they would, if they saw a gap, make for those
open gates, would they not? - A. Yes, I think that is
a correct assumption.
                                 M. FRANCE


Was Ground Control or a senior officer informed when
the cordon proved unsuccessful? - A. I do not know.

     THE CORONER: I think you can ask him whether he
did it.
Did you inform them? - A. No sir.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   All right, thank you Sergeant.

     THE CORONER: I will ask another one for you.
Did you hear any messages about that on your radio? -
A. No sir.

     THE CORONER: That does not mean to say that there
weren't any, but he did not hear.  Anything else?

     MRS. McBRIEN:   No sir.

             Further by THE CORONER:

I want to ask you one more thing which I forgot, I am
afraid.  When you were bringing the people down, the
train contingent, to use that expression, did you
search anybody?  I do not mean at Leppings Lane, but
further afield? - A. We started to.  Our orders were
to be quite firm but fair with the spectators and to
get hold of the situation straight away, and we
started to, but to be honest the type of person that
had travelled by train, the searches were unnecessary.
They were very nice, decent, ordinary people that were
travelling.

So you judged it was inappropriate? - A.
Inappropriate, yes sir.

The Jury have asked a question.  I do not think we can
ask quite this question, but one similar to it. They
are interested in the number of trains which were
expected.  Were you at the briefing given any
indication how many trains were coming? - A. Yes, we
were told there was just the one special train.

So that was at the briefing you were told? - A. Yes
sir.

     THE CORONER: I think that actually answers your
question.  Thank you very much indeed, Sergeant.  I am
obliged.

            JOHN JOSEPH BENNETT Sworn

                 By THE CORONER:

You are John Joseph Bennett, I believe, is that right?
~ A. Yes.

You are a Police Inspector in the South Yorkshire
Police, are you not? - A. Now Chief Inspector, sir.

Congratulations!  At that time, though, you were an
Inspector, is that right? - A. That is correct, sir.

That time, of course, is 15th April 1989? - A. Yes,
that is correct.

In fact, your duties had nothing to do with Leppings
Lane initially, that is right, is it not? - A. That is
true, they were mainly administrative duties, sir.

Indeed, that is what you were doing when you decided,
I think, to go and have a look at some Property
Stores? - A. Correct, sir.  There were two Property
Stores, one for the Nottingham Forest fans and one for
the Liverpool fans, and I went towards the Leppings
Lane end to supervise that Property Store there.

I want to just pick up the point of entry onto the
field, because I think you crossed from somewhere
behind the Spion Kop, is that right? How did you get
to Leppings Lane? - A. I walked underneath the North
Stand.

Underneath the North Stand, I beg your pardon.  Which
side did you exit onto the field? Can you look at the
plan, or the map? Walk up to it and show us because
it will be easier. - A. I am not sure at which stage
you are referring to, sir.

What I am interested in is 2.15. - A. Right, at 2.15
I was here at this entrance to the pitch.

That is what I thought.  Come back.  So, in fact, that
is between the North Stand and the Spion Kop, is it
not? - A. Yes sir.

Prior to that you had had nothing to do with Leppings
Lane at all? - A. Nothing at all.

We are not interested in that.  When you got onto the
area you were, in fact, intending to come across to
look at the Property Store at Leppings Lane at that
point, is that right? - A. That is correct, sir.  I
had a PC with me who had not policed a semi-final
                                                           61




                                         J. J. BENNETT:


         before and I was just pointing out to her the sort of
         things that we could expect.

    Q.   You did notice something about numbers, I think.  That
B        is what I am interested in. - A. Yes, correct, sir.

    Q.   What did you notice? - A. On the Spion Kop we
         particularly noticed that the area was about two-
         thirds full, quite full in fact, for three-quarters of
         an hour before the match, but at the opposite end of
         the pitch, which was for Liverpool fans, there was
         only a small number there.  The two central pens were
         about, again, two-thirds full, there were hardly any
         fans in the West Stand which was allocated for the
         Liverpool supporters above the Leppings Lane terrace
         and very few in the other terraces.

    Q.   So the only area that appeared fullish, if I can use
          that word, was the central pen? - A. The two central
          pens.

    Q.   Did you draw this to the police constable's attention?
D         - A. Yes, I was surprised.  We had a direct comparison
          with the number of Nottingham Forest fans to our left
          and the number of Liverpool fans to our right, and
          there was only a very small number of Liverpool fans
          there.

    Q.   But, of course, you did not have any responsibilities
          with regard to that, you were merely drawing it to his
          attention? - A. That is correct, sir.

    Q.   And you proceeded with your walk across the field, is
          that right? - A. We didn't go across the field, we
          went underneath the North Stand.

    Q.   Yes.   What happened then? Tell me perhaps in your
          words, as you came beneath the North Stand? - A. As we
          came underneath the North Stand, I had had experience
          from a previous semi-final of almost a waterfall of
          urine coming from the stand, so I made specific
          mention to the PC who was with me to be careful when
          we came back, or at least at a later stage in the
         match.




                                         /Q. So you were

                                 J .J . BENNETT



Q. So you were coming round the back, weren't you.  I made
   a mistake, you weren't coming across the pitch at all
   you were coming behind.  Is that right? - A. Underneath
   the North Stand to the rear of the terraces at Leppings
   Lan e .

Q. There was not anything there when you were coming through?
   - A. Certainly not.

Q. But you just warned him to be careful basically? - A. Yes.

Q. Because you were coming round that way you were coming
   up towards Leppings Lane and near Gate A, is that right?
   - A. Yes, that is right sir.

Q. Is that where the property store was located as well?
   - A. Yes, would you like me to point it out on the thing.
   It is a little complex?

Q. Yes. - A. There is a fence here, which segregated the
   fans who were going into the North Stand and the fans
   who were coming into the West Stand terraces and the
   Police caravan or the mobile that was used as a property
   store was immediately behind this fence here.

Q. Where were you walking? Just while you are indicating
   just show your route? — A. From this stage at the corner
   of the pitch here we walked underneath, along the tunnel
   underneath the North Stand and that brings us out to
   the rear of this fence here, around the outside of the
   fence and this is Gate A here.

Q. Do you by any chance know approximately what time you
   arrived at the Gate A position? — A. I would estimate
   about 20-to-3.

Q. This gate is used to let people Police Officers and
   authorised people in and out? - A. That is right sir.

Q. And it is also an exit gate? - A. Yes, indeed.

Q. When you got to Gate A I think you met a gateman, there
   may be several but you met at least one? — A. Yes one
   came to me specifically.  There were very few Officers
   about in the area so he approached me as I walked towards
   him and he had obviously got problems outside the gate.
   He told me there was a great pressure of people outside.
   He was afraid that people would force entry into the
   Football Ground and he told me that he had locked the gates,
   secured the gates to prevent unlawful access or unauthorised
   access.  I went across to the gate with him.   It was
   possible to see in a small glass window in the gate that
   there was in fact a crush outside and I assured him that
   he had taken the correct course of action at that stage.

                                 J. J. BENNETT


Q. That was your first glimpse so to speak of the Leppings
   Lane area? - A. Yes, that is correct sir.   Obviously
   the gateman was concerned about the situation there and
   he asked for a Police Officer or Police Officers to go
   and assist him but in fact when I looked around the
   area in the turnstiles ajoining Gate A there was only
   one Police Officer there, one P.C. there.

Q. Is that behind the turnstiles or on the far side of the
   turnstiles? - A. The turnstiles to the left of Gate A.

Q. Yes, but on the ground side ....   A.   I am sorry, inside
   the ground, yes.

Q. Just one P.C? - A. Yes.

Q. You of course had no idea where the others were? - A. I
   didn't ask him where the others were, I assumed they
   were going about their duties as they should have done.

Q. Apart from that one Officer and yourself that was the
   sum total and the gateman was concerned? - A. Yes indeed
   and I shared his concern.   As a result of that I went
   further along the turnstiles in fact through the gap in
   the wall to Turnstiles A-G to see if there were any spare
   Officers there who could assist at Gate A.

         In that area Inspector White was in charge of the
   Serial there.  I asked him or explained to him the
   situation at Gate A and asked him if he had Officers
   to go to that gateman's assistance but he didn't, all
   his Officers in fact were quite busy at that stage.

Q. You may not be able to help me but can you by chance
   recollect how many Police Officers you saw in that area,
   in the concourse area behind A-G? - A. To the best of
   my recollection about a serial of men which would be
   somewhere in the region of 10-12 Officers.

Q. Yes, I see. Not having found anybody what did you do
   then? - A. I used the personal radio to ask Control to
   send further Officers to Gate A or to the turnstiles
   and Gate A.

Q. Did you get through? - A. Yes, no problems at all and
   the Officers were there very shortly afterwards.

Q. So you got through, it was acknowledged and you got
   response? - A. Yes indeed, very quickly.

Q. To Gate A we are talking about now? - A. Yes.

Q. Again do you know, was it one Serial or more that turned
   up? - A. Just one Serial.

Q. Do you know what time that was? - A. That would have
   been within 2-3 minutes, 5 minutes perhaps of my arrival
   at that end of the ground so it would be 5 minutes after
   20-to-3 so about quarter-to-3.

Q. Nov; you then returned to that area, didn't you? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you have another look outside? - A. Well first of
   all I briefed the Serial very quickly who had arrived
   there.  I could see in addition to already having
   looked out of the small window in the gate I could see
   through the turnstiles that things were really quite
   desperate outside.   In addition to my view of the
   proceedings there, people who were managing to get in
   were quite distraught, probably in some state of fear
   or state of panic and they were actually shouting at us
   expressing their fears of what was happening outside,
   people being crushed and so on. There were obviously
   quite genuine concerns that people were going to suffer
   quite serious injury or death outside.

Q. That is what they were conveying to you? - A. Very clearly.

Q. Did you form the impression that their problems arose
   because there were so many; because there were people
   with wrong tickets in the area? that there were people
   who should not have been there at all. What was in
   your judgment the people who came through, what did they
   convey to you, what did you judge to be the problem?
   - A. The problems seemed to arise from a number of
   different reasons in fact.  It was very difficult because
   it was so crowded out there for people to go to the correct
   turnstile in fact, just a logistical problem.  There were
   clearly some people there with the wrong tickets.  That
   might not have been their fault either, but there were
   certainly other people who were trying to pay to gain
   admission.  There were people with tickets for the other
   end of the ground.  There were people who were trying to trie
   their way in, a small group of say two or three trying to
   get in on just two tickets or something like that, just
   trying to smuggle an extra person in trying to trick their
   way in, and of course the gatemen were under some pressure
   too.

         I remember one turnstile operator, sorry not a
   gateman, a turnstile operator who was quite elderly and
   was having difficulty coping with the crowd and the number
   of people trying to get through.

         There was one instance where a turnstile operator
   ran out of a turnstile and chased after someone who had
   just come through the turnstile.  I don't know what the
   problem was but other Officers went to him and resolved
   the matter.  The turnstile operator went quickly back
   to his post.  It seemed to be a combination of things.
                                                             65



                                     J. J. BENNETT


    Q. He was not gone for very long was he that turnstile
       operator? - A. No.

    Q. But obviously that caused a delay because that was not
       operating.  That is what you are saying? - A. That is
B      correct.

    Q. What did you do then? - A. After I had briefed the Serial
       or rather the point of briefing theSerial was to let
       as many people in as quickly as possible.   I told them
       not to worry about which area their tickets were allocated
       for.  It was clear there was a great problem outside and
       the best thing to do was to try and relieve the pressure
       outside by getting as many people safely in as we could. .

             Having done that I then noticed that there were
       people trying to climb over the top of the turnstiles to
       get into the ground.  There had been some earlier who
       had climbed to the top of Gate A but they had in fact got
       back down when I had shouted to them and signalled them
       and they got back down on the outside.

             There were others who had climbed up to the roof of
D      the turnstiles and in fact were shinning their way across
       the top of Gate B. Most of those eventually reached the
       roof of turnstiles and climbed   down and then were taken
       by Police Officers towards Gate C.    I assume they had
       been ejected directly.

             It seemed rather a futile exercise taking them
       straight out so I thought it would be better to try and
       stop them climbing over the roof so I climbed on to the
       turnstile roof in fact with the intention of stopping
       anyone else gaining admission by that way but as soon
       as I climbed on top of the roof I could see the full
       scale of the problem outside and in fact rather than
       turning people back when I got on to the roof I in fact
       assisted them to gain access to the ground.

                                                              66


                                                  J. J.   BENNETT




Q.   So you had a bird's-eye view? - A. Indeed.

Q.    Just describe to me what you saw, because you came to
     it cold, so to speak, unexpected, and you were high? -
     A. Yes, it was completely unexpected, I must admit.    I
     had already seen through the small window through the
     turnstiles that there were a lot of people outside but,
     in fact, the situation was far worse, or I realised it
     was far worse, when I got up onto the roof.   I could
     see that the areas immediately outside the turnstiles
     were crammed jam full of people but beyond that,
     outside the perimeter gates, something which I had not
     seen before was the large number of people outside.    I
     could not see the extent of the crowd to the left
     because there were overhanging trees by the end of the
     bridge, and to the right the view was masked by the
     shops and the houses that are on Leppings Lane there.
     In fact, the whole of the area was full of people.    The
     ones closer to me were quite well packed, or very well
     packed, but obviously as I looked further afield the
     crowd was a little bit thinner, but nevertheless the
     roadway was full, the footpaths were full, the area was
     completely full.

Q.   And it was that which induced you to get the people to
     come - not to throw them out but to allow them in, in
     effect? - A. Yes, that is right.   It was quite easy to
     spot that there was very little we could do.   Within a
     few moments of being up on the roof there I had noticed
     that the mounted department had, in fact, tried to
     throw a cordon around outside the perimeter gates.
     That held for a short time and a gap appeared between
     the perimeter gates and the line of Police horses, a
     gap of a few feet, but in what seemed a very short
     space of time that cordon was overwhelmed and people
     just flooded through it.

Q. Do you remember what the position with regard to the
   perimeter gates was? Of course, there are lots of them
   but do you recollect anything about them, the gates
   themselves as opposed to the cordon? - A. Within my
   recollection those gates remained open the whole time.

Q. I think - I may be retracing my steps a little bit -
   you also, in addition to passing a message to get the
   serial down to Gate A, I think you had another go on
   the radio, did n ’t you, at some point, is that right? -
   A. I certainly tried to tell Control, describe the
   situation to them.

Q. Did you do that from the vantage point? - A. Yes.
                                          J.   J.   BENNETT




Did you get that message across? - A. I am not sure.  I
don't recall any acknowledgment.  I wasn't sure whether
the message got through at all.

So you are saying that once you were up there you tried
to radio through to Control? - A. Yes.

But you don't know what happened to that message? - A.
No.

I think you actually saw Superintendent Marshall as
well at one point, didn't you? - A. Yes, indeed.  The
parapet at the end of the bridge is raised above ground
level and I saw Superintendent Marshall raised above
the ground.  I assume he had climbed part way up the
parapet.

Did you hear any messages on the radio emanating from
him? - A. I didn't hear any clear messages.  Because I
was helping people up over the wall, the only messages
I heard were those when I had lifted the radio to my
ear, in fact.  It was very noisy at the time, so I had
heard part messages, enough to know that people were
trying to make arrangements, Police Officers were
trying to make arrangements and negotiate for the gates
to be opened.

Did you see the gates open? - A. In fact, I didn't.   I
was so involved, I suppose, with helping people over
the wall, making sure that nobody fell back or
whatever, didn't contribute any further to the danger
outside, that I didn't actually see the gates open, but
I realised that the gates had been opened because after
a short time the number of people outside in those
enclosures reduced to about half.  There was space left
and then I looked around and realised that what must
have happened was the gates had been opened.

I want to come back to the people who were coming over
the top? - A. Yes.

Did any or all or some, or whatever the correct word
is, show you tickets? - A. Yes.  They didn't exactly
produce tickets and I certainly wasn't able to examine
them all but quite a lot of those people, perhaps two-
thirds or three-quarters, in fact, were waving some
tickets or other, obviously to try and establish that
they were authorised to watch the game that day.

Certainly your impression was that a substantial number
of the people who came over the top would have been
allowed into the ground had they been able to present
themselves at the turnstiles, and indeed all of them
might, but you certainly saw a substantial number? - A.
                                               J.   J.   BENNETT




  Yes.  In fact, what happened was that some of those who
  gained access to the roof tried to pass their tickets
  back down into the enclosure, but as far as I am aware
  I managed to stop all those being passed.  The ones
  that I spoke to, the vast majority had tickets in their
  possession.

0. these people who were coming over, who were the ones
   you had most contact with I presume? - A. Yes.

Q. What was their attitude towards you up there, a Police
   Officer assisting them to climb a wall? - A. We were
   about 15 to 20 feet above the ground and we were quite
   respectful of each other, I would suggest.

Q. I see, yes.   So no problems? - A. Certainly no
   problems.   Obviously some of them had been drinking.
   Some of them were a little unsteady on their feet, but
   we had no problems.

Q. I know you were involved with other matters as well,
   but these were considerably later, which I think we
   need not go into.

              Cross-Examined by MR. COUGHLIN

Q. It is now Chief Inspector, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. Just two points to clarify that.  As I understood your
   evidence, which was very clear, there were two attempts
   by you to make contact with control by your radio? - A.
   Yes .

Q. On the first occasion, as I understood your evidence,
   you sought assistance and that that message clearly got
   through? - A. It certainly did and reinforcements
   arrived within a few minutes, a few moments.

Q. Yes, that is helpful, and on the second occasion when
   you, endeavoured to convey the problem to Control, as I
   understood your evidence you were not clear that that
   message had necessarily got through? - A. No, I
   certainly did not hear any acknowledgment.

               Cross-Examined by MISS STEEL

Q. When you got on top of the turnstiles it was only then
   you saw the full extent of the problem? - A. Yes, that
   is quite right.

0. Then you told Control of that? - A. I tried to, yes.

Q. I think you have already said in your view it had to be
   relieved, the pressure? - A. Yes, certainly.
                                            J.   J.   BENNETT




Did you specifically or by implication suggest that the
game might be delayed, the kick off? - A. No, I made no
suggestion of that at all.

Indeed, you don't know whether your message was
received? - A. No.

           Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN

Chief Inspector, what time did you notice that the
central pens at the Leppings Lane terrace were quite
full, please? - A. 2.15.

I may have missed this next point but did you say what
you had done about the observation you had made? When
you did notice they were full did you do anything about
it? - A. No, I didn't do anything about it. My
observation was that, in fact, there were very few fans
there.  I appreciate that the two central pens were
getting quite full but there were very few other fans
there at all.

You mentioned numerous problems outside the turnstiles,
so it was not surprising when the gateman at Gate A was
afraid to let those people in, was it? - A. No,
certainly not.  Without any Police Officers there he
was clearly afraid of being overwhelmed.

You said that two thirds of the people had tickets to
go into the match.  Would you agree that it is
dangerous at a sell out match to allow any extra
numbers into the ground.

     THE CORONER:   I don't think he said.  I said of
the people who were coming over the top, not the people
who were coming into the ground, the people who were
climbing over the turnstiles, how many did he think had
tickets, and he said he could see about two thirds:

I think that is correct? - A. That is correct, sir.

     THE CORONER:    So it isn't quite the same.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   All right.   Thank you, Chief
Inspector.

               Further by THE CORONER

How much experience have you had of policing football
matches in this sort of way? - A. At that stage I had
been at Hammerton Road Police Station I think about 2%
years as an Inspector, and worked football matches
quite regularly there.  I had worked there previously
                                                       70



                                          J.   J.   BENNETT




as a Sergeant so I had had quite a lot of experience of
football matches.

So if I put to you the question which Mrs. McBrien I
think was actually trying to ask and I stopped her half
way, in your experience in big matches is it normal
that people without tickets manage to get in?  If you
have not got experience, then say, "I don't know". - A.
I don't think I am in a position to answer that, sir.
I don't know.

        Further Cross-Examined by MISS STEEL

You didn't ask for the game to be delayed, the kick
off.  Was there any reason for this? - A. I suppose I
was in some difficulty because I was not involved
operationally at the time.  I was thrown in at the deep
end.  I must admit I tackled the problems that were
confronting me immediately at the time.  Had I been
able to sit back for a couple of minutes quietly then I
might have thought about that, but I didn t think about
it.

You simply acted trying to relieve pressure? - A. Quite
right.

     THE CORONER:   Chief Inspector Bennett, thank you
very much indeed.  I would like to rise for five
minutes, then we have got one more witness for today
after that.

                    ROBERT WILLIAM COBB Sworn

                         By THE CORONER:

0. You are Robert William Cobb? - A. That is right.

Q. What is your address? - A.
         1 Sheffield.

0. For over 20 years you were a gateman with Sheffield
   Wednesday? - A. Twenty-two years on A gate and five years
   on 0 gate.

0.   Twenty-two years on A Gate.   That was the last twenty-
     two years of your career? - A. Was on A Gate.

Q.   That is the gate near Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.

Q.    Is it right that certainly over the last few    seasons you
     have worked with colleagues? - A. Yes, four.

Q.   Who were they? - A. Jack Stone, Horace Swift and a chap
     called Terry who hasn't been there very long.

0.   That was the A Gate team? - A. That's right.

0.   Would it be right to say that the job of the gatemen was
     to ensure that the gate was open and shut for authorised
     people? - A. That is correct.

Q. That would be people like police officers... -
   A. St. John's.

Q. Also to ensure that it was open when the match was
   finished? - A. Correct.

0.   So that people could leave? - A. Correct.

Q.   Also to ensure that it was opened if you were notified      of
     any potential emergencies? - A. That's right.

0.   There was a special code for that? - A. Yes, Mr. Meadows.

Q.   And you knew that? - A. Yes.

Q. On the 15th of April, 1989 it wasn't heard?   You didn't
   hear that message? - A. No, I didn't hear that.

0. The practice normally is once you take up your positions
   at the gate one or other of you will unlock it? - A.
   That's right, two. There would be two persons there.
                                                                 72

    Q. Once it is unlocked it normally stays unlocked? - A.
       That's right.

    0.   But you can close it with a latch? - A. Yes.
B
    Q.   In view of the fact you have been there for twenty-two
         years I take it that you were probably at this gate in
         1988 as well, would that be right? - A. That's right.

    0.   Were you there at the semi-final   in 1988? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Do you normally have any problems with fans as far as
         your gate is concerned? - A. Very little normally.    The
         only trouble we have is if it is an exceptional crowd.

    Q. Don't talk about the 1989 match for the moment.  What do
       you call an exceptional crowd? - A. Well, a semi-final,
       or Liverpool, or Tottenham, or a big match.

    Q. A popular match? - A. A popular match, yes.

    Q. What sort of problems do you experience on those
D      occasions? - A. Well, sometimes if there is a crowd they
       will come and wave money up to the window to let them in.

    0. So they are signalling to you and saying, "Please open*'?
       - A. That's correct.

    Q. What happens?     Do you open or do you not? - A. No, we
       don't open.

    Q. However, that is the sort of thing that happens? - A.
       That happens, yes.

    Q. I think it is true that in addition to your experience
       there, you have annual meetings when there are
       discussions with stewards and gatemen and so on? - A.
       Yes, before every season.

    0.   Those are sort of general instruction?    - A. That's   right,
         from the fire, police and so on.

    Q. You presumably knew a fair bit of this anyway because you
       were an experienced man? - A. Yes.

    0. On the match day, the 15th of April, 1989, who unlocked
       gate A, do you remember? - A. I did that particular day.

    Q. Having unlocked Gate A do you also go and unlock the
       perimeter gates? - A. No.

    0. Who does that? - A. Well, the police.      Are   youtalking
       about the wrought iron gates?

0. The wrought iron gates beyond Gate A? -A. No, they are
   not opened until the police come to me and say they want
   them opening.  We have the keys to open those gates.

Q. So when you are told, "Get them open," you then...? - A.
   Go to open them.

Q. Do you know whether those gates are normally opened and
   kept open, or is it the normal practice for them to be
   shut? - A. Well, the normal practice is to open the gates
   probably an hour and a half before the match, but on
   semi-final day we were asked to wait until we were told.

Q. What time did you open those gates? - A. It could be
   twelve-ish.   It could even be before twelve.

0. On this day the gates are open, you had unlocked Gate A,
   was everything normal initially as you would expect it to
   be? - A. Yes, normal, yes.    What, referring to a semi­
   final?

0. I am referring to the 15th of April, 1989. - A. Yes, as a
   normal semi-final everything was normal.

Q.   Until what time? - A. Until   ten minutes past two.

Q.   Everything was as you would have expected? - A. I passed
     remark to the Inspector that I had never seen it as quiet
     in all the years I had been there.

0. In fact it was more quiet than a normal semi-final? - A.
   Well, the exact words were that it was a league match.

Q.   What happened then? - A. God knows!

Q.   What happened as far as you were concerned?    What did
     you see? - A. Well, what I saw...   The Inspector came,
     only two or three minutes after, it may have been about
     twelve minutes past two when he came.    There was a crowd
     accumulating and I said to the Inspector, "If I was you,
     all the non-ticket holders I would put at the other side
     of the wrought iron fence," because the ticket holders
     were struggling at that time to come in.    The Inspector
     said, "Well, I just haven't the force."    After that it
     just piled up and piled.

Q. Tell me about these non-ticket holders.    How did you
   know there were any non-ticket holders there then? - A.
   Because they were wanting to pay - £10 notes, £20 notes -
   and they were all yelling, "Let us in."

0. So these were people outside your gate who waving money
   at you, so to speak? - A. Yes.
f                                                                     74

        Q. Within the turnstile area, basically? - A. That's right,
           yes.

        Q. Estimate how many there were? - A. Well, it is very
    B      awkward to say how many because there are only so many
           can push to the   front to wave their money.

        Q. I realise that,   but can you tell me whether we are
           talking about 10, 20, 100? - A. Well, you can be talking
           about 100.

        0.   Would you say there were more than 500? - A. No.

        Q.   What I am trying to do is find the bracket.   It could   be
             between 100, but it was definitely not 500? - A. No.

        Q. It could have been 250? - A. No.

        0. That's fair enough.  So you suggested to him, get rid of
           those people, move them outside? - A. Move them outside
           and all those with the tickets could have gone in.

    D   Q. He said, "I can't do it."? - A. "I haven't the force."

        0. What happened then as far as you are concerned? - A. As
           far as I was concerned it was just a matter of holding
           tight at the gates.  At about twenty minutes to three I
           had to lock the   gates with the key, which is the first
           time I have ever locked it with the keys. The      forcewas
           that much on the inside that the gates were gradually
           going like that. The wrought iron gates, they are
           collapsible, but they weren't going that way, they were
           going like that.

        Q. By "wrought iron" you mean the concertina type gates? -
           A. That's right.   It was that bad I thought they had
           some tools or something that was doing it, with them
           being collapsible gates.   I look through the mirror but
           it was just human power that was doing it.

        Q. Did you form the impression that people were deliberately
           moving the gate or was it just that there were such a lot
           of people that they were being pressed against it? - A.
           No, no, absolutely deliberate - "If you don't open the
           gate you so-and-so, we will smash it down.

        Q. You could hear that? - A. Definitely, yes, two or three
           times.

        Q. You locked it because you thought it mightn't hold? - A.
           That's right, yes.

Q. We saw Inspector Bennett a few minutes ago. Was it you
   who approached him and said, "We need more men"? - A.
   Yes, it was me.

0. It was you? - A. Yes.

Q. Before you asked him to get extra manpower along, was the
   police complement - you know, the numbers - on the inside
   and the outside, different to what is normal at a semi­
   final? - A. Well, it looked about the same on the outside
   of the turnstiles and then on the inside there were
   probably four more policemen than normal at a league
   match, on the inside, searching them coming through the
   turnstiles.

Q. So if anything you had more officers than normal? - A.
   Yes, there were more about than normal.

Q.   Why did you ask Inspector Bennett to send even more men
     along? - A. Well, because he wanted more men on the
     outside of my gate to move them.   I mean, the normal
     police were outside.   There was no way they could
     control the extra crowd that came that day.

Q.   Inspector Bennett told me he couldn't see very many
     officers on the inside at all.   In fact he said he only
     saw one.   How many did you see before he called for the
     reinforcements? - A. Are you calling an ordinary
     policeman an officer?

0. Yes. - A. I believe it was eight on the inside -
   policemen - and I think there was two on each turnstile
   for them coming through and on the wrought iron gates I
   could not say how many were there.

Q. That was no doubt the complement when you began? - A.
   That's right.

Q. What I am interested in is how many of those were left
   at, say, half past two, quarter to three? - A. Well, the
   inside ones weren't altered at all.   They were just
   doing their job there.

Q. Did you see the outside? - A. I didn't notice   on the
   outside, no.

0. Did extra men arrive after you spoke to Inspactor
   Bennett? - A. No.

0. You don't remember them coming? - A. No, none came at
   all.
                              R. W. COBB


Now you had an interesting   experience, I think, on
this match day that people   actually having got into
the ground then approached   you and said they wanted to
go out, is that correct? -   A. That is correct, yes.

Has that ever happened before? - A. Oh yes.

Do you normally allow them to go out through your
gate? - A. Yes, we normally allow the one man to go
out.  I would take their ticket off him and then he
would come back to me and ask for the ticket back. If
he was called out to the telephone, or to his car,  I
would take the ticket off him and he would ask for the
ticket when he came back.

So he would bang on the door, look through the window,
you would look at him? - A. Yes, I would look at him,
that is correct.

If you recognised him you would open it and let him in
and give him his ticket? - A. Yes.

Did that happen to you on this day as well? - A. No,
because we don't let them out.

Why wouldn't you let them out this day? - A. Well, it
came to our notice that they were going through the
turnstile that fast that they were coming through with
a full ticket.  Now then, with a full ticket you can
come in and through my experience they can collect
their friends' tickets, put them in their top pocket,
come to me and say, "Well, I want to go out", give me
the one ticket, go out, distribute the tickets he had
in his pocket and then come back to the window and ask
for his ticket.  So, therefore, whatever number of
tickets he had in his pocket, they would be going into
the ground legally because they would have tickets.

In other words, what you are saying is if people were
able to get in with a complete ticket, and if they
could collect sufficient, they could give you one and
use the others for their friends or anybody else? - A.
That is right, yes.

Because you could see that people were coming through
with complete tickets, you would not let them out? -
A. No, we wouldn't let them out.

So assuming that that was the reason why they wanted
to go out, whatever it was, they were frustrated? - A.
Yes, so what we did we stopped everybody going out.
                             R. W. COBB


In addition to that,   of course,     you had avery large
crowd outside Gate A   as well? -     A. That is correct,
yes.

From your position at Gate A, are you able to see any
of the other gates? - A. No.

Can you see Gate C at all? - A. No.

Did you know that Gate C had been opened? - A. Not
until the shout went up that the C Gate had been
opened.

You could not see it? - A. I couldn't see C Gate being
opened, no.

The reason why I ask    is because   in one ofyour
statements you say, "He were just able to see it from
where we were standing".    Now I am interested.   I have
looked at the model and I wondered how you did it. -
A. No.   The top of the gate, if you move back a few
yards you can probably see the top, but I mean to see
the top I couldn't say whether it was open or shut,
you see.

You can see the top of it? - A. You can see the top of
it if I move back fouror five yards away from my
gate, you see.

But you can't tell whether it is open? - A. You
couldn't tell, no.

So how did you discover that it had opened on the day?
I do not mean afterwards, we all know it opened, but
how did you discover it on the day? - A. We were stood
on the gate and the policeman behind the turnstile, I
went to see him because I had seen some of them
wrapping tickets up in a 50p piece and throwing it
over.  So I went to the policeman behind the turnstile
and said, "Look, if you would just watch them because
they are throwing tickets over", behind his back, and
by that time there was a shout went up that C Gate had
been forced open.  I did not know whether it had been
done on purpose, or by the Police, but we heard that
shout that it had been forced open, and that is the
first I knew of C Gate.

That is obviously a matter of quite considerable
importance. Are you saying that the crowd outside
expressed words to the effect that C Gate had been
forced open? - A. No, these weren't outside.  It was
on the inside where we heard it, that it had been
forced open.
                                  R. W. COBB


Q.   You are quite sure that they used words to the effect
     of forced? - A. Yes, definitely.

Q.   You are certain about that? - A. Certain, yes.

Q.   You see, all the evidence we have heard up to now is
     that the gate was opened at least on two occasions
     deliberately, so it is important to know what words
     you heard. - A. Yes.

Q.   Having heard that, what happened, as far as you are
     concerned? - A. As far as I am concerned, it could
     have been a couple of minutes after when a Police
     Sergeant came up to me and said, "Well, we are going
     to open A Gate", and I said, "Well, I don't think it
     is advisable".

Q.   What did you say, I am sorry? - A. I said I didn't
     think it was advisable with the crowd that was
     outside, and he had a policewoman with him, so he
     said, "Well, we want it opening to get rid of them",
     so I said, "Could you get it from higher authority for
     me to open it?" you see.  So he said, "Well, I'll go",
     and during that time I thought, 'Well, there's nowhere
     they can go through A Gate' because you can't see the
     match.

Q.   Is that because A Gate leads to the back of the North
     Stand? - A. To the back, straight through to 0 Gate on
     Penistone Road, so it didn't make no difference there,
     but what I was — not frightened, but what I didn't
     want to happen was for a rush and somebody to fall
     over coming through that gate.  So I did ask. When he
     came back he said, "I have authority", but I did ask
     for more police.

Q.   You did? - A. I did, which he definitely fetched, and
      then they had two lines of policemen up and Jack gave
      them the keys to the gate and I picked out the tallest
      copper and thought, 'I'm standing behind you', which I
     did.   They opened the gates and that was it - whoosh -
      gone.

Q.   How many came through, would you say? - A. You are
      talking in hundreds.

Q.   You heard this comment, you know, "Gate C has been
      opened", or forced opened or whatever it might be? -
     A. Yes.

Q.   Perhaps I just ought to ask you this.   In addition to
      that, did you hear who was supposed to have forced
      this gate open? - A. Oh no.
i   &                                                               79




                                              R. W. COBB


            Q.    You did not hear that? - A. No.

            Q.   Having heard that sound, what time  interval was there
                 between when you heard that and your opening of Gate
        B        A? - A. It was only a few minutes.  I couldn't say
                 exact, but it was only a few minutes, it wasn't long.

            Q.   You have obviously had an enormous amount of
                 experience manning Gate A? - A. Yes.

            Q.   In your experience, has this situation ever presented
                 itself before in a semi-final that you have attended?
                 - A. No.

            Q.   Or, indeed, any large league match? - A. No, not to
                 this scale.

            Q.   If I were to ask you to summarise the difference
                 between 15th April 1989, as far as   you were concerned
                 - I am not interested in anybody else - how would you
                 do that? - A. I should call it mass hooliganism
                 against my gate anyway.   The intention was to smash
        D        the gate and that was it, and to get in that ground no
                 matter what.

            Q.   You do not think that the people who were pressed up
                 against your gate, or at least who were up against
                 your gate, were pressed up in such a way that they
                 could not do anything about it? - A. I thought, 'Well,
                 if they had tickets, they wouldn't be there', so they
                 were all without tickets, in my opinion, that was
                 opposite my little window that I could see and that
                 lot there had no tickets and they were just trying
                 whatever they could to get in.

            Q.   You do not think that it might be that they had moved
                       Of course, you do not know.  I will change this
                  question.  You are quite satisfied that the people
                  outside your gate, or at least a substantial number,
                 were waving money at you and the other gateman? - A.
                 Yes.

            Q.   You were not obviously very pleased with the idea of
                 opening Gate A, were you? - A. No.

            Q.   Apart from the fact that you thought that there might
                 be a rush, and that people might fall over and hurt
                  themselves. - A. That is right.

            Q.   Was there any other reason why you did not like it? -
                 A. Well, for the simple reason that in my own mind I
                 knew that they hadn't tickets and wasn't entitled to
                 be into a place where people had reserved a seat and
                  that they should go where a seat was reserved.




        H
                            R. W. COBB


So you were envisaging that if people without tickets
entered an area where there were numbered seats,
there would be problems when two people were trying to
sit down in one seat? - A. Yes, there have got to be
problems if they go in.

That was the reason why you did not like it? - A. Yes,
that is right.

Did you notice whether people were distressed outside?
Did they look red and hot and complain about not
feeling comfortable or anything? - A. No.  The only
thing we got was abuse for not letting them in.

It is quite clear that you did not take the first
instruction from the Police Sergeant;  you made him go
off? - A. No, that is right, I didn't take that, no.

Had that situation ever arisen in the past, where you
were asked by an officer to do something and you said,
"No way, you had better get some more authority"? - A.
No. Normally I would have taken the advice of the
Sergeant or Inspector who comes up at a normal match.

Why weren't you happy? Why didn't you do it this
time? - A. Because I knew what the situation would be
releasing them without Police cover.

Yes. - A. I could have been trampled, innocent people
could have been trampled who had already given their
tickets in.

I see. - A. It is a confined space from the wall to
the West Stand.  I mean, you have only a channel to
run down and if you let a mass in through there,
people are coming in down the side with tickets
properly and if you allow a crowd like that to come
down, then somebody is forced to get hurt if there are
no Police there.

One final question.  No, I will not ask a final
question, not now anyway.

           Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Mr. Cobb, I am asking you this question because of
your tremendous length of experience working in the
same place doing the same job.  Did it seem to you
that the Police preparations for the game and the
deployment of the Police was completely in line with
what it had been at other semi-finals and big matches?
- A. What I saw from my gate was in line.  The same
procedure was done for all the other semi-finals.
                               R. W. COBB


     THE CORONER: Mr. Payne, excuse me, may I just
interrupt you.  Miss Steel has to catch a train and I
had forgotten about it.  Could we allow her to go
first? I know it is cutting it fine anyway but, if
necessary, would it be better, do you mind coming back
tomorrow?

     THE WITNESS:    No.   I have been enough times.

     MISS STEEL:  I have only three very short
questions, so it may be we can deal with them now.     I
am grateful to you.

     THE CORONER: Yes.

          Cross-Examined by MISS STEEL:

When you spoke to the Inspector, who said, "I haven't
the force", was that an Inspector inside the ground? -
A. Inside the ground.

Do you know his name? - A. No.

Was he one of your regular Inspectors? - A. No.

Then secondly your only view of outside the ground
came through your little window, is that right? - A.
Through the window, that is right.

So that whatever you saw would be restricted to the
things immediately outside that window? - A. Yes.

There were a lot of people out there, is that right? -
A. Yes, that is right.

So you would have a very restricted view, and finally
I think you did say that people who came in through
Gate A could not go into the terraces because they
would be going down the back of the North Stand, is
that right? - A. Yes.

So anybody who came through your gate would not add to
the numbers on the terrace? - A. They couldn't see the
match, no.

     THE CORONER:   Leave us, Miss Steel, but if when
we finish you feel - I have forgotten your name, I am
sorry - that it would be helpful to have this
gentleman back, then I would be quite willing to do
so. All you need to do is tell me.    I do not want you
to feel you are prejudiced by the fact that you are
having to leave us.

     MISS STEEL:    I am most grateful to you, sir.

           THE CORONER: Mr. Payne, I was very rude and
     interrupted you but I am sure you will understand.


              Further Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Q. Mr.   Cobb, I am asking you these questions on the basis of
   all   the experience you have told the Court about and
   you   have explained that this was the first time that
   you   have ever had to lock the gate? - A. That is correct.

Q. And you have described what the people outside were doing
   to the gate and demonstrated it but I don't think you have
   quite given a word for it. Would you say that the gate was
   vibrating? - A. Vibrating terrible, yes. Actually there
   was a woman behind us shouted out:  "That gate is going to
   go".  That is how much it was moving.

Q. Is the gate secured by bolts? - A. By two bolts at the
   top, yes, and two at the bottom.

Q. Did the shaking have any effect       on that? -   A. No because
   Jack was holding the bolt up.

Q. Who was? - A. Jack that was on the gate with me, Jack
   Stone.

Q. He was holding the bolts? - A. Yes.

Q. Why was he doing that? - A. Well because the vibration
   with the top ones was gradually working down.

Q. How often have people shouted from the outside to you:
   "If you don't open the gates we will smash it down". How
   often has that happened in your 22 years of experience?
   - A. Once before I think it is.

Q. Can you remember when that was? - A. Oh, it is a few
   years back.  I just can't remember.

Q.   Are you there at every match?   -   A. Yes.

Q.   All home matches? - A. Yes.

Q.   For 22 years? - A. Yes.

Q.   Let me just ask one more question.  You did mention in
     passing that there are not only annual meetings but there
     are discussions before every season and you mentioned
     that they take place with Fire Officers and Police? - A.
     That is correct.

Q. Are you involved in those discussions yourself? - A. We
   attend them.
                                R. COBB



You do? - A. Yes, we all do.

That is what a pre-season discussion? - A. It is a pre­
meeting by the Club.
And it is a meeting held between Club Officials, Club
Stewards ___   A. Officials, the Fire and St. John s.

Fire Officers, St. John's Ambulance, Police ---   A. And
the Manager of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

And this is to discuss anything that anybody wants to
bring up about the management of the ground, learning
from previous experience, any criticism anybody wants
to make of anybody else? - A. Yes.

Did you ever hear any criticism made of the Police
operation which took place at the 1988 match? - A. No.

      MR. PAYNE:   Thank you very much.


             Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Mr. Cobb, you said that people wtre saying outside^your
gate:  "If you don't open it we will smash it down ?
- A. That is correct.

Do you think it was essential   to keep those people out
for the sake of the safety of   those inside the ground?
- A. Well that is what I have   said.  That is why we
didn't open the gates for the   safety of the people inside
the ground.
Would you say it was almost a riot situation outside the
gates? - A. Yes, it was really terrible.

And so would you say that it should have been dealt with
outside the ground? - A. Yes.

       MRS. McBRIEN:   Right, thank you very much.

       THE CORONER:    Thank you very much indeed.

       Can I just tell you - it affects the lawyers -
 but can I just tell you the names of the people we
 are hoping to have tomorrow.  Peter Garratt, he is a
 supporter.  I am afraid you will find that the lists
 become a little bit more ragged over the next few days,
 partly because of fitting people in and so on.
 Malcolm Bain; Brian Ridge; Malcolm Hurst; Mr. Beadsley
 and Stuart Thorpe.  That is the present plan.
      Does anybody want to address me on anything?
(No response)  In that case we will call it a day.
See you tomorrow at 10 o'clock.

      MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, there is perhaps one brief
matter I would like to raise more conveniently in the
absence of the jury.

                     (The jury retire)


      Sir, it concerns the parameters of the evidence
which you are calling in terms of time.

      Sir, you will recall that I cross-examined one
Police Officer on Friday, I think Thursday afternoon,
P.C. Buxton as to when he did what he did because I
was seeking to establish when he did something in relation
to the arrival of the ambulance and sir you will recall
the part of his statement after he had described being
in contact with the ambulance was read out by me when I
was putting part of his statement to the witness
P.C. Buxton.

      Sir, I of course did what you asked me to.  Today
there was a further instance where I did not make any
observation or indeed cross-examine the witness who was
in the witness box who was Police Sergeant France who
described, sir you will recall, the first thing he noticed
when he got into the ground was not only that the players
had left the field but a Police cordon was starting to
form across the playing area.

      Sir, it is clear from the photographs that that
seems to have happened between 15.21 and 15.22 and the
ambulance was already there.  Sir, because ray wish to
dwell upon matters on the evidence that he gave as to
the rescue was quite limited I did not pursue it, but
sir is it still your wish to contain the narrative of
the evidence to before the ambulance arriving?

      THE CORONER:  Mr. Russell, I think I spent quite
a bit of time this weekend having another look at all,
not all the videos but I looked through quite a few
and you are quite right, there was a what I would call
a "major cordon" formed across the field at some stage
but I observed at least one other group of Officers
who I could be certain describe as a cordon but I didn't
pursue it with Mr. France because having established the
time that it came out I did not think it was relevant
to take his evidence any further than that.
      My position is this and I thought I said I was
picking the arrival of the ambulance as a convenient
marker.  I don't think it was ever my intention, and in
fact I re-read what I said on the first day and I used
the words "about 3.15 or thereabouts" so I managed to
qualify it fore and aft. What I was trying to say I
was trying to give that as a marker but I was not intending
to look at my watch and say:  "It is 3.15 full stop . If
it is necessary to hear another five minutes or even
seven minutes or possibly ten minutes from a particular
witness in order to complete his account then I would
hear, but I don't want to do - and that is really the
point - I don't want to go into a great deal of "rescue"
which clearly is very interesting but which is not going
to help the jury with establishing how the deceased came
by their deaths.
      My objective is to have that as a sort of a line
and as a time in my mind but to have a little bit of
movement around it rather than as an absolute full stop.
Does that help you in any way?

      MR. RUSSELL:  Sir, that does help.  I am grateful
for that and certainly I don't mean any disrespect by
asking you either when you'are going on, it would appear
to be after 20-past-3 with Police Sergeant France.

      THE CORONER: As I say I did not pursue it with
him.  I don't think whatever he said mattered and it may
be if I had wanted to pursue it on that point I might
have had to pin him down a little bit harder with regard
to the timings which he mentioned, but I am a i®° verY
conscious when people say:   "I saw X or Y or Z parti­
cularly in a situation like that they very often have to
get facts foreshortened.

      MR. RUSSELL:  Sir, yes, both with this witness
and with Police Constable Buxton what the evidence was
was perhaps helpful and it was their first impression
of what they saw when they got on the field, as far
as Police Sergeant France was concerned it was the
cordon forming.  We can see by objective evidence
therefore what time that was, and with of course
Police Constable Buxton the first thing he noticed was
the Liverpool fan gesticulating in the Nottingham Forest
goalmouth at the Spion Kop.

       THE CORONER:  Yes indeed and no doubt the jury
 would have to consider whether or not those timings,
 assuming for a moment that the fan he saw was the one
 we have the photograph of, let's assume that for the
 sake of your submission, the jury will then have to
 decide what time he actually got into the ground and
 if they decide he got into the ground so late that it
                                                        8b




is well past kick-off time, then of course one has to
then, whatever he said with regard to events in the
ground, have to be understood on that basis.

      MR. RUSSELL:  Sir, yes. My only reason for
pursuing that line of cross-examination with Police
Constable Buxton was because in evidence-in-chief he
said that he had some contact with Chief Superintendent
Nesbit at 3.10 and it appeared from his evidence that
he did an awful lot between 3.11, which is when the
photograph was taken of the gesticulating fan, and when
he then in the course of the narrative of his evidence
mentioned speaking to Chief Superintendent Nesbit.
In other words he had rescued I think three, four,
possibly five fans from Pen 3.

      Sir, I don't mean to turn this into a submission.
You refer to it as such.  I am only seeking guidance
because it helps us on this side of the Bar as to how
far we should pursue aspects with the various witnesses
and certainly I have been paying attention to photographs
which show the ambulance has arrived and certainly with
Police Sergeant France this afternoon there is a photo­
graph, two photographs in the album PR3 that show no
cordon at 15.20 and the cordon forming at 15.22.




                  THE CORONER:   Mr. Russell
      THE CORONER:   Mr. Russell, perhaps I should not
have used the word submission.   I understand the point
that you are making.   This Inquest, as you can see, is
difficult, long enough and complex enough as it is and
what I am trying to avoid is to go too far down the
road.   On the other hand what I am also anxious to
ensure is that we don't leave a sentence in mid-stream
or cut off because of an aspect of timing.   I know that
Chief Superintendent Nesbit is quite an important
person, if you like, in this event - he is probably a
very important person in his own right in any event.
My recollection is that he was actually on the field,
and there is evidence of this, before the ambulance
arrived ....

     MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, I was not seeking to suggest
that was the time that Chief Superintendent Nesbit had
arrived.  What was important, I felt, important to
point, was that if Police Constable Buxton's other
evidence was right, his timing of having first contact
with Chief Superintendent must have been later than 10-
past-3.

     THE CORONER:   That really makes my point, Mr.
Russell.  Supposing for a moment that you are
completely correct on this, if I had rigidly enforced
the rule that I am not listening to anything that
happened beyond 3.15, we would be left with the
situation where Mr. Buxton's evidence is unchallenged.
Now, his credibility with regard to timings - the only
aspect of challenging his credibility with regard to
timings, may be post 3.15, as indeed you sought to do.
If I had stopped and said, "No, we are not asking any
questions on that point", you might have been left -
and indeed this could happen with other witnesses -
with a witness whose credibility with regard to timings
is entirely intact, and yet who may have been mistaken
with regard to certain aspects of the matter which may
affect the weight which one should give to his
evidence, but the only way to establish that might be
by asking him something or other about an event which
occurred a little bit outside my parameter.   That is,
if you like, the way I think we should use the time.   I
hope that helps?

     MR. RUSSELL:   Yes, it does.   Thank you very much.

     THE CORONER:   Have I succeeded in making myself
clear on this?  I hope I have.  What I am anxious to do
is I do not want to go into exploring the rescue, but
where it is necessary, either to complete a sentence,
as I say, or where it is necessary to establish whether
or not a witness's recollection is probably right or
probably wrong or whatever it might be, then if need be
we need to ask the odd question just to establish that.
I must confess I never thought about Mr. France in the
cordon because I was not taking him down that road
anyway, but you may be right.

      Is that all clear? You will convey that, no
doubt, to Miss Steel or Mr. King or whoever will be
here.   Very well, 10 o'clock tomorrow then.

         (The Inquests were adjourned until
          the following morning at 10 a.m.)~

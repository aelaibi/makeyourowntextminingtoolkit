FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL: PART I - APPEALS AGAINST FLA
DECISION


Thank you for your note of 26 September.


In policy terms I think it is desirable to retain the ability
of the police to appeal on the merits of decisions affecting
safety and licensing at a grounds^they provide cover - ie to
extend the existing power in section 5 of the 1975 Act to
cover the FLA. Anything less would seem to be a diminution of
the police's ability to interject - and an expression of
considerable trust in the judgement of the FLA.


It is difficult to obtain quickly an authoritative 'police
service' view to substantiate (or refute) my preference, but I
doubt if asked whether any match commander would volunteer to
give away his 'rights'; some would almost certainly feel
strongly the new appeal should be provided. I have spoken
informally to the Met, T020, who agreed with my proposed
response.


Please keep me informed of progress on this.

STATEMENT BY LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH ON HIS
VISIT TO HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith today visited Hillsborough Stadium in
Sheffield as part of the independent scrutiny announced by the
Home Secretary on 30 June.

He said:

“I know that a great deal has changed in and around the stadium
since the disaster, including the way police and the club deal with
the large numbers of fans who attend each match.

“However, I wanted to familiarise myself with the site of the events
of 15th April 1989, and with the atmosphere and build-up to a
major match.

“I am planning to go to Liverpool shortly to meet the relatives of
those killed and their legal representatives.

“The meetings I have will be private and I will not be making any
public comments on the evidence or representations which are
made to me during the course of the scrutiny. I hope to report my
findings to the Home Secretary towards the end of the year.”

“Anyone who feels that they are able to submit material to me
should contact my secretary via Room 1106, Home Office, 50
Queen Anne’s Gate, London SW1H 9AT.”

Please contact Sarah Clifford at the Home Office Press Office on
tel. 0171 273 4610 if you require further details.

VISIT TO HILLSBOROUGH




We spoke over the telephone and I am writing to confirm the details o f Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith’s private visit to Hillsborough on the evening o f Wednesday September 24 (match
against Derby County).

2.      The Judge will be visiting South Yorkshire police during the afternoon (the police
contact will be Mr Daines) and will arrive at Hillsborough between 1700 and 1730. He then
hopes to have a tour o f the ground, in daylight, and to observe crowd control in the build-up
to the match. He plans to remain for a while after kick-off at 1945, but will leave at about
half-time in order to make a reasonably early return to London.

3.     You suggested that the Club’s security officer, Mr Nesbit, might show the Judge
round and we would o f course be grateful for that.

4.      The Judge will be accompanied throughout the day by his clerk, Mr Catherall, and
myself. We will be travelling by car and it would be helpful if you could make arrangements
to look after our driver while we are at the ground.

 5.      The Judge’s visits to the police and Hillsborough will as I say be private. Neither we
 nor the police will be publicising them and I was grateful for your confirmation that the club
 will not do so either. But it is not impossible that news may get out - for example, journalists
 or press photographers who are at the ground to cover the match may work out what is going
 on.

6.       If that happens, there would be no harm in a few photographs being taken. But it
would be helpful if we could have the club’s assistance in managing the situation to ensure
that the Judge can see what he needs to without undue disruption.

   Please find enclosed for your convenience a car park pass for the use o f your driver on arrival
   at Hillsborough next Wednesday.

 We spoke, and I am writing to confirm the details of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith s visit to
 Sheffield on Wednesday September 24.

         The Judge, accompanied by his Clerk Graham Catherall, myself, and a driver will be
 arriving from London at about midday. The car will take us to your force headquarters at
 Snig Hill for lunch, and I am grateful to you for offering to fax me a map showing the way
 from the M l (junction 33).

 3.     After lunch, the Judge wishes to travel to Heeley to see the force archive o f material
 about the Hillsborough disaster. He then wishes to go to the Hillsborough ground in time to
 have a look around it in daylight if possible and to see police briefing and preparation for the
 match that evening. As I understand it that would perhaps mean leaving Heeley at about
 1630 or 1645.

 4.     The Judge will remain at the ground until some time after match kick-off (1945) but
 does not plan to stay until the end of the game. I imagine that we will be leaving at or
 before half-time to travel back to London in reasonable time.

 5.      Our party will be travelling by Government car throughout. I would be grateful if you
 could make arrangements for our driver to be looked after both at Snig Hill and at Heeley,
 and for a lead car to be on hand to guide us to Heeley, to the ground, and finally back to the
 motorway.

 6.     I have discussed these arrangements with Mr Mackrell, the Sheffield Wednesday
 secretary, and have written to him separately. The Judge’s visit to Sheffield will be private
 and we are not planning any publicity for it.

            tanking you in advance for your help

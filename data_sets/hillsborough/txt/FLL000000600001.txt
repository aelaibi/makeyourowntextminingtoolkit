                                  PRESS STATEMENT

                     THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUND

    Following a meeting held in Liverpool on 17th April 1989 under the
auspices of Liverpool City Council and Liverpool Football Club and
attended by representatives of Sheffield City Council, Nottinghamshire
County Council and Nottingham City Council and consultations with the
Metropolitan Boroughs of Knowsley, St. Helens, Sefton, and Wirral
Trustees were appointed for the Fund which is to help those injured or
bereaved in the terrible disaster at Hillsborough Football Ground,
Sheffield on Saturday 15th April 1989 and their families and dependants.

    The Trustees of the Fund are a past President of the Liverpool Law
Society, the Chairman of the Liverpool Stock Exchange, the President of
Sheffield Chamber of Commerce and the Chief Executive of Nottingham City
Council.




                                        13
    It is anticipated that within the next few days the Trustees will
execute a Deed containing the detailed declaration of trust and the
administrative provisions regulating the Appeal Fund.

    Donations may be made at any bank or building society for credit to
the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund at Barclays Bank, City Office,
Water Street, Liverpool L69 2EX Account Number 2056 5555, sort code
20-51-01, or at the Co-operative Bank, 84/86 West Street, Sheffield SI
3SX Account Number 50000005, sort code 08-90-75.

    The Trustees will have a discretion how and to what extent to benefit
individuals and to determine who are to be regarded as potential
beneficiaries.

    It has been decided to establish the Appeal as a discretionary trust
fund for the injured or bereaved and their families and dependants rather
than as a charity but the Trustees will hold on separate trusts any part
of the fund which they in their discretion decide is not immediately
required for the direct benefit of the victims of the disaster and their
relatives and dependants.  Such separate trusts will be available to
serve community needs in ways which commemorate both the disaster and the
generosity of those who respond to this appeal; but the most urgent
purpose of the appeal is to benefit the victims of the disaster and their
dependants.

    It is hoped that the Trustees will be able to make an early
distribution.  As soon as the Deed has been executed a copy will be
available at the principal office of each of the Local Authorities
referred to above. Anyone who has contributed to the appeal before
reading this announcement may, If he or she feels that it does not meet
the purposes for which he or she has made a contribution, apply to have
the contribution refunded. Any such application should be made to The
Trustees of the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal, 4 Water Street, Liverpool 2
not later than 28th April 1989, after which date all contributions made
will be Irrevocably part of the Appeal Fund.

    The Trustees are confident that this Appeal does reflect the generous
and widespread public reaction to this terrible disaster,

    A further Statement will be issued in due course outlining the
procedures for persons wishing to make claims on the Fund.

                                                 20th April 1989

                                                     Call for Royal Commission Inquiry.




                                          The football industry should be investigated by a

                         Royal Commission inquiry, says Liverpool City Council's
                         Hillsborough Disaster Working Party.



                                          The Commission should look at the financing of

                          professional football, the administration, policing and

                          safety at football grounds and consideration should be given

                          to fans being represented at all levels of the game.


                                          The call for the inquiry is just one of a list of

                          recommendations agreed this morning (Wednesday September 6)
                          at a meeting of the Working Party as part of its interim
                          report.

      Other recommendations include the abandonment of the
Government7s National Football Membership Scheme; all

perimeter fences be immediately withdrawn; request that the
police review their whole operational procedures and built
in basic and ongoing training of all officers detailed for
match duty.



      Cllr Harry Chase, Working Party Chair, said:

"Following the scale of mismanagement, complacency, neglect

and misplaced priorities detailed in Lord Justice Taylor's
interim report, we believe all aspects of the football
industry should be subject to a Royal Commission.



      "This is particularly warranted given that

pre-Hillsborough the police, the FA, the local authority and
the club all considered their responsibilities efficiently
discharged for the prestigious occasion.



      "Clearly, if Hillsborough was an example of the best

various agencies could offer, then football needs a complete
review of its operation."



                                            ends.

      HILLSBOROUGH WORKING PARTY INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS:
That -

la)   the provisions within the 'Green Guide7 to safety at
      Sports Grounds become mandatory forthwith;

lb)   the 'Green Guide' identifies the pitch area as the
      primary means of evacuation in a relevant emergency and
      becomes, at all stadia, considered as a 'suitable place
      of safety';

lc)   chapter 14 of the 'Green Guide' ('Crowd Control') be
      redrafted on the basis that its guidelines concentrate
      too much on the prevention of hooliganism at the
      expense of spectator safety. Crowd safety must
      dominate crowd management strategies;

Id)   a new chapter be introduced to the 'Green Guide'
      specifically covering turnstile facilities and their
      provision;

le)   the provision of the Green Guide be annually updated
      and reviewed.


2)    All pitch-perimeter fences to be immediately withdrawn
      and suitable arrangements for controlled pitch access
      be introduced.

3a)   Following recommendation 19 of the Hillsborough Report,
      we request the Government recognise the futility of its
      proposals for a compulsory 'National Football
      Membership Scheme' (as outlined in Part I of the ■
      Football Spectators' Bill).and abandon this proposal.

3b)   We request the Government withdraw its proposals on a
      'Football Licensing Authority' with a view to
      introducing separate legislation on this subject,
      pending meaningful negotiations with all relevant
      certificating local authorities and their Advisory
      Groups including fans representatives.

4)    Police Operational Orders be subject to regular
      monitoring and scrutiny by the ground safety
      certificating local authority.

5)    Request the Police to review their whole operational
      procedures for football matches to include a public-

                                           i
6)   A Royal Commission of Inquiry be set up with the
     following terms of reference] to investigate*-

           (i) the financing of professional football,*

         (ii) the administration of professional football;

         (iii) policing and public safety at football stadia.

          (iv) medical, emergency and wider spectator
               facilities at Football League grounds;

           (v) the issue of effective fans representation
               within clubs and on the governing bodies
               Which administer the game.


     Following the scale of mismanagement, complacency,
neglect and misplaced priorities detailed within L.J.
Taylor's Interim Report, we believe all aspects of the
football industry should be subject to a Royal Commission,
This is particularly warranted given that pre-Hillsborough
the Police, the P.A* the local authority and the Club all
considered their responsibilities efficiently discharged for
the prestigious occasion.   Clearly, if Hillsborough was an
example of the best the various agencies could offer then
football needs a complete review of its operation.

   t Following our call for a Royal Commission of Inquiry,
we intend to publish a ’’Fans' Charter” covering those areas
identified in the terms of reference and schedule outlined
m recommendation 6.

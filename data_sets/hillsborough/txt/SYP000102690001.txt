Senior Sub Divisional Clerk

South Yorkshire Police



I am employed as Senior Sub Divisional Clerk at Hammerton Road Police

Station and have held this post since January 1986.

Over the last eight years, I have worked on numerous major football

matches and carried out my duties either at Hammerton Road Police

Station or the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.

At the 1988 Semi Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, I

worked in the police caravan dealing with property confiscated from

Liverpool supporters.     This year I was asked if I had any preference

to which side I would like to work o n , and I chose to do the

Nottingham Forest property, due to it being very quiet last yea r.

At 9.30 am on Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at the

Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground and took up position in the 'Owls

Sho p1 dealing with confiscated property,    together with Police

Cons table 3063 Marshall.    It wasn't particularly busy property w i s e ,

so we kept ourselves busy talking to the Nottingham Forest fans, who

in my opinion, didn't appear to have had too much to drink.         They

were in a j ovial and carnival m o o d .

At approximately 2.50 pm the majority of fans had taken up their

places in the ground.

Police Constable Marshall and I were in possession of a personal

radio and we were listening for any instructions that we might
At 3.02 pm it seemed as though all hell had let loose.                                  Police Constable

Marshall and I couldn't               quite understand what was happening.                            We could

hear Police Sergeant 616              Goddard shouting and asking for the match to be

stopped.        We could not make out what was happening at all.                           Then we heard

over the personal radio that there were dead people which came as a shock

to us both.          We stood and listened to everything that was going                              off but I

cannot    remember       details      of   what     was    actually        said over      thepersonal

radio.

The Nottingham Forest fans started milling around again and kept asking

us if the match would be called off and we said we thought it would be.

At   approximately        4.30   p.m.      Police      Constable Ryan made              an announcement

over     the    tannoy    that     the     match    had     been    called        off    and     would       all

spectators please remain in their seats to enable the emergency services

to gain access to and egress from the ground.

In my view the           supporters did not take any notice of Police Constable

Ryan's     instructions.           Everybody        started       moving    away        from    inside       the

ground.         By    approximately        5.00    p.m.     the    Nottingham       Forest           fans    had

evacuated the ground.

Police Constable Marshall stayed in the caravan until 5.15 p.m. in case

any latecomers wanted their property.

At   approximately        5.20   p.m.      we   made      our way    to     the    gymnasium          to    seek

permission from either Chief Inspector Beal or Inspector Sewell to return

to Hammerton Road Police Station.

As we were stood near to the gymnasium I turned just as bodies were being

brought out of one of the emergency services vehicles into the gymnasium.

I stood        for   a minute    in    deep     shock      and    realised     I must          get    back    to

Hammerton Road Police Station to deal with whatever I could as I knew an

incident room would have to be set up.
                                                                                                                 /qr

I approached Inspector Sewell and he instructed Police Constable Marshall

and    myself     to    return    to   Hammerton             Road   Police       Station    to    deal    with

relatives and friends of supporters who might be missing.

I     arrived    back     at     Hammerton    Road            Police   Station       at        approximately

5.50    p.m.       My    first     duties    were            to   gather    as    much     stationery      and

equipment       for use    in the incident room.                    I then checked whether other

civilians would be available to work longer hours and make arrangements

for reliefs for the switchboard and on the enquiry desk.

I took     it upon       myself    to open      the          canteen   in    order       to make    tea    for

friends and relatives of the missing supporters.

From approximately 7-30 p.m. onwards, I carried out duties on the enquiry

desk    dealing    with    people      trying    to          contact   relatives         and    friends    and

advising them which hospital to contact.

I remained at Hammerton Road Police Station until 11.00 p.m. carrying out

duties that were required of me.

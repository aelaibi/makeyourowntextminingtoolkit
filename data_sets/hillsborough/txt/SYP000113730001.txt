the        entrance      to        the    ground        outside        the    main    gate.         As    I    joined        this

cordon        I   was        directed       by    a Senior Officer                  (I do not       know his          name      or

rank)       to go on the alley between the River Don and the rear of                                                  the West

Stand.            It    was        obvious        that something             was     happening       or       had        in fact

happened          inside           the    ground.          As     I    entered        this       alley    I     saw      people

entering the alley from behind the turnstiles.                                        Some of these people were

obviously          injured,          one     middle       aged    man        was    laid    in    the     alley       and      was

being attended to by Police Officers.                                   The man's face was blue and I got

the impression that he was already dead.                                     With other officers I gave what

assistance             I could       to     these       people.        These people were talking about a

pitch       invasion          and    a barrier           collapsing,          but I was          still unaware as               to

what had actually taken place.                             People        fetched out into this alley were

holding their chests, and                         ribs, some had leg and ankle injuries.

I was then directed to make my way along the full length of the alley to

ensure it was kept clear for emergency vehicles.                                            I found that the alley

went from the Leppings Lane entrance along                                         the full length of the South

Stand.        In parts             it widened out to form a small car park at the rear of

the South Stand.                   Here I found several Special Constables and asked them

to ensure that the alley was kept clear.                                     I then made my way back towards

the Leppings Lane entrance.

As     I     reached          the        point    where     I     first        saw     injured          persons          I     saw

that       numbers       here        h'ad    swollen       dramatically,              there       were     in       fact       now

10    or     12    corpses           laid    alongside           the     chain       link    fence       bordering             the

River       Don.         The        bodies        had     been        covered       over     with       Police        anoraks

and     tunic s.              By     this        time     several        ambulances          had     arrived             and     a

man    dressed          in    denim        was    going     amongst          the     injured.        The       man       worked

tirelessly sorting out people                           who required immediate attention or moving

to hospital.             I was later                told that he was a doctor.                      I also saw a man

in    his     twenties             who      was     dressed           in 'T'       shirt     and jeans,             he       was

persons       in that a l l e y was           too m u c h for        the a m b u l a n c e s at the scene.

E v e n t u a l l y several      o f f i c e r s were    told to fetch vans.

When     the m ore       seriously        injured had been              removed by a m b u l a n c e a n d the

laivge numbers,          a l t h o u g h they were         being a s k e d to stay w here they were

 his     time a m a j o r       incident.

The     numbers     leaving         the gro u n d w ere ma k i n g           it d i fficult for eme r g e n c y

A small       number     of the s u p p o r t e r s      leaving the ground seemed deeply

hostile       to P o l i c e    officers,       some     shouting          “YOU M U R D E R I N G BASTARDS".

I got     the    i m p r e s s i o n that any      small       incident        could turn the            crowd

             supporters.              I do no think           that had       I been    in p o s s e s s i o n of a

At 8.15 am on Saturday,                15 April,      1989,     I paraded for duty at Stainforth

Police      Station.         I was     then    conveyed       along    with   other    Officers        to   'A'

Divisional HQ at Doncaster.                   There I met with the rest of my serial under

the supervision of PS PEARSON.




From    Doncaster       we    were     conveyed    by    van    to Hillsborough         for a briefing.

After the briefing in the grandstand we were supplied with a packed lunch

which was eaten in the grandstand.




After    the        briefing     and    meal    the     serial    left     the    ground     and   took     up

position at the roundabout on Leppings Lane.                           The Officers in this serial

paired off and with PC 1900 KENT                      I took up position near the roundabout.

At this time the only Officer in that serial with a personal radio was the

Supervising Officer, PS PEARSON.




There was a steady flow of fans from the direction of Halifax Road through

the morning.          I was not aware at what time the turnstiles were opened.

                             m




A   large    number     of fans        arriving at Leppings Lane were carrying cans and

large plastic bottles of beer/lager.                      These supporters were informed that

they would not be allowed into the ground with alcohol or if they were in

fact drunk.          However, most elected to sit on the garage forecourt close to

the roundabout and drink their beer.




The crowds were          in good humour and although noisy and boisterous I saw no

fighting       or    similar     problems.         There       were    however,      quite   a   number     of

people      wandering        back    and   forth      along     Leppings      Lane    asking     for    spare

tickets.           These were both in groups and men acting on their own.




At approximately 2.30 pm there was a large increase in numbers approaching

the ground,          this eased off again as                  'kick off' approached.                 However, just

before        3 pm there             was    a rush       of supporters         from   the Halifax         Road,    some

were running and were spurred on by cheers from the ground.




Shortly         after     2     pm    a large       number    of supporters           were   escorted       from    the

local      station        (Wadd^ey Bridge)                to Leppings Lane.           They were           escorted by

mounted         officers        who    left       this    crowd at the end of Leppings Lane.                       This

group      had      been      by     far    the    rowdiest       of   all     supporters     arriving       at    that

area.         On    entering          Leppings       Lane    this      group    spread out      across      the road

although traffic was still travelling along Leppings Lane.                                       I was asked by

quite a number of supporters for directions to local public houses.                                                Some

just asked where                the nearest pubs were,                 others asked for various pubs by

name, these included The Beehive and The Horse and Jockey.




Shortly after 3 pm my serial was directed to move along Leppings Lane,                                                I

do not know if this direction was passed to PS Pearson over the                                              personal

radio      or      that    we      were     simply       moving    to our      pre-arranged standby point.

However, we walked the full length of Leppings Lane to the entrance to the

g r ou nd .




On   arrival         at    the       entrance       to the        ground I     saw    a number       of    Liverpool

supporters          in    the        road   outside the       ground, there           was    quite    a number       of

people but I cannot                   say how many as they were well spread out.                            A number

of Police Officers were being organised into a cordon across the entrance

to   the      ground,         outside       the    main     gate    (POINT      1 ON   MAP    OF THIS        ENTRANCE

ATTACHED).           As I joined this cordon I was directed by a Senior Officer (I

do not know his name or rank) to go on the alley between the river Don and

the rear of the West Stand.                       It was obvious that something was happening

or had in fact happened inside the ground.                                  As I entered this alley I saw

people     entering          the    alley       from       behind     the    turnstiles.       Some       of    these

people were obviously injured,                     one middle           aged man was laid in the alley

and was being attended to by Police Officers.                                 The man's face was blue and

I got the impression that he was already dead.                                 With other Officers I gave

what assistance I could to these people.                               These people were talking about

a pitch        invasion       and   a barrier collapsing but I was still unaware                                as to

what     had    actually       taken      place.           People fetched out into this alley were

holding their chests and ribs, some had leg and ankle injuries.




I was     then directed to make my way along the full length of the alley to

ensure     it was kept clear for emergency vehicles.                                 I found that the alley

went     from the       Leppings         Lane    entrance        along the      full length of the South

Stand.         In parts       it widened out to form a small                      car park at the rear of

the South Stand.              Here       I found several Special Constables and asked them

to ensure that the alley was kept clear.                               I then made my way back towards

the Leppings Lane entrance.




As   I   reached        the    point      where        I    first     saw    injured    persons      I    saw    that

numbers        here    had    swollen       dramatically,            there    were    in fact now 10 or            12

corpses laid alongside the chain link fence bordering the river Don.                                             The

bodies had been covered over with Police anoraks and tunics.                                      By this time

several        ambulances          had    arrived          and   a   man    dressed     in   denim       was    going

amongst        the    injured.       This       man worked           tirelessly      sorting out people who

required immediate attention or moving to hospital.                                    I was later told that
                                                      _   4   _


he was a doctor.           I also saw a man in his twenties who was dressed in "I"

shirt    and     jeans,    he     was obviously drunk.                    This    man    was    stood    by     the

corpses    and    was     shouting       to    nearby Police          Officers,         "WHY    DON'T    YOU     DO

SOMETHING       FOR THEM."             He grabbed at               two Officers who were                helping aman

with a leg injury.              I approached this man and he                      then moved off towards

the South Stand.          I was told to form a cordon with Officers infront of the

bodies.       We were stood in this position for some time, several Officers in

this    cordon were       in     possession          of keys        for Police          vans   and offered        to

make    them    available       for use       as   impromptu ambulances.                  They were      told to

stay put but it was quite obvious that the sheer volume of injured persons

in that       alley was     too much for the ambulances at the scene.                                  Eventually

several Officers were told to fetch vans.




When    the     more    seriously       injured       had     been    removed      by     ambulance      and     the

alley     was    being    cleared       of     the    lesser        injuries      several       barriers       were

placed     in     front    of       the bodies        and         canvas    sheeting       draped       over     the

barriers.        We were then released to stand outside the gates.                                By this time

supporters       were     leaving      the     ground       via     the    Leppings      Lane    end    in     large

numbers,       although they were being asked to stay where they were over the

P.A.    system.        I was still unaware of the cause of what was by this time a

major incident.




The    numbers     leaving      the     ground       were     making       it    difficult       for    emergency

services to gain access to the alley.




A small number of the supporters leaving the ground seemed deeply hostile

to Police Officers,             some    shouting,         "YOU MURDERING BASTARDS."                    I got the

impression        that    any    small        incident        could       turn   the     crowd    against        the
                                                                                            C 2 oq

Police.      A large crowd had gathered on Leppings Lane on the other side of

the river Don, they        were shouting          abuse at Officers stood near the gates.




When Leppings       Lane   had cleared I          tried to find the rest of my serial,      I

had had only fleeting contact with them since arriving at the ground.                       I

eventuallt met with PS Pearson and together with several Officers from 'A'

Division who became         separated      from    their   own serials we made   oujt way to

Clay Wheels Lane.          Whilst walking along Leppings Lane I was struck by the

large quantity of discarded beer tins in the road and gutters.




In recent years I have worked at this ground on a number of occasions both

inside    and outside      the   ground.     I have worked at 3 F.A.         Cup Semi-Finals

including the 1988         Liverpool and          Notts Forest match. I am quite familiar

with the layout of the ground and surrounding roads.




From   the   time   I arrived at     the     ground    after   the kick off until    I later

left the ground I only saw one person who I took to be a steward.                      I had

no idea of what had happened inside the ground until I spoke with persons

leaving the ground,         both Police Officers           and supporters.   I do not think

that had I been in possession of a personal radio I would have been able

to make use of it effectively other than to have an understanding of what

was happening, which I feel would have helped me in my job.

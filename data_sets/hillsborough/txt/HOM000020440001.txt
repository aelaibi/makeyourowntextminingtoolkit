            Dear Sir
                                                                   HILLSBOROUGH


           We thank you for your letter of 13th September and note the manner
           in which Lord Justice Taylor intends to proceed. If our clients
           can be of any assistance to His Lordship please do not hesitate to
           contact us.

           We would only add that our client would, if at all possible,
           welcome the opportunity of a private audience with Lord Justice
           Taylor in order to expand upon the views they have already put
           forward in their written submission. No doubt you will contact us
           in this regard if His Lordship feels it appropriate.


            Yours faithfully



           HILL DICKINSON DAVIS CAMPBELL

               Commenced            duty       at    8.15am        from    home         station          to    parade          for    duty      8.45am

               Arrived        at     Hillsborough                for    briefing             in N o r t h      Stand       attached          to

               serial        29 with           PS    1 561   Reynolds,             PC    1280 Hebdidge,                   PC    3145     Punton,        PC

 cm            Following            the       briefing        engaged         on     duties         at    Eskdale          Road       and

               Shenstone            Road       off    Leppings          Lane,        preventing               unauthorised             parking

               with       barriers            arriving       approximately                   11.05am.           At       that     time      Liverpool

               fans       arriving,            many       with     packs      of     beer      —    lager.           Remained          in t h a t

               area       mostly         in    company       with PS          Reynolds             on    foot       patrol        along      Leppings

               Lane       between         the       two    roads       above.           As    time       went       by    the     volume        of

               spectators            arriving             grew,    many       asking          for       directions             to P u b l i c     Houses

               and       it w a s    apparent             to m e    that      a    large        number         of    them       did    not      have

               tickets        for        the    match.           I must       have       been asked             at       least       50 — 60         times

               if    I had      any       spare       tickets.

                                                                                                                                                 REA



There       were          groups          of    f a ns     walking          up       and       down       Leppings           Lane          asking

others          for       tickets,             this      went        on    from       th e      time       of     my    arrival             at       the

point       until          just       before          kick-off.                 I saw          several          instances              of

spectators                purchasing              tickets            I think              25    was       the     asking          price.




The       mood       of    the       fans       arriving             was    generally                happy/boisterous/singing,

obviously             looking             forward          to       the    match.              I did       not     see       any       bad

behaviour             as       such       but    as      time        got    nearer             kick-off           there          were       still

many       asking          for       tickets.




From       about          2pm    I was          wi th PS            1561    Reynolds                standing           in    front          of       a

private          garage          area          almost          opposite          Eskdale             Road       just        after          I think

Bickerton             Road.           This       was       a    result          of    a    complaint              from       an       elderly

couple          who       were       washing          their          car    in       the       garage        area       regarding                fans

using       the       garages             as    a toilet.




From       that       point          we    could         see        down    Leppings                Lane     to    t he      bottom             at       the

roundabout                at    Penistone             Road,          during          that       time       there        was       a    continuous

stream          of    fans       arriving,               causing           problems             fo r      traffic           on    the       road ,

one       fan    was       spoken          to    by P S R e y n o l d s              for       deliberately                 walking             on       th e

road       in    front          of    a bus.             Th e       mood    was       generally              good       natured             and

enthusiastic.                    There          seemed          to    be    no       let       up    of    numbers           arriving                and

about       2.50pm             I made          the    point          to    PS    Reynolds              that       there          was       no    way

could       they          get    into          the    ground          for       kick-off,              and      for     them          to    do       so

the       kick-off             would       have       to       be    delayed.              About          3pm     I heard             on    PS

Reynold's             radio          that       there      was        a    large          c r o wd at        the      turnstiles                 and

apparent             trouble          there.




As    a    result          together             with PS R e y no ld s,                    PC   Bradley            and     PC     Severn              we
                                                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                                                           R24

went     directly             to    to       th e    turnstile              area,         large       numbers           of     persons

there,        I saw       some          climbing           up    over           the      wall    into       th e      ground         and       many

of    them      running            up a n d         climbing          over          the     turnstiles             themselves.                  The

time     then w o u l d            be    about        3.05pm          just          after       the       main     bulk        of    them       had

been     le t      in    through             the     gate       which          had       been    opened.              Not     knowing           at

that     time       that          the    gate        had    been          opened          I prevented              several           youths

from     climbing             over       the        turnstiles             and        moved      others          to     the     other          side

of    the     gates       in       front        of    the       turnstiles.                    Remained          there        and        several

’f a n s *    leaving             the    ground           then       informed             me    that       there        were        serious

problems           inside,          one       described              it     it as         being       worse        than       the        Heysel

disaster.




Many     people          leaving             th e    ground          now       and       the    general          attitude            now       was

of    anger        and    sheer          hatred           towards          the        Police,         many       threatening

officers           and    calling             us m u r d e r e r s ,           th e      main    were       very        hostile           towards

us,    so m u c h        so       that       I was        afraid          fo r      my    own and          other        officers

safety.            Many       of    them       were        in    tears.




About        3.20pm       I was          in d e s p e r a t e         need          of    the    toilet,           so    I went           into

the    ground           and       walked       down        the       side        of      the    North       Stand        to     the       toilet,

there        were       large       numbers           leaving             the       stand       by    them,        while        in       the

toilet        (alone)             I was       subjected              to    a     barrage         of       threats        and        abuse       from

about        3 0 n>en,        3    or    4    told        them       to    leave          me    alone       as     it w a s         not    my

fault,        if    they          had    not        done    this          I feel          sure       that    I would            have       been

assaulted.               On       leaving           the    toilet          I walked             around       the        back        of    the

West    Stand           trying          to    find a w ay             on       to     the      playing       area,           bu t    not

knowing         the      ground          could        not       get       on.         Unable         to    get     on    to    the        pitch       I

then    had        to    return          outside           the       ground           and      join       other       officers            there.

Ambulances              and       fire       tenders        were          arriving             now    and    a     steady           continuous
                                                                 *

stream        of    people          leaving           the       ground           and      the    abuse       and        threats

I   remained    there    until    we    were           stood                down      and     asked          to     regroup               in         the

North    Stand.     From   there       I walked                    with         my    serial         to C l a y w h e e l s               for

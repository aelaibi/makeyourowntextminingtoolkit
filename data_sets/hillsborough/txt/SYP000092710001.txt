                 was       in charge        of operations.                 Not many Liverpool                   supportengr came via

                 the       station,       perhaps            some 7 or & bus            loads.            These were all            gen e r a l l y

                 well       behaved,        and each bus             load was a c c o m p a n i e d by two               j   /6 1 i ce

                 officers, At about 2.40                       L>m (14^0)         we were        released Ji#y Inspector Dtn.Wb

                 took            to the football                  qround,        via Lanqs e t t Road,               lhere was               tue

                 sign of football                  fans until we a rr i v e d                 opposite H i l l s b o r o u g h           park,
                                                                                                         S3697

From there       the density of supporters walking                        towards       the ground

increased.           Amongst       them were     several       fans much the worse               for drink.

At the L e p pings Lane             entrance     to the ground the main                 road     itself was

fairly       clear,    the bus having          no d if f i c u l t y getting          past.      I saw that

the    pavement and the entrance                 to the     ground was          packed t i ghtly with

supporters.           The    pavement opposite           the entrance was              clear,     wit h 6 or 7

policemen standing                on the bridge facing            the entrance,          from across        the

road.        As the bus       continued down L e p p i n g s Lane            towards Halifax Road/

Pen i s t o n e Road,       I saw    large numbers         of supporters             up to     10 deep

walk i n g    towards       the    ground    in a continuous           stream along Leppings Lane.

As the bus turned             right      into P e ni st o n e R oad     I saw that           large    numbers

of supporters were                streaming    down Hali f a x Road from Wads l e y Bridge.

The    b u s / s topped     in Pen i s t o n e Road and        I went     into the grounds

gyrrmj^sium and sat with the                 rest of my serial            ready to be called for a

       .     After    some    ten minutes        l heard       that   there were         difficulties

w ith the      crowd at Leppings Lane.

A short       time    later       instructions      came    for us to        leave.          I met    up with

PS HALL and others                of serial    14 just outside            the    door.         I was told

that       there was      c r o w ^ t rouble   in the ground and that we were                        to go on

to the       per imetep^ track       .
1 f o l lowed Ro 690 HALL             between the Kop and the North Stand and onto

the    per iwfet e r track.          We turned      right and we n t up in front                  of the

N o r t h St and towards           the Leppings Lane           terracing.

I saw that the foot ba 11 roat c h was                still       'in p r o g r ejj-^T ^ and    Chat tans

from       the Leppings Lane          terracing      were      c 1 im fajyrtg^ou t     over    the    fences     to

PS 690 HALL stopped and spoke                    to an     Inspector        some 2/3 of the way down

towards Leppi ngs L a n e .

I saw that a large                number    of fans were        standing        on the       perimeter     track
                                                                                                          P AGE           3
                                                                                                          S3697

and on the edge              of the      pitch to the        rear     of the Leppings Lane               goal.        I

was    directed to           the North Stand corner                of the     perimeter      track,       and

formed    part       of a police        cordon from the goal                to the N orth Stand along

the edge of the             pitch.

At this       time    the m atch was          still    in progress.            People were         still

climbing       u p into the stand from the L e p pings Lane                         terrace,       and over

onto    the    pitch.        1 saw     some objects          being    thrown out of the terrace

onto    the area behind the g o a l ,

There was a general                m o v ement   of supporters along               the    perimeter       track

from the goal          towards        the Ngr'th S t a n d .        People were          climbing    over       the

fence    behind the goal a n / onto                  the   perimeter        track and       pitch.       Several

supporters were
                                    /
                             leanj/ng against or sitting                   on the ad v e r t i s i n g

hoardings.           They    looked to be          in some d iscomfort             but did not appear             to

be s e r io usly      injured.

The area of terracing                 next    to the N orth S tand had plenty of                    room    in

it.     The    corner       gate    leading      to the terrace was              open.      Together with

other    officers       I directed           people    off the       pitch and towards             the gate,

and b a c k on to th e te rr a c i n g .

More    and more       people were           coming    from my       left,     and trying       to keep

between these          people and the Kop end the                    line of       police m oved back

towards       the edge of the           penalty area.              At this time the m atch had been

stopped,       but    players were           still    on the       pitch.      At this      time    I saw that

a Police       officer was          involved       in an a l t e r c a t i o n with a member             of the

public    near       to the N orth S tand            corner.        This    provoked some h o s t i l i t y

from the supporters                on the terrace.            Together with other              officers,

I went    to the       corner of the             pitch.      The    s i t uation    calmed down fairly

rapid]

A number       of fans were making                their way towards            the Kop end,         several

the m w a v i n g t h e i r a rms agg r ess i v e 1y and s hau tin g a t pe o p 1e i n t he

Nortsi Stand.          1 saw that the             pilayers    haci left the         pitch and       i»nau a
large      cordon of Police Of ficers                  had formed a cordon across                     the      pitch

towards        the Kop end of the ground.                     I a tt e m p t e d    to keep fans who were

coming       from the L e p pings Lane             end on that          end of the ground and

g ra du a l l y went         back towards        the Kop end.           1 jo i ne d the        cor do n of

Po 1 i c e 0 f f i c s rs who were         by now on the naif way                   line.      I was at         the

N o r th Stand end of the                line,    which only        reached the touch                line.

Some     fans        in front    of me were        gesti c u l a t i n g   to the North S t a n d ,

a p p a r en t l y    showing    off the        fact   that    they were           on the    pitch.         At this

time     1 was        intercepting        fans making         their way towards              the Hop end.

M any    seemed        to be shocked or bemused.                  They were          looking        for   friends

and     relatives,           seek i ng f i rXt aid or j ust want i ng ta                   1 save    the ground.

I a t t em p t e d     to keep             in the L e p pings         Lane    end of the ground.                  Insp

WALL A C E appea r e d         to £ &    in charge      of the      cordon.          Another        Inspector wai

some diff i c u l t y hearing             it.     1 asked      if there were any              instructions

but got        no reply.

I saw that            people were        being    carried on stretchers                from the Leppings

Lane end towards               the Kop.         Fans   from the N orth Stand started tearing

up the a d v er ti si ng         hoardings and taking               them to the L e p pings Lane                  end.

I returned to the               cordon,

Some     time        later    I was     instructed by ljr& p WALL AC E t o go along with the

rest of the            cordon to P e n istone ffefad to             control         fans    leaving       the

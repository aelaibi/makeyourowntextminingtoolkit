PART IV OF THE PUBLIC ORDER ACT 1986:W EXCLUSION ORDERS                                       .


Thank you for sending me a copy of your note of 26 June to Mr Grant.


2.   I very much support your view that we should seek to educate magistrates
courts further in the intelligent use of the exclusion order powers and
welcome the proposed Circular, #ven if further research indicates that there
are particular and inexplicable gaps in the exercise of these powers, I agree
that with the demise of the national football membership scheme and the
forthcoming football season it is proper and timely to issue a reminder.                                I
hope this will be acceptable to Mr Grant.


3.   You asked if there were other ways in which the message about exclusion
powers could be put across.     The speeches with which you and I are direetly
concerned are in practice delivered only to police audiences - that is to
say, to the converted.     But perhaps Mr Grant would be able to indicate where
opportunities might arise to convey messages to audiences in which the
magistrates feature.     Beyond that, we must look for opportunities to
reinforce tte-publicity given to this whole area of business.                            It is hard to
                           the orders themselves, but experience recently;lias

system                           the draft Circular) might be possible.                           And
                                  decisions are announced and perhaps followed
                                 !s recommendations.   Finally; for what it is
                                 ry to encourage magistrates to pay “training"

                shown that there is an appetite for information about, for example, thefNFIU.
                Linking the HFIU’s functions with the reinforcement of the exclusion order
                system (to which you refer in the draft Circular) might be possible.                      And
                there will be future pegs when decisions are announced and perhaps
                through on Lord Justice Taylor’s recommendations.                Finally; for what 1
                worth, I believe it is customary to encourage magistrates to pay "training"
                visits to people at the "sharp end of law enforcement.                  I wonder if a ;;
                worthwhile group could be put together to visit the NFIU, where the general

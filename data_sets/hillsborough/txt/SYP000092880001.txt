 trying         to    catch          their        breath.             I did       not      s ee a n y o n e     near     me    in a n y

 We    decided            to    get       up     into       t he W e s t      Stand,        some man      gave/ us a lift                   up

 the      st an d.

  We   found         two       empty       seats           t e n or     twelve        rows       from     the    front        and     sat

 down and            I started             to     feel        c o ld a n d      shiver.            I saw       people     being

\ carried across                 the       pitch and              others        ly in g     motionless           on     the    p i t c h as

  if   they were               dead .          I was        too    far a w a y        to    identify any              dead     or     injured,

       looked across                 to    the N o r t h S t a n d            and     could        see m y      father        w as

 distressed               so we       decided              to m a k e    ou r     way      to    him.      We    left     the W e s t

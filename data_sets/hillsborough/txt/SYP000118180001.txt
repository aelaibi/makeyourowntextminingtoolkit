IAIN WILLIAM ASKEW                                                                         R179




DETECTIVE CONSTABLE 1209




HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION




I am a Detective Constable in the South Yorkshire Police presently stationed

at Hammerton Road Police Station, Hillsborough, Sheffield.

I have eight and a half years service and during this time I have policed a

large number of football matches at Hillsborough in both uniform and plain

clothes.      Whilst in uniform the majority of my duties at Hillsborough were

at   the     Leppings     Lane   end     involved   in    various     duties   including   coach

reception,        turnstiles,    and   general   public    order    patrols.    I worked    last

year's semi-final at Hillsborough between the Liverpool and Nottingham clubs

in plain clothes and experienced no problems.                   I have always prided myself

on   the    positive     and well      run   policing    operations   at Hillsborough which,

without doubt,        made it one of the best grounds in the country for football

fans to attend        and enjoy a trouble free match.

At 8.30 am on         Saturday 15      April 1989, I signed        on duty at Hammerton Road

Police Station        CID office.       My duty at the match was to be in plain clothes

working under         Detective Sergeant McSloy and Detective Inspector Towell on

the pick-pocket squad, this tour of duty was to commence at 9*00 am.                        This

squad had been set up in an effort to identify and catch persons, believed

travelling Liverpool          fans,    who were responsible         for pick-pocket offences.

There      were   a   large   number   of    complaints    from supporters     at the previous

semi-final in 1988, relating to pick-pocket offences.
On arrival at the station I was informed that a prisoner I had circulated as

wanted    had    been    arrested   and required    interviewing.      I liaised with the

Custody Officer and Detective Inspector Towell,               after which I attended the

match briefing at Hillsborough with other CID officers.                    The briefing was

much the same as the previous year with no significant alterations.                   After

the briefing I returned directly to Hammerton Road Police Station and dealt

with my prisoner completing my dealing with him at 1.30 pm the same date,

after which I walked alone to Hillsborough football ground intending to meet

up with Detective Inspector Towell, Detective Sergeant McSloy and other CID

personnel working the pick-pocket operation.

The    walk to the       ground along Middlewood Road and down Leppings Lane went

peacefully enough but I noticed a large queue of fans outside Threshers Off

Licence near Hillsborough corner on Middlewood Road and as I continued up

the road, although there was a good Police presence along the route, there

were a large number of fans I passed and observed in the Park carrying and

drinking      from beer cans, usually they were in possession of packs of four

cans,    they were all good natured and no signs of trouble was apparent.                 In

Hillsborough Park nearer to the Leppings Lane end I did see half a dozen

fans    urinating       in full view of the      public,    obviously well    the worse   for

drink.     It was hard to determine from which city they hailed.

I continued down Leppings Lane and met up with Detective Inspector Towell,

Detective       Sergeant McSloy and other officers,           namely Detective Constables

Hallam,       Locking,   Lawrence   and Lilley.         I moved   into a position near the

gates    to    the   turnstiles where,    with    the    other officers,   I kept   in close

contact    with      Detective   Constable Hallam       who was   stood alone with a large

wallet in his rear trouser pocket acting as bait for the pick-pockets who we

expected to be in the area.            I would estimate that the time would be 1.50
pm.     The crowd in the Leppings Lane area at this time appeared orderly and

officers on duty were managing to Police the situation effectively.

As    time went by the crowd gradually grew in density within the                                turnstile

area    and    up    to the roadway.            The mounted officers were doing                 everything

possible to keep the crowd moving, so much so that myself and other plain

clothes officers were moved on repeatedly.                         Nevertheless, the situation was

still    orderly      at   this     time.        I moved      into    a position     inside     the    small

protected area caused by the ground gates being in the fully open position,

from where I could clearly see Detective Constable Hallam and not get moved

about by the crowd.              Whilst stood in this position I recall being pushed and

watching three Liverpool fans urinate up the dividing fencing between those

fans    queuing for        the West Stand and those                  for the Leppings Lane end.            I

would estimate that the time would be 2.20 pm at this time and I thought

this    is getting a bit congested and I moved from this position to outside

the gates.          From this point onwards the situation outside the ground seemed

to steadily increase in intensity and deteriorate.                            I was repeatedly asked

by Liverpool fans if I had tickets for sale.                          I then witnessed fans walking

towards       me    with   their    tickets      in their      hands    in readiness       to    enter   the

ground when other Liverpool fans moved up to them and snatched the tickets

out of their hands which resulted in a confrontation after which the tickets

were    returned.          The     time   now    would   be    approximately        2.25   pm    and   after

talking       to    Detective       Constable      Hallam      I     voiced   the   opinion      that    the

operation regarding pick-pockets was impossible in such a dense crowd and we

withdrew to a position where                    the broken white line is marked on Leppings

Lane prior to entering the ground area.                       On standing there and watching the

situation it was obvious that we had problems regarding the crowd control.

The horses, which numbered four, were proving ineffective and were having
difficulty       in moving in       the crowd.       We were joined by Detective Sergeant

McSloy and other officers,             after which Detective Sergeant McSloy mentioned

two persons whom he suspected of being involved in pick-pocket                                  offences.

Together with Detective Sergeant McSloy and Detective Constable Locking, I

walked along Leppings Lane towards Wadsley Bridge in an effort to locate the

two suspects.        As we moved along the road there were a large number of fans

walking     towards    the    ground,      many    were     drinking    from   cans       and   they    all

appeared merry and in good spirits                  and quite orderly.            We      turned at Law

Brothers garage and walked back towards the ground amongst a constant stream

of   Liverpool     supporters        who   filled    half    of   the   roadway      as    well   as    the

footpath.        I was asked about tickets all along the return journey to the

ground,     always    the    same     'Have   you     any    tickets     for   the     game?',     always

delivered in a scouse accent.

As we approached the ground I heard a siren from behind and on looking round

I    saw   the    Police     short    wheel       based   Land    Rover    approaching          with    its

headlights illuminated.             The Land Rover pulled up outside the Leppings Lane

end facing into the crowd.              Myself, Detective Sergeant McSloy and Detective

Constable Locking went and stood nearby.                      The occupant in the vehicle was

Police     Constable Mick Buxton.             Police Constable          Buxton alighted          from   the

vehicle and delivered a message over the PA system attached to the vehicle

requesting the Liverpool fans to move back and stop crushing at the front.

This was repeated numerous times and appeared to have no effect whatsoever

on the crowd.         At this time I remember stopping an elderly man, who passed

me as I stood beside the Land Rover telling him to stay out and not to go

any further into the crowd, trying to get into the ground, he just looked at

me and carried on pushing into the crowd in front of me.                        The time now would

be about 2.45 pm.          The mounted Police Officers were hard pressed to stay on
their    horses.        The     PA    system    was    later   taken over     by    an   Inspector who

repeated the message Police Constable Buxton had been saying.                             At this time

I also recall seeing Chief Inspector Creaser from South Yorkshire beside the

Land Rover.

The situation was by now desperate with fans climbing onto the tops of the

turnstiles and then pulling up others to escape the                          crushing below.       Still

large contingents              of supporters continued to arrive at the                      ground inlarge

numbers and continued to swell the crowd outside the ground.                              Some had the

good     sense     to   walk         over the   road    and    stand   on   the    footpath but    these

numbered only a few dozen,               therest continued to try toget into the ground.

It was also apparent                 that not   all had tickets for the            match as myself and

other plain clothes officers                continued to be asked had we tickets for the

match.       The time now would be nearing the kick-off and the situation outside

the ground at Leppings Lane was serious.                       Detective Sergeant McSloy decided

that we would be better utilised elsewhere and we made our way via Vere Road

to the gymnasium.             As we walked down Vere Road a large cheer went up from

the ground and fans in Vere Road began to run passed us towards the Leppings

Lane end of the ground.                 On arrival at the gym I got something to eat and

sat down with other CID officers inside the gym.                            Almost as soon as I had

sat down reports               began    to come       into the gym that people had been            killed

inside the ground             after which the first body arrived in the gym, which was a

young boy.         I was ordered with certain other officers to remain inside the

gym.

I began to check the boy for any signs of life and almost immediately I was

surrounded by uniform officers who were all bringing people who were dead

and injured into the gym area.                   From then on I was involved in the laying

out     of   the   deceased           and looking     after    theirpersonal       effects   and    later

              in some of the identifications by relatives and friends.

immediately        p r i or      to    the    briefing         taking           place.         Chief       Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD        was      followed          by    other      officers           including           Superintendent

MURRAY,       Inspector          SEWELL,          and    DS CHARLESWORTH.                     Superintendents

GREENWOOD,        MARSHALL and CHAPMAN w e r e also                              present          a n d at    the

conclusion        of Mr       D U C K E N F I E L D ’S a d d r e s s       they went           off w i t h      their

respective        Sub Sector               Commanders        and      went a r oun d           their       particular

areas.    Dealing        with         the    detail       content          of    the    briefing           by Mr

DUCKENFIELD,         quite        frankly          I am     unable         to    remember          now m u c h a b o u t        what

was    said.      This      is    partly          because       of    the       t ime    t ha t    has     elapsed      and

partly    because        of a         lot    of w h a t     was      being       said did          not     have     a direct

bearing       on a n y   of m y a r e a s          of    r e s p o n s i b i 1 ity.       I have         performed        duties

at    football     matches            in the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e          Police          area     including

Hillsborough         over a           period       of    twenty       five       years and           the      briefing      by

Chief    Superintendent                DUCKENFIELD            w as    much       in     line      with what         I expected

for    a match      of    that        scale.        It w a s      a full         and     comprehensive              briefing

which    in m y     opinion           should       not    have       left       any     officer       present        unclear

about    his     duties       and      responsibilities.

Although       I attended             at    the    ground       from 6 am             (0600)       on the m o r n i n g         of

15th A pr il      1989      (150489),             I did     not      so    far as        I can       recall       attend        the

mass    briefing         conducted           in the N o r t h S t a n d           by C h i e f      Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD,         consequently                 I am    unable          to    comment        on the         content     or

quality       of sa m e .        I was       engaged        during         this       t ime    on a d m i n i s t r a t i v e

duties    elsewhere           in the         ground       probably             in the     gymnasium.

               I am a Liverpool                      supporter,               on S a t u r d a y       15th April           1989    I went        to

              Hi lls borough with                     two      mates.            We      went     by    train       to S h e f f i e l d    I paid £6

              for        my    ticket          from     a friend              at w o r k .        It w a s     for     the     Lepppings          Lane

              end.            At       S h e f f i e 1d w e    had a          police       escort         t o the      ground       and     got    there

              at    about               415    pm.     There            was    no     trouble          and    the     turnstiles           were    quite

              empty.

               I asked             some       police       outside            for     directions.              When      I got      inside        the

              ground           I didn't           know where              to     go.       I saw        the    tunnel        and walked           through

               it    into          pen 3.          I got       t o my         pl a c e    betweeen           1440 -      1 4 25    pm.      It was

              packed already                     ~ except           for       the     sides       at    the    t o p whi ch we re           empty.

              I was           leaning          against         a    barrier,             but as        the^rush         got       worse,     my mate

                              h e l p e d me      underneath              a n d we        stood        in f r o n t    of    the    barrier.            Th e

              c r owd         surge         began     to      get       worse       and    at     a    certain        po int      the    only     thing
                                                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                                                               S58

             I could move                 was     nvy h e ad .          This    would          be    j ust    before        kick       off    time.

             I could           see    people trying                 to    get    over          the     barriers        on    to    the       pitch    &

             police        were       pushing           &    shouting          “ push-b-ac k . "

             Eventually              I saw        the       gate    leading          to    the       pitch was         opened          & people

             started           to    get    out.            The    gate    would          be    to m y       right.

             After       a w h i 1 e it           started          to    ease    off       at       the    back    of me         and    1 was

             pul led       o u t , I went            back         through       the       t u n n e 1 I was        then aware            of    bodies

             in t he       courtyard.                People         were       helping          to     carry      them      to    the

             ambulances              at    th e    back.           This    would          be    between          1515 &      1530       pm.     I sa w

             loads       of     policemen            by      their       vans    &    cars          just     standing        about.

             A    p o 1 i ce    lady       came      up      & t o o k m y s h i r t & j a c k e t off - I w a s v e r y

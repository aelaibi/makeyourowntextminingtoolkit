     SCRUTINY OF EVIDENCE RELATING TO THE HILLSBOROUGH
                 FOOTBALL STADIUM DISASTER


                                      REPORT

Introduction

1.    On 15 April 1989 an FA Cup semi-final soccer match between Liverpool and
      Nottingham Forest was to take place at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, the
      home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. Play was stopped after six
      minutes when it became apparent that Liverpool spectators on the standing
      terrace behind one of the goals had been seriously crushed. Ninety-five
      people died and over 400 required hospital treatment. A ninety-sixth victim
      died in 1993.

2.    This tragic incident - in terms of deaths the worst in the history of British sport
      - occasioned a series of investigations and other proceedings. Lord Justice
      Taylor conducted a public inquiry, for which the West Midlands Police, acting
      as an independent investigating force, collected a massive amount of evidence.
      The Director of Public Prosecutions considered laying serious criminal
      charges against police officers and others. The Police Complaints Authority
      considered complaints which had been laid against the chief officer of the
      force and against other police on duty at the ground. There were Coroner’s
      inquests, whose conduct was itself later considered by the Divisional Court.

3.    On 30 June 1997 you appointed me to conduct a scrutiny into whether there is
      any fresh evidence which might have a bearing on the various legal procedures
      and decisions that have been taken. My terms of reference are as follows:

      To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
      Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available;

               (a)    to the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

               (b)    to the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney
                      General fo r the purpose o f discharging their respective
                      statutory responsibilities; or

               (c)   to the Chief Officer o f South Yorkshire Police in relation to
                     police disciplinary matters;
and in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available
is o f such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State fo r
the Home Department o f a further public inquiry; and in relation to (b) and
(c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered by them
which may be relevant to their respective duties; and to advise whether there
is any other action which should be taken in the public interest.

I now submit my report.

My report is divided into seven chapters, with Appendices. Chapter 1 sets
out the background to the Hillsborough disaster and the sequence of events
since. Chapter 2 deals with allegations about video evidence relating to the
disaster. Chapter 3 discusses allegations about the inquest and the rescue
operation following the disaster. Chapter 4 is about suggestions that improper
pressure has been put on witnesses to the disaster. Chapters 5 and 6 deal
with issues that have been put to me by the relatives of victims and some other
miscellaneous points. Chapter 7 summarises my findings.

I should like to record my sincere thanks to my secretary Chris Bone and my
Clerk Graham Catherall who have greatly assisted me throughout my scrutiny.
I should also like to thank Mike Ward who has also helped me from time to
time.
CHAPTER t - The background


The sequence of events since the disaster


1.     It will be helpful first to set out the broad sequence of inquiries and
       investigations following the disaster. Two days afterwards, on 17 April 1989,
       the then Home Secretary appointed Lord Justice Taylor (as he then was and
       whom I shall refer to as Lord Taylor) to conduct an inquiry. On 24 April,
       West Midlands Police were instructed to investigate the disaster for the
       purpose of Lord Taylor’s Inquiry.

2.    Lord Taylor’s Inquiry held public sessions between 15 May and 29 June
      1989. 174 witnesses gave evidence and much other material in the form of
      statements and video evidence was made available to the Inquiry. On 4
      August, Lord Taylor’s interim report was published. He concluded that
      'the main reason fo r the disaster was the failure o f police control’ (interim
      report, para 278).

3.    On 18 April 1990, Dr Popper, the Coroner for South Yorkshire began the
      first of 95 mini inquests to decide the statutory questions as to who each of
      the deceased was and when and where he or she died. He did not deal at
      that stage with the remaining statutory question of how each victim died,
      since that could not be answered pending the decision of the Director of
      Public Prosecutions (DPP) as to whether or not any prosecutions should be
      brought against any of those involved.

4.    On 11 July 1990 the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) directed that
      disciplinary charges of neglect of duty be preferred against Chief
      Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray. Mr Duckenfield
      had been in overall control of the police operation for the semi-final at
      Hillsborough, and Mr Murray was in control of operations in the ground.

5.     Both officers had been in the police control box with good views of the part
       of the ground where the tragedy occurred. In November 1990 Mr
       Duckenfield retired on grounds of ill-health. Since disciplinary charges can
       only be pursued against serving police officers, this meant that the complaint
       against him had to be dropped. The PCA subsequently announced that it
       would not pursue the charge against Mr Murray on the ground that it would
       be unfair to pursue what was in essence a joint charge against one officer
       only.

 6.    In the autumn of 1990 the DPP announced that there would be no
        prosecutions. On 19 November the inquests were resumed at Sheffield.
        These proceedings are often referred to as the 'main’ or 'generic’ inquest,
       since they were concerned with the question common to all the (then) 95
       deceased of how they came to their deaths.

7.     Around 200 witnesses gave evidence at these resumed inquests, including 56
       who had done so before Lord Taylor. On 28 March 1991, the jury returned
       verdicts of accidental death in all 95 cases, by majorities of 9 to 2.

8.     In April 1992, a Memorial was presented to the Attorney-General inviting
       him to exercise his powers under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 asking
       him to apply for new inquests on the basis of evidence that had come to light
        since the original inquests. In August of that year the Attorney-General
        announced that he had declined to do so.

9.     On April 6th 1993, six families who had lost relations at Hillsborough were
       granted leave to move for judicial review to quash the verdict of the inquest
       and seek a fresh inquest. On 5 November 1993 the Divisional Court
       dismissed their application.

10.    Civil claims for compensation have been made throughout the period since
       the disaster. The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has not contested
       liability for these claims, though he has sought contribution from other
       parties. Paragraph 65 of this chapter gives details in relation to the claims
       which have been settled.

11.    On 5 December 1996, Granada Television broadcast a programme entitled
       ‘Hillsborough’. The programme presented an emotive and powerful picture
       of the plight of the bereaved immediately following and in the aftermath of
       the tragedy. It also suggested that there was fresh evidence which had not
       previously been considered which called into question the verdict at the
       inquests and perhaps also some other decisions.


The scrutiny

 12.   Since my appointment to conduct this scrutiny in June, I have had evidence
        either in writing or in person from a wide variety of people. There is a full
        list of those from whom I have taken evidence in person, or otherwise
        consulted, at Appendix 1. As well as the people listed there I have had about
        30 letters about my scrutiny from members of the public.

 13.   I have read the evidence given at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and most of that given
         at the Inquest. I have examined many of the ‘body files’ which contain
         information about individuals who died and considered other material, the
         nature of which will be apparent from my report. I visited Hillsborough
         Football Stadium on 24 September.

 14.   I have in particular had written submissions from Mr Alun Jones QC and Mr
         Julian Knowles, Counsel for the Hillsborough Family Support Group, which
      represents many of the families of those who died. I discussed these with
      Counsel, who were accompanied by the Chairman and vice-Chairman of the
      Group, in late September. I then visited Liverpool, where I met all those
      families personally who wished to see me. I appreciate the thoughtful and
      constructive way in which the family members whom I met on that occasion,
      and since, have put their points to me.

15.    Since my visit to Liverpool, I have had meetings with a number of other
       people who expressed their concern to me about the disaster, or who I thought
       could help me in my scrutiny. I am very grateful to all those who have
       helped me in the course of my scrutiny.


Evidence

16.    My terms of reference mention evidence which was not available to the earlier
       inquiries into the disaster, and invite me to judge whether any such evidence is
       significant in various ways. In an event of the magnitude of Hillsborough,
       witnessed by so many people, there will inevitably be evidence which is ‘new’
       in the sense that it has not surfaced before. I therefore think that it is
       important at the outset of my report to establish what the concepts of ‘new’
       and ‘significant’ evidence must mean in the context of the Hillsborough
       disaster.


a) - evidence which is ‘notpreviously available ’

17.    Much of the evidence which I have been invited to consider, including that of
       the two witnesses Dr Walker and Mr Houldsworth upon whom reliance is
       placed by the Family Support Group, has been previously available in the
       sense that their existence was known at the time of Lord Taylor’s Inquiry or
       the Inquests and written statements were taken from them. But for one
       reason or another they were not called to give oral evidence to Lord Taylor or
       the Coroner, or their evidence may not have been considered by the
       prosecuting and police disciplinary authorities and the Divisional Court.
       Evidence which falls into this category might in my opinion be regarded as not
       having been previously available, so long as it was not - at the time of Lord
       Taylor’s Inquiry or the Inquests - in the public domain.

18.    I would regard evidence as being in the public domain if the substance of it
       was known to the legal advisers of the parties - including the legal advisers of
       the families. In the case of items such as videotapes, or other ‘exhibits’, I
       would regard them as not previously available if they were unknown to Lord
       Taylor’s Inquiry team or to the Coroner, or if it seemed that Lord Taylor’s
       team or the Coroner did not appreciate their significance. I would also regard
       videotape or other evidence as not previously available if its existence was
       unknown to the legal advisers acting for the families - even if Lord Taylor or
       the Coroner knew about it.
19.   But I should make it plain that I have looked at all the evidence I have been
      asked to consider, whether it was previously available in this sense or not.


h) - ‘significant evidence’

20.    In order to be significant a piece of evidence must first of course be credible,
       but it must also differ in some important way from evidence which has already
       been given. Over 50,000 people were present in the Hillsborough Stadium
       on the day of the disaster. Many others were involved in the rescue
       operation, including police, ambulance and fire service personnel, doctors
       and nurses. It is highly unlikely that any two had precisely the same
       perception or recollection of the fast moving and horrific events.

21.   The West Midlands Police took 3,776 statements from witnesses. These
      included the people who were most involved, but even so this was only a
      fraction of those who witnessed something of the events. Lord Taylor was
      satisfied from the evidence that he heard that he was able to reach the
      necessary conclusions for the purpose of his report. He said that to have
      heard further evidence would not have added significantly to the picture
      (interim report para 14).

22.   Lord Taylor had to decide a number of controversial issues, for example
      why the police lost control of the crowd outside the Leppings Lane
      turnstiles. The evidence of witnesses who have not previously come
      forward is unlikely significantly to affect the weight of the evidence already
      given on these controversial issues.


(c) - evidence, significant enough to justify a new public inquiry

23.    So far as a further public inquiry is concerned, the new evidence needed to
       justify one would in my view have to be such that there would be a real
       possibility that the conclusions reached by Lord Taylor in his Report might
       be different. Neither Counsel appearing on their behalf nor any of the
       families who I have seen in interview had any criticism of Lord Taylor’s
        Inquiry or the conclusions that he reached.

24.    I would also recommend a further public inquiry if I considered that there
        was an important aspect of the disaster or its aftermath which had not been
        sufficiently investigated, and that it was in the public interest that it should
        now be investigated, notwithstanding the long lapse of time.
(d)   -    evidence o f such significance that I should draw it to the attention o f the
          Director o f Public Prosecutions, the Attorney-General or those in charge o f
          police disciplinary matters

25.       The Director of Public Prosecutions had the responsibility of deciding
          whether criminal proceedings, in practice charges of manslaughter, should
          be brought against any corporate body or individual. In their submissions to
          me Counsel for the Family Support Group have only invited me to make a
          recommendation to the DPP in the case of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray
          (see note 1).

26.       The DPP, accepting the advice of two very experienced Queen’s Counsel,
          concluded in 1990 that there was not sufficient evidence to justify such
          charges against either of these officers. The fresh evidence therefore would
          have to be of sufficient significance that there is in my view a real possibility
          that in considering it the DPP might change her mind and institute
          proceedings for manslaughter, or any other offence, against one or both of
          these officers.

27.       My terms of reference also mention the Attorney-General. The Attorney-
          General has powers under the Coroner’s Act 1988 in relation to Inquests.
          Section 13 provides that:-

                  ‘.... where on an application by or under the authority o f the
                  Attorney-General, the High Court is satisfied .... where an inquest
                  has been held .... that (whether by reason o f fraud, rejection o f
                  evidence, irregularity o f proceedings, insufficiency o f inquiry, the
                  discovery o f new facts or evidence or otherwise) it is necessary or
                  desirable in the interests o f justice that another inquest should be
                  held, the High Court may .... order another inquest to be held into
                  the death .... [and] .... quash the inquisition on that inquest’.

28.       In their written submissions to me Counsel for the Family Support Group
           stated “it is accepted, eight and a half years after the event, that it is
           impracticable and may be undesirable for fresh inquests to be convened.” In
           my view the Courts’ powers under section 13 only arise if it is 'necessary or
           desirable’ in the interests of justice that another inquest should be held. If it
           is impracticable, it cannot be said to be necessary in the interests of justice.
           I agree with Counsel that it is impracticable and undesirable to hold fresh
           Inquests. In their oral submissions to me Counsel accepted that this remedy
           was not available (transcript 30 September 1997, page 3).

29.        Counsel however submitted that there could be a further application to the
           Divisional Court for judicial review of the Coroner’s Inquest with a view to
           quashing the verdicts of accidental death. He further submitted that I should
           grant leave for such an application. That I cannot do, since no formal
           application has been made, nor am I sitting as a Judge dealing with the
           Crown Office List.
30.   If I came to the conclusion that a further application to the Divisional Court
      for a review of the Inquest would have a reasonable prospect of success I
      would be prepared to say so, in the hope and expectation that the single
      Judge hearing the application might be inclined to grant leave. Since
      however it would be impossible to substitute a verdict of unlawful killing in
      the absence of a fresh inquest, I cannot see what the point of such an
      application would be. As Lord Justice McCowan said in his judgement in
      the Divisional Court in 1993 (transcript page 4 IB):

              “As to the ... suggestion o f a mere quashing o f the existing verdicts
              leaving nothing in their place, I would regard that as absolutely
              valueless

31.   The effect of quashing the accidental death verdict without substituting any
      other verdict would be the same as if the jury had returned an open verdict.
      (R v St Pancras Coroner ex parte Higgins. 152 JP 637.640). An open
      verdict is only appropriate where there is insufficient evidence to record any
      other suggested conclusion. In practice there were two alternative verdicts
      here - unlawful killing or accidental death. If the jury did not consider that
      the evidence justified a verdict of unlawful killing, then accidental death
      must inevitably be the verdict.


Other action which should be taken in the public interest

32.   My terms of reference also ask me to advise whether there is any other
      action which should be taken in the public interest. I shall return to this
      later, in Chapter 3 Part 2 and Chapter 4 Part 2.


The previous proceedings

33.    It is necessary to summarise the previous proceedings as briefly as I can in
       order to see what possible impact any fresh evidence might have upon the
       conclusions reached by those making the relevant decisions. It is important
       to bear in mind that each set of proceedings had a particular scope and
       purpose.

Lord Tavlor’s Inquiry

34.    Lord Taylor conducted a thorough and wide-ranging inquiry which was in
       some respects - certainly in its effects upon crowd safety at major sports
       events - one of the most important to be held in this country for many years.
       His terms of reference were -
        “To inquire into events at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on
       the 15th April 1989 and to make recommendations about the needs o f
       crowd control and safety at sports events

Lord Taylor’s interim report was concerned with the events of 15th April,
while his final report dealt with his recommendations. The 174 witnesses
from whom he heard oral evidence included more than 50 Liverpool
supporters, over 50 police officers, 11 representatives of the Ambulance and
Fire Services, including senior officers, 15 employees of Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club together with their consulting engineers, and 5
doctors (3 of whom were Liverpool supporters) who had attended the injured
and dying.

The purpose of the first part of Lord Taylor’s Inquiry was to find out what
happened and why, and to consider the response of the emergency services.

It was not difficult to discover what happened. The Leppings Lane standing
terrace on which the disaster occurred was separated from the pitch by high
metal fencing, and divided into pens by ‘radial’ fences which stretched from
the pitch back towards the rear of the terrace. The match was to kick off at
3 p.m. - by about 2.50 pm the central pens 3 and 4 of the Leppings Lane
terraces were full or nearly full. At 2.52 the police had an exit gate by the
Leppings Lane turnstiles, Gate C, opened in order to relieve dangerous
crowd pressure which had built up outside the turnstiles. The result was that
some 2,000 supporters came through Gate C into the ground in a relatively
short time. Most went through a tunnel leading into the rear of pens 3 and
4, and the result was a crush of people substantially exceeding the safe
capacity of those pens. Part of a crush barrier in pen 3 collapsed.

The police did not at first appreciate what was happening. When they did,
rescue was difficult because of the congestion and restricted access to the
pitch.

The question of why the disaster occurred was more complex. The first
issue was why the police lost control of the crowd outside the turnstiles.
The police said it was due to the unexpected late arrival of very large
numbers of supporters, many of whom were determined to get into the
ground on time come what may. They said that there was a larger number
than usual affected by drink, and behaving badly. A substantial number had
no tickets, which increased the problems of crowd control. The position
was exacerbated by people not knowing where to go because of poor sign­
posting.

The police said that they could not stop those at the back pushing forward
and crushing those at the front, near the turnstiles. They said that they could
not have anticipated such a large unco-operative crowd in the last half hour
before the game. The policing operation was conducted on similar lines to
that which had been successful during the identical Nottingham Forest-
Liverpool semi-final fixture at Hillsborough in 1988.

The other side of the picture was given by the supporters. Many of them
criticised the policing. The police should have appreciated that many
people would turn up in the half-hour before kick-off, and should have taken
more effective steps such as filtering the crowd well before they reached the
turnstiles, as was done in the previous year. This would have prevented
people without tickets getting in the way and adding to the throng in front of
the turnstiles. If need be the kick-off should have been delayed.

Lord Taylor rejected the view advanced by the police. He summarised his
conclusions on this aspect of the matter at para 268 of his interim report:

         “the need to open Gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the
        turnstiles. That occurred because, as both Club and police should
        have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large
        numbers demanded o f it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy
       period. The Operational Order and police tactics on the day failed
        to provide fo r controlling a concentrated arrival o f large numbers
        should that occur in a short period. That it might so occur was
       foreseeable and it did. The presence o f an unruly minority who had
        drunk too much aggravated the problem. So did the Club’s confused
        and inadequate signs and ticketing. ”

Lord Taylor also criticised the police decision not to delay the 3 p.m. kick-
off for the match.

I have heard no fresh evidence relating to what took place outside the ground
before 3 pm. There is no question of reviewing Lord Taylor’s finding on
that.

But the crucial question was what happened inside the ground. Lord Taylor
concluded that the influx of supporters going through Gate C after 2.52
should not have been allowed to go down the tunnel. He said (para 231):

        “It should have been clear in the control room where there was a
        view o f the pens and o f the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had
        to be closed. I f orders had been given to that effect when gate C was
        opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty areas o f the
        wings and this disaster could still have been avoided. Failure to give
        that order was a blunder o f the first magnitude. ”

He also criticised the police response to the situation. He said they should
have appreciated earlier than they did what was happening and summoned
the emergency services earlier. But here we are only dealing with a few
minutes - albeit vital minutes.
47.    Lord Taylor was therefore highly critical of the police. But he also
       criticised others. The Safety Certificate issued for the ground by Sheffield
       City Council was unsatisfactory so far as the capacity of the Leppings Lane
       terraces was concerned once the radial fences had been installed. He
       criticised the Club and their consulting engineers, because the layout of the
       forecourt and turnstiles at Leppings Lane was quite inadequate to cope with
       so many people. There was no method of monitoring how many people
       went into the individual pens on the Leppings Lane terrace except by a
       visual check, which was wholly unsatisfactory. The signposting at the
       ground and the information on tickets for the match was inadequate and
       misleading and the club had no stewards in the concourse directing people
       where to go. The result was that most standing spectators who went in
       through the turnstiles A-G or Gate C did not realise there was any
       alternative but to go down the tunnel.

48.    Barrier 124A which collapsed was of insufficient strength. The crush
       barriers were insufficient and poorly placed and the gates on the perimeter
       fence were too small.

49.    Lord Taylor also considered the response of the Emergency Services. He
        said at para 296 of his interim report:

               “I say at the outset o f this chapter that no valid criticism can be
               made o f the response by the St John Ambulance Brigade, by South
               Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service or by the fire brigade on
               15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any criticism o f
               them. ”

50.    He considered the criticisms of two Liverpool doctors in relation to the
        rescue operation, and specifically rejected them.

51.    None of the evidence I have been invited to consider could make Lord
        Taylor’s censure of the police more severe, and it does not add any separate
        or additional ground of criticism in respect of the events leading to the
        tragedy. Nor, save in one respect which I mention in Chapter 6, has it had
        any impact on the responsibility of other parties criticised in Lord Taylor’s
        report.


 The decision not to prosecute

 52.    I have read the joint opinion of Counsel dated 6th August 1990 which gave
        advice to the Director of Public Prosecutions on the possible criminal
        proceedings against Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield, amongst others.
        Although the material available to Counsel was more extensive than that
        which was placed before Lord Taylor, because by that time the criminal
        investigation carried out by the West Midlands Police had been completed,
        Counsel stated that
        “the criminal investigation, fo r all its thoroughness, has not
       significantly added to or contradicted Lord Justice Taylor’s findings.
       In our judgement, therefore, the Taylor analysis o f the facts is as firm
       a base as any from which to approach the question o f Criminal
       Liability

Counsel then set out a full, detailed and careful resume of the facts based on
the evidence then available. I have not found any error or omission in this
resume, nor in my view is any particular aspect understated or exaggerated.
I have also considered the statement of the law set out in the opinion.
Counsel considered both the offences of manslaughter and culpable
misfeasance in public office. They were plainly correct to consider that the
latter offence would be no easier to establish than manslaughter in the
circumstances of the case.

In order to recommend that the DPP reconsider the decision not to prosecute
therefore I must be satisfied that any fresh evidence establishes or may
establish facts not previously considered by Counsel or the significance of
which was not fully appreciated, which makes it more likely that charges of
manslaughter could be established. Essentially this relates to Mr
Duckenfield’s and Mr Murray’s knowledge and appreciation of the risk of
injury in doing what they did or omitted to do (but see note 1 at the end o f
this chapter).

From my meetings with the bereaved families and their representatives I am
left in no doubt that there was widespread disappointment at the DPP’s
decision not to prosecute. They find it difficult to understand in the light of
Lord Taylor’s trenchant criticisms of the South Yorkshire police and the fact
that the force have been paying compensation.

What the Director of Public Prosecutions had to bear in mind, however, is
the significantly different and greater degree of culpability which is involved
in manslaughter, or culpable misfeasance in public office, as against the
degree of negligence which gives rise to liability, and compensation
payments, under civil law. Any prosecution of an individual police officer
would have to establish his individual responsibility. It would not be enough
simply to prove the composite failure of the police operation.

The causes of the disaster were many and complex. So far as these two
officers were concerned the prosecution would have to prove to the high
standard required for a criminal conviction that the failure to give the order
to close off the tunnel when Gate C was opened amounted to the serious
degree of recklessness necessary to constitute manslaughter.
Police Complaints Authority

58.    The decision by the Police Complaints Authority not to pursue charges
       against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray was
       not taken on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to charge them
       with neglect of duty. Mr Duckenfield retired from the police on grounds of
       ill health and, as the rules stood (and still stand), such charges cannot be
       pursued against a retired officer. In the case of Mr Murray it was
       considered unfair to pursue a joint charge against the junior of the two
       officers only.

59.    It is clear to me that many of the families of victims consider this to be
       unfair and unsatisfactory. I sympathise with this view. But it is not my
       task to comment on these rules. The issue is a complex one and is a matter
       for Parliament. The Police Complaints Authority commented on it in their
       Annual Report for 1988, and the matter has recently been reported on by a
       Parliamentary Committee. In the context of my scrutiny it means however
       that fresh evidence is unlikely to have any impact on the decision not to
       pursue these charges.


The Inquest

60.    The purpose of an inquest is to find out who the deceased was and how,
       when and where he or she came to their death (Coroner’s Act 1988, section
       11(5) and Coroner’s Rules 1984, Rule 36 - which also prohibits the Coroner
       or jury expressing an opinion on any other matter). No verdict can be
       framed in such a way as to appear to determine any question of criminal
       liability on the part of a named person or civil liability.

61.    The Hillsborough inquests therefore were, or should have been, of much
       more limited scope than the wide ranging Inquiry conducted by Lord Taylor.
       The questions of who the deceased were, and where and when they died
       were dealt with at the mini inquests. At each mini inquest a police officer
       gave a summary of the evidence relating to the deceased. This was based on
       statements taken from witnesses and sought so far as possible to trace what
       happened to each person from the time they left home to go to the match to
       the post-mortem examination on them. A second police officer gave
       evidence based on photographic material in an attempt to trace the
       movements of each individual.

62.    Then the pathologist gave evidence in relation to the post-mortem
       examination and cause of death. Because of the general confusion as the
       disaster unfolded it was not always possible to trace what happened to
       everybody who died from the time they were last seen alive on the terraces
       to the confirmation of their death and subsequent identification. This has
       understandably caused great concern to families who are anxious to trace the
last moments of their children or relatives. I will return to this question in
Chapter 5.

The main inquest began on 19th November 1990 and concluded on 28th
March 1991. As I have explained in paragraph 31 there were in practice
only two possible verdicts, unlawful killing and accidental death. The jury
returned the latter verdict. Again as a result of my meetings with the
families and their representatives I have been left in no doubt that there is
widespread dissatisfaction among them as to the verdict and much criticism
of the Coroner and the way the inquests were conducted. As to the verdict,
as I have already said, Counsel for the Family Support Group has accepted
that it is now impossible to have a fresh inquest with a view to substituting a
verdict of unlawful killing. The Support Group argue that the public
perception is that the verdict of accidental death implies that there was no
fault on the part of the police or any other party. I cannot say what
perception, if any, the general public have. In any event the proposition is
wrong. In his summing up the Coroner correctly stated that a verdict of
accidental death did not mean that the deaths occurred without fault.

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has never contested civil liability on
the part of the police to pay damages for negligence to the bereaved and
injured. This was accepted in a letter from Hammond Suddards, solicitors
for the Chief Constable and his insurers dated 15 December 1989 and
recognised as an admission of liability by the Courts (Divisional Court
Transcript, page 40; Lord Keith of Kinkel in Alcock v Chief Constable
[1992] AC 310, 392).

Compensation has been paid. In respect of the fatalities, 37 claims were
made for loss of financial dependency pursuant to the Fatal Accidents Acts.
Of these 36 have been settled. 53 fatal claims were restricted to damages for
funeral expenses and/or statutory bereavement payments. 50 have been
settled. Offers have been made in respect of the other 3 but not accepted.
1473 claims for personal injury were intimated. All claims included a
psychiatric element. The great majority were for psychiatric as opposed to
physical injury. 1035 have been settled, 19 remain outstanding. The
remaining claims have been closed with a nil payment or not pursued. The
Club and Eastwood and Partners, the Club’s consultant engineers, made a
very substantial lump sum contribution to those settlements; so also did the
City Council, although their insurers were the same as those of the police.
The major portion was borne by the police and their insurers. In total
£13.25 million has been paid in compensation and legal costs, not including
compensation to police officers.

I have heard the suggestion that the verdict of accidental death at the
inquests in some way undermined or reversed the findings of Lord Taylor.
But it did no such thing. In order to justify a further application to the
Divisional Court for judicial review to quash the inquest verdict of
accidental death, without an order for a new inquest, any new evidence must
      in my opinion show that had it been presented to the jury they would have
      been likely to reach the only other possible verdict, namely unlawful killing.


The Divisional Court

67.   As I have already mentioned the Divisional Court heard in 1993 an
      application on behalf of six families to quash the inquest verdicts of
      accidental death and seek fresh inquests. It considered ten grounds which
      were advanced on behalf of the six families, but rejected all of them. I will
      discuss some of the points which the Divisional Court considered in more
      detail later.

68.   The main arguments before the Divisional Court were -

       a.      That the Coroner should have disqualified himself on the grounds
       that he was too closely associated with the Sheffield City Council, one of the
       interested parties, who appointed him and paid his salary. This was said to
       give rise to apparent bias. The Divisional Court said the point was far too
       late, since no objection was taken at the time. This ground was raised for
       the first time before the Divisional Court - nobody had mentioned it at the
       inquests. The Divisional Court concluded in any event that the point had no
       merit.

       b.      That the Coroner wrongly conducted the mini inquests by reference
       to summaries of the statements of eye witnesses which were read out and the
       contents of which could not be tested by oral evidence and questioning.
       (Ground 1 of the application). The Court held that Rule 37(3)(C) of the
       Coroner’s Rules 1984 permitted this. It had been done with the complete
       agreement of Mr Fraser who was then acting as solicitor on behalf of the
       relatives. This ground was not pursued by Mr Alun Jones QC who appeared
       before the Court on behalf of the Applicants.

       c.      That there was now (1993) available some evidence that the Coroner
       and his jury were not given the full picture of the evidence of some of the
       witnesses whose statements were partially summarised at the mini inquests
       and the result was that the proceedings were vitiated (Ground 7). Six cases
       were relied upon. One of these was that of Kevin Williams, with which I
       shall deal in more detail later. The Court rejected this ground.

       d.     That the Coroner wrongly introduced a cut-off point of 3.15 pm
       (Ground 3). The Court upheld his decision about the cut-off point, and the
       Coroner’s reasons for making it. I shall deal with this in more detail later,
       because Counsel say that further evidence now shows that this approach was
       wrong.

       e.     That the Coroner wrongly limited his inquiries into how the deceased
       met their deaths so as to exclude inquiry into whether lives could have been
      saved by calling the Emergency Services sooner and providing better
      emergency care for the injured thereafter (Ground 5). This point is clearly
      related to the 3.15 pm cut-off point. The Court held that there was a
      sufficient inquiry to answer the statutory questions of who the deceased was,
      when, where and how they died.

      f.     That the Coroner should have left the verdict of lack of care to the
      jury (Ground 6). After considering the authorities the Court held that

              “the verdict o f ‘lack o f care’ is concerned with the failure to provide
             care in the form o f food, medicine, clothing, shelter, etc., not with
             carelessness, and is appropriate only in cases which are the other
             side o f the coin o f self-neglect such as starvation, hypothermia and
             persistent failure to provide medication. ”

      Such a verdict could not have been appropriate in this case. The law on this
      point has subsequently been affirmed in Reg v N Humberside Coroner ex
      parte Jamieson [1995]QB 1 at 24 and 25. It was not seriously argued before
      me, either by Counsel for the Family Support Group or by Professor
      Scraton, who has taken a keen interest in the Hillsborough Disaster and who
      made written and oral submissions to me, that this was a possible verdict.
      In my view the decision of the Divisional Court on this point needs no
      farther consideration. None of the evidence I have been invited to consider
      could make this an appropriate verdict.

69.   Although only six families made the application for Judicial Review, the
      Court’s reasoning applies to the inquest verdicts on all those who died at
      Hillsborough. There was no appeal from the Court’s judgement. A fresh
      application for Judicial Review could only succeed, therefore, if fresh
      evidence undermines the Court’s reasoning, or shows that it may have
      proceeded on an incorrect factual basis.

70.    The Divisional Court also stated that even if any of the grounds had been
       made out, the Court would not have exercised its discretion to order a fresh
       inquest and gave cogent reasons of this decision (per McCowan LJ at pages
       40 and 41 of the judgement). These reasons are even more cogent now and
       as I have already said Counsel did not contend that there should be a fresh
       inquest.



Note 1 (to paragraphs 25 and 54).

The only person who suggested that another officer should have been prosecuted
was Mrs McBrien. In a clear and restrained submission to me she argued that the
sole cause o f the tragedy was the opening o f Gate C when the need to do so had not
arisen and when it was quite contrary to the whole concept o f proper crowd control.
She contended that the fault lay mainly with Superintendent Marshall who called fo r
the gate to be opened, and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield fo r ordering it to be
opened.

Lord Taylor rejected this argument. At para 228 o f his interim report he said that
  “Having lost control and rejected the option o f postponing kick-off, the police were
faced with a serious danger o f deaths or injuries. They were left therefore with no
 alternative but to open the gates. Superintendent Marshall was right at that stage
 to ask fo r it and Mr Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects o f so
 dramatic a step required other action ”.

Moreover, M r Hytner, the QC who appeared fo r the bereaved and injured at Lord
Taylor’s Inquiry, specifically stated that he did not blame Mr Marshall in requesting
the opening o f the gates (transcript day 10, page 112). I have not been asked to
consider any fresh evidence bearing on this issue and there is no basis fo r re­
considering the decision not to prosecute him.
CHAPTER 2


Video evidence about the disaster


1.    At the heart of many of the allegations about the disaster which I have heard
      over the last few months has been the suggestion that video evidence of what
      happened has been distorted or concealed. Several different possibilities of
      this sort have been put to me. Their common theme is that, had the full video
      evidence been available, the culpability of the police would have been even
      clearer than it already is. That might have meant inquest verdicts of unlawful
      killing rather than accidental death, or led to criminal prosecutions of senior
      police officers, or both. It is said that the police themselves concealed the
      video evidence to hide the true facts.

2.    I have found that there is considerable confusion and misunderstanding about
       the video evidence of the disaster. Before moving on to discuss the
       allegations in detail, I think it is necessary to explain what video cameras were
       operating on the day and what has happened to the tapes that were made.

3.    The police and Sheffield Wednesday FC were each operating their own
       separate video systems at the ground. BBC cameras were also present to
       record the game.

4.    The West Midlands Police team which investigated the disaster used footage
       from all these sources to create a ‘compilation tape’, lasting about 2 hours,
       giving an overall picture of the disaster. This tape was shown both to Lord
       Taylor’s Inquiry and to the jury at the Inquests.


The Club CCTV System

5.    Sheffield Wednesday had 19 fixed closed circuit (CCTV) cameras which were
      trained onto the various turnstiles around the ground. There were 19 CCTV
      monitor screens in the club’s Control Room showing what these cameras
      photographed - the club’s Control Room was inside the South Stand, just off
      the players’ tunnel (and had no direct view of the pitch). The club recorded
      the output of all these cameras. One of the club’s CCTV cameras showed the
      Leppings Lane turnstiles, in particular the turnstiles A to G through which
       spectators going to the Leppings Lane standing terrace would normally come.
      It also showed the exit gate, Gate C, which the police opened to relieve the
       pressure outside these turnstiles.

6.    The pictures from this camera were recorded on tape JH2. The West
       Midlands police officers investigating the disaster took custody of this tape
       and used footage from it in the compilation tape.
7.     As well as the 19 screens linked to their own CCTV system, Sheffield
       Wednesday’s Control Room also contained a further screen, linked to the
       police CCTV system. This allowed people in the club Control Room to see
       what was being shown by any of the five police CCTV cameras. But they
       could not record these police pictures.

8.     The club also had a mechanism which automatically monitored the number of
        spectators passing through the turnstiles.

9.     There were three people in the Sheffield Wednesday Control Room as the
        disaster took place. One was Mr Lock, the club’s security officer. Mr Lock, a
        former policeman, gave evidence both at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and at the
        inquests. He left the Control Room at about 2.45 p.m., at about the time when
        Gate C at Leppings Lane was opened briefly so that police could eject
        somebody. He returned just after the kick-off.

10.    The second person in the Control Room was PC Guest, who has since died.
        He was police liaison officer with the club, and gave evidence at Lord Taylor’s
        Inquiry. The third was Mr Houldsworth, the club’s video technician.


The Police CCTV System

11.    The police had five fixed CCTV cameras situated around the ground. The
       police Control Box contained one screen for each of these five cameras.
       The screens are shown in photograph 48 in Appendix 2 (48 was the number
       this photograph was allocated when it was used as an exhibit at Lord
       Taylor’s Inquiry). I need only be concerned with cameras 1, 2, 3 and 5.
       Police camera 4 was situated outside the ground, on Penistone Road, at the
       far end of the ground from Leppings Lane where the tragedy occurred.

12.    Police camera 1 was mounted on the rear of the West Stand. It looked out
       from the ground towards the Leppings Lane turnstiles, in particular
       turnstiles A-G through which the standing spectators would come. It could
       also show Leppings Lane itself, part of the area outside the turnstiles, and
       part of the concourse between the turnstiles and the West Stand. Its
       pictures were in black and white.

13.    Police camera 2 was mounted on the South Stand and it commanded views
        all round the ground. It was in colour. Police camera 3 was also mounted
        on the South Stand, but was nearer the Penistone Road (Kop) end, where the
        Nottingham Forest supporters were standing. It was in black and white.

 14.   Police camera 5 is the important one from the point of view of my scrutiny.
        It was mounted near the scoreboard at the south east corner of the West
        Stand and was the closest one to the police control box. It provided views
        of the West Stand and the West Terraces. It was in black and white.
15.   A plan which formed Appendix 1 of Lord Taylor’s interim report showing
      the five police cameras with their numbers forms part of Appendix 2 to this
      Report. All five police cameras were operating continuously from about 12
      noon to 17.20 on the 15 April. They were under the control of PC Trevor
      Bichard. All five could zoom and pan. (PC Bichard in fact referred to
      camera 2 as camera 3, and to 3 as 2. I have adopted Mr Houldsworth’s
      numbering of the cameras).

16.   Additionally in the police Control Box were two video recorders, each
      linked to a monitor screen showing what it was recording. The recorders
      could be operated in one of two ways. They could operate on ‘auto­
      sequence’, in which mode the recording would move around the five police
      CCTV cameras at pre-set intervals. Alternatively, the operator could
      override this and record output from whichever of the five cameras he
      wanted, for as long as he wanted. The monitor screens can be seen without
      numbers on the right in photograph 48, Appendix 2, one above the other.

17.   Both of these tape recording machines could record in two ways, either in
      continuous or normal play, or in ‘time-lapse’, recording a new still frame
      every half second. ‘Time-lapse’ is jerky when played back, but it allowed
      tapes to be used for longer. Police made four tapes from these two
      recorders in the course of the day. One (TB1 - TB for Trevor Bichard) ran
      from 12 noon to 15.04, the second (TB2) from 12 noon to 15.34. These are
      the tapes with which we are primarily concerned. TB3 continued on from
      TB2, and TB4 from TB1 but with a 30-minute gap. TB3 and TB4 both ran
      up to 17.20. The reason why there was a half-hour gap between TB1 and
      TB4 is that PC Bichard forgot, in the anxiety of the moment, to replace the
      tape when it expired at 15.04. TB2 lasted longer than TB1 because of
      greater use of ‘time-lapse’.

18.   PC Bichard sealed the four tapes at the end of the day and handed them to
      other South Yorkshire police officers for safe custody. South Yorkshire
      police later gave them to the West Midlands police investigating team. I
      have inspected the originals of tapes TB1, 2, 3 and 4. They are intact.
      Each of the four tapes is timed throughout and there are no gaps in these
      times. The four tapes were all made available in their entirety to Lord
      Taylor’s Inquiry and the Coroner.


Other video cameras operating on the day

19.   The police had a hand held video camera operating from time to time
      between 11.45 and 17.30. The tapes from this are identified as VRM1 and
       VRM2.

20.   The BBC had a number of cameras, both mounted and hand held operating
       during the day. Tapes from these are identified as MAPI to MAP9.
Theft of two videotapes

21.   Between 4.30 p.m. on the afternoon of the disaster and 9 a.m. the next
      morning two tapes were stolen from the club’s Control Room, which was
      locked. One of these tapes was entirely blank (the club camera concerned was
      wrongly placed and pointing at a wall). The other showed turnstiles 9 to 16 at
      the Leppings Lane end of the ground, which were next to turnstiles A to G.

22.   The theft of these tapes was investigated by the West Midlands Police but
       remains unsolved. There is no proof of who was responsible for their
       disappearance. During the course of my scrutiny I have heard allegations that
       they were taken by South Yorkshire police officers as part of a ‘cover-up’.
       There is no evidence for this suggestion. The loss of these tapes could not
       have hindered Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, the Inquests, or any of the other
       proceedings. They would not have shown anything relevant.


The Compilation Tape

23.    This tape, which lasts about 2 hours was made by the West Midlands Police
       in conjunction with the Treasury Solicitor. It was designed to ‘show what
       was felt to be the most important scenes and sequence of events’ (Inspector
       Layton, inquest transcript, Day 1 page 64).

24.   It consists of extracts from tapes TB1, TB2, and RJH2, together with BBC
       footage. The tape shows scenes in Leppings Lane and at the turnstiles there
       prior to about 15.00, and then scenes inside the stadium up to 16.44. It
       begins with some footage of the layout of the ground which West Midlands
        Police shot specially later on. The compilation tape was shown at the
        Taylor Inquiry and the Inquest. It includes no scenes taken by police
        Camera 5.


The evidence of Roger Houldsworth

25.    Mr Houldsworth was the technician responsible to the club for the working
       of the club and police CCTV systems. The Family Support Group have
       presented him to me as having evidence that what the police said about the
       capacity of their CCTV system and what it showed on the day was false.
       During my scrutiny I have considered a number of written statements from
       Mr Houldsworth and oral evidence which he gave me at an interview with
       him.

26.    First there is a statement in writing which Mr Houldsworth made on 16 May
       1989 to Sheffield Wednesday’s solicitors, which appears in Appendix 3, Part
       1. In this he described the police and club CCTV systems. He said that
       on the day of the disaster he had been called to deal with a fault on police
camera 5. He says he rectified the fault and the camera then worked OK.
He then described his experiences in the club Control Room on the day, in
particular what could be seen on the club screen showing turnstiles A-G
(recorded on tape RJH2) and the monitor screen from the police system,
which was showing output from police camera 1, including the influx of
supporters through Gate C at 14.52. He continues

       “At that point in time I realised, from the numbers already displayed
       on the monitor as having entered from the Leppings Lane turnstiles,
       that a dangerous situation was being created. I left the room and
       went down the players ’ tunnel to the pitch and ju st as I did so the
       Referee stopped the match as I recall. I looked over to the West
       Stand area and I saw fans climbing over the fence and my first
       thought at that time was that it was a pitch invasion, and the match
       had been stopped fo r that reason. ”

Finally in this statement Mr Houldsworth deals with the two tapes missing
from the Club Control Room. I have found an exact transcription of this
statement by Mr Houldsworth in the West Midlands Police computer records
(HOLMES) of their investigation. It is dated 27 May 1989.

There are two written statements by Mr Houldsworth dated 28 April and 5
December 1989 to West Midlands Police. These statements are concerned
with the tapes which went missing from the club Control Room. They are
not material. Thirdly there is a transcript of an interview which Mr
Houldsworth gave for a Yorkshire Television ‘First Tuesday’ programme
about the disaster, broadcast on 6 February 1990. This is at Appendix 3,
Part 2. It adds very little to his 27 May 1989 statement. But he makes it
clear that it was the scenes from the club camera pointed at turnstiles A to G
and police camera 1 of supporters coming through Gate C that caused him
concern, together with the numbers of spectators shown on the clubs
monitors as having already come into the ground.

Fourth, in an affidavit sworn on 25 November 1996 Mr Houldsworth
exhibits, as ‘GH2’ certain comments on the evidence which PC Bichard and
PS Goddard gave to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and the Inquest, and the evidence
of PC Ryan given at the Taylor Inquiry. I set out the material parts of this
document in Appendix 3, Part 3. The most important statement here is
numbered 1, where Mr Houldsworth says

       7 was able to see what the police could see on their monitors and I
       specifically remember checking to see the state o f Pens 3 and 4 when
       the order was given to open the gate. I could see very clearly that
       the pens were fu ll to the point o f overcrowding. ”

Mr Houldsworth says in this affidavit that he disagrees with the police
evidence that the pictures from their Camera 5 were less than perfect or that
      the zoom capacity on cameras 2 and 5 were not sufficient for clear
      identification of spectators.

31.   Finally, I interviewed Mr Houldsworth on 14 October 1997. He repeated
      the points I have just mentioned. The transcript of his evidence is at
      Appendix 3, Part 4.


The submissions and allegations made by the Hillsborough Family Support
Group,

32.   Two of the most important issues both at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and the
      Inquest were

      a) whether the police in the control box, and particularly the two senior
      officers Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray, realised that pens 3 and 4 were
      already full when the order was given to open Gate C so that a dangerous
      situation would arise in them if a large number of supporters were to enter
      them through the tunnel in a short space of time; and

      b)   if they did not realise this, whether they should have done so.

33.   In the light of this, Mr Alun Jones QC, Counsel for the Family Support
      Group made a number of submissions to me. These were

      1.      that the police blamed their failure to see the overcrowding in pens 3
      and 4 on the fact that Camera 5 was defective (paras 12 and 23 of Counsel’s
      written submissions of 27 September 1997). Their argument is that what
      the police said about this was deliberately false, and that this is shown both
      by Mr Houldsworth’s evidence that Camera 5 was working perfectly and by
      the ‘discovery’ that the police tapes show footage taken by camera 5, which
      demonstrated that it was working (written submissions para 46(viii); oral
      submissions page 12 lines 15 to 22);

       2.     that the evidence from the video tapes of what was filmed by Camera
       5 was deliberately suppressed and concealed, presumably by the South
       Yorkshire and/or West Midlands Police, because it would have revealed the
       falsity of the police claim in submission 1. This would, prima facie, be a
       perversion of the course of justice (written submissions paras 52 and 55 and
       56);

       3.     that the Coroner failed properly to pursue the question of the
       ‘missing footage’. He ought to have summoned West Midlands police
       officers to explain its disappearance (written submissions para 52);

       4.    that PC Bichard, PC Ryan and PS Goddard all gave deliberately false
       evidence that camera 5 was not working properly and that cameras 5 and 2
      were not good enough to show distress on the faces of those in pens 3 and 4
      (written submission para. 46); and finally

      5.      that Mr Houldsworth in the club Control Room could see and
      appreciate from the screen monitoring the police cameras (in particular
      Cameras 5 and 3) that pens 3 and 4 were overcrowded and that a dangerous
      situation was likely to arise because of the influx through Gate C. The
      allegation was that this evidence was withheld from the jury, presumably
      deliberately.

34.   The first and second submissions are particularly serious. If they are made
      out they might affect the verdict of accidental death and the decision of the
      DPP not to prosecute for manslaughter. The third submission is a grave
      allegation against the Coroner even taken on its own. If it is to be taken in
      conjunction with the first and second submissions it could affect the verdict.

35.   On its own the fourth submission would not affect any of the prior
      proceedings. But consideration would have to be given to prosecuting the
      officers concerned (Bichard, Ryan and Goddard). If the last submission is
      made out, the failure of the police to appreciate that a dangerous situation
      had arisen because pens 3 and 4 were already full to their safe capacity when
      gate C was opened could be further criticised if Mr Houldsworth realised
      this simply from seeing scenes depicted from Cameras 3 and 5.

36.   I must examine these five submissions in detail.


Suhmission 1

37.   The central allegation here is that the police blamed their failure to see the
      overcrowding in pens 3 and 4 on Camera 5 being defective when in fact it
      was not. In his oral submissions to me Mr Jones accepted that this was
      crucial to the Group’s submissions in relation to the video evidence
      (transcript 30.9.97 page 12). The submission involves the proposition that
      the police in the Control Box were saying that they could not see with their
      own eyes through the windows of the control box the state of the terraces,
      but were dependent on camera 5 which was not working properly.

38.   Mr Jones originally put this submission to me with respect to the evidence
      given by police officers both at the Taylor Inquiry and at the Inquest. As to
      the former, it was said:

               “[Lord Taylor] accepted the police evidence that they were unable to
               see the terraces [were overfull by 2.50] because o f the faulty camera”
               (written submissions para 12).

39.   This is not correct. Lord Taylor made the following findings:
      “ [The police box] has windows commanding views across the pitch
      and straight along the west perimeter fen ce” (Interim Report para
      49).

       “The cameras [operated in the police control box] have a zoom
      facility to close in on any point o f interest. Specifically there were
       good camera views o f the west terracing         ” (para 50 and see also
       para 170).

        “It should have been clear in the control room where there was a
       view o f the pens and o f the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had
       to be closed” (para 231).

       “[Officers in the control room] had a direct view (of pens 3 and 4)
      from an elevated position through their window.... In the event pens
       3 and 4 became more and more crowded, surges took place, fans
       were shouting and signalling distress. None o f this was seen or
       recognised in the control room ” (para 244).

At paragraph 38 of the written submission, after references to the evidence
of PC Ryan, PC Bichard and PS Goddard, none of whom said that defective
pictures from Camera 5 was the reason why they failed to realise that there
was a dangerous situation, Counsel said that

       “Chief Superintendent Duckenfield .... did not refer to any faults with
       the camera system. On the 25 May 1989 at page 129 he said that he
       did not use this zoom facility but mainly (my emphasis) looked out o f
       the window” .

The implication is that Mr Duckenfield was saying that he was partly reliant
on the cameras. This does not accurately represent his evidence which was:

       Q. “Did you use or was the zoom facility used at all to have a close
       look at the situation in pens 3 and 4 once it was apparent somebody
       was climbing over the fence? - A. Not that I am aware of, sir, that
       may have been the case, but I looked through the window ”.

There was abundant evidence at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry that the police in the
control box had a good view out of the windows (Inquiry transcript, day 8
pages 10 and 47, day 9 page 35, day 20 page 13, day 18 pages 76 and 88 -
references are to evidence by Duckenfield, McRobbie and Goddard). PC
Ryan said he very rarely looked at the TV monitors because they were over
his head (day 18 page 59). Superintendent Murray never suggested that he
was reliant on the TV cameras. He had an excellent view out of the
window.

In the course of his oral submissions to me Mr Jones accepted that the
submission was not correct so far as the police evidence at the Taylor
Inquiry was concerned (page 15). But he submitted that the effect of the
evidence of those officers at the inquest was quite different and supported
the submission that they had lied about Camera 5 being faulty.

In my judgement this submission is equally ill-founded. So far as Mr
Duckenfield is concerned, he never said anything about a faulty camera 5,
still less that that was the reason he failed to appreciate the overcrowding.
Although he pointed out that he was standing behind the officers seated at
the front of the Control Box and did not have quite such a good view
through the windows (inquest day 68, page 59) he never suggested he could
not see the terraces sufficiently to form a judgement. On the contrary at
(Day 69 page 23C-E) he said:

        Q. “You had the vision from the Control Box, which we have all
       been to, through the windows? - A. Yes.

       Q. You also were able to see the video cameras, the cameras which
       were showing the terrace? - A. Yes.

       Q. They have a zoom facility, do they not, as fa r as the Leppings
       Lane terrace goes? - A. Yes, they do.

        Q. You still say that in that period between 2.52 and 3 o ’clock you
       never noticed even this huge surge into the terrace? - A. Let me ju st
       direct you to where I was and what I was doing. Yes, I was in the
        Control Box and I was standing towards the back o f that Control Box
       and when you stand in the back o f that Control Box and look across
       you have a view. As you rightly say you have the other facilities, but
       I did not see anything untoward on those terraces from my position,
       from my viewing position and from the angle at which I was in the
        Control Box ”.

At page 45 (inquest day 69) he gave substantially the same evidence as he
gave to Lord Taylor, to which I have already referred. He said specifically
he was “looking with my eyes at the scene on the terraces” - not at the
television screen.

So far as Mr Murray was concerned, he was seated in the front row of seats
in the Control Box, on the left hand side. He would therefore have an
excellent view out of the window. This is shown in photo 52 (Appendix 2).
He would not be well placed to see the CCTV monitor screens, which were
above his head. At Inquest day 67 (page 48F-49B) he said

        Q. “You in the police Control Box had access to the following, didn’t
        you? First o f all you were able to look out o f the windows to view
        specifically the state o f the Leppings Lane Terraces? - A. Yes. Q. I
        think everybody has visited the ground who needs to visit the ground
        and I need not ask you questions about what you can see because we
       can observe them, but in addition to that you have access to I think it
       is five monitors, do you not? - A. Yes, that is correct in the Control
       Room

He was then asked about the cameras that show the terraces. There is no
suggestion that they were not working properly; still less that that was the
reason he failed to realise there was a danger of overcrowding. At page
50C-D:

       Q. “So you are in a position in the Control Box not only to see that
       which you can see with your own eyes o f the terrace, but also, if you
       so choose, to have the cameras so operated that you can look at a
       particular part o f the terrace if you want to do so? - A. Yes, I can
       identify, or the operator can identify, a particular part that we should
       look at. ”

Then at page 78E he says:

       Q. “You were in a position from the Control Box to see the state o f
       the Leppings Lane terraces and Mr Duckenfield was too? - A. I
       would think we could both have looked at the terraces and seen the
       state o f them, yes. ”

In further written submissions to me Counsel for the Family Support Group
stated that Mr Murray told the inquest jury specifically that he could not see
what was happening on the terraces because of the allegedly faulty cameras.
They cite an answer he gave at inquest day 67, transcript page 79F.

In my view this answer is taken out of context. The passage when looked at
as a whole does not support the assertion that is made about it. Mr Murray
was being asked about photograph C326A. This photograph appears at
Appendix 5 of Lord Taylor’s interim report. It is a still photograph taken at
2.59 p.m. from the North Stand looking across the Leppings Lane terraces
towards the police box and Camera 5. The relevant extract reads in full
(inquest day 69, page 79 D to G):

        Q. “I f we can move to C326A we get an even better view o f pen 6 at
        some five minutes later? A. - Yes.

        Q. Going back to the position just before the order was given to
        order the gates to be opened, because we know gate C was opened at
        2.52, if one looked at the west terraces it would be clear that pen 6
        had marked empty spaces in it? - A. From where that photograph is
        taken, yes.

        Q. Even without the photograph, the position on the photograph, it
        must have been obvious, must it not, from your use o f the cameras
        you had from the Control Box that pen 6 was markedly empty ? That
       was not difficult to see, was it? - A. From the views that we were
       getting from the cameras, from the views that I could see from the
       Control Room, it wasn’t obvious.

       Q. At the end o f the day that will be a matter o f evidence. You are
       saying that from the Control Box with your use o f the videos, the
       cameras, and you had the ability to look along as we have already
       described? - A. I think you have got to look at the individual
       cameras. I think the colour camera was unfortunately focused on the
       problem area in the Kop and that is where it stayed until about three
       o ’clock. The camera on the gantry next to the Control Box was
       unfortunately not working up to its potential. I do not know how that
       affected it but I can see from the angle that that photograph is taken,
       326A, yes, there is a lot o f room on the front o f pen 6 but I didn’t
       have that view and if I had had that view it might have affected my
       decisions ”.

It is true that Mr Murray says that Camera 5 was not working up to its
potential. But he does not claim this as a reason for his failure to see that
pen 6 was relatively empty. On the contrary he says that he does not know
how that affected it. His point is that although one can see from photo 326A
- taken from the other side of the ground - that there is a lot of room in pen
6, that is not the view he had from the police control box. But at Day 68
pages 26D-27B the Coroner specifically raises this question with Mr Murray
at the instance of the jury. This very important passage runs:

       Q. On the day o f the disaster were you able to monitor the different
       parts o f the terrace at random? I think what the Jury is asking is
       with the cameras, not with the eyes. - A. The camera that would be
       best equipped fo r that was the one that was in the centre o f the South
       Stand, which would show a slightly oblique picture o f the terraces
       and the Kop. Unfortunately fo r most o f the event that was trained on
       the problems that we had in the Kop, particularly after some
       ejections and arrests had been made from that area. What we
       normally use the cameras fo r is evidence gathering and you can only
       gather and preserve the evidence o f what you are actually looking at,
        at the time. When we foresee problems in a certain part o f the
        Ground we will record that particular area fo r the whole o f the
        event, and that gives us the chance to then take still photographs
       from the video and blow them up later, and utilise them as evidence
        and identify people who are wrongdoers.

       Q. The next question is a supplemental one on that really. Did you
       rely more on your own physical view from the Control Box or on the
       monitors, and I think we must be talking about the terracing still
       because you could not, o f course, see outside, could you, without
       looking at the monitors? A. No. We had a good view o f the
       terraces from the Control Box. We could see the terraces, had a
       good view o f the terraces. I probably relied more on what I could
       see with my own eyes than anything else. I f I had seen a particular
       problem I would have tried to get the video operator to zero in but
       their capabilities are only as good as the actual lens, and the better
       the lens the much more expensive they are. They seemed to be all
       right fo r our purposes. ”

I find it surprising that Counsel did not see fit to draw my attention to this
passage. Along with Mr Duckenfield, Mr Murray was much the most
important officer in the Control Box, since they were the decision makers.

There is nothing in the evidence of PC Ryan or PS Goddard which supports
the submission that the police could not see what was happening because of
faults on Camera 5. I will come in due course to what these officers said
about the quality of the pictures from Camera 5.

PC Bichard, of all the officers in the control room, might be expected to be
watching the screens rather than looking out of the window, since he was the
video operator. He was asked (inquest day 71 page 82D)

       Q. “Did you see it through a window or did you see it on a monitor?
       -A . It is very difficult to remember. The view is partially obscured
       o f what is happening out on the terrace because o f people walking
       across the front o f my position. I am not sure. ”

I should add that Mr Houldsworth also said, in evidence to me, that the
police would not rely on the cameras to see what was happening in the pens.
They had a good view out of the window. (See transcript of my meeting
with him on 14 October 1997, page 23 line 33 to page 24 line 38).

The Coroner’s jury had a view of the scene. They went to the police control
box. They could see for themselves the view which each police officer had.
Mr Houldsworth also demonstrated the CCTV cameras to them during this
visit, so they could see their capability for themselves.

The evidence of all the police officers in the control room was that they
could see the west terraces but they did not realise that the central pens were
becoming dangerously overcrowded. They thought the numbers were
normal for a big match. The matter was accurately summed up to the jury
by the Coroner (inquest day 77, page 127 of the transcript of his summing-
up).

The submission that the police tried to blame their failure to see the
overcrowding on a fault in Camera 5 seemed to me to be so at variance with
the evidence given at the Inquest that I asked Mr Timothy King QC about it.
Mr King was Counsel for the families at the inquest. He said that so far as
he was concerned it had never been the police case that they could not see
that pens 3 and 4 were full because their CCTV was not working correctly.
      The issue was not whether they could see the state of the pens, but whether
      they appreciated that they were full and what steps they took to deal with the
      situation once Gate C was opened.

59.   In his further submission put forward on 11 December 1997 Mr Knowles,
      junior Counsel for the Family Support Group, advanced another argument in
      support of this submission. He said:

               “In his evidence to Lord Taylor Mr Duckenfield admitted that he was
               concerned about the disparity in the numbers o f supporters in the
               centre pens compared with the numbers in the side pens. This caused
               him to request that a Tannoy announcement be made asking
               supporters to move forward (Day 8, p9-14)....

               It is significant that the Tannoy announcement ordered by M r
               Duckenfield coincides with a shot from Camera 5 at 14.18.07 (shown
               on the footage supplied by Yorkshire TV), which shows young people
               standing in space at the front o f the Leppings Lane terraces. It
               would therefore appear that the Tannoy announcement was made as
               a result o f what had been observed on the video, and that Mr
               Duckenfield was, in fact, using the cameras to assess crowd build up
               inside the ground. ”

60.   In my view this argument is not well founded. The passage referred to at
      Day 8 p l2 referring to the Tannoy announcement relates to 14.30 (though
      according to Lord Taylor the announcement was at 14.15 - paragraph 59 of
      his interim report). It does not relate to 14.18 and has nothing to do with
      the scene captured by camera 5 at that time. There was never any
      suggestion from Mr Duckenfield that he depended on Camera 5 to see the
      state of the Leppings Lane terraces. Indeed the contrary is the case as I have
      already pointed out. The argument advanced by Counsel is a non-sequitur
      even if the timing was correct.

61.   In my judgement the submission that police blamed their failure to
      appreciate the overcrowding onto a faulty CCTV camera is quite untenable.


Submission 2

62.   The allegation here is that evidence of the video tapes taken by camera 5 was
      deliberately suppressed and concealed. It appears to be based on the
      following propositions:

               1 - that the compilation tape had no footage from Camera 5.

               2 - that footage from Camera 5 had disappeared and was not
               available at the inquest. This is based on the following exchange
between PC Bichard and the Coroner, at inquest day 71, page 80A-
E:

       Q. The film we saw this afternoon o f the Leppings Lane end,
       which came from what I have called camera 1, I don’t know
       the camera number. - A. I would know it as camera 5.

       Q. The one beneath or near the Police Box? - A. Yes, sir.

       Q. That scene began at about 15.02? - A. Yes, sir.

       Q. Where was that camera looking before 15.02 as fa r as
      you can recollect? - A. My recollections are that the
      particular camera had been faulty and in fa c t you saw some o f
       the problems that occurred. You were getting what is called
      flare. It is reflection o f light coloured objects and you lose
       the picture. The camera was not really being used as much as
       it would normally be because o f the sub-standard picture. It
       was just left in position. That is why the picture never really
       moved at all because it was set and left in that position.

       Q. That is what I am coming to. Given that it started at
       15.02, let us assume I am right on that time, was that the time
       you moved it and located it and then left it to take that shot? -
       A. No, that probably would have been done before that.

       Q. Would it have been recording before that? - A. Yes.

       Q. So there ought to be a film o f it, prior to that? - A. I
       would have thought so, yes.

       Q. Of that same scene? - A. Yes.

       Q. I f I tell you we cannot fin d it would that make any
       difference to your answer? - A. I have no idea at all where it
       could have gone to. It was part o f the tape and the tapes
       were all sealed up at the end o f the day. ”

       (The film which the Coroner says was seen by the jury that
       afternoon was not included in the compilation tape. The jury
       saw it in addition to the compilation tape, in circumstances I
       shall refer to later).

3 - that between 14.18 and 14.23 there is footage taken from Camera
5 which shows a number of fans in pen 2 of the Leppings Lane
terraces. Pen 2 lay between Camera 5 and pen 3. The footage
clearly shows Camera 5 zooming and panning. Prior to 1400 there
were other scenes taken by camera 5 and recorded on tape TB2 as the
       tape flicked from one camera to another. This footage indicates that
       camera 5 was operating satisfactorily. It was never shown to the
       jury. It was only discovered when the Family Support Group saw
       the video material shown to them by Yorkshire Television.

       4 - that the purpose of the ‘concealment’ was to prevent the exposure
       of the falsity of the claim in submission 1, to the effect that the
       reason why the police could not see the overcrowding was because
       camera 5 was faulty.

Since, as I have already pointed out, submission 1 is misconceived, it can be
said that this submission must also fail. There would have been no point in
the police suppressing or concealing the video evidence unless they had a
reason for doing so. But in fact there was never any disappearance or
concealment of video footage from camera 5.

The facts are these. At the end of the day of the disaster the tapes from the
police monitors were secured. They were made available to Lord Taylor’s
Inquiry and appear on its exhibit list as documents 109 (TB1) and 110
(TB2). Lord Taylor’s Inquiry had a detailed schedule of the contents of
these two tapes. TB1 has no scenes from camera 5. It ends at 15.04.

Tape TB2 is automatically switching at intervals between the five police
cameras, including camera 5, until 1400. There is nothing of note.
Between 14.18 and 14.23 TB2 shows scenes taken by camera 5 of fans on
the Leppings Lane terrace. The camera zooms and pans. The police trained
Camera 5 on this small group of people because they thought someone in
that area had been misbehaving (though there is no sign of that on the tape).
The schedule for Lord Taylor’s Inquiry described this scene as a ‘view of
Leppings Lane and terraces, plenty of room in the pen in view, insufficient
detail to identify which pen’. But it is almost certainly pen 2.

Tape TB2 shows scenes from Camera 5 again from 15.02 until 15.25. This
sequence shows supporters climbing over the fence from pens 3 and 4 onto
the pitch. The camera, once focused on this scene, remains static. The
sequence is in ‘time-lapse’, and is described in the schedule which the West
Midlands Police provided for Lord Taylor’s Inquiry.

The incident between 14.18 and 14.23 is referred to in PC Bichard’s
evidence at the Taylor Inquiry (Day 19 page 45) and also in the evidence of
Chief Inspector McRobbie (Day 20 page 20). Mr McRobbie was asked
about his statement:

       Q. “You say “Police Constable Bichard operated the camera and I
       watched him to be able to zoom onto him which I thought was a
       super facility fo r spotting troublemakers in the crowd. ”
       A. That is correct sir.
       Q. No difficulty with the picture at all? - A. Well when you say “no
       difficulty ” it certainly brought this person closer to us than I think it
       would have been possible fo r a Police Officer to select the correct
       person that Control were identifying without any problem

All the exhibits which the West Midlands Police had prepared for the Taylor
Inquiry - including Tapes TB1 and TB2 - were made available to the legal
representatives at the Inquest. The evidence required for each day was
placed in a side room at the hearing. The rest of the unused material
including tapes TB1 and TB2 and the schedule were kept locally at a police
station where access was given to any legal representative who required it.

I have tried to find out whether the legal advisers then representing the
families, namely Mr Hytner QC, Mr Tim King QC, Mr Fraser and Miss Steele,
can recall whether or not they saw TB1 and TB2. Not surprisingly after this
lapse of time they cannot. However, I think it very likely that some or all of
them did so. This is because they were exhibits at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and
they were obviously potentially important evidence. I would certainly expect
the legal advisers to have seen the videotapes relating to the build up to the
disaster, TB1 and 2. Mr Fraser recalls watching many hours of video footage.
That being so, he must have looked at those tapes.

I have asked the Hon Mr Justice Collins (then, as Andrew Collins QC,
Counsel to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry) about this. He cannot recall any specific
occasions when the families’ lawyers viewed these tapes. He told me that
since they were exhibits and freely available, he would have expected the
lawyers to have looked at them. I agree.

None of the camera 5 scenes on tape TB2 were included in the compilation
tape which the West Midlands Police and the Treasury Solicitors made up for
Lord Taylor’s Inquiry. It is quite plain that no-one considered the footage
from pen 2 at 14.18, or any of the earlier views from Camera 5 of the Leppings
Lane terrace, to be of any help in illustrating the sequence of events leading up
to the disaster.

The footage from Camera 5 after 1502, showing fans climbing over the
perimeter fence to get out of the fatally crowded pens 3 and 4, is also not
particularly helpful from the point of view of illustrating what happened.
There was much better coverage of this part of the disaster from the BBC
cameras, so the compilation tape uses that instead.

During the inquest (Day 69, page 53) the Coroner said that the jury had
twice asked about video evidence of the terraces. He said that the videos
(clearly a reference to TB1 and TB2) had been looked at and there was
actually next to nothing on them because not everything was recorded.
There was a tiny bit showing the terraces on the compilation tape, and
another bit from 15.03 for a few minutes. He had had that ‘clipped’ and
      would show it to the jury. He said it was of poor quality and he did not
      think it would help very much. It became exhibit C539 at the Inquest.

74.   The jury saw exhibit C539 on day 71 (transcript page 61). The footage
      they saw was the material from 1502 onwards from tape TB2 (though
      Sergeant Killock of the West Midlands Police incorrectly identified it as
      coming from tape TB1). It extended only to 15.16, whereas the camera 5
      footage on TB2 continued to 15.25. The sequence was in time lapse. I
      have seen the original and I agree with the Coroner’s comment that it is of
      poor quality and not much help. It is this film that PC Bichard is referring
      to in the passage which I have cited above.

75.   It is plain in my judgement that PC Bichard was mistaken in thinking that
       there was tape from camera 5 of the same scene prior to 15.02.

76.   It has been put to me on behalf of the Family Support Group that the vital
       parts of tape TB2, namely those showing scenes taken by Camera 5, were
       concealed from Lord Taylor, the Coroner, and the families of victims, but
       were later on made available to the families by Yorkshire Television.
       Yorkshire Television have kindly let me have the tapes they have, and which
       they previously showed to the Family Support Group. They are copies
       which they made of tapes TB1 and TB2 (also TB3 and TB4). The police
       had given these to them to help them make their “First Tuesday” programme
       (transmitted in February 1990). It seems to me to be a bizarre way to
       conceal or suppress evidence to make it available to a television company.

77.   In my opinion the allegation that police hid videotape evidence is completely
       unfounded. There was no suppression or disappearance of footage from the
       vital tapes TB1 or TB2 which were at all times, together with the schedule
       of their contents, available to be seen by the legal representatives of the
       families.

78.   It is entirely understandable that the compilation tape contains no footage
       from Camera 5. It would be surprising if it did, since footage from Camera
       5 was not helpful or relevant in illustrating the causes of the disaster.


Submission 3

79.   The allegation is that the Coroner failed properly to pursue the question of
      the ‘missing footage’. This submission is unfounded for the reasons I have
      just explained. There never was any missing footage from the relevant
      tapes. The two missing club tapes have nothing to do with this. The
       Coroner dealt perfectly properly with the jury’s request to see the camera
       footage of the terraces. He was right to regard the incident in pen 2 at 14.18
       as irrelevant.
Submission 4

80.   The allegation is that Constables Bichard and Ryan and Sergeant Goddard
      deliberately gave false evidence that camera 5 was not working correctly.
      Their evidence to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry was as follows:

               PC Bichard (day 19 page 43)

                      Q. “We have heard that on the day in question there was
                      something wrong with that one; is that correct? - A. For a
                      number o f weeks we have had difficulty with the camera and
                      they have been looking into having the camera replaced or
                      improvements made. In fact, on the day when I arrived at the
                      ground M r Roger Houldsworth, who is the Technical Officer
                     fo r the Club, was in fact working on that camera to try and
                      upgrade the picture that we were actually getting.

                     Q. What was the trouble? - A. When the system had been
                     switched on, after an amount o f time, the picture would go
                     white - you would lose actually what you could see. We
                     believed initially it was in relation to the lighting inside the
                     ground but we seem to think that it may be a problem with the
                     electrical supply to that camera.

                     Q. What was the effect o f that on the day in relation to your
                     ability to look properly at the terraces, the West terraces ? -
                     A. On that particular day, the picture had been — the quality
                     had been improved. It was not up to mark but it was a lot
                     better than it had been. We were getting pictures, that is the
                     best way o f describing it.

                     Q. Could you zoom in in the normal way on to the terraces if
                     you wanted to? - A. The actual control facilities were fully
                     available. ”

81.   PC Rvan.who was sitting in the front row next to PS Goddard and could
      therefore not easily see screen 5 (which was overhead) said (day 18 page 53)
       in relation to camera 5 :

                     A. “Roger Houldsworth, yes. He attended and came out and
                     worked on that camera fo r some time. Quite how long he was
                      there I do not know. He was certainly there working on it fo r
                      some considerable time. The picture was never satisfactory as
                     fa r as I recall that day although that was not my specific duty
                      to look at that.
              Q. I follow that. When you say the picture as fa r as you can
              see was not satisfactory what was wrong with it? - A. It was
              not as clear as you would hope the picture to be.

              Q. Did that mean the zoom facility was rendered in any way
              inoperative or less adequate than normal or ... - A. As fa r as
              I recall the zoom was operative. It was the quality o f the
              picture that was the problem. ”

Sergeant Goddard did not deal with this point.

None of this evidence from Bichard or Ryan persuaded Lord Taylor that
there was anything wrong with Camera 5, since he made the specific
findings to which I referred earlier in this Chapter when I was discussing the
Support Group’s first submission (paragraph 39).

At the Inquest PC Bichard’s evidence on this point is that to which I have
already referred (paragraph^ above). PC Ryan gave no evidence at the
Inquest and Sergeant Goddard, who did, did not deal with this point. As
against this Mr Houldsworth, in his statement of 16 May 1989 (Appendix 3,
Pt 1 page 3) says that after he had made the necessary adjustments the
camera was working OK. In his later comments (Appendix 3, Pt 3) he says
it was working perfectly.

I have interviewed PC Bichard. He told me that while he was operating a
particular camera his concentration would be mainly on the screen relevant
to that camera and not on the recording monitors. He said that if he was
operating a camera to film some point of interest, he would record this. He
also told me that after he had operated a particular camera he would
normally leave it parked in the position where it was last focused. This is
what one would expect. He maintained that the quality of what he was
seeing on screen 5 was not as good as that on the other screens - he
described it as misty or foggy - though he accepted that the footage recorded
from camera 5 at 14.18 was perfectly adequate.

An examination of tapes TB1, 2, 3 and 4 does show that Camera 5 was
being used (in the sense of moved about) less than the other cameras.
Before 14.00 the scenes recorded from Camera 5 were static, as the
recording flicks from one camera to another, though the position of the
camera is moved so that three different views of the West Stand are shown.
After 14.01 the only time Camera 5 is zoomed, panned, or changes position
in any other way is between 14.18 and 14.23 and for a few seconds at 15.02
when it focuses on the perimeter fence at pens 3 and 4 (shown to the
Coroner’s jury as C539). It stayed there, static, until 15.25.

Although there is a half-hour gap between the end of tape TB1 and its
replacement tape TB4, it is clear in my view that PC Bichard is operating
Camera 2 (the colour one) during this time, except when he turns Camera 3
onto the Leppings Lane terraces and leaves it in the parked position. This
can be seen on tape TB2 at 15.25. Camera 3 stays in this static position
until 15.59 (seen on tape TB2 until 15.34 and thereafter on TB3). Moreover
it is quite clear that PC Bichard’s attention prior to 14.58 (when Camera 2
swings from the Kop end to the pens at Leppings Lane end) is concentrated
on Camera 1 and what was happening at the turnstiles. It was not directed
to Camera 5 and had not been since 14.23. There is a full analysis of the
movement of the police CCTV cameras between 14.30 and 15.34, as
recorded on videotape, at Appendix 4.

I have some doubt whether the pictures from Camera 5 appearing on screen
5 in the police Control Box were substandard to any material extent, though
there are certainly examples of Camera 5 flaring on tape TB2. But in any
event this is largely a matter of opinion and degree. No-one other than PC
Bichard and Mr Houldsworth is likely to have looked at screen 5 in the
police control box. Mr McRobbie, not surprisingly, could not recall
whether he saw the incident at 14.18 on screen 5 or the monitor. The
Coroner’s jury saw the Camera 5 extract from 1502 onwards for themselves,
though the quality of the copy they saw is not as good as the original.

In my opinion, even if PC Bichard did to some extent exaggerate any defect
in what Camera 5 was showing, it is of no consequence. As I have already
said Lord Taylor took no note of it and the only circumstances in which it
might be relevant, namely if any of the submissions 1-3 above were made
out, do not arise.

There is a difference of opinion between Mr Houldsworth and PC Bichard as
to the degree of definition it is possible to get with the zoom on cameras 2
and 5 for the purpose of identification. I do not regard this as significant.
The Coroner’s jury had the cameras demonstrated to them and they could
see for themselves what the situation was. There is a great deal of
difference between identifying a single person or a small group, each of
whom stands out individually, and trying to pick out individuals in a large,
compact crowd where there is almost constant movement and only a partial
sight of the face and body.

Moreover having seen the original of tape TB2 at 15.02 when Camera 5 is
focused on pens 3 or 4 I am inclined to agree with PC Bichard on this point.

At 14.58 Camera 2 swings down towards the Leppings Lane terraces. It is
possible to identify some of the people on the pitch, for example WPC
Richardson, who has a distinctive pony-tail and is seen ushering people into
pen 2 via its perimeter gate. However I do not think it would be possible to
identify a person in the centre pens from their face and it is certainly not
possible to see their facial expressions. Moreover even if the police had
focused either of these cameras onto those at the front of pens 3 and 4 at the
material times, that would not have enabled them to pick out the distress
which was being experienced.
93.    The other matters raised by Mr Houldsworth on the evidence of PC Bichard
      and PC Ryan are in my view of little consequence for the same reason. In
      my opinion the evidence is wholly insufficient to warrant consideration of
      criminal proceedings against any police officers.


Submission 5

94.   The allegation here is that Mr Houldsworth in the club Control Room could
      see from pictures on the Control Room monitor from police cameras 3 and 5
      that pens 3 and 4 were overcrowded at 14.50, and that the influx of extra
      spectators through gate C would create a dangerous situation. I have no
      doubt that it is true that there were times when Mr Houldsworth and others
      in the club control room switched their monitor on to see what the police
      cameras would show of the Leppings Lane terraces.

95.   This accords with the evidence of PC Guest to the Taylor Inquiry. At Day
      19 page 121 he said:

               Q. “But it was obvious at twenty to three that the two wing pens
               were virtually empty, was it not? - A. Yes, sir. As fa r as I am
               aware, I don’t know, sir, because I wasn’t looking at that particular
               screen. I was only looking at Leppings Lane on the outside; I was
               not looking on the inside o f the ground.

               Q. Are you saying you never saw ... ? - A. I did, yes. I did
               actually look on the inside o f the ground but this was later. This was
               after the gates was broken — well, either broken or opened, and once
               the crowd had got in. It was after the crowd had got in, then when I
               turned to that camera that would cover the West Stand and the
               Leppings Lane.

               Q. Are you saying that prior to the quarter to three, ten to three,
               you never saw on the monitor the inside o f the ground at the
               Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes, I did look at it earlier on, before
               twenty to three, yes, and at that stage it was quite normal.

               Q. When did you last see the terraces on the monitor? - A. I
               couldn’t be exact, sir, but I would think it would be something in the
               region o f probably half past two, probably twenty-five to three.

               Q. At twenty-five to three? - A. Something like that.

               Q. At twenty-five to three the wing pens were virtually empty, were
               they not? - A. They were, sir. ”
I do not however accept Mr Houldsworth’s evidence that he realised from
looking at coverage from police cameras 3 and 5 that pens 3 and 4 were
overcrowded and that the influx of people through gate C would create a
dangerous situation. I reject this evidence for the following reasons.


1.    It is hard to believe that if this were so Mr Houldsworth would not
       have said as much before 1996 (see his comments at Appendix 3,
       Part 3 para numbered 1). I do not accept that he can have been
       inhibited either in making his statement to the club solicitors or in his
       interview with Yorkshire Television. I do not find convincing Mr
       Houldsworth’s explanation as to why it was only in 1996 that he
       realised this evidence was important, (see transcript of his evidence
       to me, page 20 lines 18 - page 21 line 17 - Appendix 3 Pt 4). There
       is no record of any interruption by the police officer until the end of
       the interview.

2.    What Mr Houldsworth now says is in fact inconsistent with what he
       said before. In his written statement he attributes his concern to what
       he could see on the police monitor in relation to Gate C and the club
       monitors of the numbers. (See Appendix 3, Pt 1 pages^Kand           In
       the television interview the references to the police cameras are
       throughout to camera 1. It was submitted to me by Counsel that Mr
       Houldsworth’s references to Camera 1 in the first paragraph of page
     '^ 'o f Appendix 3, part 2 was in fact a mistake for Camera 5. The
       context shows that this is obviously not correct, and Mr Houldsworth
       confirmed this to me when I interviewed him. The same reasons are
       given for his concern, namely what is seen in relation to gate C and
       club monitors of the numbers (page^flast^tfra) and an appreciation
       that people coming through gate C would be likely to go into the
       centre pens (page      last answer).

3.    It was not until 15.05 that Mr Houldsworth got onto the pitch. It
       took less than half a minute to get there from the control room. Even
       so, like almost everyone else observing the situation, he thought he
       was looking at a pitch invasion. He could not have thought this, if
       what he now says about noticing overcrowding on the Leppings Lane
       terrace before Gate C was opened at 2.52 p.m. were correct.

4.    The last shots from police Camera 5 which are recorded before 15.02
       are those at 14.23 when it is focused on pen 2 and does not give a
       view of the centre pens. It is unlikely in my view that it was changed
       from this position until 15.02 when the recording shows it trained on
       the perimeter fence, picking up the fans climbing out. This accords
       with PC Bichard’s evidence to me. It is also consistent with PC
       Guest’s evidence which I have quoted above (paragraph ^ ) . If he
       could see that the wing pen at 2.35 was virtually empty, this strongly
       suggests that he is seeing the same area that was filmed by Camera 5
at 14.18 - 14.23. Camera 3 was trained on the Kop end, for which it
was primarily designed. I think it likely that it remained there till it
was swung round to show the Leppings Lane terraces at 15.25. Mr
Houldsworth does not suggest that he saw the state of the pens from
Camera 2. That too was focused on the Kop end until 14.58, when it
is focused on the Leppings Lane end (TB1). In my opinion it was
probably not until Mr Houldsworth saw the scenes from Camera 5 at
some time after 15.02 that he realised that there was a problem and
went to investigate. This fits with the timing of his arrival on the
pitch and his belief that there was a pitch invasion.

At a very late stage of my Scrutiny (11 December 1997) junior
Counsel for the Family Support Group submitted that Mr
Houldsworth’s evidence about spotting the overcrowding from the
monitor of the police CCTV system in the club Control Room was
supported by that of PC Guest. He referred to PC Guest’s statement
of 10 May 1989 (which is in identical terms to an earlier one dated
29 April but on the standard Criminal Justice Act statement form).
Counsel did not cite the relevant passage. It reads:

        7 then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and
       covered the area o f the West Stand and it was obvious that the
       situation was getting out o f hand and people were being
       pushed up against the fencing on the perimeter o f the ground.

       I could see that all available officers were being sent to this
       area o f the ground to assist with the injured and dying. ’

This makes it quite plain that what is being shown by the camera
inside the ground is occurring after 15.00. (This description might
be thought to describe more accurately what was shown by Camera 2
(colour) after 14.58. But Mr Houldsworth said what he saw was on
cameras 5 and 3). What is cited by Counsel (in fact wrongly, the
incorrect words are in square brackets) is a passage from a later
undated statement by PC Guest, where an additional passage has been
inserted between the first and second sentences quoted above from
the earlier statement.

         ‘A t the [this] point where [while] things seemed to be getting
        out hand outside the turnstiles I tried to use my personal radio
        in order to contact Police Control that further Police
        assistance was required urgently at the Leppings Lane end o f
        the ground, but each time I tried to use the radio I was
        blocking others already using the radio, so I did not try
       further to use it.

       I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact
       Police Control but again each time I tried the line was
       engaged and could not get through. A t this point M r Lock
       then left the video room in order to organise some safety
       measures with the security personnel.

       Also present during this time in the video room was a M r
       Roger Houldsworth, he is the person who installed all the
       videos and computer system.

       As he could also see what was taking place he also left the
       room in order to assist in any way he could. ’

This passage was inserted because of comments made by Hammond
Suddards, solicitors to South Yorkshire Police, when the force sent
PC Guest’s original statement to them for comment (I shall have
more to say about this in Chapter 4, Part 2 of this report). In a letter
dated 25 May 1989, after referring to PC Guests’s statement on page
2 of the earlier statement that ‘it was obvious that looking at the
crowd outside trying to get in, that there would not be sufficient
room for all to be accommodated’, the solicitors said:

        7 wonder why he did not use either Club radio or the internal
       telephone system to reach the control box, if he did not wish
       to interrupt transmission by using his personal radio. It may
       be helpful if PC Guest recalls, as accurately as possible, the
       actual figures fo r the north stand, west stand and Leppings
       Lane, when he studied these at, or shortly after, 2.40pm. ’

Unfortunately the inserted passage dealing with this point breaks the
continuity and chronology of PC Guest’s original statement.
Moreover the final sentence of the inserted passage makes it clear
that what was being looked at was after 15.00, because we know that
Mr Houldsworth did not leave the control room until about 15.05.

Analysis of tapes TB1 and TB2 from 14.30 until they finish shows
quite clearly which cameras PC Bichard was manipulating and
concentrating on. In particular from 14.35 to 14.49.02 he is
operating Camera 1. There is then a brief point at 14.49 when
Camera 2 is operated on the Kop end before at 14.49.38 he reverts to
Camera 1 which is more or less continuously used until 14.58.42
when Camera 2 pans from the Kop down into the West Stand
Terraces. Thereafter he is operating cameras 1 and 2 until 15.02.53
when he operates Camera 5, which after a very short while is fixed
on the perimeter fence (the part shown in C.539). This analysis
(Appendix 4) supports the conclusions which I have set out in sub-
paragraph 5 above.

If Mr Houldsworth is correct in what he now says, it is to say the
least surprising that he did not draw the attention of PC Guest to the
             reasons for his concern, namely that he could see the serious state of
             the terraces on the monitor screen. It is clear from PC Guest’s
             statements and evidence at the Taylor Inquiry that he did not do so.
             PC Guest has unfortunately since died.

      8.     It was submitted to me at a late stage in my scrutiny by Miss
             Adlington, Solicitor to the Family Support Group, that a comparison
             of three photographs showed clearly that Camera 5 had been moved
             between 14.52 and 14.59 and that this supported Mr Houldsworth’s
             evidence to this point.

             The photographs in question were taken by supporters in the North
             Stand. They show the scoreboard on which Camera 5 was mounted,
             together with the scoreboard clock. The first two, with the
             scoreboard clock showing respectively 14.52 and 14.54, are taken
             from about mid-way up the top of the North Stand, about a third of
             the way along the pitch from the west (Leppings Lane) end of it.

             The third photograph is timed at 14.59 by the scoreboard clock. It is
             the one which appears at Appendix 5 in Lord Taylor’s Interim
             Report. It is taken from a position higher up the North Stand and
             nearer to the Leppings Lane terraces. Both in the copy of this
             photograph at Appendix 5 of Lord Taylor’s report, and in the copy
             of it submitted to me by Miss Adlington, it is almost impossible to
             distinguish Camera 5. However I obtained the negative and enlarged
             the relevant area.

             Bearing in mind that the photographs are taken from different
             positions they do not in my opinion show that Camera 5 was moved
             between 14.52 and 14.59 - still less do they show this, as I was told,
             ‘clearly’. On the contrary, although I do not attach much weight to
             the point because it is not sufficiently clear, I am inclined to the view
             that the three photographs show that Camera 5 was not moved and
             that it was at 14.59 still trained onto the same corner of pen 2 as it
             was when it was used to take the shots recorded at 14.18 to 14.23 on
             tape TB2.


Conclusions about the video evidence

97.   In my opinion the importance of Mr Houldsworth’s evidence has been
      exaggerated out of all proportion. Mr Houldsworth’s existence, and his
      evidence, were known both to the Taylor Inquiry and to the Coroner.

98.   There is no reason why he should have been called to give evidence, since
      what he was then saying as to the police and club systems was dealt with by
      other witnesses, notably PC Bichard and PC Guest.
99.    The only sense in which Mr Houldsworth’s evidence is new and might have
       an effect on the previous proceedings is in relation to submission 5. For the
       reasons I have given I am unable to accept that his recollection of events
       now is accurate. Even if it was correct it would not have any effect on the
       previous proceedings.     It would simply have been the evidence of one
       more person who thought that the central pens were full at 14.52.

100.   The propositions advanced in submission 1, 2 and 3, which are by far the
       most serious, are in my view untenable.

101.   There is nothing in any of the submissions about the video evidence that
       calls for any further inquiry or consideration by the prosecuting or
       disciplinary authorities or further resort to the Divisional Court. The
       evidence is quite insufficient to consider any proceedings against PC
       Bichard, PC Ryan or PS Goddard.
CHAPTER 3


The Aftermath of the Disaster


1.    During my scrutiny I have heard serious criticisms made of the Inquests into
      the deaths of those who died at Hillsborough. It has been suggested to me
      that they were seriously flawed, because they did not go into the important
      question of whether more could have been done to help the victims or
      whether the rescue operation following the disaster could have been better.

2.    In the first part of this Chapter I describe the conclusions which I have
      reached about the inquests. In the second part I consider whether there
      should now be a fresh public inquiry into what was done, and not done, to
      rescue those who were crushed. The first issue I must discuss is the so-
      called ‘3.15 cut-off point’ at the Inquests.


The Inquests and the 3.15 cut-off point

3.    I have given a brief description of the Inquests in Chapter 1 of this report.
       The inquests on 95 of the victims were conducted by Dr Stefan Popper, who
       was at that time Her Majesty’s Coroner for South Yorkshire, in two stages
       between April 1990 and March 1991. (The 96th victim, Tony Bland, lived
       until 1993).


‘Mini-Inquests ’

4.     The first stage, the so-called ‘mini-inquests’, ran over a two and a half week
       period in April and May 1990. The law governing inquests is the
       Coroners Act, 1988 and the Coroners Rules of 1984. As I explained in
       Chapter 1 these require the inquest to answer four separate questions about
       the deceased - who they were, and when, where and how they died.

5.     It was not possible in April 1990 for an inquest to reach a decision about
       how any of the Hillsborough victims had died, because there was the
       prospect that one or more of the senior police officers who had presided
        over the police operation at the ground might be prosecuted. It is lawful
        and perfectly proper for an inquest to be adjourned in these circumstances to
        await the decision of the prosecuting authorities as to whether anybody
        should be tried in connection with a death and - if a trial takes place - its
        outcome.

6.     However the Coroner could at that stage usefully establish the answers to the
       rem aining statutory questions of who the victims were, and when and where
      they died. The mini-inquests resolved these questions. For each of the 95
      victims the West Midlands Police, who had investigated the disaster on
      behalf of Lord Taylor and the Coroner, presented the Inquest with a
      summary of the facts about them, based on the very many interviews that
      had taken place and analysis of photographs and other material about the
      match.

7.    The Coroner therefore went into very considerable detail at the ‘mini-
      inquests’ into the precise circumstances of where and when each of the
      deceased died.


The main Inquest

8.    The remaining question, of ‘how’ the victims died, fell to be answered by
      the main (or ‘generic’) inquest. This began on 19 November 1990 and
      concluded, after 80 days of hearings, on 28 March 1991 when the jury
      brought in a verdict of accidental death in respect of each of the victims.

9.    At the beginning of the main inquest the Coroner ruled that he would cut off
      the inquiry at 3.15 p.m ., by which time he considered that all those who
      died had received the injuries which caused their deaths. This ruling by
      the Coroner has been subjected to a good deal of criticism, not only during
      my scrutiny but also during the application by six of the bereaved families
      for judicial review of the inquest in 1993.

10.   The Divisional Court, which heard the application in 1993, upheld the
      Coroner’s decision about the 3.15 ‘cut-off point’. But it has been
      submitted to me by Counsel for the Family Support Group that fresh
      evidence discovered since 1993 undermines the Divisional Court’s decision.
      Before considering this evidence and the submissions based upon it, it is
      necessary to examine the Coroner’s reasoning in more detail since it has
      been widely misunderstood and misinterpreted.


The Coroner’s reasoning

11.   The Coroner’s reasons for introducing the 3.15 ‘cut-off point’ can be
       summarised as follows:

       (a)    in considering the question of how someone died an unnatural violent
              death it is not usually relevant to consider matters subsequent to the
              infliction of the injuries which obviously result in death. It is not
              relevant whether the person died instantly at the scene or some time
              later, after medical or other unsuccessful treatment. Accordingly it
              is not appropriate for a Coroner to conduct an enquiry into the
              response of the emergency services or consider in any given case
       whether had it been quicker, differently organised, or with other
       facilities a person who died might have been saved;

(b)    there was no evidence that any of those who died did so from any
       cause other than crush or traumatic asphyxia as a result of being
       crushed in the pens (see note 1 to this chapter). There was no new
       intervening cause which might break the chain of causation between
       the crushing injuries and death. The Coroner rejected the submission
       of Mr King, who appeared for the families at the Inquests, that there
       might have been an intervening cause.

(c)    all those who died received the injuries from which they died before
       3.15 at the latest. This did not mean that they were all dead by then
       - they may have respired and had a heartbeat for some period after
       that time, running to hours or days;

(d)    the effect of the pathological evidence which the Coroner had
       received was that once the chest of the victim was fixed so that
       respiration could no longer take place, irreversible brain damage
       would occur after between four and six minutes.

(e)    that it was necessary to keep the Inquiry within reasonable bounds
       and to this end a time cut-off had necessarily to be imposed.

It should be noted that the Coroner did not say that all those who died did so
before 3.15, or that the medical evidence was to this effect. In this respect
he has been widely misrepresented. Nor did he say that all those who
became unconscious subsequently died. The evidence was that it was only
those people whose chests were in a state of permanent fixation as a result of
the crush for four to six minutes, so that they could not breathe at all for that
time, whose condition was irreversible.

In upholding the Coroner’s decision on this point the Divisional Court said
that the Coroner cut off the evidence at a reasonable and sustainable point,
particularly bearing in mind the exhaustive public enquiry which had already
been conducted by Lord Taylor (McCowan LJ at page 12 of the transcript
of the Divisional Court’s judgement). The Divisional Court also rejected the
grounds advanced on behalf of the applicants that the Coroner wrongly
limited the inquest so as to exclude inquiry into whether lives could have
been saved by calling the emergency services sooner or providing better
emergency care for the injured. It concluded that these questions were not
relevant to the inquiry into how - i.e. by what means - the deceased had
come to their deaths.
Further evidence

14.   In the light of the Divisional Court’s reasoning it is difficult to see the
      relevance of further evidence that person A was alive at 3.15pm but died
      subsequently, or that spectators B, C and D became unconscious in the crush
      but subsequently recovered, whether because of resuscitative treatment
      received at the ground or in hospital, or that an ambulance driver, E, found
      a particular policeman ignorant of the situation and unhelpful, or that a
      particular doctor, F, had criticisms as to the availability of drugs or other
      resources. Still less is it arguable that such new evidence affords grounds
      for quashing the verdicts of accidental death at the inquest.

15.   Nevertheless this is the nature of the new evidence which I have been asked
      to consider during my scrutiny. I must describe it in some detail before
      dealing with the submissions which Counsel for the Family Support Group,
      and others, have based upon it. It falls into three groups - evidence from
      Dr Ed Walker, evidence from supporters who became unconscious but
      survived and who, in some cases, believe they were considered to be dead at
      the scene, and evidence from ambulance men. I was also asked to examine
      an article by Mr Wardrope in the British Medical Journal.


Dr Ed Walker

16.   Dr Walker’s evidence can be summarised as follows. He was a House
      Officer in Anaesthetics at Rotherham District Hospital. At about 3pm on the
      day of the disaster he happened to turn on the television at home and saw
      scenes of disturbance at Hillsborough. He realised there might be casualties
      and thought he might be of assistance, so he went to the Northern General
      Hospital to see if he could help.

17.   On arrival at the Accident and Emergency Department, no one seemed to
      know very much about the situation. The first casualty arrived soon after he
      did. This was Lee Nicol, who was in cardiopulmonary arrest. Dr Walker
      intubated him, gave him external heart massage, and his heart started beating
      again. Lee Nicol was taken to the Intensive Care Unit, but was declared
      dead two days later.

18.   The second patient arrived shortly afterwards. This was Philip Hammond,
      who was also in cardio-pulmonary arrest. Dr Walker carried out
      resuscitative treatment and the heartbeat was restored. In a statement which
      Dr Walker made near the time he said that he established venous access for
      drug therapy, but in subsequent comments on Dr Slater’s evidence, he said
      that the drugs which had been administered had been delivered via the
      endotracheal tube. In his evidence to me he could not recall which was
      correct. Philip Hammond’s pupils were fixed and dilated, and shortly
       afterwards he was certified dead.
19.   These are the only two patients treated by Dr Walker whom it has been
      possible to identify. In his statement near the time, Dr Walker dealt with the
      resuscitative treatment he gave to six other patients. Three died. He
      believed that one made a good recovery but did not know what the outcome
      was for the other two. Thereafter he went to Ward 60 at the Hospital,
      where he assisted, particularly with two patients who had deteriorated
      neurologically and had to be transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Therapy
      Unit. The effect of his evidence therefore was that he treated five patients
      who subsequently died, most of them later that day. He treated others who
      were seriously ill, but one at least, and possibly more, recovered.

20.   Dr Walker made a written statement in the form of an aide-memoire shortly
      after the events. Apart from these matters to which I have referred, he made
      a number of criticisms about the availability of drugs and other equipment at
      the hospital and the delay in activating the major accident procedure. In
      evidence to me, he said that these points were mainly for internal
      consideration by the Hospital. On 20 July 1989, he made a witness
      statement on West Midlands Police Criminal Justice Act witness statement
      paper, which was later put on the computer system (Holmes) which the West
      Midlands Police were using for their investigation. He wrote this statement
      out in his own language, and he confirmed to me that he said everything in it
      which he wished to. It forms Appendix 5, part 1.

21.   Dr Walker gave evidence to me on 22 October 1997 and a transcript of his
      evidence appears at Appendix 5, part 2. Dr Walker also made written
      observations to me dated 28 September 1997 and in later letters. Much of
      this is in the form of comment and does not add significantly to his factual
      evidence. He did not give evidence at the Inquest.


Spectators who were unconscious but recovered

22.   Counsel asked me to consider evidence about Ian McDermott, Steven
      Williams, Roger Ball and Edward Spearitt.

23.   M r M cDerm ott’s evidence is contained in a signed statement dated 3
      September 1997. I can summarise it as follows. He was in pen 3 and was
      crushed. He was in agony and could not breathe. He lost consciousness and
      felt he was going to die. He recovered consciousness while being given the
      kiss of life on the terraces. He drifted in and out of consciousness. He was
      carried onto the pitch and given further mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and
      heart massage.

24.    Mr McDermott was taken to the gymnasium and given oxygen and a drip.
       He was checked by a doctor and sent to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital,
       where he was treated and discharged a few days later. His case attracted
       some publicity in the press when he was visited by the Prince and Princess
       of Wales. He did not give evidence at the Taylor Inquiry or the Inquest, but
he had made a statement to the West Midlands Police dated 29 April 1989.
He appears to have forgotten about this but it is in substantially the same
terms as his recent statement, though with less detail. His earlier statement
was available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and the Coroner.

Steven W illiams’s evidence is contained in a signed statement dated 12
October 1997. I can summarise it as follows. He was in pen 3. At about
15.04 (when Beardsley’s shot hit the cross bar) he was pinned for 5-10
minutes against a crash barrier unable to move and in pain. He was
subjected to crushing for at least 30 minutes and eventually lost
consciousness. He recovered consciousness on the ground, vomiting and in
shock and pain. He was taken to the Northern General Hospital. X-rays
showed fractures of two ribs. He was in hospital for three days. In addition
to his physical injuries, he suffered post traumatic stress disorder. He did
not give evidence at the Taylor Inquiry or the Inquest.

Counsel for have also put to me the evidence of Andrew Worsley, who
dragged Steven Williams out from underneath his father. Mr Worsley says
he thought Steven Williams was dead because he was blue in the face and his
eyes were staring. He dragged him out of the tunnel at the back of the
Leppings Lane terrace to a place where there were 15 to 25 bodies dead or
unconscious. He there handed him over to a police officer “who dropped
him uncaringly on the floor”.

That appears to be the last Mr Worsley saw of him. It would seem that
Steven Williams must have regained consciousness fairly soon afterwards,
since he was conscious when he was put in the ambulance. But it is not
known what, if any, resuscitative treatment he received or whether he was
seen by a doctor. If Mr Worsley’s evidence is correct, it shows a callous
attitude by the police officer in question. But there were doctors and
ambulance personnel at the Leppings Lane end who were dealing with those
brought out through the tunnel from the terraces. The fact that Mr
Worsley may have thought that Mr Williams was dead does not mean that
those more expert did so, or that they abandoned him.

Roger Ball is the father of Kester Ball, who died in the disaster. He came
to see me in London on 31 October 1997. Mr Ball gave evidence at the
Inquest to the effect that he was in pen 3 and became crushed. Shortly
before the game was stopped he must have lost consciousness. He regained
consciousness near Gate C, with someone slapping his face. He fully
recovered, and was not taken to hospital but searched for his son.

There has been put before me also a letter from solicitors acting for a Mr Ian
Wier to Mr Ball’s solicitors. It is stated that Mr Wier found Mr Ball
collapsed on the ground and apparently dead. The man next to Mr Ball was
dead. Mr Wier says that Mr Ball was going blue in the face and another
supporter trod on his chest to get out of the ground. He revived Mr Ball by
slapping his face.
30.   It seems that Mr Ball recovered consciousness without any resuscitative
      treatment such as mouth-to-mouth ventilation or heart massage and thereafter
      seems to have made a complete recovery. The fact that a wholly untrained
      person (Mr Wier) thought he was dead does not suggest to me that the
      emergency services were making similar erroneous assumptions.

31.   E dw ard S pearritt is the father of Adam Spearitt, who died as a result of the
      disaster. Adam died in intensive care at 16.45 on 15 April. Edward
      Spearritt gave evidence at the Inquest. He was in pen 4 and was crushed.
      He lost consciousness and was taken to hospital. He too was taken to
      intensive care, but made a full recovery. Counsel for the Family Support
      Group told me that there is no evidence as to what happened to Mr Spearritt
      between the time he lost consciousness at 3.06 pm or thereabouts and 5 pm
      when he arrived at Hospital. Counsel submitted to me that it was reasonable
      to conclude that Mr Spearritt was also left for dead because of what
      happened to other bodies (presumably a reference to Mr Ball)

32.   I have been unable to ascertain at what time Mr Spearritt reached hospital,
      though according to Mr Wardrope it was before 5 p.m. Most of the serious
      cases, of which Mr Spearitt’s was one, were taken to hospital well before
      this. No detailed inquiry or evidence was collated in respect of victims who,
      like Mr Spearritt, were crushed but survived. I do not think that it is
      possible to conclude on the evidence that Mr Spearritt was at any time ‘left
      for dead’.


Ambulancemen

33    I have been asked to consider evidence from three ambulancemen - Anthony
      Edwards, John Flack and Peter Howes.

34.   Anthony Edwards was employed by South Yorkshire Metropolitan
      Ambulance Service (SYMAS). He was on duty on the day of the disaster.
      He has made four signed statements. The first, dated 7 May 1989 to
      SYMAS solicitors, was put on the West Midlands police Holmes computer
      and was available to the Taylor Inquiry and the Coroner. The second is
      dated 25 October 1989. The third is dated 5 September 1995 and the fourth
      is dated October 1997. In addition he has written me a number of letters.

35.   Mr Edwards was very anxious to speak to me and he came to see me on 11
      December 1997. He did not give evidence at the Taylor Inquiry or the
      Inquest but his part in taking Victoria Hicks to hospital is referred to in the
      mini-inquest into her death (24 April 1990, page 9).

36.   In his first statement, of 7 May 1989, Mr Edwards describes the arrival of
       his ambulance at the Penistone Road end, being ordered onto the pitch by
       Mr Hopkins, the Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer, but being told by
police that he could not get through. After the intervention of Mr Hopkins,
his ambulance was driven onto the pitch as the St John Ambulance was
leaving. On the way to the Leppings Lane end progress was slow. Fans
were screaming for the ambulance to stop.

On arrival at that end there was much confusion. Mr Edwards went to assist
a casualty and whilst doing so he was deliberately kicked in his rib. His
ambulance was eventually loaded with a boy and girl (Victoria Hicks) and
another body.

The ambulance left with two policemen, a nurse and two spectators (one of
whom was Trevor Hicks, Victoria’s father), and proceeded to the Northern
General Hospital. The ambulance returned to the ground and Mr Edwards
assisted with casualties at the gymnasium. By this time the serious casualties
had been dealt with, he was exhausted and was told to go to Casualty at the
Royal Hallamshire Hospital because he had been kicked. Mr Edwards said
that he was unaware of any Hillsborough plan or the role of the gymnasium
as a casualty clearing centre or temporary mortuary until he was told on the
day.

Mr Edwards’s statement of 25 October 1989 is immaterial, because it simply
states that he does not wish there to be any prosecution in respect of the
assault on him. In a letter to me dated 10 November 1997 he says that the
two officers who interviewed him on 21 October 1989 (sic) showed him
video tape and photographs of his ambulance on the pitch. He points out
that they must have forgotten this when they interviewed Mr Bruder on 3
May 1990 and gave evidence at the Inquest on 4 May. I refer to this later,
in Chapter 4.

Mr Edwards’s statements of September 1995 and October 1997 add little of
substance to his previous account of his arrival and departure from the pitch,
save to point out that his ambulance experienced no difficulty getting down
the ramp. This was different from the experience of the first two
ambulances to go on the pitch. When treating patients in the gymnasium, he
described the scene as chaotic. There was a shortage of orofarangeal
airways, and he noticed how few bodies had these airways in them. The rest
of the most recent statement is comment.

John Flack was a leading ambulanceman employed by SYMAS and was on
duty on the day. He made four signed statements. The first dated 5 May
1989 was available to the Taylor Inquiry. The others, dated 10 August, 23
October and 29 November 1989 were additionally available to the Coroner.
Mr Flack did not give evidence at the Inquiry or Inquest, but his part in
taking Lee Nicol and Carl Lewis to hospital was referred to in the
summaries which police gave at their respective mini-inquests.

In his first statement Mr Flack describes the arrival of his ambulance at the
Penistone Lane end, contact with Station Officer Eason, driving onto the
pitch and taking a boy (Lee Nicol) who was receiving resuscitative treatment
and was accompanied by a doctor to Northern General Hospital. Apart from
the St John Ambulance this was the first ambulance on the pitch. He
returned to the ground and collected another casualty, but on arrival at the
hospital, the casualty was examined by a doctor and declared dead.

He returned to the ground, this time being directed to Leppings Lane
(outside the ground). There were three ambulances already there. He
described the scene as bedlam with police and fans everywhere. He had
difficulty in finding an ambulance officer in charge or deciding where the
casualty clearing point was. He took a third casualty (Carl Lewis) to the
Royal Hallamshire Hospital accompanied by a local doctor and a Derbyshire
ambulance man (Peter Howes). After that he reported to the Herries Road
bus depot which was being used as the assembly for ambulances.

Mr Flack’s remaining statements are concerned with identification of the
casualties, and add nothing of substance.

Peter Howes was a qualified para-medic employed by Derbyshire
Ambulance Service. He was on duty on the day and his ambulance was
called to assist. He has made two written statements. The first dated 15
September 1989 was available to the Coroner and his part in helping to
resuscitate Carl Lewis and take him to the Hallamshire Hospital was referred
to in the mini-inquest. The second is dated 15 October 1997.

In his first statement he described arrival at the Leppings Lane end. He was
unable to get any clear information and there was no obvious ambulance
point. There was a large number of casualties, some conscious, some not.
He described resuscitative measures on a patient who was lying face down
with a shirt over his head. He intubated the patient and instructed a police
officer on heart compression. He was joined by a doctor who used a
defibrillator carried in the ambulance and inserted a canula. He was then
asked to accompany Carl Lewis to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital with Mr
Flack and the doctor.

His second statement adds little to the previous one. He comments on lack
of police help in finding the location and the fact that they did not receive a
major incident call which might have prepared him for the horrific scenes.

I did not think it necessary to interview any of these witnesses other than Dr
Walker, nor to append their statements to this report. Their statements
were available to the police and are available to the Family Support Group
and I am prepared to accept what is said in them.
Mr W ardrope’s article in the British Medical Journal

49.    Counsel also referred me to an article published in the British Medical
       Journal (BMJ) in November 1991 by Mr Wardrope - the Accident and
       Emergency consultant at the Northern General Hospital - and others. This
       showed that all 13 Hillsborough patients admitted to the hospital in cardiac
       arrest died (two after a period in the Intensive Care Unit), as did the one
       patient admitted to Royal Hallamshire in cardiac arrest.

50.    The significance of the article as far as the Support Group were concerned
       was that it also said that ten patients who were unconscious or convulsing on
       admission and five who were confused were admitted to Intensive Care and
       survived, though the outcome in some cases involved severe neurological
       deficit including two in a persistent vegetative state (one of whom, Tony
       Bland, has since died).

51.    The article also said that of 15 other patients who were admitted with a
       history of unconsciousness, 12 were admitted to the wards and three sent
       home. All except one made a good recovery.


Arguments for quashing the inquest verdicts

52.    Based on the evidence which I have described above, Counsel submitted to
       me that a further application to the Divisional Court for judicial review with
       a view to quashing the verdict of accidental death would have a reasonable
       prospect of success. Counsel cited the following reasons, which I have
       done my best to summarise.

              1.      The medical evidence adduced by the Coroner suggested that
              all the deceased had died quick and painless deaths and that they
              were all dead by 3.15 pm. For this reason the Coroner ruled that no
              evidence after 3.15 could be considered. The 3.15 pm cut off was
              predicated on a number of unrealistic assumptions about the time it
              took for the deceased to be asphyxiated and unconscious. The
              evidence now put forward shows these conclusions and assumptions
              are false. Reliance is primarily placed on the evidence of Dr Walker
              (written submissions, paras 58 &59).

               2.     The fresh medical evidence undermines the justification for
               the 3.15 cut off point and shows that people could have been saved.
               The evidence shows that:

                      (a) some of those who died were alive at 3.15 pm. This is a
                      reference to Dr Walker’s evidence (written submission para
                      76 and oral submission para 81, line 31 - the reference to
                      Houldsworth is an obvious mistake for Walker).
                     (b) At least one supporter who would otherwise have died
                     was saved by proper medical treatment (this appears to be a
                     reference to the cases of Ian McDermott and Stephen
                     Williams, the evidence of Dr Walker that some of those he
                     treated survived, and the BMJ article by Mr Wardrope -
                     written submission para 76).

             3.      That the justification for the 3.15 cut off point was that one
             can be confident that when people became unconscious their deaths
             would have followed, normally within six minutes, or in some cases
             later. But this had been falsified by new evidence that not all those
             who became unconscious died. Reliance is placed on the evidence of
             Dr Walker that some patients treated by him survived, the cases of
             McDermott, Williams, and Mr Wardrope’s article in the BMJ. Had
             this evidence been given or the facts known the whole of this cut off
             point would have been completely undermined (oral submission p66,
             line 17 and p75 p25).

             4.     The jury at the Inquest were not allowed to know that two
             people (Lee Nicol and Adam Spearritt) died after 3.15. The jury
             were not told that people who became unconscious and were taken to
             hospital, recovered (oral submission p77).

             5.      That the evidence previously referred to together with the
             evidence of the ambulance men Edwards, Flack and Howes as to the
             inadequate response to the disaster by the police and emergency
             services was relevant to the question “how” the deceased died and
             the Coroner should have admitted this evidence and not imposed a
             cut off time.

             6. That it would be open to the Divisional Court to hold that the
             verdicts had been procured by fraud, suppression of evidence or
             insufficiency of inquiry (oral submission p69). That the evidence of
             Dr Walker (like that of Mr Houldsworth) was central and its non­
             presentation could amount to fraudulent concealment (oral
             submissions p81).


Conclusions on these submissions

53.   In my judgement these submissions are unfounded.

54.   I now set out my reasons for this conclusion. It is convenient to consider
       the reasons advanced in sub-paragraphs 1 to 4 together, since they raise
       different aspects of the same argument. Sub-paragraph 5 is slightly
       different. Sub-paragraph 6 applies to all evidence said to be new.
Arguments about the 3.15 cut-off point

55.    The arguments advanced in sub-paragraphs 1-3 of paragraph 52 above show
       a complete misunderstanding of the Coroner’s reasons for imposing a cut-off
       point at all or choosing the time of 3.15 pm. I have set these out in
       paragraph 11 of this Chapter, particularly sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and
       (e). I do not need to repeat them here. But essentially they were that it is
       not necessary or appropriate when considering the question “how” , i.e. by
       what means, the deceased came to their death to consider what happened
       after the injuries which resulted in death were inflicted. This reasoning was
       upheld by the Divisional Court. To adduce fresh evidence that some of
       those who died did so after 3.15, or that some of those taken to hospital in a
       state of unconsciousness survived does not affect this reasoning.

56.   The answer to the question how the deceased came to their deaths was that
      they suffered from traumatic or crush asphyxia (see note 1 to this Chapter)
      as a result of being crushed in pens 3 and 4 through dangerous overcrowding
      with the result that they were unable to breathe for a continuous and
      sufficiently long period of time to cause death. They did not come to their
      deaths because first-aid or medical attention failed to resuscitate them.

57.    It was well known to the Coroner and legal representatives of the families,
       and also to the inquest jury, that not all those who died did so before 3.15.
       So far as the Coroner was concerned he said as much in the course of his
       reasons for imposing the cut off (inquest transcript, day 1 pl6). Mr Tim
       King QC, Counsel for the families, confirmed to me that this was so, as is
       apparent from his submissions to the Coroner (day 1, p9) which referred to
       the case of William Pemberton and the evidence of an ambulance man that
       resuscitation at 15.50 appeared to be successful.

58.   So far as the jury was concerned, they had heard evidence in the mini­
       inquests that Lee Nicol died on 17 April, and they heard of the attempts that
      were made to resuscitate him both before and after arrival at hospital. The
      jury also heard that Adam Spearritt and Philip Hammond did not die until
       after attempts to resuscitate them both before and after arrival at hospital
       failed. They also heard the evidence of Mr Wardrope, which I summarise in
      paragraphs 62 and 63 below.

59.    It was well known to the Coroner and the legal representative of the families
       that not all those who were unconscious as a result of the crushing died. At
       Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, evidence was given of successful mouth-to-mouth
       resuscitation being given to those who were unconscious (Bradley, day 1
       page 97).      Other witnesses gave evidence to Lord Taylor that they had
       been unconscious. Mr Hennessey (day 2, page 49) recovered consciousness
       in hospital. Mr Clarke (day 2, page 70) was crushed, blacked out,
       recovered consciousness on the pitch after mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by a
       policeman and was later taken to hospital. Mr Moody (day 3, p98) lost
       consciousness and recovered on the pitch. Mr Smith (day 4, pl36) was
trapped for some minutes, passed out, and recovered consciousness while
being put over the fence.

Evidence was given at the Inquest by many witnesses who said that they
became unconscious because of the crush. Two said they recovered
consciousness in hospital (Mr Spearritt [day 34, p i 1] and Mr Baron [day 35
p l2 and 18]). Others regained consciousness at the ground. Mr Garrett
(day 22 p48) said he temporarily lost hearing and sight. Others were Messrs
Crawford (day 25 p i 8), Anderson (day 27 p33), N J Langley (day 26 pl23),
Oyitch (day 32 p97), Jolly (day 35 p96), Ball (day 40 pl09 - whom I have
already mentioned above), Gray (day 42 p i 2), L D Lloyd (day 45 p i 02),
and T W Lloyd (day 45 p i 17, who lost consciousness twice). Mr King also
confirmed to me that he was well aware of this.

Mr Wardrope, the Consultant in the Accident and Emergency Department at
the Northern General Hospital, gave evidence at the Inquests. His evidence
can be summarised as follows.

He arrived at the hospital at 15.33 and took charge. By then six patients had
already arrived. At first he gave help resuscitating some patients but soon
took over the job of triaging patients as they arrived. 87 patients were
received in the first hour. 13 of these were suffering cardiac arrest. Some of
these were triaged dead on arrival. It is not quite clear how many this
applied to, but it seems to have been not more than four.

Other patients received resuscitative treatment but died. These patients were
not dead on arrival, otherwise resuscitative treatment would not have been
attempted. Two patients, Lee Nicol and Adam Spearritt, were admitted to
the Intensive Care Unit but subsequently died. Of the 87 patients, 17 were
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.

Although Mr Wardrope’s article in the BMJ is somewhat more detailed, it
does not differ significantly from this evidence. What is apparent from Mr
Wardrope’s evidence is that a substantial number of patients were not dead
on their admission to hospital, but died subsequently; and that of the 17
patients who were taken into intensive care, and were therefore almost
certainly unconscious and seriously ill, the great majority lived.

In his summing up (day 75, p72) the Coroner told the jury:

       “In order to avoid any possible misunderstandings, o f course, you
       have to understand particularly with asphyxial deaths and
       particularly in the light o f what the various pathologists said, if you
       could have got to a particular person or if one had got to a person
       before the irretrievable damage had been done then, provided one
       did resuscitation correctly, that person might well not only have
       recovered but might have been perfectly alright. That is undeniable.
       Indeed, we have seen several people who were unconscious, who told
              us so, and who are here and who seem perfectly alright because the
              cells in their case fortunately had not been so severely damaged as to
              the irretrievably harmed. That, if you like, is the beauty o f the body,
              that you can assault it like that and retrieve it before it is too late and
              the people themselves just recover. ”

66.    The fact that Dr Walker had treated Lee Nicol was referred to at the mini­
       inquest on him (1 May 1990, p9). It is clear that the rest of the evidence
       which I have seen from Dr Walker, Ian McDermott and Stephen Williams
       adds nothing to the evidence given at the Inquest.


A reuments about the response to the disaster

67.    I now turn to consider the submission (5 in my summary of the arguments at
       para 52 above) that the inquest verdicts should be quashed because the fresh
       evidence, particularly that of the ambulance men, shows that lives could
       have been saved by a more prompt and efficient response from the
       emergency services.

68.    The fact that evidence was available, from ambulance men who were not
       called at the Taylor Inquiry, about confusion, lack of comprehension by
       some police officers and other difficulties, does not in any way undermine or
       affect the Coroner’s decision not to have a wide-ranging inquiry into the
       response of the emergency services or his decision to have a cut-off point
       into the inquiry as to how the deceased came to their death. Indeed it is only
       to be expected that evidence relating to the rescue operation existed. Had
       the Coroner embarked on such an inquiry, which was wholly unnecessary
       for the purpose of answering the question of how the victims met their
       deaths, it is quite evident to me that the Inquest, which lasted an extremely
       long time as it was, would have become totally impossible.

69.    As the Divisional Court pointed out, it was a matter for the Coroner’s
       discretion at what point he chose to confine the inquiry. Even if there had
       been no prior investigation into the response of the police and emergency
       services, the Coroner would have been perfectly entitled to limit the inquiry
       as he did. But again, as the Court pointed out, the decision was “reasonable
       and sustainable, particularly bearing in mind the exhaustive public inquiry
       which had already been conducted by Lord Taylor” (per McCowan LJ,
       transcript p3). I shall return to this matter in the second part of this chapter.


Fraud or suppression o f evidence ?

70.    The suggestion that the evidence now put before me on this aspect of the
       case was deliberately suppressed and concealed and those concerned acted in
       bad faith, is, in my opinion, wholly irresponsible. The evidence of Mr
       Edwards and Mr Flack was available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry. There is
nothing surprising in the fact that they were not called to give evidence since
they did not add materially to that which was given.

Dr Walker’s evidence was available to the Coroner and the fact that he had
treated Lee Nicol was referred to at the mini-inquest on him. It would be
unusual for a junior doctor to be called to give evidence of treatment, even if
he was the first anaesthetist on the scene. The matter was dealt with, as one
would expect, by Dr Appleyard, the Consultant Anaesthetist in charge of the
Intensive Care Unit who was called to give evidence. For reasons I have
already given, Dr Walker added nothing of any significance.

So far as the evidence of Ian McDermott and Stephen Williams is concerned,
the West Midlands Police took a very large number of statements from
Liverpool supporters including Mr McDermott. More than 50 were called
at the Taylor Inquiry and over 100 gave evidence at the Inquest (only 8 of
whom had done so before at the Inquiry). I think it is worth quoting what
Lord Taylor said about the West Midlands Police.

        “/ pay tribute particularly to the West Midlands Police fo r their
       speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to all those
        responsible fo r processing it. The most eloquent tribute to fairness
       and thoroughness o f the police investigation came from the Secretary
        o f the Football Supporters ’ Association. He said there had been
        initial anxiety at Liverpool as to whether that investigation would be
       fa ir and objective. His Association therefore collected 200 witness
        statements themselves. Having heard the opening statement by
        Counsel to the Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered by the
       police, he found that it accorded entirely with his Association’s
        evidence and the initial anxiety was wholly dispelled. ” (interim
        report, para 16).

It is obvious that the police could not take statements from all those who
were in pens 3 and 4 who survived the ordeal. As I have pointed out the
evidence of these witnesses did not differ materially from that of witnesses
who were called to give evidence. The suggestion, if indeed it is made in
respect of those witnesses that their evidence was concealed or suppressed,
is completely unfounded.

In my opinion it is quite impossible on the basis of the evidence and
submissions now advanced to impugn the verdict of accidental death or
suggest that the Divisional Court should again be invited judicially to review
that verdict.
Note 1 (to paragraph 11)

There is a semantic argument based on the difference between traumatic and
crush asphyxia.

 Before Hillsborough the expression traumatic asphyxia was generally used to
 describe asphyxia due to the application o f external force. It covers a wide
 range o f cases from instant death due to crushing by some enormous weight,
 strangulation where unconsciousness occurs fairly quickly but death only after
 some period, to cases like the present where the chest is fixed in position fo r a
period o f about 4-6 minutes, so that throughout that time the victim cannot
 breathe. As in the case o f strangulation, i f the pressure is released before
 death occurs recovery can take place, though it is not necessarily always
 complete. I f death has not already occurred, resuscitative treatment in the
form o f oxygen or mouth-to-mouth ventilation together with external heart
 massage is the appropriate first aid treatment.

 The problem at Hillsborough was that those who died were unable to breathe
fo r too long a time, because it was not immediately recognised what was
 happening to them and the extreme difficulty o f access. It may be that crush
 asphyxia is a somewhat more specific description than traumatic asphyxia to
 describe the cause o f their deaths. But the Coroner used the terms
 interchangeably and in my view he was right to do so.
The Rescue Operation


75.   Should there now be a fresh judicial inquiry into the response of the police
      and the emergency services, with a view to ascertaining whether lives could
      have been saved? In my interviews with some of the families, this appeared
      to be what they wanted.

76.   I also had some submissions on this topic from Professor Scraton, Director
      of the Centre for Studies in Crime and Social Justice at Edge Hill University
      College. I was not initially clear as to what further investigation or inquiry
      Professor Scraton thought ought to occur, but in due course it appeared that
      this was one of the two aspects that he urged ought to be inquired into. It
      became one of the main points in the final written submissions which he sent
      me on 3 December 1997.

77.   I cannot agree that there should be a new public inquiry into the rescue
      operation. It was extensively inquired into by Lord Taylor. He reached
      certain conclusions and made recommendations. I will set out as briefly as
      I can the nature of the evidence that the Taylor Inquiry heard, and the
      findings and recommendations made in relation to this matter.


The evidence heard by Lord Taylor

78.   Liverpool supporters spoke of the slow reaction of the police in appreciating
      what was going on in the pens, the failure to open the perimeter gates earlier
      and their closure in the early stages. Police officers who had been
      stationed on the perimeter track, in the West Stand and in the Control Box,
      gave evidence as to why they did not appreciate sooner what was happening.

79.   Many police officers and supporters gave evidence to Lord Taylor of
      attempts to extricate casualties from the pens and the difficulties involved,
      attempts at resuscitation by police and supporters, and the chaotic conditions
      in the pens and on the pitch.

80.    St John Ambulance personnel who were on duty on the day gave evidence
       about the rescue work. Mr Wells was the Divisional Superintendent in
       charge. Mr Hytner QC who appeared for the families at Lord Taylor’s
       Inquiry expressly stated (day 19 pl9) that having read hundreds of
       statements of supporters there was no word of criticism levelled against the
       St John Ambulance Brigade. The other St John personnel who gave
       evidence were Divisional Superintendent Towler, Mr Godley and Mr
       Saxton.

81.    Two South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYMAS) officers,
       Station Officer Higgins and Mr Eason, who were present at the disaster gave
      evidence to Lord Taylor. They spoke of the confused situation, difficulty of
      access and problems with the radio. Mr Hopkins, the Deputy Chief
      Metropolitan Officer took over command on the ground at the Penistone
      Road end. He dealt at length with the arrangements for use of the
      gymnasium as a casualty station, access for ambulances, equipment carried
      and the operation generally. He was not cross examined by Mr Hytner. Mr
      Clarke and Mr Page, Senior ambulance officers, gave evidence about the
      control of the operation at Headquarters.

82.   Lord Taylor’s Inquiry considered at length the questions of when
      ambulances were summoned, why they were not summoned earlier, when
      the major accident plan was put into effect and why it was not done earlier.
      This involved the evidence of the police officers who had been in the control
      box and SYMAS personnel at Headquarters. The question of why there was
      no request for doctors and nurses to attend the injured until late on was dealt
      with, together with the impact on casualties.

83.   The Taylor Inquiry also looked at the question of when emergency
      equipment was asked for and why it did not arrive until it was too late.
      The Inquiry went into these issues with the police and the fire brigade.
      Altogether five fire officers gave evidence of the part the brigade played in
      the rescue operation.


Doctors

84.   Five doctors, three of whom were Liverpool supporters present at the match
      as spectators, gave evidence as to the parts they played in the rescue
      operation. In the light of the submissions now made, it may be helpful to
      refer to some of the evidence given by these doctors.

85.   D r Byrne was a Consultant Anaesthetist. He went down to the pitch at
      about 3.20. He saw that cardio-pulmonary resuscitation appeared to be
      being carried out efficiently and that he could be more use elsewhere. On
      the directions of the police he went to the gymnasium. There were already
      two doctors there. He assisted in treating patients and later gave formal
      confirmation of death in relation to 16 bodies. His cross examination by Mr
      Hytner is important and I set it out in full (Taylor Inquiry day 25 p24).

             Q. D r Byrne, I am not sure that I got an answer o f yours down
             accurately. I f I did, I would like you to help us about explaining it; if
             not, I will not have any questions. I think you said that an earlier
             call fo r help would not have done very much good. Have I got that
             down accurately or inaccurately? - A. No, that is correct.

              Q. Just fo r the benefit o f the bereaved, I think I ought to ask you to
              explain that a little. Can I take it stage by stage. In the crush, there
would have been those who immediately or after a while stopped
breathing ? -A . That is correct.

Q. There will be those who got on to the pitch still breathing but
gasping fo r breath, maybe with rib injuries or something o f that sort?
- A. I believe there were a few.

Q. By the time any doctor would have got to the pitch, however
quickly, there would have been those who were already clinically
dead - is that right? - A. That is correct.

Q. No good could have come from any doctor getting to them
because they are dead? - A. Some o f them may have been able to be
resuscitated from the cardio-vascular point o f view but would have
suffered such lack o f oxygen to the brain that had they been
resuscitated, they would have severe lack o f oxygen brain damage.

Q. When I say “clinically dead” I mean not capable o f being
resuscitated. - A. Well, capable o f being resuscitated from the
circulation point o f view; I am sorry.

Q. In between, would there have been those who were either finding
it difficult to breathe or who, though alive, had ceased temporarily to
breathe? - A. There would certainly be some perhaps finding it
difficult to breathe fo r a number o f reasons. Most o f those reasons
would involve slightly more sophisticated equipment than would have
been available or one would expect to be available at a football
ground.

Q. You see, the comment that earlier medical attention would not
have done any good would seem to imply logically that once the
doctors got there they could not do much good. Are you saying that
really however heroically people were behaving in attempting mouth-
to-mouth resuscitation and so forth, they did not actually do any
good? - A. I think that is my overall impression, yes.

Q. So people who appeared to be revived by mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation or other means o f resuscitation, are you suggesting that
if they had not had medical attention eventually they would have
started breathing o f their own accord? - A. I believe there are odd
patients who have recovered after mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but
they would have had to be resuscitated very, very quickly.

Q. You appreciate I have no medical instructions to challenge
anything that you are saying. I am simply trying to get some
clarification. - A. Yes.
86.   Dr Byrne was re-examined by Mr Collins QC, Counsel to the Taylor Inquiry
      (page 29) -

            Q. D r Byrne, can I explore something a little more o f M r H ytner’s
            questions ? Am I right in thinking that broadly there are two
            categories. There are those who have already died in the sense that
            they have stopped breathing as a result o f crushing, and those you
            think probably would not have been saved by an earlier call fo r
            medical assistance? - A. Yes, that is correct.

            Q. Because they would have been crushed on the terraces and would
            have been likely to have suffered, effectively, death before they were
            able to be got out? - A. They would have suffered severe brain
            complications.

            Q. And the only way o f resuscitating those sort o f people would have
            been to have got them either mouth-to-mouth or oxygen or whatever
            in the terraces themselves or immediately upon being brought out? -
            A. That is correct.

            Q. I suppose a doctor present immediately on them being brought
            out might have assisted but he could not, I suspect, have done a great
            deal more than a trained ambulanceman or a trained St John’s
            person could have done, is that right? - A. Yes, in that situation.

            Q. So fa r as the other sort are concerned, there are those who have
            suffered some sort o f crush injuries, perhaps fractured ribs or
            whatever and who as a result have difficulty in breathing. Is that
            right? - A. Yes.

             Q. And if they are not given treatment, they might cease to breathe
             altogether? - A. There is a condition called tension pneumothorax
             where the rib punctures the lining o f the lung and if it happens on
             both sides, then you cannot breathe and you need a seal putting in
             the chest, involving inserting a special needle in.

            Q. That I can see, but what I am getting at is there may have been
            people presumably brought out from those terraces who had difficulty
            in breathing, who had not ceased breathing but who had difficulty in
            breathing? - A. There was certainly one patient that I saw.

             Q. And there may well have been others? - A. Yes.

             Q. Lord Justice Taylor:   On the pitch ? - A. No, in the
             gymnasium.

             Q. Still having difficulty then? - A. Yes. He had clinically obvious
             rib fractures.
      Q. M r Collins: And those sort o f patients would have needed
      medical attention? I am sorry, that is the wrong question. Such
      patients could have been assisted by medical attention - is that right?
      - A. My view would be that you would get a patient like that quickly
      to hospital.

      Q. I see. That is really all that sensibly can be done? - A. Unless
      you have this special equipment fo r relieving tension pneumothorax.

       Q. We know that oxygen was administered to a number o f people. Is
       that simply to help them when they have difficulties in breathing ? -
      A. The use o f high inspired concentrations o f oxygen in this situation
       is, I think, probably not very well proven. It is more as a device to
      force something into the lungs. There is 20 per cent oxygen in the air
       and that is usually sufficient, but it has to be got into the lungs. This
       device that has been mentioned is in fact just a way o f inflating the
       lungs but, instead o f with air, with 100 p er cent oxygen. So I don’t
       think in that situation it’s been proven that 100 per cent oxygen is
       necessarily any better than air.

      Q. So does it boil down to this - that although obviously the
      presence o f a doctor helps to tend to a patient to diagnose fractures
      and to treat the patient in the correct manner, what really matters is
      getting patients in this sort o f situation to hospital as quickly as
      possible? - A. That is my belief. ”

D r Ashton was a Liverpool supporter. He answered the call for doctors and
nurses and went to the back of the West Stand. The police did not seem to
know what was wanted or who was in charge. He assisted with the
resuscitation and sorting out priorities as to who should go to hospital. He
was critical of the absence of equipment. He was asked (Taylor Inquiry,
day 25 p i 15):

       Q. Well now do you think looking back on it and seeing what was
       there, that if equipment o f this nature had been available it would
       have made any practical difference to the number o f people who
       survived? - A. I think it is a very difficult question because o f the
       nature o f the injuries. It seems to me that a lot o f people were
       actually dead when they were brought out from the ground so we are
       really in the realms o f speculation. What I would say is if there had
       been equipment there then at least the various medical and nursing
       people who were there and who became involved, many o f whom
       have contacted me, could at least have had a go at trying to do
       something with the equipment.
       Q. Well we have heard today that those people who were not
       breathing had something like four minutes before they were going to
       be in serious trouble if not dead? - A. That is correct.

Dr Ashton arranged for serious cases to go to hospital. Those who were left
were either dead or had minor injuries. He and another doctor confirmed
those who were dead at that end of the ground.

Dr Curpen was a Liverpool supporter. He realised there was trouble and
went to help. The police diverted him to the gymnasium. This was just
after 3.20 and he was the first doctor there. There was very little equipment
at that stage. But later, about 3.30, a team of para-medics arrived and there
was then all the equipment needed. He then examined bodies and confirmed
those that were dead.

D r Phillips was also a Liverpool supporter. He went onto the pitch at about
3.10 and assisted with resuscitation. After that he looked for people who
were dangerously ill; but he could not find any, they were either dead or
slightly injured. He gave evidence during day 25 of Lord Taylor’s Inquiry,
when he said (p 95):

       Q. So fa r as that is concerned, can you say if there is anybody who
       might have been saved but was not as a result o f what you perceived
       as to the inadequacies o f the equipment from your point o f view? -
       A. I can only say that there may have been because it may well be
       that the delay in getting people out o f the terrace was too great and
       by then it was probably or possibly too late fo r them and it concerns
       me not that people would have been harmed by a de-fibrillator, that
       in actual fa ct maybe some severely brain-damaged people may have
       been revived and we would now have a great number o f still
       unconscious, permanently brain-damaged fans.

At page 96 of the transcript he says “I f they had not been breathing fo r [4
minutes], then it was hopeless, I agree.”

All this evidence was entirely in accord with that given by the pathologists
and Mr Wardrope at the Inquests. Even if Dr Walker’s evidence was at
variance with it, which in my view it is not, it would not justify the issue
being reopened. Mr King told me that he had advised the families that if the
evidence of the pathologists at the Inquest was to be challenged, medical
evidence would be required to support the challenge. This was obviously
correct advice. No such evidence was forthcoming then or now.

In addition to those who gave oral evidence to Lord Taylor a considerable
number of statements from ambulance personnel, firemen and doctors who
responded to the call for help were available to his Inquiry. Lord Taylor
made it clear that he had taken into account many written statements in
addition to oral testimony and that he would not have been assisted by
       calling any more witnesses to give evidence in person (interim report,
       paragraph 14). I have looked at the written statements which were then
       available, some of which can be found on the body files. In my opinion
       their effect is not significantly different from that of the witnesses who gave
       oral evidence at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry though they are of course all dealing
       with the particular part which they played.


Lord Taylor’s conclusions about the rescue operation

94.    Lord Taylor dealt with the rescue operation in Chapter 5 of his Interim
       Report. At para 89 he said

               “Those capable o f survival mostly came round o f their own accord.
              The rest were mostly doomed before they could be brought out and
              treated. ”

95.    In Chapter 14 of his interim report Lord Taylor dealt with the response of
       the police. He criticised the slow appreciation of Mr Duckenfield and Mr
       Murray of what was happening.       He continued (para 251 and 252)

              “ Until Chief Superintendent Nesbit arrived, there was no effective
              leadership either from control or on the pitch to harness and
              organise rescue efforts. No orders were given fo r officers to enter
              the tunnel and relieve pressure. Some officers did this on their own
              initiative. Apart from the Tannoy request to clear the pitch, no
              attempt was made to clear and mark o ff a casualty area where first-
              aid could be given without hindrance by fans and photographers
              milling about between the bodies. There was no co-ordination o f the
              early provision o f first-aid or o f stretcher parties or o f the rescue
              effort through gates 3 and 4. No request fo r help was broadcast to
              doctors and nurses in the crowd until about 3.29 pm when it was too
              late. Probably, there was little that could have been achieved in
              most cases however soon doctors had been summoned, but there were
              marginal cases where earlier attention might have made a difference.

               The plight o f those behind the fencing and the existence o f injuries
              were known to officers at the scene from 3 pm. But the Major
              Disaster Plan was not started until 3.06 pm at earliest when the
               ambulance service was called. No request fo r cutting gear or fo r the
              fire brigade was made until 3.13 pm. Again, it is unlikely that these
               services could have saved lives if they had been called promptly, but
               it is possible.”

96.    In Chapter 21 of his interim report Lord Taylor reported on the first-aid and
       emergency services. He said (paras 296 and 297)
              “/ say at the outset o f this chapter that no valid criticism can be
              made o f the response by the St John Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS
              or by the fire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represented party
              ventured any criticism o f them. The only attack on SYMAS came
             from two Liverpool doctors. One claimed that ambulances did not
              arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipment and that there was a lack
              o f triage. He was proved to be wrong in all three aspects.
              Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April when he
              said more lives could have been saved if staff and equipment had
              arrived earlier. Apart from being proved wrong in fa ct as to the
              times o f arrival o f ambulances, he conceded in evidence that it was
              not possible to say whether lives could have been saved. His
              comments on television were irresponsible. The other doctor
              complained o f the absence o f defibrillators. I am satisfied on
              overwhelming evidence that to attempt to use a defibrillator on the
             pitch with people milling about would have been highly dangerous
              owing to the risk o f injury from the electric charge.

             I fin d that all three o f the emergency services named above responded
             promptly when alerted, that they brought appropriate equipment and
             that their personnel operated efficiently. ”

97.   Lord Taylor made comments on what it was reasonable to expect in the way
      of equipment. He criticised the lack of co-operation between police and
      emergency services and dealt with problems of access for ambulances. In
      his final report Lord Taylor made specific recommendations in relation to
      co-ordination of the emergency services with the police (para 228), and the
      sort of first-aid, medical facilities and ambulances that should be available at
      football stadia.


Mr Edwards’s evidence

98.   I discussed earlier in this Chapter the written statements about the
      emergency services response from Mr Tony Edwards, a former South
      Yorkshire ambulanceman. I think it is convenient at this point to discuss
      the oral evidence that he gave me. I had not thought it necessary to
      interview Mr Edwards, for reasons which I have already described. But he
      was anxious to come to see me and he did so on 11 December 1997.

99.   Although he had never mentioned this before, Mr Edwards told me that he
      was critical of the response of the ambulance service. He said that, in his
      opinion, ambulances should have gone onto the pitch and triaging should
      have taken place at the Leppings Lane end of the pitch. He blamed himself
      for not triaging patients at this end of the pitch. He said this was his duty as
      the only ambulance man there. Specifically, he said that Victoria Hicks
      should not have been put in his ambulance as she was already dead, whereas
       he believed that her sister Sarah was not. But he did not take Sarah’s pulse
       or see if her pupils reacted to light.

100.   Mr Edwards said that his ambulance should have stopped before leaving the
       ground for triaging to take place. He said he had never mentioned these
       criticisms - and others which he had - before, because he expected to be
       called to give evidence and cross-examined on them. Mr Edwards did not
       understand that he could not be cross-examined with a view to eliciting
       matters he had never mentioned. It seems to me that his criticism of the
       operation ignores the fact that there were both doctors and St John
       Ambulance personnel at the Leppings Lane end of the pitch, as well as from
       time to time Mr Higgins, Mr Carpenter and Mr Eason from SYMAS, even
       though these people may not have been there during the relatively short
       period when Mr Edwards himself was there. Mr Edwards’s criticism also
       ignores the fact that the triaging was taking place at the gymnasium in
       accordance with a pre-existing plan agreed between the ambulance service
       and the police, and that the quite chaotic conditions on the pitch would have
       made it extremely difficult to do it there.

101.   It is clear that Mr Edwards has been racked with guilt, at least apparently
       since the Cook Report television programme about Hillsborough shown in
       June 1994, because he feels that he himself could and should have done
       more. I do not think he should blame himself. He was obeying Mr
       Hopkins’ order in going down the pitch to pick up casualties and take them
       to hospital as quickly as possible. He would have faced a very difficult task
       in trying to persuade Mr Hicks that his daughter Victoria should be left
       behind, even if it meant taking Sarah instead. He had already sustained an
       assault in the course of his duty and valuable time would have been lost.


Conclusion about the rescue operation

102.   In the light of Lord Taylor’s very full and detailed inquiry, and the specific
       findings and recommendations, I cannot see that any useful purpose would
       be served by having any further inquiry into the rescue operation. Even if
       some ambulance men, notably Mr Edwards, feel that they or the service
       generally could have done more in spite of the very difficult conditions, I do
       not think this could affect Lord Taylor’s findings and recommendations.

103.   It would clearly be quite impossible to say about any given victim of the
       disaster that if more sophisticated or competent aid had reached him or her
       at some unspecified earlier moment, they would have survived. Any wide
       ranging inquiry such as advocated by Professor Scraton and some of the
       families I have spoken to, would clearly impose enormous burdens on the
       police, the emergency services and the hospital and medical staff. But these
       burdens would in my judgement be to no purpose.
104.   In my opinion there is no evidence of want of care by the emergency or
       medical services. In any event the extent of the legal duty of care on rescue
       services towards those who are injured is limited. Their duty is not to
       create or increase the danger created by others. They are not liable for an
       ineffective response to an emergency caused by others, at least until they
       have assumed responsibility for the care of a particular patient (see Capital
       and Counties PLC v Hampshire County Council [1997] 3WLR 331).

105.   I have not understood Counsel for the Family Support Group to invite any
       further inquiry into these matters. Instead they made it plain that they
       accepted Lord Taylor’s findings and the sufficiency of his Inquiry.
CHAPTER 4


Alleged improper interference with witnesses


1.    During the course of my scrutiny I have heard allegations that the evidence of
      witnesses to the disaster was tampered with. There are two types of allegation
      of this sort.

2.    The first is that the West Midlands Police, who investigated what happened at
      Hillsborough on behalf of Lord Taylor, the Coroner, and the Director of Public
      Prosecutions put pressure on three named witnesses - Derek Bruder, Debra
      Martin, and Paul Taylor - to change their evidence in various ways. I
      consider these allegations in the first part of this Chapter.

3.    The second concerns the way in which the South Yorkshire Police obtained
      evidence about the disaster from their own officers. I consider this in the
      second part of this Chapter.


Part 1 - allegations against the West Midlands Police

4.    In their written submissions to me Counsel for the Hillsborough Family
       support Group stated (para 103) that:

               “Evidence has come to light which tends to show that some witnesses
              were pressured into changing their evidence (or prevented from
              adding to their evidence) by officers from the West Midlands Police.
              In the main, this pressure was brought to bear in order to prevent
              evidence being put before the jury which tended to contradict the
              theory that all the deceased were dead by 3.15pm. This evidence
              demonstrates the biased and incomplete nature o f the investigation,
              and the desire on the part o f those investigating the disaster to keep
              to a minimum the scrutiny o f South Yorkshire Police’s reaction to the
              disaster. ”

5.     Counsel cited three witnesses who they said had been pressured in this way.
       Two of them - Derek Bruder and Debra Martin - made written statements
       relating to the death of Kevin Williams. The other, Paul Taylor, had
       evidence about the death of Victoria Hicks.


The Kevin Williams case

6.     Kevin Williams’ case was one of the six that the Divisional Court considered
       in 1993 during the application for judicial review (see Chapter 1, para 66
(c)) in connection with the seventh ground of the application, namely that
there was evidence available to show that the Coroner and his jury were not
given the full picture in the summaries at the mini-inquests and the omission
of certain relevant facts vitiated those proceedings. The factual issue in
Kevin Williams’ case was whether he was dead when recovered from the
pen or whether he died a little later, at some time after 15.32 or possibly as
late as 15.55.

At the mini-inquest on Kevin Williams on 2 May 1990 Dr Slater, the
pathologist, said that in his opinion his death had occurred very quickly.
Kevin’s case was unusual because there were four fractures of the larynx,
and it was in Dr Slater’s view a case of very severe traumatic asphyxia due
to crushing of the neck and chest.

Dr Slater’s view that Kevin had died quickly was at variance with the
evidence of two witnesses. The first was an off-duty Liverpool policeman,
Derek Bruder, who had been sitting in the stand watching the match but
came down to the pitch to help in the rescue operation. The second was
Debra Martin, a South Yorkshire Police Special Constable who was on duty
at the ground.

In a statement dated 27 April 1989 PC Bruder said that he had seen a man,
who was later identified as Kevin Williams, lying on the pitch near the Kop
End of the stadium. As Mr Bruder approached him the man had
convulsions and his head moved as if he was being sick. Together with a St
John Ambulance man, Mr Bruder attempted to resuscitate him with mouth-
to-mouth ventilation and cardiac massage. He could feel a slight pulse in his
neck.

Attempts were made to stop an ambulance, but it continued down the pitch.
PC Bruder and the St John man continued to attempt to revive Kevin
Williams without success. They were then joined by a St John Ambulance
woman and shortly after this the ambulance man said the patient was dead.
Mr Bruder agreed that he was.

Kevin’s body was then taken to the gymnasium, which was being used as a
temporary mortuary, by a number of other people. One of these was
Special Constable Debra Martin. In a statement dated 8 May 1989, she said
that Kevin had stopped breathing while he was in the gymnasium. She gave
him the kiss of life and heart massage and a doctor helped. Kevin started
breathing, opened his eyes and said “Mom” and then died.

A doctor confirmed Kevin Williams as being dead at 16.06.

During the mini-inquest on Kevin Williams on 2 May 1990 Dr Slater was
asked about these matters. He said he thought Mr Bruder may have been
mistaken in believing he found a slight pulse. So far as WPC Martin’s
statement was concerned, there was no way in which someone with the
severe injury to his voice box which Kevin had could have said “Mom” .

The Coroner caused further enquiries to be made. Inspector Sawers of the
West Midlands Police took a further statement from PC Bruder on the 3rd
May 1990. In it he said that since Hillsborough he had had further training
in first aid. In relation to his earlier statement when he described Kevin
Williams as having convulsions, he said:

        “I have thought about this carefully today and with the added benefit
       o f my training I can say that this was not a process that lasted fo r
       any time. It certainly wasn’t anything similar to an epileptic fit, fo r
       example. It was an impression that I had which I originally
       associated with the lad vomiting. I will say that I did not see the
       casualty vomit nor did I see any sick on the body or grassed area
       around him. I will correct further references to vomit as they occur
       in my original statement.

       I refer to feeling fo r a carotid pulse in the neck and said originally
       that I thought I could detect a slight pulse, however, I now feel that I
       am able to correct this. I felt fo r the pulse with my first two fingers
       o f my left hand, I believe, to the carotid artery. I cannot say
       absolutely that I fe lt fo r the pulse before I started mouth-to-mouth or
       after; nor indeed whether I did both simultaneously. Whilst I would
       now have much more skill, on the day I cannot say with absolute
       certainly that I went accurately straight to the carotid artery.

       For all those reasons, I can say that I fe lt fo r a pulse in the region o f
       the carotid artery, but I may have also touched the area o f the
        ‘Adams Apple ’ or felt something in the neck region which I originally
       thought was a pulse but may have been mistaken. ”

Inspector Sawers also asked Mr Bruder about the reference in his previous
statement to trying to stop an ambulance. Mr Bruder maintained that the
ambulance in question was on its way into the ground and going to the
Leppings Lane end.

WPC Martin had been seen on 17th March 1990 by WPS Appleton of the
West Midlands Police, who took a further statement from her. In this
further statement Miss Martin described how upset she had been on the day
and that her recollection of events was vague and confused. By the time she
came to deal with Kevin Williams’ body, which she was told to stay with in
the gymnasium, she was in a state of shock and felt like a ‘zombie’. She
said:

        “I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to believe the boy was dead.
       I didn’t know if he was dead or not but I decided that I had got to
       attempt to revive him. I started to give him mouth-to-mouth but
       someone, I don’t know who, touched me on the shoulder and told me
       he was dead. By this time my head had gone, I wasn’t aware o f what
       I was doing or what was really happening. ”

The Coroner resumed the mini-inquest on Kevin Williams on 4 May 1990.
Sergeant Killock told the jury the substance of Mr Bruder’s first statement.
Inspector Sawers then told the jury about Mr Bruder’s second statement. He
said that he had pointed out to Mr Bruder that there appeared to be a
discrepancy between what he was saying about the ambulance which they
had tried to stop, and the known times of the first two ambulances on the
pitch. At that point it seems to have been overlooked by everyone that in
fact a third ambulance - driven by Mr Edwards - had come onto the pitch.

The Coroner recalled Dr Slater. He affirmed his opinion that Kevin was
brain dead at the time when he was removed from the pen, but accepted that
his body was not dead until later, when Mr Bruder was trying to resuscitate
him. He said (transcript, page 13 B-D):

       Q. “In the light o f what you heard and what we have heard now, do
       you feel that this lad died, if you like, in the totality sense, I don ’t
       mean that his skin was dead, but in lay terms at the point in time
       when M r Bruder was with him ?

       A. “Yes, sir, I am quite confident o f that. When one speaks to lay
       people who have experienced people dying, a word which is recurrent
       in these descriptions o f death is the way that individuals turn ‘grey’,
       recurring several times. To me as a doctor that implied that that was
       the point o f whole body death. In fact I feel that that it was probably
       around that time that Kevin’s whole body died. His brain had died
       twenty /twenty-five minutes before that at the time o f the crushing, but
       his whole body died at the time PC Bruder was with him. ”

Dr Gumpert, a Consultant Clinical Neurophysiologist and Neurologist, was
also called. He agreed with Dr Slater’s opinion. He accepted the possibility
that Mr Bruder might have felt a carotid pulse (pl7A).

In his judgement in the Divisional Court, Lord Justice McCowan reviewed
this evidence at considerable length. He said (page 28G of the judgement):

       “We were told that some while after, Mrs Williams, the deceased’s
       mother, made contact with Police Constable Bruder and Woman
       Police Constable Martin, and they alleged that they had been
       pressurised into changing stories and that they now stuck by their
       original versions. Where does the truth lie? I see no fault in the
       Coroner in this matter. He made fu ll inquiry. He was not asked by
       the applicant’s representative to do more. There was overwhelming
       medical evidence that the deceased was in fa ct dead by 3 .15pm. In
       my judgement it would not be right to quash the verdicts and order a
               new inquest on the strength o f these allegations made against the
               investigating police officers. ”

22.   The Divisional Court did not find it necessary to investigate the allegation
      that the West Midlands police investigators had put Mr Bruder or Miss
      Martin under improper pressure.      The proceedings before the Court
      concerned the conduct of the Coroner, not the police. No criticism could be
      made of the Coroner, who had investigated Kevin Williams’ case with great
      thoroughness.

23.   I have investigated the allegation of improper pressure. This is not because
      it could affect the verdict of accidental death on Kevin Williams. It plainly
      could not alter that. Nor could it affect the 3.15 cut-off point. The
      Coroner had sound reasons for making his decision about that and these
      would not have been affected by the question of whether Kevin Williams
      died before then as Dr Slater originally thought, or afterwards as PC Bruder
      and WPC Martin thought.

24.   I have looked into this in great detail because an allegation of improper
      pressure against a police officer to persuade a witness to change his or her
      evidence contrary to that witness’s recollection and belief, is a very serious
      matter. But there is all the difference in the world between such conduct
      and seeking to reconcile, if one can, apparent inconsistencies between
      witnesses.


Derek Bruder

25.   I interviewed Mr Bruder on 6 October 1997. He told me how he came to
      make his second statement on 3 May 1990. He said Inspector Sawers came
      to see him on that day because he (Sawers) wanted to clarify certain medical
      issues which had been brought up in Mr Bruder’s first statement. Mr
      Bruder told me that because they were both having difficulty understanding
      points, Inspector Sawers telephoned the Coroner’s office and spoke to
      someone there and explained the difficulty. The telephone was handed to
      Mr Bruder who discussed what he had seen with the person on the
      telephone, who must have been Dr Slater. There was a discussion about the
      movement of the body which Mr Bruder had described as a convulsion, the
      question of vomit and the possibility of mistaking the pulse. But he said that
      there was still some confusion in his mind about the medical points.

26.   He then said that Inspector Sawers suggested he might have been mistaken
      about the ambulance, because the video footage did not show it at that time.
      But he, Mr Bruder, insisted that he was right about that.

27.   I took Mr Bruder through his second (3 May 1990) statement. He
      confirmed to me that everything in it was correct, save for where he said
that he may have been mistaken about the pulse. He said (transcript page
10, line 5):

        “What I am saying is: I went to the lad, felt a pulse and o f that I am
       not mistaken. I t ’s as simple as that. As I say, I hope you don’t think
       I ’m being forward but that was the case.

      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith: You are an experienced police officer
      and, I have no doubt, you have taken statements from people in the
      past and you know how these things are taken, and sometimes things
      are put to a witness: are you sure about that or may you have been
      mistaken about that because o f something else. What I am at getting
      is that in this statement you actually say: ‘But I may have been
      mistaken about that ’.

       M r Bruder: Yes, I may have been mistaken as to the region I took
       the pulse from, i.e. within an inch or two o f an A dam ’s apple is the
       carotid artery on the neck.

       Lord Justice Stuart-Smith: But you did not mean that you were
       mistaken about feeling a pulse?

       Mr Bruder: Most definitely not. ”

Mr Bruder said that he was quite satisfied that Kevin was dead when he gave
up trying to resuscitate him. He also made it perfectly plain to me that he
was not put under any pressure to change his statement. At page 15, line 15
of my interview with him he said:

       Lord Justice Stuart-Smith: So fa r as the alteration or so fa r as the
       amendment o f your statement is concerned, correct me if I am wrong,
       I do not get the impression that you are suggesting that you were
       subjected to any improper pressure to alter your statement?

       Mr Bruder: L et’s say I wouldn’t say I was bullied or cajoled
       certainly because I ’m not that type o f chap, I would have shown him
       the door had that been the case to be quite honest. The fact that he
       was an Inspector didn’t really mean anything to me, he was here to
       do a job, to take a statement.

And later:

       Lord Justice Stuart-Smith: I am concerned, you see, because there
       have been suggestions that you were subjected to improper pressure
       to change the statement.

       M r Bruder: I disagree that I was put under pressure to change the
       statement.
My conclusions about Mr Bruder’s evidence are these: I did not find his
explanation as to why he had said in his second statement that he might have
made a mistake about the pulse, entirely convincing. I doubt whether he
really meant that he might have been mistaken as to the precise region where
he took the pulse. However, I am satisfied that he now genuinely believes
that he did feel a slight pulse and so believed at the time of his first
statement. This was accepted by Dr Slater, who said that Kevin’s whole
body died when Mr Bruder was with him. (inquest transcript 4 May 1990,
page 13 B-D). It was also accepted by Dr Gumpert (page 17 A).

Having seen Mr Bruder I am quite satisfied that he was not subjected to any
improper pressure in making his second statement, which in every respect
save one he confirmed was correct. As he himself said, he is not the sort of
person to be bullied or cajoled.

For this reason I have not thought it necessary to take the matter further with
Mr Sawers or Dr Slater. Dr Slater wrote to me. He said he had spoken to
Mr Bruder with the full knowledge and approval of the Coroner. The object
was to enable him to assess the strength of his own evidence, in relation to
Mr Bruder’s, having regard to the difficulty in deciding when a person is
alive or dead, particularly the distinction between somatic and brain stem
death. Although it may be somewhat unusual for a pathologist to speak to a
witness about his evidence I see nothing improper about it, especially if, as
Mr Bruder says, he and Inspectors Sawers were having difficulty in
understanding the medical point involved.

There is nothing whatever wrong in the Coroner attempting to reconcile the
evidence of Dr Slater with that of PC Bruder and WPC Martin. Indeed he
would probably have been criticised if he had not. If the witness adheres to
his or her original statement, then the conflict cannot be resolved without the
decision maker hearing the evidence. But if the witness expresses doubt, or
gives an explanation as to why they may have been mistaken, or if he or she
says that they were confused at the time or may have been, any conflict is
likely to have been resolved. Mr Bruder told me he thought he should have
been called as a witness. This was entirely a matter for the Coroner. In the
light of Mr Bruder’s second signed statement, as the Divisional Court said,
no possible criticism can be made of the Coroner.

 It is unfortunate that Inspector Sawers appears to have overlooked the fact
 that there was a third ambulance on the pitch as Mr Bruder had said.
 Indeed this seems to have been overlooked by the Coroner and the legal
 representatives who were in Court, including Mr Fraser who was
 representing the families.

 There is in fact a problem reconciling the times involved. There is a timed
 photograph of Kevin Williams being carried across the pitch, through the
 centre circle, at 15.32. This is plainly before Mr Bruder’s attempt to
 resuscitate him, which took place further down the pitch, between the
 centre circle and the gymnasium. The timings given in PC Bruder’s
 statements suggest that it was not until about 15.43 that he saw the
 ambulance coming onto the pitch and attempts were made to stop it. Yet
 there is video evidence that Mr Edwards’ ambulance was on the pitch at
 15.36.

 I think there cannot be any doubt that the ambulance Mr Bruder is referring
 to is Mr Edwards’. But this confusion about timings perhaps goes some
 way to explain why the connection was not made during the Inquest. In
 any event no one has ever doubted that Mr Bruder attempted to resuscitate
 Kevin Williams. The only question was whether in truth he felt a pulse. It
 is quite wrong to suggest that PC Bruder’s evidence at the Inquest was
 discredited. It was not and I see no evidence of any attempt to discredit it
 - merely to clarify it.


Martin

 I interviewed Miss Martin on 18 November 1997. She made a statement
 dated 27 February 1995 in the presence of Miss Adlington, the
 Hillsborough Family Support Group’s Solicitor. In this she said that WPS
 Appleton came to see her on 17 March 1990 and tried to convince her that
 her original statement of 8 May 1989 was untrue. After exerting
 considerable pressure on her, WPS Appleton produced a dictionary which
 she referred to while she, WPS Appleton, compiled the second statement.
 Miss Martin was unable to read this because of her distress. She said she
 signed it because of the pressure exerted on her and because she wanted to
 put Hillsborough behind her.

 In her interview with me I asked Miss Martin about the pressure exerted on
 her. She said WPS Appleton had harassed her with telephone calls at her
 work and when she couldn’t get through, at her home. She visited her
 three or four times, sometimes accompanied by male officers - Miss Martin
 said she was literally brow beaten. When WPS Appleton came to her home
 on 17 March she accused her (Miss Martin) of lies and said she had never
 been at Hillsborough.

 Debra Martin told me WPS Appleton kept on calling her a complete liar
 and that she needed to take a second statement. She didn’t read this
 statement because she was in such a state she had to go and speak to her
 parents. Miss Martin said that although she had taken statements from
 witnesses in her work as a Special Constable, and knew there was a caution
 at the beginning of the statement, she had not signed this. Her signature
 there must be a forgery. She agreed that she had signed the statement at the
 bottom of each page and at the end.
I took her through the statement which she was said to have given to WPS
Appleton. Much of it she agreed she had said. But in every case where
the statement records that she was confused, did not have a clear
recollection and was like a “zombie”, she said that was untrue and that
WPS Appleton had made it up, though she accepted that she had used the
phrase that ‘she was acting on auto-pilot’.

Miss Martin insisted to me that she had a clear recollection of the events
on 15 April 1989. She told me that she had never read the statement she
gave to WPS Appleton. When I pointed out that this appeared to be
inconsistent with her statement of 22 February 1995 to Miss Adlington, she
accepted that she must have read it on that occasion but had no recollection
of it. She told me that she was very distressed and upset by the events of
the day of the disaster and had made a claim against the South Yorkshire
Police in respect of her post traumatic stress, but had been pressurised to
drop the claim.

Mrs Martin, Debra’s mother, also gave evidence to me. She too said that
WPS Appleton had been to the house three or four times previously. She
was not present during the interview on 17 March 1990 - but had been in
the next room with her husband. They could hear raised voices but not
what was said. She said there came a time when her daughter came and
spoke to them and said, “I can’t take any more, she is bullying me all the
time, she is calling me a liar” . Both she and her husband told Debra not to
sign anything, but in spite of this she went back into the lounge and signed
the statement. She told me that Debra had been deeply disturbed by
Hillsborough and still was. She agreed with me that her daughter was very
emotional.

In my judgement Debra Martin cannot be regarded as a reliable witness.
Her first statement (8 May 1989) is very confused and in conflict with all
the other evidence relating to events at Hillsborough. In it she said that at
about 2.50 p.m. she was on duty at the Penistone Road end (that is, the
other end of the ground from Leppings Lane where the Liverpool fans were
arriving). She said that there was a great deal of trouble at that end with
drunken Nottingham Forest fans so that mounted police were forced against
the wall. A large blue gate (which she told me was somewhere near the
entrance from Penistone Road by the gymnasium) was opened and the large
majority of the crowd pushed their way into the ground. She was carried
along by the crowd and pushed to the floor.

She found herself inside the ground at the bottom of the Spion Kop, with
the gates closed behind her. She managed to get out into the road again,
where she found herself surrounded by drunken fans screaming abuse. She
then made her way to the Leppings Lane end (she told me she had gone
round the North side of the ground and along Vere Road). Ambulances and
police cars were rushing to that end of the ground (the first ambulance
arrived at that end at 15.13). There was, she said, a vast crowd of about
4,000 fans trying to get into the ground. Next thing she got into the
ground, apparently through a blue gate and found herself on the pitch, she
could not remember how.

Miss Martin is the only witness who speaks of a crowd of disorderly
Nottingham Forest fans surging through a blue gate at the Penistone Road
end. Her mother told me that when Debra had given her an account of
what had happened, she understood that this had happened at the Liverpool
end. I found Miss Martin to be highly emotional; she was obviously deeply
upset by her experiences that day. She told me in her interview that she
had felt Kevin Williams’ pulse and felt a faint one. I can find no trace of
her ever having said that before.

In fact her two statements of 8 May 1989 and 17 March 1990 are not
contradictory. But the second one explains why the first may not be
reliable. I am satisfied that her statement that Kevin Williams was alive
and said ‘Mom’ to her in the gymnasium cannot be relied upon. It is
contrary to the evidence of PC Bruder and also contrary to the medical
evidence, both of Dr Slater and the pathologist Dr Iain West (who advised
Mrs Williams and said that it was unlikely that with the injuries to his
throat Kevin could have said ‘Mom’).

I am also confident that Miss Martin signed the caution at the beginning of
the second statement.

By contrast I found WPS Appleton a most impressive witness. She told me
that she had been asked by the Coroner to see Miss Martin because he
found her account of Kevin Williams dying in her arms difficult to
reconcile with the other evidence and he wished to make sure that she was
correct about it. She telephoned and made an appointment. She had only
been once to the house - she remembered this as she had difficulty finding
it. She said other officers may have been previously with a view to tracing
the movements of deceased supporters from photographic material; but she
had not done so. (In fact this is correct - there are two statements by Debra
Martin, dated 12 July and 5 September 1989, taken by police officers other
than WPS Appleton, dealing with identification of victims).

So far from being anxious to discredit Miss Martin, she would have liked to
be able to confirm what she said in relation to Kevin, because she realised
that it might be of some comfort to Mrs Williams. The interview was
perfectly amicable though like many people involved with Hillsborough
Miss Martin was upset, particularly when talking about Kevin. WPS
Appleton said she explained the problem about the inconsistency with other
evidence in relation to Kevin. She had not appreciated that the earlier
account of the entry of a crowd at Penistone Road was inconsistent with all
the other evidence, and she did not ask about it. She did not call Miss
Martin a liar and did not bully or browbeat her. Miss Martin dictated the
       fresh statement and she, WPS Appleton, took it down. Miss Martin signed
       the caution at the head of the statement and initialled two corrections in it.

50.    WPS Appleton told me that she was shocked when she heard for the first
       time the allegations made by Miss Martin in the ‘Cook Report’ television
       programme in 1994. I accept the evidence of WPS Appleton and prefer her
       account to that of Miss Martin, or that of Mrs Martin to the extent that she
       supports her daughter.

51.    I deal further with the case of Kevin Williams in Appendix 9 .


Paul Taylor

52.   The third witness who I was told had been pressurised into changing his
       evidence is Paul Taylor. Mr Taylor, a Liverpool supporter, was near the
       centre of the crush in pen 3 of the Leppings Lane terrace. Although badly
       affected by the crush himself he helped or tried to help a number of other
       people who were caught in the pen.

53.   The allegation is that there was an attempt to prevent Mr Taylor from adding
       to his original statement relevant matters concerning the death of Victoria
       Hicks.

54.   I have interviewed Mr Taylor. He made three statements in writing. The
       first is undated, which he told me was made on 4 May 1989 because he had
      been asked by the survivors’ group to record his recollections. The second
       was to West Midlands Police dated 8 May 1989, and the third is dated 23
       September 1997. He also gave oral evidence at the Inquest.

55.   In his first statement (4 May 1989) he described dealing with a girl in pen 3.
      He said

               “I then spotted a girl with her legs trapped and lying over
               backwards so I pulled her out and carried her to one side. I put her
               down and went to give her the kiss o f life and then smelt the odour
               coming from her mouth. I realised then she was dead but I still did
               it out o f instinct. I then pulled her arm out o f her cardigan and
               pulled it over her face and left her, and went to help anyone else I
               could”.

56.   His next statement, of 8 May 1989, is substantially the same, but also
      includes a description of the girl and her clothing. It appears that Mr and
      Mrs Hicks were told of this description and thought it was their daughter
      Victoria. As a result, Mr Taylor told me that he had a telephone call from
      Mr and Mrs Hicks four to six weeks after the disaster, when he described
      how he had found their daughter and what he had done. In his statement of
      23 September 1997 he said
         “I told Mr and Mrs Hicks that when I lay the young boy next to
         Victoria a young police officer wearing gloves came along. He felt
        fo r a pulse in both Victoria and the boy. He told me to leave both
         bodies as they were dead ... Mr and Mrs Hicks were keen that I
         added this information to my earlier statement. I therefore received
         a visit at home from DC McCombie, the West Midlands Police
         Officer assigned to the Hicks ’ case. I explained what I wanted to
         add to my earlier statement. He told me that unless I knew the name
         and number o f the police officer that I would be committing perjury
         if I made another statement. He told me I could go to ja il fo r
         committing perjury. At the time my wife had ju st had a baby. I was
        frightened by what DC McCombie was saying to me and agreed that
        I would not make another statement. I did not want to put my family
         at risk. I did not refer to any o f this when I gave evidence at the
        Inquest. ”

In fact when he gave evidence at the Inquest he did refer to the incident; but
he did not mention that the person who said Victoria was dead was a
policeman or was wearing gloves. He said (transcript, day 32, p74E):

        A.      “I saw she had bits o f rust in her mouth when I slightly
        opened her mouth and I realised then it was from the pole o ff the
        barrier when it had been thrown over. I had seen all the stuff
         earlier and it must have gone on her and it was around her eyes and
         speckled on her face, and I ju st took a few bits o ff her lips and then
        just tried to blow into her mouth, and then someone said, ‘Leave
         her, she’s dead’. ”

        Q.      “You thought she was dead. She looked dead to you, did she
        not, or did she ? ”.

        A.   “Her lips were rolled back and her eyes were really wide
        open

In cross examination, Mr Fraser who was acting for the Hicks family,
brought out that the girl Mr Taylor was referring to was Victoria Hicks.
But no further question was asked as to who the ‘someone’ was, or how they
knew she was dead. This is hardly surprising. In a letter, dated 13
November 1990, a copy of which was sent to the Coroner, Mr Hicks
records the meeting between himself, his wife and Mr Taylor, and what Mr
Taylor had told him. So far as is material this is as follows:

        ‘He went on to describe how Victoria was pinned by her legs and
        was bent over backwards on the top o f the pile o f bodies and how
        she was removed in a semi-conscious state. He went on to say how
        she was laid on her back on the terraces; he/others removed her
        blue cardigan when he had been told she was beyond help. He
        claimed he did not know how to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, he
        was put o ff by the smell o f vomit from her mouth and rust from the
        barrier on her face and the fact “she was only a young school kid ”.
        He described how he sat and cuddled her fo r some minutes before
        she was passed on to the pitch - this six minutes could have been
        vital to Victoria’s survival had she received proper attention at that
        time. ’

It is noticeable that in this account there is no reference to a policeman. The
account is also inconsistent with Mr Taylor’s first written statement and
recollections where he says that he thought Victoria was dead, not semi­
conscious, and there is no reference to cuddling her.

In his evidence to me, (transcript page 7, lines 10-26), Mr Taylor said that
Detective Sergeant McCombie

         “asked me if I could describe the police officer, and I said, like, I
        knew he was a young police officer and not an old man. He said,
         “well, did you recognise his badge number or anything like that?” I
        said, “well, I can’t recollect because everything was hectic at the
        time ”. It was just a case o f trying to get on with what you were
        trying to do. He said then, “have you ever heard o f the word
         ‘p erjury ’ I said, “Well, I think so. I don’t really understand what
        it means”. He explained if you say something and put it down in the
        statements and then it ’s found not to be true you can actually go to
        prison fo r committing perjury. He said, “I ’d have a think about
        this ” and then he went, and I spoke to my wife after he went because
        he said on the lines that you ’re a young family. Our Michael was
        only about 12 weeks old at the time, and he was emphasising about
        perjury and you could actually go to prison. ”

Mr Taylor did not mention that the police officer was wearing gloves when
he took the pulse until he was specifically asked this. I am not so much
concerned with whether Mr Taylor’s recollection about the policeman
wearing gloves is correct, but with whether he was actually threatened in the
way he describes.

I interviewed Detective Sergeant McCombie on 2 December 1997 and he
sent me a further written statement, dated 17 December 1997, elaborating
certain matters. He told me that he had been contacted by the Liverpool
Social Services. Mr Taylor had been in touch with the Hicks family and it
was established that one of the people he had dealt with was Victoria Hicks.
Mr Taylor had told them that while he was giving Victoria Hicks the kiss of
life a policeman said, “Leave her alone, she’s gone”, without feeling her
pulse. This had caused upset to Mr and Mrs Hicks.

DS McCombie went to see Paul Taylor on 31 May 1989. He said that Mr
Taylor was confused, upset and emotional, and said he’d been suffering
from the stress syndrome. He went through Mr Taylor’s original statement
with him and what he had apparently told Mr and Mrs Hicks. He said that
Mr Taylor retracted what he had said to the Hicks family about the
policeman. DS McCombie said that he would try and check his involvement
through the photographic evidence. To this end he filed an ‘Action’ dated 1
June 1989, asking if there was any identification of Mr Taylor in the crowd,
for his involvement to be assessed and whether his continuity to Victoria
Hicks could be established. The ‘Action’ recorded the above account of
what Mr Taylor was supposed to have told Mr and Mrs Hicks, that he had
retracted it and was suffering from the stress syndrome.

West Midlands Police pursued the matter. They found two photographs
which showed Mr Taylor in pen 3, but these did not show him in any
involvement with Victoria Hicks. When I spoke to him DS McCombie
could not recall whether he had visited Mr Taylor again or spoken to him on
the telephone to tell him the result of the further enquiries.

Mr McCombie told me that at no time did he threaten Mr Taylor with any
question of perjury. He did not bully or intimidate him. He was very well
aware of the trauma Mr Taylor had been through. He was anxious that
things should not be said which might upset the Hicks family unless they
were correct. But it did not matter to him whether a South Yorkshire
policeman behaved as Mr Taylor had told Mr Hicks.

After more than eight years it is impossible to be sure precisely what
happened. On balance of probability I would conclude as follows. Mr
Taylor was undoubtedly very upset and emotionally disturbed following
Hillsborough. This is confirmed in his original recollections of the
treatment he received. DS McCombie was anxious that things which might
upset Mr and Mrs Hicks should not be put forward unless it was reasonably
certain that they were correct. To this end I have no doubt that he went
through Mr Taylor’s original statements, and pointed out that there was no
reference to a policeman saying Victoria was dead without taking her pulse,
and pressed him as to whether he was sure of this. He also said that he
would have a check made to see if any photographic evidence could link him
with Victoria. I am satisfied that Mr Taylor said he was not sure, and DS
McCombie took this as a retraction. I am certainly not satisfied that DS
McCombie in any way bullied or intimidated Mr Taylor or threatened him
with a charge of perjury if he insisted on adding to his statement anything
about the matter.

I think the most likely explanation of Mr Taylor’s belief that there was a
reference to perjury is that made by DS McCombie in his statement to me of
17 December 1997. This is that when the police took from Mr Taylor his
statement of 8 May 1989, they may have explained the formal caution at the
top of the statement to him in terms of a prosecution for perjury if the
witness making the statement wilfully says in it which he believes to be false
or does not believe to be true. Alternatively, in going through this statement
with DS McCombie, Mr Taylor may have asked what the caution meant,
and DS McCombie explained it to him in that way.

It should be noted that Mr Taylor’s account of his conversation with the
policeman in pen 3 has varied over the years. In his original very full
recollections and statement, there is no mention of it. His account, as
recorded by Mr Hicks in his letter of 13 November 1990, also makes no
mention of a policeman. The next account, at least as recorded near the
time by DS McCombie, is that the policeman said, “She’s gone”, without
taking Victoria’s pulse. This account however appears to be hearsay on
hearsay. At the inquest he said, ‘Someone said’, “Leave her, she’s dead”
with no mention of a policeman or of a pulse being taken.

In his statement of 23 September 1997 Mr Taylor said the policeman took
Victoria’s pulse. It is not clear whether he means that the policeman was
wearing gloves at that time. In his evidence to me he did not initially
mention him wearing gloves when he took the pulse, but in answer to a
direct question at the end of his interview said that he was.

It is quite plain that despite the situation which he himself was in Mr Taylor
did his best to help other spectators who were trapped and in some cases
dying in pen 3. I intend no criticism of him - very much the reverse. But
in the light of the inconsistent statements he has made over the years I
c annot regard his evidence as reliable. I can see no reason why I should not
accept DS McCombie’s account, supported as it is by the contemporary
documents. No complaint has, so far as I am aware, ever been officially
made about DS McCombie’s conduct to the Police Complaints Authority and
the first time it appears to have been raised is very recently in 1997. In my
view the evidence is wholly insufficient to justify any action being taken
against this officer.

Neither WPS Appleton nor DS McCombie had any reason or motive to try
to bring pressure to bear on Miss Martin or Mr Taylor. The suggestion that
they did so as part of a biased and incomplete investigation and ‘fo r the
purpose o f keeping to a minimum the scrutiny o f South Yorkshire Police’s
reaction to the disaster’ (see para 4 above) is clearly untenable.

Miss Martin’s evidence about the last moments of Kevin Williams has
nothing to do with South Yorkshire Police. West Midlands Police gathered
and presented to Lord Taylor and the Coroner extensive evidence critical of
South Yorkshire Police. Even if DS McCombie had done what is alleged,
which he did not, it is difficult to see how omitting to mention questionable
conduct (taking a pulse with gloves on) by one police officer in the terrible
circumstances of the epicentre of the disaster could amount to an attempt by
its investigators to minimise the faults in the South Yorkshire Police reaction
to it. Nor is there any indication here of an incomplete investigation. On
the contrary, when the point about the policeman saying Victoria Hicks was
dead was raised DS McCombie very properly looked into it.
Collection of evidence from South Yorkshire Police Officers


73.   In his written submissions to me Professor Scraton stated that there was a
      ‘range of claims that witnesses were subjected to pressure in giving their
      statements’. When he came to make oral submissions to me I asked him to
      tell me what these claims were. In addition to the three cases which I have
      dealt with in the first part of this chapter he invited me to consider the
      evidence of Mr David Frost, whom he brought to see me.


David Frost

74.   Mr Frost was a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police on duty at
      Hillsborough. He was in Serial 21, which was at the Penistone Road End.
      He assisted in arresting a drunken fan and taking him to the charge room.
      He returned to the Penistone Road End. At 2.55 his serial was called inside
      the ground and sent to the Leppings Lane Terraces where he assisted with
      the rescue operation. Like other officers Mr Frost was asked to write out
      his recollections. He did so in his own handwriting and this appears to have
      been typed up into the form of a statement dated 9 May 1989. It was
      submitted to the South Yorkshire Police solicitors, as a result of which a
      number of deletions and some alterations were made. (Appendix 6 is the
      amended version, showing the alterations).

75.   I can see nothing to take exception to in these amendments save possibly in
      three instances. The reference in the third page to the radio being garbled
      and frantic might be considered both factual and material, though other
      officers had also spoken of the difficulties with the radio. On the fifth page
      the word ‘bottleneck’ possibly amplified the sentence that follows. A
      reference on this page to the late arrival of certain officers to organise the
      rescue might be regarded as factual, though the language is not appropriate.
      But none of the deletions or alterations in my view alter the substance of the
      statement.

76.    Mr Frost was asked to sign the amended statement. He told me he refused
       to do so. He said that other officers also refused to sign their amended
       statements, though he was unable to name any. He said he would let me
       know their names, but he has not done so.      He also told me that others
       were ‘asked/impelled to sign things that they didn’t want to that had been
       changed’. I asked him if he had witnessed any one being impelled to sign.
       He said that he personally had not, but he knew officers who had. Again I
       have not been supplied with their names. He accepted that his original
       statement was not in a suitable form to be a witness statement. He said that
       he himself was not put under any pressure to sign, he was left alone. He
       told me:

                ‘This was an attempt by senior management to sanitise and protect
               themselves; and any honour that the South Yorkshire Police, which I
               thought at the time was considerable, disappeared fo r me.

               That is why I left the force. I was medically pensioned off. I
               couldn’t wear a uniform after this sort o f thing took place ’
               (transcript page 14, lines 13-19).

77.    He suggested to me that the reason why officers were asked to submit
       statements on plain paper as opposed to writing up their notebooks or
       making statements on Criminal Justice Act forms was so that they could be
       doctored.

78.     On the strength of this evidence and that which I have dealt with in part 1 of
       this Chapter, Professor Scraton submitted to me that officers’ statements had
       been taken in a manner which was

               “highly irregular and leaves itself open to accusations o f widespread
              and institutional malpractice; it does smack o f ‘getting our stories
              right before they go to the investigation fo rc e’ and pressure, no
              pressure, but people are expected to make changes in their statements
              to their recollections ”.


Collection o f police evidence

79.    I have investigated the facts surrounding the obtaining of statements from
        South Yorkshire Police officers. At a meeting of senior officers including
       the Chief Constable at South Yorkshire Police HQ on the 17 April 1989 it
        was decided that the officers principally involved should set down their
        recollections of events in writing. On the 25 April Assistant Chief
        Constable Mervyn Jones, who was in charge of the Inquiry on behalf of
        West Midlands Police and the Taylor Inquiry was told that the South
        Yorkshire Police were obtaining ‘self-serving’ (ie self-written) statements by
        police officers down to Inspector level, and also from all officers at
        Leppings Lane End of the ground.

80.    At a meeting on the morning of 26 April 1989 Chief Superintendent Wain
       told a group of South Yorkshire Police officers who were concerned with the
        inquiry that it was necessary to obtain self-written statements from the
        relevant officers. These would be on plain paper and not taken under
        Criminal Justice Act rules. It was said that “our job is merely to collate
        what evidence South Yorkshire Police officers can provide to their Chief
        Constable in order that we can present a suitable case, on behalf o f the
       force, to subsequent inquiries ”, An aide memoire produced by Chief
      Superintendent Wain setting out the matters to be dealt with appears to have
      been distributed. These included the time of coming on duty, to whom the
      officer was responsible, and where they were deployed and what they said
      and did. It appears to call for a factual account.

81.   At 2pm that day there was a conference between senior South Yorkshire
      Police, the solicitors acting for the South Yorkshire Police, Messrs
      Hammond Suddards, and leading and junior counsel. A note of the meeting
      made by the solicitors records that in the course of it Mr Woodward QC
      advised that the operation undertaken by South Yorkshire Police should be
      regarded as an evidence gathering operation for the information of the legal
      advisers. He said that any statements taken for this purpose would be
      privileged, and that writs were expected. He suggested that some officers
      might “want to put all their thoughts and expressions of that day down on
      paper, as a sort of catharsis”. The process was a confidential one and the
      legal advisers would choose what they wanted to leave in or leave out.

82.   In a letter dated 7 May 1989 ACC Jones told the Chief Constable of South
       Yorkshire that he had been asked by Counsel for Lord Taylor’s inquiry to
       request statements from a selected number of officers of their recollections
       of the day. This was in addition to the statements of senior officers which
       had already been sought. In a telephone conversation referred to in an
       attendance note dated the 9 May this request was discussed between Mr
       Metcalf, a partner of Hammond Suddards and Chief Superintendent Denton
       of the South Yorkshire Police. Statements from some 120 officers were
       being sought by the West Midlands Police; of these about 100 had already
       written their accounts. It was agreed that many of these might be suitable to
       be handed over as they were, but some might include comment and
       speculation and might have to be redone. The solicitors were to consider
       them. Mr Denton sent a number of statements under cover of a letter of the
       same date. He said “no doubt you will advise me on the propriety of
       supplying these documents to the West Midlands Police.”

83.   Over the next 5 weeks in excess of 400 statements written by South
      Yorkshire officers were submitted to the solicitors. Of these, 253 attracted
      no comment at all. In 60 cases the comment was confined to pointing out
      some minor error or ambiguity.

84.   As the work of supplying material to the West Midlands inquiry continued,
      South Yorkshire Police themselves suggested alterations to some officers’
      statements, adopting the same basis for amendments as the solicitors had
      recommended to statements that had been sent to them previously.


Police statements amended pursuant to recommendations by solicitors

85.   At that time no official guidance appears to have been given by the Law
      Society or the Bar Council as to the preparation of witness statements to be
disclosed to other parties. Guidance has subsequently been given by the Bar
Council in 1997. In his submission to me Mr Metcalf summarised what he
considered were the appropriate principles to be applied. I accept these,
though I have made some alteration to para. 4 which I have underlined:

       (1)    The statement must accurately reflect a witness’s evidence, but
              exclude inadmissible hearsay, comment and argument.

       (2)    It should be succinct, exclude irrelevant material and
               unnecessary elaboration, and should not serve as a
               commentary on documents.

       (3)    It should contain all witness’s evidence in chief; it should not
               be edited so that it no longer fairly reflects the answers which
               the witness would be expected to give in response to viva voce
               examination in chief.

       (4)    Great care should he exercised in the exclusion o f material that
              is unhelpful to the parties case. No material should be
              excluded which might render a statement anything other than
              the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, e.g. by
              leaving in fa ct A while excluding fa ct B in such a way as to
              render untrue or misleading anything which remains in the
              statement. The overriding duty is to assist the Court or
              Tribunal in the administration o f justice.

       (5)    The exclusion o f unfavourable material, other than in such
              manner as to amount to a failure to comply with guideline 4, is
              a matter o f judgement.

       (6)    It is permitted and appropriate to draw a witness ’ attention
              that what he proposes to say appears in conflict with other
              evidence, or may be found by a court difficult to accept, but i f
              the witness maintains the evidence, then the guidelines 1-5
              above apply.

I have examined approximately 100 amended statements where on the face
of the comments by the solicitors something of substance might have been
referred to. In 74 instances the amendment is of no consequence. Of these,
there are some cases in which the solicitor’s recommendation was not
adopted and the suggested amendments were not made. In others, adverse
comment on fans’ behaviour, intemperate language, personal feelings or
hearsay have been removed or the statement has been made clearer or
ambiguities or inconsistencies put right.

In the remaining 26 cases comment and opinion are excluded. These are
generally criticisms of the police operation and in the main fall under three
heads: complaints about lack of radios, lack of information on the radio and
difficulty of communication by radio due to interference; apparent shortage
of police on foot at Leppings Lane; and lack of organisation by senior
officers in the rescue operation. Not infrequently the factual matters
underlying the criticism are apparent from the rest of the statement. In a
factual statement these comments and opinions would not normally occur
and the solicitors cannot be criticised for recommending their removal.

Of the 26 amended statements which I mentioned in the last paragraph there
is a total of ten on which I should make specific comment, and I do that in
Appendix 7. In five of these cases - Creaser, Crawford, Eustis, Powell and
Huckstepp - factual matters were excluded which arguably should not have
been. (The amendments which they appear to have suggested to PC
Huckstepp’s statement were not in fact made, apparently due to administrative
error - see Appendix 7).

In four others - Brookes, Ramsden, Walpole and White - although what is
excluded is comment, factual matters are implicit in the comment and it might
have been better to elucidate these rather than simply exclude the comment. I
also comment in Appendix 7 on the alterations to a statement by PC Groome
which, other than the statement by PC Frost, has more changes made to it than
any other I have examined.

The solicitors were under severe time constraints in giving their advice since
the statements were urgently required for Lord Taylor’s Inquiry. In no case
does what is excluded render the rest of the statement misleading. In those
cases where factual matter has been excluded I accept that the solicitors had to
exercise judgement as to whether material unhelpful to the police case should
be excluded. I have indicated in Appendix 7 that at least in some cases it
would have been better if it had not been. But I would categorise this at worst
as an error of judgement. I certainly do not think the solicitors were guilty of
anything that could be regarded as unprofessional conduct.

A number of officers had expressed concern over the alterations to Mr
Denton and those officers under him who were responsible for obtaining
amended statements.. With the approval of the solicitors an explanation was
circulated on about 23 May 1989. I exhibit a copy at Appendix 8, p i.
The recipients are identified in the document and I have no doubt that the
explanation was passed on to those who had expressed concern.

It appears that in some cases, because of the short timescale before the Lord
Taylor’s Inquiry got underway (it started on 15 May 1989), some
statements were sent to the inquiry team and circulated by them to
representatives of the parties before they had been vetted by the solicitors.
As a result one police officer was cross-examined at the Inquiry (day 16) on
the basis of a criticism contained in his original statement but later excluded.
This was a matter of concern to ACC Jones, because it was contrary to an
arrangement which he had made with the Chief Constable of South
       Yorkshire. The matter was taken up with the Treasury Solicitor, who
       replied on the 7 June. A copy of this reply is in Appendix 8, p2.

93.    This letter shows that Counsel to the Inquiry and the Treasury Solicitor were
       well aware that self-written statements were being vetted by Hammond
       Suddards. Mr Justice Collins, who was Leading Counsel to the Inquiry,
       and Mr Whitehurst, Assistant Treasury Solicitor and part of the Inquiry
       Team have both confirmed to me that that was the case. So also has Chief
       Superintendent Foster who was in charge of the investigation by the West
       Midlands Police.


Privilege

94.    I do not think statements which came into existence prior to 26 April 1989
        were subject to legal professional privilege. There is no evidence that they
        were obtained so that the legal advisers to the Chief Constable could advise,
        as opposed to the officers being asked to record their recollections while
        matters were fresh in their minds. Those that came into existence following
        the conference with Counsel may well have been privileged, though there
        may have been difficult questions relating to the dominant purpose for which
        the statement was obtained.

95.    In the event I do not think the point is of any consequence since the question
        of legal professional privilege only relates to the non-production of
        documents in litigation. Nor do I think there was anything improper about
        asking officers to record their recollections in their own words on ordinary
        paper, rather than in their notebooks. The occasion was wholly exceptional
        and a notebook is not a convenient form in which to write what, in many
        cases, was likely to be a very long statement.


Timescale

96.    While it might have been preferable for statements to be taken in the usual
       Criminal Justice Act form, I doubt whether this was practicable having
       regard to the time constraints. Lord Taylor’s Inquiry was working to a very
       tight timescale in order to allow the Home Secretary to have a report by the
       beginning of the next football season in August.

97.    It would probably have been difficult for South Yorkshire Police to take
       these statements from their colleagues in the time available. It is quite clear
       to me that the West Midlands Police could not possibly have taken such
       statements in time for them to be available for consideration by the Inquiry
       team. The Inquiry team, including Lord Taylor, were clearly well aware
       that original self-written statements were being vetted by the solicitors and in
       some cases altered. I have no doubt that they either knew or suspected that
       criticisms of the police operation or conduct of senior police officers were
       being excluded on the basis that such criticisms were comment or opinion.

98.    These alterations were made on the advice of the solicitors, though in many
       cases they simply advised that the passage in question be reviewed. This
       process of submitting statements to solicitors before they were sent to the
       Inquiry did not materially differ from that adopted by the Club and the
       Ambulance Service. In their cases the respective solicitors took the
       statements and forwarded them to the Inquiry team.


Statements which were amended without reference to the solicitors

99.    There were also a large number of statements which South Yorkshire Police
       obtained from their officers which they did not send to their solicitors for
       comment. The reason for this seems to have been that they were not
       available until the latter part of May 1989. The force examined these
       statements but suggested no alteration to most of them.

100.   I have examined 51 of these statements where some alteration was made. In
       many of these the alteration is quite trivial and of no consequence whatever.
       In others, comments have been excluded, for the most part of the same kind
       as those I have referred to in paragraph 87, that is to say criticism of the
       shortage of radios and information, and of the lack of organisation of the
       rescue. In my opinion these comments were properly excluded and I have
       not found any instance in which the factual content of the statement has been
       altered so as to render it misleading.


Cover-up ?

101.   Having regard to Mr Duckenfield’s disgraceful lie about Gate C being
       forced open by fans and the fact that some shocking stories about the
       behaviour of fans, said to have emanated from some police officers, were
       reported in the press (see Lord Taylor’s Interim Report, para 257), I have
       considered this matter critically because of the allegation of a cover-up. I
       have no doubt that in the days following Hillsborough the South Yorkshire
       police perceived themselves to be on the defensive. This was also the
       perception of their legal advisers. There was an understandable desire not to
       give anything away.

102.   For the most part the suggestions for amendments by the solicitors are not
       open to criticism. In a few cases however I think it would have been
       preferable if the deletion had not been made. The amendments which South
       Yorkshire Police suggested themselves, without reference to the solicitors,
       are in my view unexceptionable. What was happening was well known to
       Lord Taylor’s the Inquiry team, though not the detail of the amendments,
       except in those cases where the unamended version was forwarded due to
       pressure of time.

103.   I have made enquiries of a number of the officers whose statements I refer to
       in Appendix 7 to see if they were subjected to improper pressure as Mr
       Frost suggested. One, PC Groome, told me that he had been told that unless
       the alterations were made his evidence would not be forwarded to the
       Inquiry, and so, reluctantly, he agreed. He might perhaps have sent his
       unamended version in to the Inquiry of his own accord if he had really
       wanted to, but in any event the alterations to his statement - though
       extensive - are in my view unexceptionable (see Appendix 7). Otherwise
       any reluctance the officers may have had seems to have been allayed by the
       explanation to which I referred earlier (see Appendix 8).       I have not come
       across any statement that is not signed by the officer, and that includes Mr
       Frost’s.

104.   In fact I think the whole effort may have been counter productive. Had
       more attention been paid to the comments and opinions of the junior ranks,
       the Force might have avoided the stinging rebuke which they received from
       Lord Taylor. At para 285 of his Interim Report he said:

                ‘It is a matter o f regret that at the hearing, and in their submissions,
               the South Yorkshire Police were not prepared to concede they were in
               any respect at fault in what occurred. Mr Duckenfield, under
              pressure o f cross-examination, apologised fo r blaming the Liverpool
              fans fo r causing the deaths. But, that apart, the police case was to
               blame the fans fo r being late and drunk, and to blame the Club fo r
              failing to monitor the pens. It was argued that the fatal crush was
               not caused by the influx through gate C but was due to barrier 124a
               being defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives cause fo r anxiety
               as to whether lessons have been learnt. It would have been more
               seemly and encouraging fo r the future if responsibility had been
              faced. ’

105.   I am quite satisfied that Lord Taylor’s Inquiry Team were in no way
       inhibited or impeded by the exclusion of material from the original
       statements. They were well aware of the criticisms that were being raised
       by junior officers. All the questions on which comments were made and
       excluded were matters which Lord Taylor investigated and made findings -
       on the basis of the facts - which were adverse to the police. This applies to
       all the cases I have commented on in Appendix 7. Mr Justice Collins has
       confirmed to me that this was so.

106.   I have not found anything in the material excluded in this way that might
       have influenced the jury at the Inquests to bring in a different verdict. The
       legal representatives of the families at the Inquest were well aware of Lord
       Taylor’s conclusions on the points at issue. Equally I am quite satisfied that
       the exclusion of these comments could not possibly have affected the
%




           Director of Public Prosecutions. As I have already stated, Counsel advising
           the Director proceeded on the basis that the evidence before them supported
           Lord Taylor’s findings.

    107.   In my opinion the allegation made by Professor Scraton of irregularity and
           malpractice (paragraph 78 above) is not substantiated.
CHAPTER 5


Other matters of concern to the victims’ families


1.    As an important part of my scrutiny I visited Liverpool in early October to
      meet the families of victims of the disaster and listen to the matters which
      concerned them. I held an open session to which I invited all the families of
      those who died, and I was pleased that many were able to attend. I then held
      sixteen private meetings with families who had asked for them. I had two
      other meetings with family members later, at the scrutiny office in London.

2.    Many of the relatives of victims whom I saw during these meetings raised
      questions to do with the video and medical evidence about the disaster, which
      I have discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 of this report. But both in my
      discussions with them and in writing victims’ families have made other
      allegations as well. To summarise them briefly, they are

              there were inconsistencies between the way in which the police
              summarised the facts about each individual death at the ‘mini-
              inquests’ and evidence about what actually happened to that person;

              the Coroner was biased;

              Liverpool supporters were treated unfavourably and in a hostile
              manner when they gave evidence at the inquest;

              South Yorkshire Police have failed to give families documents to
              which they are entitled;

               victims were confirmed as being dead on the basis of cursory
               examination;

               the West Midlands Police investigation team was biased in favour of
               South Yorkshire Police;

               South Yorkshire Police have never apologised for the disaster.

3.     I consider these points in this Chapter.


Inconsistencies in the evidence about individual deaths

4.     One of the most common complaints which families had was that they had
       not been able to find out precisely when and where their relations died, in
       some cases because the evidence was very sparse and in others because it
was said that the evidence was conflicting, or did not support the summary
given about their relative at the mini-inquest. I fully understand the families’
anxiety to know all the facts as far as possible. But it is only right to point
out that the West Midlands Police were faced with a massive task in
collecting the evidence, seeking to identify individual deceased from
photographic evidence, and reconciling, in so far as it was possible, the
inevitable conflicts of evidence.

Inspector Layton of the West Midlands Police described how they had set
about this task on the first day of the mini-inquest (18th April 1990,
transcript pages 37-47). He said

         “Specifically with regard to the deceased, we have attempted to
        identify each person’s position at the ground, where possible, before
       and after their deaths. The search fo r such information has been
        exhaustive, but the degree o f success in achieving an accurate picture
       fo r each individual does vary greatly. In some cases the information
        obtained has been very limited and in some instances it has not been
       possible to confirm with any degree o f certainty some o f the
        identifications made. ”

M r Layton then described the photographic source material. There were 71
hours of video, from police, club and BBC. There were about 600 colour
still photographs taken by the police for normal intelligence gathering
purposes and a further 1800 photographs from Press, freelance agencies and
the public. Much of the photographic material is timed (i.e. the time at
which it was taken, down to the minute or the second, appears on the print).

West Midlands Police investigators showed this material to over 300 South
Yorkshire Police Officers, 10 officers from other forces, 21 members of the
South Yorkshire Fire Service, 19 members of SYMAS, and 169 spectators
and other civilian witnesses who said that they had had some involvement
with people who had died.

Initially, the police had been reluctant to involve the families in the
identification process, because of the distressing nature of the photographic
material. However, following consultation with the Social Services and the
families themselves the policy was changed. Eighty families wished to see
the evidence and take part in the identification, and were able to do so.

Altogether West Midlands Police interviewed over 600 people, with each
interview lasting a minimum of 2 hours.

The possible misidentification of pictures and other evidence about those
who died was a problem. Inspector Layton told the Inquest:

        “I should point out that on a small number o f occasions it has
        subsequently transpired that both police and civilian witnesses have
       made mistaken identifications. Although I would again stress they
       were made at the time with the genuine belief that they were correct. ”

West Midlands Police created a file, known as a ‘body file’, for each of the
people who died. These files contain the following material:

       i)      a single-page summary report, prepared by the West Midlands
       Police, setting out the name of the person, where he or she died, and
       other formal details;

       ii)    an analysis or summary of the witnesses, tracing the
       movements of the deceased from the time they left home on the day
       of the match right up to the autopsy, also containing details of visual
       evidence and the blood ethanol analysis;

       iii)   statements of witnesses, referred to in the analysis. In many
       cases these statements dealt with other matters and contain only a
       short passage about the person who is the subject of the file;

       iv)    visual evidence (photographs and video stills) taken from the
       sources I have mentioned, together with plans identifying so far as
       possible where the deceased was last seen alive, and where he or she
       was found apparently dead, together with supporting photographs;
       and

       v)    A continuity chart, showing what happened to the individual
       hour by hour during the day.

A police officer presented a summary of the evidence, based on this
material, at the mini-inquest on each of the victims. The summaries would
often include excerpts from the witnesses statements. The summaries were
prepared in advance and sent to the solicitors for the families so that they
could be checked for errors and corrected if need be, though the supporting
material was not then made available.

The Coroner made it clear that if from time to time it became apparent that
corrections had to be made, they would be made at a later stage. This
happened in some instances.

Before the main Inquest began the Coroner told the lawyers for the families
that he would consider questions they had about the facts which had come
out at the mini-inquests sympathetically, so that the Inquest dealt properly
with inaccuracies or omissions in the evidence about what had happened to
individuals. He invited the solicitors for the Hillsborough Steering Group,
who represented the families, to submit the questions they wished to raise
(transcript of business meeting, 30 October 1990, p. 13).
15.   There followed considerable correspondence between the solicitors and the
      Coroner, lasting from November 1990 until the main inquest began in
      March 1991. Some of the questions the families’ lawyers had about the
      precise facts of particular deaths were dealt with in correspondence or not
      persisted in. In other cases the Coroner agreed to call witnesses requested
      by the families to deal further with the questions where and when their
      relatives had died. Paul Taylor - whom I mentioned in the last Chapter - is
      an example of such a witness. He gave evidence about Victoria Hicks.

16.   In other cases it would seem the Coroner considered that the problem could
       be taken no further. It seems to me that he did his best to resolve the
       queries that were being put to him.

17.   The Divisional Court upheld the Coroner’s decision to conduct the mini­
      inquests in the way he did. Equally in my opinion, even if there were
       inconsistencies in the evidence and discrepancies between the summary and
      the supporting evidence, that cannot affect the Coroner’s decision about the
      3.15 cut-off time or the verdicts of accidental deaths.

18.   I did my best to point this out to those families who raised these points when
      I met them. But I appreciated that this was a matter of great concern to
      them and said I would do my best to resolve the inconsistencies or
      discrepancies which they pointed out to me (although I very much doubt
      whether this was within my terms of reference).

19.   Some of the relatives I spoke to did tell me the nature of the inconsistency or
      discrepancy which concerned them, for example in the cases of Kevin
      Williams and Philip Hammond. Other people told me that they could not
      specify the problem at that stage, either because they had not received copies
      of the body file from the police or had not had it long enough to deal with
      the points. I urged those families who had not yet sought copies of the body
      files to do so without delay.

20.   I am afraid that I have not been able to resolve relatives’ concerns about
      conflicts of evidence in every case. It seems to me that that is inevitable
      given the nature of the problem. What is clear, however, is that no
      further inquiry involving examination of the witnesses could be of any help.
      No one is likely now to have a recollection beyond what was written in their
      statements at the time and if they did, it would be likely to be suspect after
      eight and a half years.

21.    However I deal as best I can with individual cases in Appendix 9.


Bias and conflict of interest on the part of the Coroner

22.    The Divisional Court was specifically asked to consider whether the Coroner
       was biased or had a conflict of interest. It found that he did not and I have
       seen no reason to disagree with that assessment. A criticism that the
       Coroner visited the ground with the jury is not correct.


Hostile treatment of Liverpool supporters at the Inquests.

23.    The allegation has been made to me during my scrutiny - but without any
       particular examples being cited - that Liverpool supporters who gave
       evidence at the Inquest were given a difficult time. I have read most of the
       supporters’ evidence.

24.    I can find only two possible examples of cross-examination which might fall
       into this category. In one case Counsel tended to ask repetitive questions
       and was stopped by the Coroner. The second case is of a witness who said
       that he and two friends had been drinking and pushed their way from the
       back of pen 3 (in his statement he used the word ‘forced’) to the front and
       through the gate onto the pitch, ignoring appeals not to push and regardless
       of the plight of others. In these circumstances it is hardly surprising that the
       cross-examination was less than sympathetic.

25.    In view of the criticisms that have been made of the Coroner on this score I
       should record that on 30 April 1991 Miss Steele, the solicitor acting for the
       Hillsborough Steering Committee wrote to him thanking him on behalf of
       the Committee and their clients for his kindness. She said “the care and
       sensitivity and in particular the arrangements made for the families at the
       individual Inquests was very much appreciated both by them and us” . She
       also said that the families’ lawyers concerned appreciated his unfailing
       courtesy, consideration and ready response to problems that they raised.


Police failure to let families have documents

26.   One of the complaints which families have made particularly strongly to me
      is that they have been unable to obtain copies of relevant documents from
      the South Yorkshire Police. It may help if I set out the background to this
      complaint.

27.   South Yorkshire Police have an extensive archive of material about the
      Hillsborough disaster. There is a substantial storeroom full of investigation
      files, statements, photographs, videotapes and computer records. They have
      given me and my team unrestricted access to their archive for work on this
       scrutiny. It contains two types of material. First, there are the ‘body files’, of
      which there is one for each individual who died in the disaster.

28.   I have described the content of these files in paragraph 12 of this Chapter. The
       police keep these on behalf of the (current) Coroner for South Yorkshire, and
       access to them is at his discretion. There is a right of access to some of the
material in them under Rule 57 of the Coroners Rules 1984, which so far as
relevant reads

        A coroner shall, on application and on payment o f the prescribed fee
       (if any), supply to any person who, in the opinion o f the coroner, is a
       properly interested person a copy o f any report o f a post-mortem
       examination ...o r special examination, or o f any notes o f evidence, or
       o f any document put in evidence at an inquest ...

       A coroner may, on application and without charge, permit any ...
       properly interested person to inspect such report, notes o f evidence, or
       document ’.

The approach which the South Yorkshire Police have told me they adopt, with
the consent of the Coroner, to requests from relatives for material from the
body files is to send copies of all of it to them, uncut and without charge, so
long as it is not material which they have sent to the relative before.

The rest of the material in the archive is not covered by the Coroners Rules
and access to it is at the discretion of the police. It includes all the statements
taken both during the investigation by West Midlands Police and by South
Yorkshire Police themselves (including, in the case of amended ‘recollections’
and statements by South Yorkshire police officers, both the original and final
versions) and other material such as videotapes, photographs, and the West
Midlands Police report of their investigation to the Director of Public
Prosecutions. Some of the statements and photographs, and stills from the
videotapes, are included in the body files.

South Yorkshire Police told me that they send relatives copies (free of charge)
of material falling into this second group which they say they would like to
see. There are however some exceptions to this. The most important ones are
that they do not send out copies of statements which are not contained in, or
referred to, in the body files unless the person who made the statement agrees
that it should be released (or has since died) and that they will only send
photographs or video stills showing a dead body to someone who is a relation
of that person. This means that they will sometimes trim the print which they
send to relatives of a photograph which contains a picture of more than one
dead body. I think this is a reasonable step for them to take, since sending out
a picture uncut would mean that a picture of other bodies shown on it would
go to somebody who was not a relative of those people.

Some of the families I met said that they could not be sure that the police had
supplied them with all the information from the body files. Others assumed
that they had not done so. I was anxious from the outset of my scrutiny that
families who wished to do so should be able to see the material in these files,
and from what I have seen of the way the South Yorkshire Police have dealt
with families’ requests I would surprised if these criticisms were true.
33.   Nevertheless I invited those families who said they had not received all the
      material in their relative’s file, or that they might not have had it all, to let me
      know what they had so that I could check and see what was missing. Two
      families did so. I checked the relevant files and I am satisfied that nothing of
      significance was omitted.

34.   Quite apart from any of this, witness statements by people who gave evidence
      at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry were made available at that time to the legal
      representatives of the parties, including the families. Transcripts of the
      evidence at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and the main Inquest are in the public
      domain and have been available to the families at all material times.


Confirmation of Death

35.   Some of the families whom I met said that they did not think that their
      relatives were necessarily dead when they were examined at the ground by
      doctors who confirmed to the police that they were so. They said that the
      doctors’ examination was cursory and that mistakes might have been made.

36.   This very serious criticism was in particular made of a Dr Bull, who
      examined 20 people and stated that they were dead between approximately
       3.50 p.m. and 4.20 p.m. (Dr Bull’s statement gives a time of 4.15, but this
       seems to be wrong because the timing of his last examination was 4.20
       according to the police officer who had been placed in charge of the body
       concerned). Relatives have told me that proper examinations could not
       have been conducted in this time.

37.   No expert medical evidence has been tendered to me to support this
      criticism. Nevertheless I thought it right to interview Dr Bull. He told me
      that the times in his statement were an approximation based upon what the
       police told him. He did not look at his watch.

38.   He and a Dr Redgrave divided a certain group of casualties between them.
      These were all people whom the police, or ambulance staff, or other doctors
      had thought were dead and who had been placed in rows in a particular part
      of the Hillsborough gymnasium, which was being used as a casualty clearing
      station and temporary mortuary. Dr Bull said he looked for a pulse in the
      neck of each person and listened for heart and breath sounds. He had not
      brought a stethoscope with him, but he shared Dr Redgrave’s. This was
      possible because they were working in close proximity to each other.

39.    He also examined each person’s pupils for reaction to light. He did not have
       a torch, which he would normally use but in each case he closed the
       person’s eyelids and then opened them and looked for a reaction. The
       gymnasium had bright overhead lighting and he considered this was as good
       as looking with a torch. He felt under no pressure of time. The police had
       asked him to check and make sure of death. He said he had no doubt that he
      had done so correctly. In some cases when using the stethoscope to listen to
      heart sounds he could hear footsteps reverberating through the body, so he
      had to make sure, after these ceased, that there was no heart sound.

40.   Dr Bull did not complete any paperwork as he would have done in a normal
      case of certification of death, but told the police officer who was allocated
      responsibility for each body that the person was dead. At that stage the
      identity of most of the bodies was unknown. His recollection was that he
      looked at one line of bodies, that Dr Redgrave examined the adjacent line,
      and that having done so he checked Dr Redgrave’s cases and vice-versa. He
      did not leave the ground until 5.45 p.m.

41.   Dr Bull was at the match as a spectator and had gone onto the pitch to help
      when he saw that things were going wrong. He had administered first aid to
      a number of people before being asked by the police to go into the
      gymnasium. He had no connections with the police or with Sheffield
      Wednesday Football Club as some relatives have claimed to me.

42.   I have discussed what he told me with a senior Accident and Emergency
      consultant. I did not do this because I was in any doubt about what Dr Bull
      had said but because of the very grave nature of what was being alleged
      about him and the other doctors who unexpectedly had to carry out this
      difficult and demanding task on the day. The consultant confirmed to me
      that the procedures Dr Bull adopted were proper and reliable and I see no
      reason whatever to doubt that this was so.


West Midlands Police biased in favour of the South Yorkshire Police

43.   Chapter 4 deals with allegations that the West Midlands Police tried to
      distort evidence or bully witnesses in favour of the South Yorkshire Police.
      Even if there were signs, which in my view there are not, that individual
      officers exerted undue pressure in those cases, it does not support the
      contention that the West Midlands Police as a whole favoured the South
      Yorkshire Police.

44.    The other suggestions that were made to me on this score were wholly
       unsubstantiated. I see no reason to differ from Lord Taylor’s conclusion as
       to the impartiality of the West Midlands investigation which I cited in
       Chapter 4.


No apology bv the police

45.    One frequent complaint made to me by victims’ families was that the police
       had never apologised for the part they played in the disaster. I have
       discussed this with Mr Wells, who took office as Chief Constable in mid-
       1990. He drew my attention to a press release by his predecessor, Mr Peter
Wright, issued on 4 August 1989, the publication day of Lord Taylor’s
interim report. Mr Wright said

       7 accept the findings and the conclusions o f the Inquiry in so fa r as
       they relate to South Yorkshire Police. The fa ct that we are held to
       have contributed to the terrible tragedy o f Hillsborough is a matter o f
       profound sadness to all members o f the Force, and both personally
       and on their behalf I once again extend my heartfelt regret to those
       who have lost loved ones or suffered injury

Mr Wells said that he often uses the occasion of public speeches to express
his and the Force’s regret. He gave me some examples (and there are many
others).

In a press release on 28 March 1991, the day of the Inquest verdict, he said:

         “I f there seems to be any sense o f relief in South Yorkshire Police
        today it should not be mistaken fo r celebration. I have the
       profoundest sense o f sorrow fo r the 95 deaths that occurred, any
        sense o f relief that we do feel is diminished by the desolation o f the
       families who lost loved ones. We have come to the end o f another
       phase o f the long, slow process o f understanding and healing. ”

In a television interview on the same day there was the following exchange:

       Trevor Hicks: “I was gladdened when I heard his announcement
       earlier where fo r the first time publicly I have heard the Chief
       Constable publicly apologising and expressing regret to the families
           »




The interviewer asked Mr Wells if it was true that he had said on behalf of
the Force that they were sorry. Mr Wells said:

       “I would not have said it if it wasn’t true ... as I say, as a parent
       with all the feelings that I can muster, to M r Hicks and everybody
       else who has lost loved ones here, we are, not just the Chief
       Constable but all o f the officers involved are terribly sorry. It is an
       inexpressible grief to have to bear and I know words don't count fo r
       much but they are sincerely meant. ”

In the Yorkshire Post for 29 March 1991 Mr Wells is recorded as saying:

       “I can’t bring back their children. I wish to God I could. I can only
       say sorry so much, but by God, we are sorry. ”

In a letter to the Yorkshire Post dated 25 January 1992 he wrote:
        ‘The truth is that Lord Justice Taylor described the failure o f the
       police to order the closure o f the tunnel leading to the terracing as a
        “blunder o f the first magnitude”. South Yorkshire Police has
       consistently and unequivocally accepted the truth o f this finding. I
       repeat it now. How can anyone fairly describe this acceptance o f
       responsibility as evasion?

       Not only the police were to blame. You will recall that Lord Justice
       Taylor concluded that there were many factors that contributed to the
       disaster - the layout o f the crush barriers, the dangerous congestion
       arising at the turnstiles, inadequate signing - were some . . . . I repeat
       that blame apportioned by Lord Justice Taylor has been accepted by
       South Yorkshire Police. ’

Following the broadcast of the Granada Television film ‘Hillsborough’ Mr
Wells issued a press release whose last paragraph reads:

        “I am on public record as saying sorry to the bereaved families fo r
       the police’s part in the tragedy and I repeat that every time I have the
       opportunity. We were found wanting and have faced up to our
       responsibility fo r our role, but we were not the only ones who played
       a part in it and it is time fo r others, including the fans, to do the
       same and fo r the families to try to start building bridges. ”

At my meeting with him Mr Wells made it plain that since Lord Taylor’s
Interim Report he had acknowledged on behalf of the force that there had
been four main errors:

i)     failing to delay the kick-off in the light of the large crowds at
        Leppings Lane;

ii).   not noticing or taking full account of the fact that the central pens
        were full by 2.50 p.m;

iii)   not foreseeing where the supporters would go once Gate C was
        opened and not blocking off the tunnel - this was the critical mistake;
        and

iv)    not distinguishing distress from disorder and consequently not
        reacting sufficiently quickly or effectively to the situation.

But Mr Wells also pointed out that others had been criticised by Lord Taylor
(see Chapter 1, paras 47 and 48) and that the police did not bear the sole
responsibility for the disaster although he accepted that they took the largest
share. This is in accordance with Lord Taylor’s findings and is reflected in
the apportionment of liability reached in the settlement of civil proceedings.
I do not think it is reasonable to assert that the South Yorkshire Police have
never apologised or accepted responsibility for their share of the blame.

Miscellaneous


Television programmes

1.    Not unnaturally the Hillsborough disaster has attracted a lot of media coverage over
      the years. Three television programmes I think are particularly significant, and I
      think it right to offer brief comments on these.

2.    The first is a 1First Tuesday ’ programme, ‘Disaster at Hillsborough’, broadcast by
      Yorkshire Television in February 1990. It is in my view a fair and balanced
      account, using much original material, including scenes taken from police camera 5
      after 15.02 (being part of the clip shown to the jury as C539). The commentary
      closely corresponds with Lord Taylor’s findings.

3.    The second is an episode of the ‘Cook Report’ (Yorkshire Television) shown in June
      1994. This concentrated on the case of Kevin Williams. A number of statements
      made in the course of the programme are in my opinion not substantiated, for
      reasons I set out when discussing the Kevin Williams case earlier. For example -

                Roger Cook ‘Evidence previously disregarded or altered with duress and
                witnesses previously ignored demonstrate that Kevin and others could be
                alive today”.

                Sir Malcolm Thornton MP “The truth seems to have been suppressed -
                policemen and women on the spot were ‘leaned on ’ by their colleagues to
                change their evidence. ”

                 Roger Cook “I f evidence that (Kevin) was alive at five to four had been
                 allowed to stand, events after 3.15 would have had to be investigated” (by
                 the Inquest).


4.    The third is the Granada Television programme ‘Hillsborough ’ shown on 5
      December 1996. This is a highly emotive and powerful drama based on
      Hillsborough and the Inquest. It portrays most graphically the appalling grief of the
      bereaved and their disillusion with the Inquest. It is not always easy for the viewer
      of this programme to tell what is reconstruction and what is original video footage
      taken on the day.

5.    I do not have much doubt that this programme played a substantial part in the
       decision to set up my scrutiny. It is not for me to comment on the accuracy of the
       impressions which it gives as a whole. But in so far as it suggests that police
      videotapes were suppressed or destroyed, it is not accurate. The programme also
      relies on Mr Houldsworth’s assertions, made for the first time at about this time,
      that he could see from police cameras 5 and 3 as relayed in the Club Control Room
      that pens 3 and 4 were already full before Gate C was opened. For reasons I have
      set out at length, I do not accept this evidence.


Ten unresolved questions?

6.    At the time of the ‘Hillsborough’ television programme in 1996 the programme
      makers, Granada Television, wrote to Mr David Maclean MP, then a Minister at the
      Home Office, with a list of what they said were ten unresolved questions about the
      disaster. Most of these questions were in my view clearly answered by Lord Taylor’s
      Inquiry. Nevertheless I have looked at them and set out the answers in Appendix 10.


The state of the ground

7.    At a late stage of my scrutiny I was invited by the South Yorkshire Police to consider
      the evidence of Mr Noel Bume, BSc(Eng), ACGI, FICE, FI.Struct.E., FCIOB, FFB,
      ACI ACG, FBAE. Mr Bume is a structural engineer who was instructed in July 1989
      to report on and advise the South Yorkshire Police Authority on the safety and
      structural aspects of the Hillsborough ground, in particular with a view to the
      anticipated civil proceedings. He produced a report, dated August 1990, and gave oral
      evidence in the contribution proceedings heard before the Hon Mr Justice Jowitt
      which began on 2 October 1990. His evidence was therefore not available at the time
      of Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and he was not called to give evidence at the Inquest.


Mr B um e’s evidence

8.     In his Report Mr Bume dealt with the following matters:

              (a)      Turnstiles - poor labelling and inadequate number

              (b)      Lack of proper direction signs in the concourse

              (c)      Lack of control system for monitoring numbers in each pen

              (d)      Overall capacity of Leppings Lane Terraces overestimated

              (e)      Incorrect slope of the tunnel

              (f)   Exits from the pens not signed and inadequate for emergency
              evacuation

              (g)    Crush barriers - poorly placed, too low, of inadequate strength and
              insufficient in number
9.    In Mr Bume’s view there were many breaches of the advice and recommendations
       contained in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Green Guide) to such an extent
       that his overall opinion was:

               “As a whole, the West Terrace was unsafe by reason o f neglect to conform to
               the primary recommendations and obligations o f the Green Guide, among
               others. ”

10.   On 5 October 1990 Mr Burne gave evidence before the Hon Mr Justice Jowitt in the
      contribution proceedings. Before his evidence was completed or tested in cross-
      examination, the proceedings were settled. It is reasonable to assume that Mr Bume’s
      opinion was a material factor in persuading the Club and Eastwood and Partners to
      make a substantial contribution to what was then estimated to be the overall cost of
      the claims.

11.   For the most part the matters that Mr Burne criticised were fully considered by
       Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, and Lord Taylor made a number of findings consistent with
       Mr Burne’s criticisms, some of which I have referred to in Chapter 1 (paragraphs 47
       and 48). But there are two matters which Mr Bume pointed to which the police
       suggest were either not considered or not fully considered at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry.


Height o f the crush barriers

12.   The first relates to the height of the crush barriers. The recommended height for crush
       barriers in the Green Guide is between 1.02m and 1,12m with a preferred height of
       1.1m. This is measured above the nosing of that part of the step immediately behind
       the barrier. According to Mr Bume, adopting this method of measurement, the
       effective height of crush barrier 124A (the one which collapsed in pen 3) was between
       .865 - .915m, and more importantly the height of the barrier immediately behind,
       namely 136, was only .745 - .775m; barrier 136A (which was diagonally between
       barrier 124A and the entrance to the tunnel) was .765 - .785m.

13.   Mr Bume identified three disadvantages resulting from too low a crush barrier. First,
       if the barrier is at the level of the upper leg and below the groin it is not anatomically
       in the best position and the person behind it cannot use his arms to push away from
      the barrier. This is not particularly relevant in the circumstances of extreme
       overcrowding. Secondly, the upper part of the body of a person behind the crush
       barrier is not restrained by it, so that the load is transferred from those behind to those
       in front, thereby imposing an excessive load on the next barrier. Finally, there will be
       a downward component in the forces exercised on the barrier in addition to a
       horizontal one, which tends to make it more vulnerable to collapse under conditions of
       extreme pressure.

14.   There is little doubt that the failure of barrier 124A contributed to the substantially
       larger number of deaths in pen 3 and in particular in the area between barrier 124A
       and the perimeter fence. These points could therefore be of some significance.
15.    Dr Nicholson, who was a Chartered Engineer and Deputy Director of the Research
       and Laboratory Services Division of the Health and Safety Executive, made a written
       report to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry. He also gave evidence at the inquest. He did not deal
       with these specific matters; but in his oral evidence at the inquest he considered that
       one of the important causes of the collapse of barrier 124A was that there was a gap in
       the barrier behind, between barriers 136 and 136A, with the result that there was
       nothing to break the density of the crowd bearing on barrier 124A. and it may well be
       that this is a more important factor in causing the failure of barrier 124A than those
       suggested by Mr Bume relating to the height of the barriers.


Capacity o f the Leppings Lane terrace

16.    The second matter which Mr Bume pointed to relates to the overall capacity of the
       Leppings Lane terrace. The overall capacity for the terrace had been calculated by
       Eastwood and Partners, the consulting engineers to Sheffield Wednesday Football
       Club, and accepted by the City Council at 10,100. This was divided between 2,900 to
       the North West Terrace and 7,200 for the remainder, calculated at the rate of 54
       spectators per 10 sq meters. The size of the area in question was not based on a
       survey of the ground by Eastwood and Partners, but on a drawing produced by the
       Club. In December 1989 (after Lord Taylor’s interim report) the area was measured
       and this revealed that the size of the North West Terrace as shown on the Club’s
       drawing was too great. Adopting the correct measurement, at the rate of 54 spectators
       per 10 sq meters the capacity of the North West Terrace was only 2,242. There was
       therefore an excess of 658 or 22.6% allowed in this area.

17.    In paragraphs 137 to 142 of his Interim Report, Lord Taylor dealt with the correct
       calculation of the capacity for pens 3 and 4. These had been calculated by Eastwood
        and Partners at 1,200 for pen 3 and 1,000 for pen 4. These figures would have been
       too high even if the terraces complied with the Green Guide recommendations. If
       they had complied with the Green Guide the figures should have been 1,015 and
        1,036 respectively. But they did not and Lord Taylor calculated that the capacities of
       pens 3 and 4 should have been 822 and 871 respectively, a total of 507 less than the
        2,200 allocated.

18.    It is not clear whether the other pens on the Leppings Lane terraces, numbers 1 , 2 , 6
        and 7 complied as to layout, position and size of cmsh barriers, means of access and
        gangways with the Green Guide. It seems unlikely that they did. But even assuming
        that they did, and that it was appropriate to calculate the capacity of these pens on the
        basis of 54 spectators per 10 sq meters, it is apparent that the capacity overall was
        overestimated by 1,165, ie 658 in the North West Terraces and 507 in pens 3 and 4.
        The result would be that an excessive number of tickets were sold over the safe
        capacity.

19.    The individual pens were not segregated and did not have separate turnstiles, and
        spectators naturally tended to congregate in the central pens 3 and 4 because these
        were the ones behind the goal. The overstatement of the capacity of the Leppings
      Lane terraces is clearly therefore a matter of some importance. Lord Taylor was
      aware of part of the problem, but it does not seem that he was aware of the
      overstatement of the size of the North West Terrace and it is not clear whether an
      adjustment for non-compliance with the Green Guide should have been made in
      relation to the pens other than 3 and 4.

20.   These matters do not give grounds for re-opening the Judicial Inquiry or any other
      proceedings. Indeed it is not suggested by the police that they do. Lord Taylor
      might, if he had known of them, have criticised Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
      their consultant engineers, and those responsible for licensing the ground in more
      stringent terms than he did, but I do not consider that there would have been any
      question of his changing his central conclusion, borne out as it is by the overwhelming
      mass of the evidence, that the primary cause of the disaster was a failure of police
      control. However, if the responsibility of the other parties was somewhat greater than
      had earlier been appreciated, that might have a bearing on any reconsideration of
      criminal proceedings against police officers.



Further complaints about the Inquest

21.   In further very late submissions dated 11 December 1997, Junior Counsel for the
      Family Support Group raised two further complaints about the Inquest. The first
      concerns the Coroner’s summing-up. Counsel said that in relation to the state of the
      central pens at 14.52 he directed the jury to reach ‘a factual conclusion which was
      in direct conflict with the conclusions reached by Lord Taylor’ and by so doing he
      distorted the evidence.

22.   This has nothing to do with any fresh evidence and strictly speaking therefore does
      not call for comment from me. But lest it be given credence it is I think only fair to
      the Coroner that I say something. Counsel cites three passages. When his
      summing-up is read as a whole, it seems to me that the Coroner dealt fully and
      fairly with all the evidence.

23.   He did not direct the jury to make particular findings of fact and he did not usurp he
      jury’s function. Had he done so, I have no doubt that it would have been
      challenged in the Divisional Court. Complaint was made there of his directions to
      the jury on law, but not of his summary of the facts.

24.   Secondly, Junior Counsel for the Family Support Group criticised the Coroner’s
       ruling about the use of transcripts in cross examination. This again has nothing to
       do with fresh evidence. It is a point which if there was any substance in it, could
       and should have been raised in the Divisional Court.

25.   Under cover of a letter dated 17 December 1997 the Solicitor for the Family
      Support Group sent me “an analysis of the major variances between the findings of
      Lord Justice Taylor and the summing-up of Dr Popper” . The analysis does not
      contain any fresh evidence. Moreover it appears to confuse the function of Lord
      Taylor in weighing conflicting evidence and making his findings according to his
      view of its reliability, and the function of the Coroner who has to sum up the
      evidence so that the jury can reach their verdict. The two things are quite
      different.

26.   The fact that there is evidence both consistent and inconsistent with Lord Taylor’s
      findings is a consequence of having an Inquest which covers much the same ground
      as the Inquests. I comment on this below.

27.   It is perhaps some indication of the substance of these points that they were raised
      for the first time on 11 and 17 December 1997.


An Inquest following a Judicial Inquiry

28.   I do not agree with the criticisms of the Coroner and his conduct of the Inquests
      advanced by the families (most of them had already been rejected by the Divisional
      Court) and I have found no fresh evidence to justify reopening them. But I have
      come to the very firm conclusion that it is unsatisfactory to have an Inquest into the
      question of how the deceased came to their deaths where there has been a major
      disaster and an inquiry chaired by a High Court Judge, which will inevitably have
      covered the same ground and indeed, as in this case, ranged much wider.

29.   I have read the Report of the Home Office Working Group on Disasters and
      Inquests (published in March 1997) and concur with their recommendation that in
      such cases the role of the Coroner should be limited by securing the adjournment of
      the Inquest when a public inquiry is established and limiting the circumstances in
      which the inquest can be resumed. I also agree with the Working Group’s
      reasoning for making this recommendation. I would like to make the following
      points specifically in the case of Hillsborough:

              a)     At the Taylor Inquiry 179 witnesses gave evidence over a period of
              31 days. Of these over 50 were Liverpool supporters. Their evidence
              occupied about four days in total. Their evidence was graphic, clear and
              substantially to the same effect. By contrast at the Inquest over 200
              witnesses gave evidence over a period of 72 days. Of these over 100 were
              Liverpool supporters and included only a few of those who gave evidence
              before Lord Taylor. I estimate that their evidence in total took in excess of
              15 days. Again their evidence of the critical events was often graphic and
              substantially to the same effect. But it took much longer because it was not
              concentrated on the vital points and much of the questioning was repetitive.

              Dr Popper told me that he considered it necessary to call so many supporters
              so that their side of the case should be fully put. While I understand this
              desire, it must be open to question whether in considering the question ‘how’
              a deceased came to his death, it is necessary to call so many witnesses whose
              evidence is essentially the same.
      b)     Although the issues at the Inquest are likely to be of far more limited
      scope than at a judicial inquiry, and in particular questions of civil liability
      and individual criminal liability are not matters for the Inquest, in practice it
      is very difficult for the Coroner to draw the line, especially if, as in this
      case, there are a considerable number of parties legally represented, all of
      whom have interests to pursue or protect.

      c)     In practice it is the decision of the DPP that it important in
      determining whether or not there should be a prosecution for manslaughter,
      though the DPP can reconsider a decision not to bring a charge if further
      evidence not previously considered emerges at an Inquest and the jury reach
      a verdict of unlawful killing.

      d)      It is most unlikely that a Coroner will have experience comparable to
      that of a High Court Judge in controlling an Inquiry of this magnitude. It is
      an extremely onerous task.

      e)     A tribunal of Inquiry is an inquisitorial body, usually charged with
      the responsibility of finding out what happened and why and making
      recommendations to avoid similar disasters in future. The tribunal will
      make detailed findings of fact and very probably express an opinion as to
      where responsibility or criticism lies. It seems pointless to go over part of
      the same ground again, especially having regard to the limited scope of the
      Inquest and available verdicts. Although as I have already said, the
      perception is misconceived, there is no doubt that a number of the families
      have perceived the verdict of accidental death as in some way reversing or
      negating the findings of Lord Taylor.

      f)      Quite apart from other considerations, a major inquest of this sort
      involves very considerable expense both in time and money. Witnesses have
      to attend; local taxpayers have to bear the expense of the Inquest, interested
      parties the expense of legal representation for which legal aid is not
      available.

      g)      There is distress and anxiety caused by the delay. In this case it was
      over two years before the verdict at the Inquest. Not infrequently in this
      type of case, there is a challenge in the Divisional Court which increases the
      delay and adds to the uncertainty. If the challenge is mounted by legal
      advisers who did not appear at the Inquiry or Inquest, points may be taken
      which could not have been taken by those who had appeared before, possibly
      giving rise to false hopes of the applicants. It is not only the bereaved who
      suffer from this long drawn out process. Those whose conduct has been
      called in question should not have the anxiety hanging over their heads
      indefinitely.

In the case of Hillsborough the Coroner was confronted with a most formidable
task. The Divisional Court rejected the criticisms made of him and complimented
him on his summing up. The undue prolixity of the proceedings flowed in part
from the difficulties in controlling such an Inquiry with many parties represented
and in part from the Coroner’s understandable desire that the Liverpool supporters
side should be fully presented to the jury. It is not the sort of case which a Coroner
should be asked to undertake where there has already been a full judicial inquiry.
But as the law now stands he has no option.
CHAPTER 7


Summary


1.   In this chapter I summarise the findings which I have made.

2.   Before doing so I must make it clear that anyone who is familiar with the
     terrible events of 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough is bound to have great
     sympathy with the relatives of those who died and the spectators who were
     injured. I have now spent many weeks studying the evidence of what
     happened and considering the representations and submissions made by the
     families and their legal representatives. I find it difficult to imagine anything
     more horrific than that experienced by those who endured it and those who
     lost their children, relatives and friends.

3.   That 96 people, the majority of them young, should set out in high hopes and
     spirits on a fine Spring day, and yet within a space of less than half-an-hour
     suffer crushing injuries from which they died, is nothing less than appalling. I
     have the most profound sympathy with all the families and friends of those
     who suffered in this way, many of whom I have met. I also understand the
     dismay that they have that no individual has personally been held to account,
     either in a criminal court, disciplinary proceedings, or even to the extent of
     losing their job.

4.   I realise that my report and advice will come as a disappointment to them,
      especially since they had had their hopes raised that something more could be
      done. But I cannot allow compassion to cloud my judgement. I have had to
      look dispassionately and objectively at what is said to be fresh evidence, in the
      light of the evidence which had previously been considered.

5.   Having done so, for the reasons I have set out, I have come to the clear
     conclusion that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial
     Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor’s Inquiry. There is no basis for a
     renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to
     exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider that there
     is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions
     or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the
     decisions they have already taken. Nor do I consider that there is any
     justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the
     emergency and hospital services. I have carefully considered the
     circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written
      statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, but I do not consider that there
     is any occasion for any further investigation.

6.   None of the evidence I was asked to consider added anything significant to the
     evidence which was available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry or to the Inquests.
Video evidence

7.     Chapter 2 of this report deals with video evidence of the disaster. My
       conclusions about that are that there is no new video evidence of it or video
       evidence which was not available to Lord Taylor, the Coroner, or the other
       authorities who examined the disaster at the time.

8.     Two video tapes which were stolen on the day of the disaster remain missing.
       They were tapes of pictures from CCTV cameras operated by Sheffield
       Wednesday Football Club. They were not police tapes and would not have
       shown anything significant. Their theft is unsolved. The suggestion that
       the police tried to blame their failure to spot overcrowding on the terraces onto
       faulty CCTV equipment is wrong. They did not blame the CCTV equipment.
       The police controllers had a good view over the terraces from their control box
       and did not pretend otherwise.

9.     The allegation that police hid videotape evidence of the terraces is unfounded,
       and the allegation that the Coroner failed properly to pursue the question of
       this ‘missing’ police footage is equally unfounded.     Police officers did not
       give false evidence about the state of the police CCTV system at the ground,
       and I do not accept the evidence of Roger Houldsworth, video technician at
       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, that he realised from looking at police
       CCTV pictures of pens 3 and 4 at about the time Gate C was opened at 14.52
       that these pens were dangerously overcrowded.


The aftermath o f the disaster

10.    I deal in Chapter 3 of the report with suggestions that the inquest into the
        deaths of those who died in the disaster was seriously flawed, and that there
        should now be a public inquiry into what was done, or not done, to help them
        and others who were crushed.

11.    I do not consider that the Inquest was flawed. Most of the criticisms relate to
        the so-called ‘3.15 cut-off point’. I do not agree with these criticisms. The
        Coroner considered the questions of who the deceased were and when and
        where they died at the mini-inquests, and this involved consideration of
        matters long after 3.15. It was only in relation to the question of how, i.e. by
        what means, the deceased came to their deaths that the Coroner imposed a cut­
        off point of 3.15 p.m. He had good reasons for deciding to limit the inquiry in
        this way and the cut-off did not limit inquiry into that question.

12.    Questions of whether the response of the emergency services was adequate
       were not relevant to the task the Coroner had to perform. It was suggested to
       me that the fact that Dr Walker, Mr Houldsworth, and others were not called
       as witnesses at the inquest amounted to fraudulent concealment of their
       evidence. That suggestion is false and I regard it as wholly irresponsible.
13.   Lord Taylor inquired into the rescue operation and his findings are published
       in his report. He made criticisms of the slow response of the police and
       recommendations for the future. I cannot see that any useful purpose would
       be served by having any further inquiry into the rescue operation. In my
       opinion there is no evidence of want of care by the emergency or medical
       services. Any wide-ranging inquiry into this aspect of the disaster would
       place huge burdens upon them, but to no purpose.


Interference with witnesses

14.   Chapter 4 of this report deals with suggestions that the evidence of witnesses
      to the disaster was tampered with, so that the truth did not emerge either at
      Lord Taylor’s Inquiry or the Inquests. These allegations are of two types -
      that the West Midlands Police put pressure on Derek Bruder, Debra Martin,
       and Paul Taylor which affected the evidence they wished to give, and that the
      way in which the South Yorkshire Police went about collecting evidence from
      their own officers who were at Hillsborough and witnessed the disaster was
       unacceptable. I have interviewed Mr Bruder, Miss Martin, and Mr Taylor and
       have come to the conclusion in each case that there was no improper attempt
       to affect their evidence.


Mr Bruder

15.    So far as Mr Bruder is concerned, I am quite satisfied that the West Midlands
       Police, in seeking to confirm details of his statement relating to Kevin
       Williams, did not subject him to improper pressure. He told me himself that
       they did not. His statements were accurately summarised at the inquest on
       Kevin Williams and there was no attempt to discredit him.


Miss Martin

16.    I did not find Miss Martin a reliable witness. Her statement about events at
        Hillsborough, where she was on duty as a Special Constable, was seriously at
       variance with the account of everybody else who was there. She remains
       plainly - and understandably - deeply upset by the disaster, and her memories
        of the day and of subsequent events relating to it are vague and confused. I
        think that she gave her account of Kevin Williams sitting up in her arms and
        saying ‘Mom’ in good faith. But it cannot be relied upon. It contradicts Mr
        Bruder’s evidence and is also contrary to the pathological findings.

17.    I interviewed the West Midlands police officer who Miss Martin claims
        bullied her. I found this officer to be an impressive witness. I cannot see
        that she had any reason to discredit Miss Martin, and she told me that she did
       not bully or browbeat her.   I accept her account and prefer it to Miss
       Martin’s.


Mr Tavlor

18.    As far as Paul Taylor is concerned, I do not accept his evidence that he was
       bullied or intimidated by a West Midlands officer. His account of what he
       saw at Hillsborough has changed in various ways over the years, and he does
       not appear to have raised any complaint about the conduct of this officer until
       1997. I prefer the evidence of the officer, which is supported to some extent
       by the contemporary documents. In any event he had no reason to put
       pressure on Mr Taylor.


South Yorkshire Police statements

19.    I have looked with great care at the way in which the South Yorkshire Police
       obtained written evidence from their officers who witnessed the disaster to put
       before the West Midlands Police investigators and Lord Taylor’s Inquiry.
        Soon after the disaster officers were asked to write out in their own words their
       recollections of the day and of the part which they themselves had played.
       Many of these statements were submitted to Hammond Suddards, solicitors to
       the force, to advise whether they were in a suitable form for submission to
        Lord Taylor’s Inquiry.

20.   The solicitors made no comment on the great majority of these statements, and
      in others their advice was confined to clearing up ambiguities and removing
      hearsay, comment or inappropriate language. In a very few cases, which I
      have referred to in Appendix 7, what has been excluded is either factual or
      comment in which factual matters are implicit. In these cases I think it would
      have been preferable for the factual matters not to have been excluded, or the
      comment elucidated.

21.   It was well known to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry Team that the statements were
       being vetted in this way. The process did not materially differ from the way
       in which statements were taken from witnesses who were employed by
       Sheffield Wednesday FC or the Ambulance Service.

22.    Towards the end of May 1989 the South Yorkshire Police team responsible for
        collating the evidence of officers in the Force began to suggest amendments to
        statements without referring them to the solicitors. The suggestions they
        made were on the same basis as those made by the solicitors. I have looked
        at all the statements that were altered in this way. In most cases the alteration
        is trivial. Where comment or opinion is excluded the amendments cannot in
        my opinion be criticised. In no case is the statement rendered misleading.
23.   I am quite satisfied that Lord Taylor’s Inquiry was not in any way inhibited or
      impeded by what happened. Lord Taylor was well aware of the criticisms
      made by some junior officers. His Inquiry examined these issues and he
      made findings about them which were adverse to the police.

24.   I am also satisfied that the exclusion of these comments did not affect the
       outcome of the Inquests, or the decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions
      not to bring criminal charges as a result of the disaster. I do not consider that
      there is any question of misconduct either by the solicitor who gave the police
       advice upon the statements or by the police officers who suggested alterations
      to the statements without referring the statement to the solicitors.


Other issues

Inconsistent evidence

25.   It is clear that there is inconsistent evidence about precisely what happened to
       some of the people who died at Hillsborough. Such conflicts of evidence are
       inevitable given the scale of the disaster. The Coroner did his best to resolve
       these questions at the Inquest, and I have tried to get to the bottom of some of
       those which remain and which the families of those who died have asked me
       to look into. I have not been completely successful in this. What is clear
       however is that no further inquiry involving examination of the witnesses
       could help after this lapse of time.


The Inquests

26.   The Divisional Court found that the Coroner was not biased and had no
      conflict of interest. I see no reason to disagree with that. I can find no
      evidence to support the suggestion that Liverpool supporters who gave
       evidence at the Inquest were given a difficult time in the witness box.

27.   I do not agree with the criticisms which have been made of the Coroner and
       the way in which he ran the Inquests. But I endorse the recommendation of
       the Home Office Working Group on Disasters and Inquests that the role of the
       Coroner should be limited in circumstances such as these. I have reached the
       firm conclusion that is not satisfactory to have an inquest into the deaths
       caused by a major disaster when an Inquiry chaired by a High Court Judge has
       already covered the same ground.


The police

28.   Some of the families of those who died have told me that they have been
       unable to obtain copies of documents to which they were entitled from the
       South Yorkshire Police archive on the disaster. Two families supplied me
       with material to enable me to check on this. In neither case did I think the
       complaint was justified.

29.    The investigation of the disaster by the West Midlands Police was not biased
       in favour of the South Yorkshire force.

30.    The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has on many occasions apologised for
       the disaster on behalf of his force.


Examination bv doctors confirming death

31.    Criticism that doctors who examined bodies at the ground did so in a cursory
       or inadequate manner is wholly unsubstantiated.


The state o f the ground

32.    There are two questions to do with the state of the Hillsborough football
       ground which seem to me to have aspects which were not considered by Lord
       Taylor’s otherwise very full Inquiry. These questions are to do with the
       height of the crush barriers on the Leppings Lane terrace where the disaster
       happened and the overall capacity of that terrace. I do not consider that they
       give grounds for reopening the Judicial Inquiry or any other proceedings.

APPENDIX 3 - ROGER HOULDSWORTH


PART 1 Statement. 16 May 1989
        -




STATEMENT


I,     ROGER HOULDSWORTH of                {address deleted)        WILL STATE: -

I am 42 years old and up to the week commencing 10th April I was employed as Technical
Director by M.W. (Technology) Limited of Sheffield. I had been employed in that capacity for
some 2 years until I resigned my position. I hold an H.N.C. qualification as an Electronics
Engineer. Prior to working with M.W. (Technology) Limited I had previously worked for
more than 10 years abroad, in the electronics field.

When I returned from working abroad, in 1986, I was approached by the then Company
Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Dick Chester, who asked me to assist in
relation to certain problems the Club were having with their closed circuit television systems
(CCTV). I understand the CCTV system then installed had been put in place by Philips Alarms
in about 1984 but that Company had subsequently gone out of business.

I did look at the system at Mr Chester’s request and as then designed and installed it was not
working properly.

Shortly afterwards I joined M.W. (Technology) Limited and whilst their employee I completed
by examination of the existing system and re-designed it to improve the system and also the
computer system related to it. I also re-designed the CCTV system which had been installed by
the Club for Police use - this being a separate system from that operated by the Club for its own
purposes.

The Club System

This consisted of a number of static TV cameras situated at strategic points around the ground.
As a result of my examining the system I arranged for some additional cameras to be installed
to enhance it, particularly when the Spion Kop part of the ground was re-opened in 1986.

Being a static system the cameras are in a fixed position and focus on a particular fixed area.
They were in fact positioned at strategic points to view the turnstile entrances, and there was
also a camera covering the players’ entrance. Within the CCTV room, situated in the south
stand near the players’ entrance, there is a bank of 20 monitors plus a monitor for the computer
system. This computer system records the number of spectators who come through the
turnstiles for each separate area of the ground. Of the 20 monitors within the control room, 19
display the scene as depicted in the Club’s static system. The remaining monitor is connected
to the Police CCTV system.

Each of the monitors connected to the Club system is in turn connected to a VCR so that we
have the facility to tape the film shown on those monitors, on a video tape. Of the 19 static
cameras however I was not in commission at the time because a wall had been constructed after
the camera had been installed, which obstructed that camera’s view of the relevant turnstiles.
The turnstiles in question were those numbered 9 - 1 6 which will be referred to later in this
Statement.

The Police System

This consisted of 5 fully functional remote controlled cameras - ie those cameras could pan tilt
through 360°, and zoom on a 16/160 lens. They are controlled from a Police control box which
is fixed in position at the south west corner of the ground, adjacent to the western end of the
south stand. The cameras for the Police system are positioned as follows:-

       1 on the upper south west corner of the west stand;

       2 are positioned on the top of the south stand, 1 at about its centre point and the other to
       the eastern end of the stand at the top;

       1 at the top (rear) of the roof of the Spion Kop;

       1 at the south west corner of the ground, mounted on high near the score board and
       close to the Police control box.

Within the Police control box there are 7 TV monitors. 5 of them are dedicated, 1 to each of
the CCTV cameras. The other 2 are connected to special time lapse Video Recorders, and you
can switch from camera to camera by means of a passive switch within the control room so that
the Officer in Charge can record the scene being displayed on any 1 of the 5 cameras. The
remaining 2 monitors are used so that the Officer can check which of the 5 cameras are being
recorded at any given time. PC Trevor Bishop (sic) (Bichard) was the Officer who worked the
CCTV system for the Police but it was not usual for him to be alone in the control room - there
might perhaps be 3 or 4 other Officers in there with him at any given time for their own
reasons - eg to watch a section of the crowd from an elevated position.

Within the Police control box there is also a telephone land line which is part of Sheffield
Wednesday FC’s internal telephone system, and the Police have their own separate telephone
land lines installed also.

The events of Saturday. 15th April. 1989

Although I had previously resigned my position as Technical Director of M.W. (Technology)
Limited I was asked by Graham Mackrell to attend at the ground on that day in case my
assistance was required. We knew that the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool FC and
Nottingham Forest FC was a sell-out all ticket match and I arrived at the ground fairly early on
the Saturday morning to check that everything was in order. I was in fact asked to rectify a
fault on one of the Police CCTV cameras, the one at the south west corner near the score
board. I checked it, found it was not functioning properly and I made the necessary
adjustments to the iris controls within the camera and thereafter checked that it was working
OK. Late in the morning I then went to the CCTV control room where PC Harold Guest was
also in attendance, as usual. In addition there was present Doug Lock, the Security Officer for
Sheffield Wednesday FC and Geoff Plane of M.W. (Technology) . PC Guest, as a matter of
routine, would have ensured early in the morning that cassette tapes were inserted in the 19
                                                 2
VCRs - 1 of course would not be recording a picture because the camera was out of action but
PC Guest would nevertheless routinely load all 19. The authorised crowd capacity figures for
each section of the ground was part of the data stored in the computer, and the display monitor
for the computer would show how many spectators came through each of the turnstiles in
operation as the day went on. The system was so designed that when the turnstiles for a
particular area had admitted 90% capacity to that area, the total for that section would flash on
the TV screen and if, for example, one part of the ground was being filled up quickly and there
was capacity in another part (subject to segregation of supporters) that would enable the Police
to be aware that they should direct remaining supporters to a different set of turnstiles. Each of
the turnstiles was also fitted with an infra-red ray sensor, so that if spectators tried to climb
over the turnstiles but within the turnstile enclosure, that would also be recorded on the screen,
under a separate heading. I produce [Exhibit 1] a copy of the print-out from the computer
monitor for the game in question. Numbers climbing over the turnstiles within the enclosure
would be shown on the column headed “Check Total” . The first heading “Gate” is the
turnstile number through which the fans entered, the “Gate Total” shows the number who
entered through each of those turnstiles and there will be sub-totals for each section.

I was present in the CCTV control room from about 11.30 am that morning when the turnstiles
were opened and spectators were entering the ground. The Spion Kop and the south stand had
been designated for Nottingham Forest supporters, and the north stand and west stand
(including Leppings Lane) were reserved for Liverpool supporters. The authorised capacity for
the various sections of the ground was as follows:-

               Spion Kop                    21,000
               South Stand covered           5,524
               South Stand uncovered         3,310
               West Stand                    4,465
               Leppings Lane                10,100
               North Stand                   9,702

By about 2.45 pm the Kop and the south stand areas were full of Nottingham Forest supporters
but the north stand and the west stand areas were only about 2/3 full at that time and it was
noticeable from the static camera covering the Leppings Lane turnstiles that there was a build­
up of fans outside the turnstiles in that area. I produce [Exhibit 2] a plan of the ground
showing the Leppings Lane entrance to the west and the turnstiles (7 in number) which admit
spectators to the terraced area of the west stand are designated A/G. It will be seen that to the
south of those turnstiles runs a concrete path which leads around eventually to the south stand.
That path is bounded on the one side (the south) by the river Don and on the north side by a
high brick wall. Situated in that wall just immediately beyond the turnstiles - ie to the east of
them - was an exit gate designated Gate C which is a double gate of the concertina metal type
which was kept closed. One of the static cameras of the CCTV system was situated on a post
just east of that gate, the camera being positioned so as to show the area of the turnstiles A/G.

It was through the monitor showing the scene depicted by that camera that it was possible to see
the build-up of supporters outside the turnstiles. The Police had erected some barriers across
the pathway a short distance east of Gate C so that spectators could not walk along that pathway
to get across to the south stand. The build-up of Liverpool supporters outside the Leppings
Lane entrance was such that some had been forced beyond the entrance to the turnstiles outside
Gate C and some of those supporters were visible within the field of vision of the static camera.
The position was such that I recall commenting, at perhaps 2.50 pm, “For God’s sake why
don’t they delay the kick-off” and I made that comment in the presence of Doug Lock and PC
Guest. We were all, as I recall, in general agreement that it would be sensible to postpone the
kick-off to enable people to get into the ground, although I do not recall that anyone in the
CCTV control room attempted to contact the Police by radio or telephone to suggest that. The
Police of course were monitoring the situation themselves from their own CCTV system, and in
particular using the camera on the south west corner of the west stand roof. We could of
course see that that camera was trained on the Leppings Lane turnstiles because we were able to
monitor the Police pictures on one of the monitors within our control room, although we did
not have the facility to record that picture.

There came a time when Gate C appeared to be opened, and a number of spectators rushed
through into the “reservoir” area between the turnstiles and the rear of the west stand. An
examination of the video recording appears to indicate that this occurred when the Police
opened the gate in an effort to eject one of the spectators that way, and a number of the fans
pressed through from the outside. It would appear that several hundred got through before the
gates were again closed.

Subsequently the static camera picked up the fact that a number of fans climbed up over the
structure housing the turnstiles, and jumped down into the reservoir area inside. That is, it
seems, further indication of the pressures building up outside the turnstiles although a steady
flow of spectators was coming through those turnstiles at all times, in the normal way.

I recall that after the first influx of several hundred spectators through Gate C, Doug Lock left
the CCTV room to go outside presumably to report the matter to the Club Secretary, Graham
Mackrell, and/or to check the position for himself on the ground.

Some time later, I am unsure of the exact time, I heard over the Police radio (we had one in the
CCTV room) a Senior Police Officer make a request that a gate be opened at the Leppings Lane
entrance. Police control asked which gate he wished opened and he repeated his request 2 or 3
times. On about the fourth occasion he said “Someone is going to die here. Open the gate”
and Police control replied “If someone is going to die open the gate, open the gate”.

As appears from the video tape recording the scene the gate was then opened apparently by a
uniformed PC, and a huge number of fans flooded into the area.

At that point in time I realised, from the numbers already displayed on the monitor as having
entered from the Leppings Lane turnstiles, that a dangerous situation was being created. I left
the room and went down the players’ tunnel to the pitch and just as I did so the Referee stopped
the match as I recall. I looked over to the west stand area and I saw fans climbing over the
fence and my first thought at that time was that it was a pitch invasion, and the match had been
stopped for that reason. The perimeter fencing at that point is high and not easy to climb over.
I sat down in the stand area behind the dug-out, and watched the situation for a little time -
perhaps 2 or 3 minutes before I realised what really was occurring. One of the Sheffield
Wednesday ground staff came down the tunnel holding 2 stretchers and I grabbed one from him
and ran across with it to help ferry the injured people to the gymnasium area where the first-aid
room was situated. It was in fact only after I had ferried 3 or 4 injured people in that way that
I then realised that there were many people who had died as a result, and the gym was in fact
designated as a temporary mortuary.
After helping on the pitch as much as possible at about 4.15/4.30 pm I went back to the CCTV
room where Geoff Plane and PC Guest were present, and I had a cup of coffee and a cigarette.
Subsequently I took print-outs of the attendance from the computer monitor, and ejected the
tapes from the VCRs leaving them in the machine in the ejected position so that I could later
know exactly which tape related to which monitor/area.

I normally take 3 print-outs from the computer for the attendance figures, 2 of which go to the
Secretary, Graham Mackrell, and the third will normally to the Ticket Office staff. However
on this occasion, since it was an FA Cup semi-final, all ticket, I did at first give the third print­
out to PC Guest at his request, since he said his superior officers might want it. Later however
Graham Mackrell said that he wanted to keep all 3 in his secure possession and I therefore
retrieved it from PC Guest.

At about 6.15/6.30 pm Graham Mackrell asked me to ensure the video room was properly
secured. Geoff Plane and PC Guest had left the ground at that time. I went to the CCTV
room, locked the cupboard doors where the VCRs were and then locked the room and activated
the alarm system for the room. I kept the key in my possession overnight. On locking the
cupboard doors where the VCRs were I do not recall specifically checking that all the tapes
were still in the machine but I do recall that as I finally left the ground at about 7.30 pm that
night, with my fiancee who works as a receptionist at the Club, I asked the Security Guard at
the players’ entrance to ensure that no-one entered the CCTV room overnight. He promised to
do so.

I returned to the ground at 9 am on the Sunday morning and checked the room where it was
still locked and the alarm operative. However when I opened up the room and checked the
VCRs I found that 2 tapes were missing. One of those was the tape relating to the camera
which looks over Gates 9 - 1 6 , and the other was from the VCR which had not been activated
at the time. I have no idea who removed the tapes - 1 mentioned it to the Security Officer,
Doug Lock, and he was surprised and had no knowledge of it.

I have read this Statement and it is correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Part 2   -    Roger Houldsworth. interview with *First Tuesday ’ (broadcast February 1990)

ROI/L 62
Interviewee - ROGER HOULDSWORTH (RH)


A police officer was present with M r Houldsworth and the interviewer.


RH:      From approximately quarter twelve, twelve o ’clock when we set the videos going and it
         was quite normal inflow of people right the way up to approximately about two fifteen
         although I didn’t really look at the time. Then we could see through looking, especially
         on this monitor which comes down from the police system, I’ve linked the video imputs
         down to here so that the policeman, Harold Guest and Wednesday’s own security man
         can see what the police are actually looking at. We put it on to camera one which is the
         West stand camera which overlooks the Leppings Lane end and you could see that the
         crowd was building up. This kept continuing up to about approximately two thirty, two
         thirty five where we could see that from that camera and also from the camera that is
         part of the Wednesdays own system, it overlooks turnstiles A to G and gate C, that it
         was a very, sort of abnormal build up. Really my brief, I am down here purely as a
         consultant in case anything goes wrong on the day. So apart from that I cannot say
         anything to the police or advise in any way, shape or form. So it was just a case that we
         watched it happening. At approximately twenty to three, somewhere round about that
         region, we did notice that gate C was open and an influx of people came through the
         gate. Eventually the police got that under control by putting a police horse across gate
         C to allow them to close it again.

IN T : Can I just interrupt you at that point and ask you, you say it was an abnormal build up,
       can you tell me what made you think it was abnormal. What you saw on the monitors?

RH:          Well what we saw on the monitors was the mass of humanity that was outside the gates
             and looking from the monitors themselves and from the imputs that were going through
             on the computer system that there was no relationship between the two. There was,
             there seemed to be less people as though they’d got only a small crowd outside coming
             through the turnstiles. So that led us to believe, or led me to believe, that the crowd
             outside were forcing so much pressure against the entrances to the turnstiles, instead of
             being like an orderly queue you don’t look for the type of problem that obviously did
             occur, but you could see that there was a problem. Now what the cause of that problem
             was I honestly didn’t know but I had my own thoughts that too many people had come
             too late as opposed to last seasons gate, which I was also in attendance in the same
             position here, it was a more steady flow from an earlier hour.

IN T : Did you talk with the policeman who was in here with you and what was the
       conversation that you had with him. Was he aware of the problem?
RE:   The policeman was aware of the problem but again I don’t think really either myself, the
      policeman or Mr Lock sort of took any cognisense (sic) of what was happening outside.
      You could hear the police radios and they were breaking down. For what reason that
      was I do not know. Because it seemed to be as if there was an awful amount of static on
      the police radio.

TNT: OK so let me ask you then Roger. Not talking about the very early part of the day but
     from when the crowds really started to build up. If you can tell us what you saw on
     your screen when you saw the crowds building.

RH:   Well what I saw on the screens from both the camera on A to G and from the police
      monitor that the others. A large build up of people outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles
      which sent (sic) very abnormal, we came to the realisation that a lot of people had
      arrived late and they were all trying to get into the ground obviously before the kick off
      at three o ’clock. The crowd outside bore no sort of relationship to the people who were
      actually going through the turnstiles as I say which led me to believe that there was a
      build up which would not allow the normal flow through. At about twenty to three,
      somewhere in that region, gate C was opened, at the time we didn’t know why it was
      opened, just that it was opened. A large amount of people came in to the ground from
      gate C which relieved the pressure a little bit on the people outside. Eventually the
      police got control of that situation by putting a police horse across the gate and they
      managed to close it. It continued the same as it had before up to about I would say ten
      to, five to three when we heard that gate C was asked to be opened by the police, the
      command was given for gate C to be opened. It was opened and the flow of people
      came through. It came through first fairly steadily. It built up to a surge, died of for a
      short while and then it built up again and it built up then and it was at the point then that
      I left the room to go down to the entrance, to the players entrance, just to see exactly
      what was happening in the central pens.

IN T : Why did you do that?

RH:   Because again from the police system we could see that there was a ... and from the
      computer system we could see how many that were supposedly to be allowed in that end
      of the ground and we knew that we were getting somewhere near the limits that
      obviously the computer system then was virtually useless. Because I could not count the
      people on the computer system coming through gate C.

IN T : So effectively this whole system had been bypassed by the opening of the gate.

R H : By the opening of the gate the system had been bypassed. As far as accounting is
      concerned and keeping account of crowd control from that point of view.

IN T : At what stage. I mean can you sort of describe what you saw on that monitor when gate
       C opened, by sort of referring to the monitor, like I was sat, I looked at the monitor ...?

RH:   I looked at the monitor and as I say we heard the command at gate C, open the gate and
       the gate was to be open. Gate C was opened. When it was open a huge surge went
       through and that eventually tailed off to a steady flow for a minute or so. After that the
       surge surged again and a whole load of people came through. I mean we could see from

                                                7
       the monitors that they were coming down right from the top end of Leppings Lane and
       they were bypassing the turnstiles and coming straight through gate C and I could see
       from the way that they were heading from, cos’ I know the bearing, of the relationship
       of the cameras to the layout of the ground, that the majority of people were heading
       towards the central pens.

TNT: What did you say to the policeman who was with you?

RH:    I didn’t really in all honesty say anything because he was trying to get through himself
       to the police control box as the police radios were not working properly and the land,
       we have a landline here which is through Wednesdays internal telephone system and that
       was blocked as well.

TNT: So effectively you were isolated?

RH:    At that point in time yes.

IN T : Can I ask you finally what you saw when you went outside and looked at the pens for
       yourself.

PO LICE OFFTCER:              Hang on is this in your statement?

RH:    No this is not in my statement.

P O IJC E O FFIC E R :        He can only talk about what is in his statement
APPENDIX 3

Part 3 - Comments by Roger Holdsworth on the evidence about the video cameras


25 November 1996


‘I went to the club at about 8.00am because I ’d been asked by Graham Mackrell to give the
cameras a final check. W e’d had a problem with the camera on the scoreboard.

I switched on all the cameras at the police control box, and checked the irises were working
properly, monitors and VCRs were OK. It would have taken about three quarters of an hour.’

The ‘faulty’ camera

‘There had been a flaring problems with the camera on the scoreboard - an electrical fault when
the scoreboard came into use. It wasn’t a problem with the quality of the picture. I had been
there all day the day before to sort it out. On the day of the disaster itself I phase-locked the
camera, which cured the problem, and to save any more potential problems, I disconnected the
earth to the camera which suppressed the electrical supply. By the time I had finished the
check, everything was working OK.

Graham Mackrell came and talked to me when I was up the ladder and I said it was all working
properly.

Mick Ryan also came in when I was checking them. I would have shown Ryan and Goddard
that they were working when I had finished.’

Evidence given by police re cameras:

 PC Mick Ryan (in charge o f phones and public address system in control box) says camera 5
faulty

Mick Ryan says in his evidence to Taylor p 52E re camera 5 ‘there was an apparent fault on the
camera to the West stand., the one that is mounted on the electronic scoreboard’.

He also specifically describes this camera at 53E to say ‘It is principally directed towards the
West stand terraces’.

He goes on on p53A to say ‘the picture was very distorted’. He says that he contacted Roger
Holdsworth himself about it, and Holdsworth ‘was there working on it for some considerable
time’.

He then says ‘The picture was never satisfactory as far as I recall... It was not as clear as you
would hope the picture to be... It was the quality of the picture which was the problem’.

RH: The quality o f the picture was never a problem - and fixed the flaring problem by
disconnecting the earth that morning.
                                               9
Set Mick Goddard (in charge or radios in the control box)

1) Couldn ’t see pens 3 and 4 fu ll

Goddard says in his evidence to Taylor p95B that it wasn’t possible to tell that the pens were
full from the control box.

He says that at no stage before he saw people climbing over the pens did he notice any
overcrowding in pens 3 and 4.

‘3 and 4 were getting full, were full. From my vantage point, they were not overcrowded’.

RH: 7 was able to see what the police could see on their monitors, and he specifically
members checking to see the state o f pens 3 and 4 when the order was given to open the gates.
I could see very clearly that the pens were fu ll to the point o f overcrowding’.

2) ‘Blind spot’ made it difficult to see crushing

Goddard also talks on p96 about a ‘blind spot’, down at the front by the fencing, obstructing
the first two rows of the terracing.

“Even though your view is obstructed, basically you see figures, although... you would not be
able to pick them out individually’.

RH: ‘This evidence does not make any sense to me, based on my knowledge o f the control box. ’

PC Bichard (in charge o f cameras and videos)

1) Camera 5 faulty

In his evidence to the Taylor Inquiry (June 12th), P43 Trevor Bichard claims, like Mick Ryan,
that there was a problem with the scoreboard camera which overlooked the terraces. He says
that ‘for a number of weeks we had been having difficulty with the camera, and they had been
looking into having the camera replaced or improvements made., when the system had been
switched on, the picture would go white - you would lose what you could actually see., we
seem to think it may be a problem with the electrical supply to the camera. On that particular
day, it was not up to the mark, but it was a lot better than it had been. We were getting
pictures, that is the best way of describing it’.

At the Inquest, P80, Bichard admits that camera 5 was trained on the Leppings Lane end, but
says that the camera ‘had been faulty and in fact you saw some of the problems that occurred.
You were getting what is called flare. It is reflection of light on coloured objects and you lose
the picture. The camera was not being used as much as it normally would be because of the
substandard picture.’
Inquest P89B Bichard says that from 2.05 onwards there was only one camera trained on
Leppings Lane, which solicitor Mr Manning summarises as being ‘a small screen and not a
very easy picture to distinguish and differentiate’.

At the Inquest, P93A, Bichard again describes the camera as ‘inadequate’.

RH: ‘Bichard gives an accurate description o f what the problem had been, but I disagree that
 ‘it was not up to the m ark’. As fa r as I was concerned, the camera was working perfectly after
I had fixed it that morning. ’

2) No close ups available with camera 5

At the Inquest P92D Bichard says that it is not possible to get what he would call a ‘close up’
view of the centre pens from any of the cameras. He is defining ‘close up’ as no more than 6
or 7 heads and shoulders on the picture.

Inquest p96D/E/F, Bichard agrees with the comment that it is not possible to zoom in so that
one can clearly identify a given individual if one wishes to do so. He also denies that you can
zoom in and see clearly facial features with the camera.

RH: ‘With camera 5, you wouldn’t get 6 heads at the fa r end o f the ground, but you would get
them in the central pens.

It is possible to pick out facial features with the camera. [This is borne out by the evidence o f
 the families and lawyers who went to the ground]. It would be more difficult to pick out facial
features while events are happening, but this is not the specific question that Bichard was
 asked. ’

3) Camera 5 was not only fault, it gave a distorted view o f the terraces

Bichard describes the close up that is available of the pens from this particular camera (5). He
says to Taylor P43E.

‘A close up is available to move into those centre two pens. However, because of the position
and the angle, it does give you a false impression about the crowd that is in there. It is quite
low down and it is set at 90 degrees to the pens rather than looking face o n... The picture it
creates is a bit of an illusion about the crowd that is in there. You may be looking at somebody
who is stood in the far comer of pen 3, and it may give you the impression that in fact he is
stood at the far corner of pen 4. It is because of the angle of the camera.... The physical
position it is in is difficult to assess that the pens would be getting overcrowded’.

RH: ‘This explanation does not make any sense at all. You cannot get optical effects with
 crowd density. Even looking at an angle you ’ve got reference points. You’ve got a perceptive
 depth which would give you an indication o f density. I had focused each o f the lenses along the
focal plane, so they were virtually in focus all o f the time. A CCTV camera doesn’t auto-focus,
 would also disagree that it was difficult to assess that the pens were getting overcrowded from
 that camera ’.

 4) Colour camera (camera 2) does not provide a very close picture o f the terraces
Taylor P44D Bichard says of the colour camera that ‘although it does provide a better angled
view of the terraces it does not provide as close a picture as the one mounted on LL itself. ’

Taylor P63D, Bichard says that the zoom facility of the colour camera was not good enough to
see whether or not people were being crushed against the perimeter fencing in pens 3 and 4.

Bichard admits that it enables you to see the fence, but not to get a close up of the people at the
fence.

‘We must define what you mean by a ‘close up’. It is closer than it is closer that in its extreme,
yes, but it is not a close up of an individual. You would probably only get 30 or 40 heads and
shoulders at best on this picture’.

At the Inquest, P77B Bichard says of the colour camera ‘If you were to take pictures of people
below the camera in the uncovered seating area, you would get identification because they are
so close to the camera, but once you get to the end of the South Stand area, Leppings Lane, the
magnification available on that zoom was insufficient to create identification’.

(He admits, however, at 77F that it gave you a ‘reasonable view’ of pens 3 and 4).

RH: ‘The colour camera had the same magnification as the camera on the scoreboard. The
magnification was reasonable (1:10). After all, it was designed fo r identification purposes.
This evidence is contradictory and not altogether truthful. It depends where on Leppings Lane
you are talking about. The shots o f the very fa r side would obviously not be quite as detailed.
But the camera was designed to give a view o f the Leppings Lane end. You could certainly
identify individuals with it, and distinguish their clothing. A shot would give you 6 or 7 heads
and shoulders, depending on the crowd density ’.

5) Camera 1 provides large and general picture when zoom is on

P47E, Bichard describes the camera that could look down Leppings Lane (camera 1) ‘when you
are using your zoom facility the picture you are getting at the extreme is a rather large and
general one’.

RH: ‘That the camera had been replaced 6 months earlier, and was so good that he could pick
out a car number plate at the end o f Leppings Lane.

6 ) Why there is no video evidence from camera 2 before 3.00

At the Inquest 79C Bichard says ‘when the colour camera came into use, the tape had expired’.
Bichard also says that the colour camera was also trained on the Spion Kop, along with camera
3, and camera 2 was not retrained onto the terraces till after 3.00.

7) Why no video recording o f the terraces before 3.00

Taylor P51D, Bichard admits that there was a video going of the situation on the West terrace
from about 2.30, [yet no pictures from this camera were ever made available to the Inquiry or
the Inquest].
At the inquest, p80D, Bichard can offer no explanation of why there is no video material
available of from camera 5 before 3.02. He admits that it would have been recording before
then.

Taylor P69D Bichard claims that of the 2 VHS recordings that were made, one expired just
after 3.00 [this does not explain why there was no evidence available from this tape before
3.00]. He says (Taylor p69H) that it finished at 6 minutes past 3.

T h e other tape, somewhere between 2.30 and 3.00, the actual function of the tape, the mode of
operation, altered inadvertently. The assumption is that when the radio repair man came into
the control box, Mr Duckenfield actually came and stood to my right hand side, behind the
controls, and I would then move to the left hand corner and I have caught the video with my
knee - the actual operating button.

RH: ‘The buttons in the front o f the machines are tiny. They don’t stick out. It is highly
unlikely that he could have knocked it with his knee. More importantly, it is actually impossible
to flick a switch and go into time lapse mode if as Bichard claims at 69G, the machine is
already recording ’.

8) ‘Pictures shown to jury at inquest greatly enhanced’

At the inquest P73F, Bichard says that the video pictures shown to the jury of Leppings Lane
end of the ground were ‘greatly enhanced’. ‘What you must consider is that the screen we are
looking at is only 12 inches.. .(the tapes shown to the jury) gave a false impression about the
accuracy of the picture you were seeing’. He agrees with the coroner that the image seen by
the jury is ‘infinitely clearer’.

RH: ‘The screens in the control room were 14 inches, not 12. They are 5ft in front o f the
camera operator. The size o f the screen is in relation to the position o f the person watching it
in the control room. You get the same information as you would do if you showed the picture
on a larger screen, as they do in the court. It is irrelevant if the image is blown up. It is
simply not true that you get more information on the screen if the picture is enlarged’.

At the inquest p74D Bichard says that the pictures the court have seen (which he initially claims
that he did not recognise as his own) was running on a time lapse system, and was not running
at the same speed as they would have seen it on the camera.

[From p80A, we know that the pictures shown to the court were actually taken from camera 5,
the allegedly faulty camera, and showed the Leppings Lane terraces].

RH: ‘You only get the time and date imprinted on the recording if things are recorded at
normal speed. ’

9) Camera 3 not trained on Leppings Lane end

P77G Bichard says that Camera 3, the one with maximum zoom facilities, wasn’t trained onto
the Leppings Lane end because there had been an incident at the Kop end. He agrees on p78A
that the camera remained on that location - then goes onto contradict himself at 78D by saying
that it was retrained onto the Leppings Lane end, but it was not recorded.
    At 78B, Bichard says that this particular camera would not have been good enough to enable
    identification of individuals at the front of Leppings Lane terraces ‘it would give you an overall
    picture only’.

    RH: ‘This camera was extremely powerful - and had magnification facilities o f 1:500. It would
    have been able to give a very clear picture o f the Leppings Lane terraces ’.

    10) Why pictures from camera 3 did not become part o f the recording

    At 78D, Bichard says that the reason the pictures from Camera 3 when it was retrained on the
    Leppings Lane end did not become part of the recording was as follows.

    ‘The system operated whereby at 2.30 I should have replaced both tapes. Because of what was
    happening on Leppings Lane end I didn’t replace those tapes, and eventually I think it ran out
    just after 3.00. The camera was used, but it was not taping’.

    RH: ‘It is very unusual fo r them to have needed to replace both tapes at 2.30. It would suggest
    that they had been recording everything in real time since 11.30am.

Comments on amended South Yorkshire Police Statements




Chief Inspector Creaser

Mr Creaser’s original statement contained the following passage:

        ‘At approximately 12 noon I visited the Police Control Room and there spoke
       to Superintendent Murray. I asked him if he had any preference as to the
       manner in which the spectators should be allowed to fill the Leppings Lane
       terraces. I was informed that the filling o f the fenced pens would be allowed
       to take place in a natural fashion and that no control would be exercised by
       the Police on the supporters regarding which particular pen would be filled.
       This instruction was exactly in line with the instruction given the previous
       year, when Liverpool supporters had occupied the same parts o f the stadium.
       I only raised this question because I was aware that on previous occasions
       different methods had been used to accommodate spectators ’.

The solicitors advised -

       II feel that the comment about packing the pens on page 4 should either be
       expanded to include detail o f when (in his experience) this had been done, or
       the entire section dealing with this should be deleted’.

In the event the passage was deleted from Mr Creaser’s statement. The whole
question of whether supporters should be allowed to find their own level or pens
filled sequentially was an important one and considered at length by Lord Taylor.
He made findings critical of the policy of allowing supporters to find their own
level. In my opinion this passage is factual - it may have called for some
elaboration but it should not have been omitted.

But PS Goddard’s statement also refers to this conversation.    He says:

        ‘Inspector Creaser came into the Control Box and asked Superintendent
       Murray about the Leppings Lane terraces and it was stated by
       Superintendent Murray that the standing fans would fin d their own levels in
       the pens rather than trying to fill one pen at a time. ’

Although the solicitors suggested this might be reconsidered, it was left in.
PC 446 Groome

Apart from Mr Frost’s statement, this statement was more extensively altered than
any other:

       Deleted - ‘An officer o f Inspector Calvert’s experience o f policing would
       have been fa r better placed at the Leppings Lane end o f the ground’

      Deleted - ‘The control room seemed to have been hit by some sort o f
      paralysis ’

       Amended - ‘It was noticeable that the only supervisory officers above the
       rank o f Inspector on the pitch were Chief Inspectors Beal and Sumner and
       Superintendent Greenwood. Certain supervisory officers were conspicuous
       by their absence. It was utter chaos.' This was changed to ‘On the pitch
       were Chief Inspectors Beal and Sumner and Superintendent Greenwood’.
       The words in italics were deleted.

       Deleted - ‘Why, during the period 2.00 and 2.45 pm when the Leppings
       Lane end and the West Stand were not very full, except fo r the centre pen,
       was the kick-off not put back and the delay broadcast to the supporters
       outside. You cannot pass 30-40 thousand through the turnstiles at the
       Leppings Lane end in one hour. At 2 pm I would estimate that only 12,000
       were in the ground.

       Why was there a 10 per cent reduction in manpower from the previous semi­
      final in 1988. 80 more police officers at the Leppings Lane end could have
       made a difference, filtering fans at the Leppings Lane end. Approximately
       980 officers were used fo r the semi-final in 1988, 1,000fo r the semi-final in
       1987 and 1,200fo r the semi-final between Wolves and Spurs.

       The control room staff are not used to working in the pressure o f a control
       room. The staff fo r control room duties should be from weekly leave staff or
       mornings, as they are used to making decisions under pressure.

       ... The policing at Hillsborough has become complacent over the least (sic)
       2-3 years

       ... various officers working the track and in the ground had warned that
       things were starting to go wrong over this period, yet no action was taken.
       Manpower levels were steadily c u t ...

       The decision to replace Chief Superintendent Mole before the semi-final
       needs to come under some scrutiny. This man had many years experience o f
       policing big matches at Hillsborough.’.

Although these criticisms are trenchantly expressed they are all matters of opinion
and comment (the underlying factual matters are not necessarily correct). They
were all matters which were considered at length in Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, where
findings adverse to the police were made.


PC 115 Huckstepp

Omitted was:

        ‘The crush outside the ground could have been better controlled with more
       police officers and a better regulation o f the flow o f fans ... knowing the
       ground as I do and how the Leppings Lane end fills up it might possibly have
       been better to direct the fans coming in through the open gates into the flank
       areas. ’

This is a pure statement of opinion, but it might suggest that other methods of
filtering supporters had been used in the past. There seems to have been some
confusion in this case between the police and the solicitors. In a letter of 12 May
1989 the solicitors recommended removal of comment from a statement by a PC
‘Hickstep’. There was no such person, and the solicitors presumably meant PC
Huckstepp (whose handwritten statement was evidently processed in the South
Yorkshire Police typing pool on 7 May).

The unamended version of PC Huckstepp’s statement went to the West Midlands
Police and Lord Taylor’s Inquiry - they saw the passage in italics above and PC
Huckstepp was cross-examined on the point (Day 15, page 113).


PC 1669 Walpole

The original statement contained this passage:

        ‘By 2.55pm the central pen fo r standing at the Leppings Lane end appeared to
       be absolutely packed solid whilst the pen towards the Police Control was
       about half fu ll and the pen towards the North Stand was perhaps only one
       sixth full. For normal big games the standing fans at the Leppings Lane
       terrace have filled each pen slowly well before kick off. I did not hear any
       radio message for the entrance to the central pen to be closed o ff, despite this
       being packed solid. ’

In the amended version the last sentence (which I have emphasised) is omitted. It can
probably be regarded as comment; but it does carry with it the implication that in the
past the centre pens had been closed off, though I doubt whether this adds much to the
preceding sentence.

A number of comments at the end of the statement were in my view properly
excluded.
Inspector White

A somewhat similar point can be made in the case of an omission from this officer’s
original statement:

        ‘During the briefing no mention was made about the tunnel gates being used
       to control ingress o f the crowd. Although on rare occasions in the past I
       have used the gates nearest the concourses to control flow away from the
       tunnel around to the south pen. I did this only fo r a few moments merely as
       a psychological support to turn the fans round to the south pen. I would not
       use them fo r any length o f time as when they are in the closed position they
       would be an obstruction in an emergency evacuation situation as they would
       have to be opened against the crowd and also because this is the only
       ingress/egress fo r fans in the central pens to get to the snack bar and
       toilets. ’


PC 1842 Brookes

A similar point arises here.   The following passage was omitted:

       ‘Why were the sliding doors at the back o f the tunnel not closed at 2.45
       when those sections o f the ground were fu ll as at the Manchester United
       match this season. ’

This is comment, but contains factual material about what happened previously.
But PC Brookes’s reference to ‘sliding doors’ is unclear - the doors at the back of
the tunnel were hinged, not sliding, and could not safely be used when spectators
were in pens 3 and 4 because they might impede escape. But moveable barriers
had previously been used. It might have been better to seek clarification of this
part of PC Brookes’s statement rather than exclude it.


P C 2102 Eustis

Deleted is the following:

        7 remember that last year the crush behind the goal was immense and was
        appalled that people would stand being in amongst people so tightly packed.
        Whenever anything happened on the field fo r example the Liverpool goals
        last year the crowd in the pens below us at Leppings Lane ju st became a sea
        o f waves the crowd from behind pushing forward time and again to create
        waves o f people. I passed comment to fellow officers last year about how
        glad I was not to be in amongst the crowd. ’

This is a factual statement, although it seems to be at variance with other evidence,
including that of the supporters who had by the time PC Eustis’ statement came to
be considered (5 June 1989) already given evidence at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and
made no particular criticism of the condition in the pens in 1988. I think it might
have been better to invite PC Eustis to reconsider this passage rather than delete it.


PS Crawford

The solicitors suggested review of part of Sergeant Crawford’s statement, with the
result that the following was omitted -

        7 personalty thought we were very light on manpower at this end compared
        with previous years.

        I have worked this end o f the ground either outside the turnstiles, inside
        searching or in the West Stand fo r several years at Cup ties, FA Cup Semi-
        Finals and league matches with a lot more manpower. In fa ct I have seen
        more manpower at this end during league matches. Normally we have had
        a serial at the centre tunnel to direct fans to the North or South pens when
        the Centre pens had been filled. This was not the case at this match and
        several o f my serial remarked on this. ’

His personal feelings are irrelevant, and the numbers of police on duty are a matter
of record. But his past experience relating to the shutting of the centre pens is a
question of fact. It may be that the solicitors saw some confusion in this part of
his statement between what happened at League games as opposed to FA Cup semi­
finals. If so, it would have been better to ask him to clarify the point.


PC 2302 Powell

Referring to the position in Leppings Lane at 2.45 pm, the following passage is
omitted:

        ‘The first thing I said was, “Where are all the bobbies, there’s hardly
       anybody there”. I saw numerous people climbing over the tops o f the
       turnstiles and the few Police Officers that I saw appeared to be doing
       nothing about it. My main observation at this point was the lack o f Police
       presence. I couldn’t understand how such a large crowd could have possibly
       gathered. I recall in previous games there was usually a large Police
       presence concentrated on this part o f the ground usually forming some sort
       o f cordon. ’

This passage contains material about PC Powell’s own feelings, which are
irrelevant. But the reference to the cordon is an assertion of fact, although the
statement is somewhat vague as to where it was. The question of a police cordon
(on Leppings Lane) was an important issue at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, over which
he criticised the police.
PC 2547 Ramsden

The solicitors advised the deletion of the following:

        7 also fe lt in relation to the entrance outside Leppings Lane end that there
       should have been some sort o f semi-sterile area. We, that is Rotherham
       officers, had this particular duty fo r the F.A. Cup Semi-Final in 1987 which
       was played between Leeds United and Coventry City.

       On this occasion we kept the crowds back outside the metal railings and gates
       to allow m yself and other officers to carry out searches etc. Also there seemed
       to be a general lack o f information coming from within the ground from
       ground control via the radio or the public address system, either giving
       information to us, or information and requests etc., to the crowd. ’

This is another statement in which comment (the first sentence) and fact are
intertwined. In fact only the first two sentences were deleted.

The result was that the previous occasion was not identified, although the substance of
what happened was retained. The point is perhaps a minor one since anyone reading
the statement would ask - what omission is referred to? Comments at the end of the
statement were in my view properly excluded.
APPENDIX 8 - correspondence about amendments to statements


                          THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - UP-DATE II

TO:    Officers of the South Yorkshire Police submitting evidence to the West
       Midlands Police in connection with the Public Inquiry into the disaster at
       Hillsborough Stadium

Hammond Studdards, Solicitors, are acting on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police in the preparation
and presentation of evidence to be submitted to the Inquiry.

As part of this process the firm initially requested that all officers directly concerned should, as soon
as possible, prepare a note of their recollections, in the form of a statement including matters of
comment and impression, whether or not this amounted to evidence.

These accounts are of immense value to our Counsel.

Subsequently, the South Yorkshire Police were advised by the West Midlands Police that it would be
appreciated if South Yorkshire Police officers, who were at Hillsborough, could effectively prepare
their own factual statements for submission to the Inquiry. This was agreed and the obvious way of
proceeding was to look at the statements which had been initially prepared at our request, on the
basis that if matters of hearsay and comment could be removed, these would be suitable as the factual
statements requested by the West Midlands Police.

Some officers have expressed concern about alterations being made to their original statements prior
to submission to the West Midlands Police.

What must be kept in mind is that the statements for submission to our own Counsel were intended
to have an entirely different purpose to those submitted to the West Midlands Police.

The initial reports submitted contained a mixture of fact, conjecture and opinion. In editing them for
use as a factual statement by the Inquiry it has been necessary for the solicitors to remove conjecture
and opinion and to leave only matters of fact.

All statements which are submitted to the Inquiry may be taken into account in reaching conclusions,
whether or not the officer making the statement is called as a witness. It follows that the statements
must contain only direct factual observations, as opposed to matters of impression.

No amended statement will be submitted to the West Midlands Police until it has been seen,
approved and signed by the officer making it.

                         SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

       Thank you for your letter of today’s date, which we have already discussed.

        The main difference between the initial and final versions of the South Yorkshire Police
Officers’ statements is that any expressions of opinion were (as I understand it, on the advice of
Mr Woodward) removed from the final version. As I understand it, Andrew Collins’ view is that
there is absolutely no reason for excluding such expressions of opinion when they touch on matters
relevant to the Public Inquiry and that, in the circumstances, there is no objection in principle to
written statements containing such opinions being submitted to the Inquiry.

         Clearly, in view of the personal undertaking which you have given to the Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire, Andrew Collins agrees that it would not be appropriate to use the original statement
for the purposes of the Inquiry when this has been superseded by a subsequent statement. However,
what I understand may have happened in the case of the Officer who gave his evidence yesterday is
that the original unamended statement was circulated because of the need to circulate statements to
all parties as much in advance of the calling of the relevant witnesses as possible and because at the
time of circulation of the relevant batch of witness statements the revised, final version of the
statement in question had not yet been received. I understand that in total there are three cases where
this has been necessary: P.C.s Best, Huckstepp and Illingworth. However, in such cases only the
final, revised version of the statement was given to the press.

        I trust that this problem will not recur in the future.

        I have not copied this letter to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, but am
naturally happy for you to do so.



                                               D. Brummell
APPENDIX 9


I deal in this Appendix with a number of questions that have been put to me by the
families of particular victims about the exact circumstances in which their relatives
came to die and with difficulties which they have told me exist with the police
documentation.


The individual cases which I discuss are those of


               James Aspinall
               Paul Carlile
               Gary Church
               Ian Glover
               Philip Hammond
               Sarah Hicks
               Victoria Hicks
               Richard Jones
               Michael Kelly
               Graham Roberts
               Andrew Sefton
               Christopher Traynor
               Kevin Traynor
               Kevin Williams
James Aspinall


At the mini inquest on 19 April 1990, Detective Sergeant Killoch said when
summarising the evidence about the death of James Aspinall that:

       “Sometime after the crushing had occurred in the West Stand terracing, James
       was removed from the enclosure, placed onto the pitch and taken to the
       gymnasium. It has not been possible to identify the persons involved in these
       actions

There is however a statement on the body file for James Aspinall from Detective
Constable Fox which Mr Fox identifies himself with James in a photograph (MW 1/2)
and says that he tried, without success, to resuscitate him. This statement is dated 25
March 1990. An addendum to the summary on James’s body file refers to DC Fox’s
statement, though there is no date indicating when this addendum was made.

Mr and Mrs Aspinall asked me why DC Fox’s evidence was not mentioned at the
mini-inquest. I asked Dr Popper about this. He could not offer an explanation but
there can in my view be no conceivable reason for anybody to suppress this statement
deliberately. Inspector Layton, who was in charge of the visual identification from
photographic material, gave evidence at the mini-inquest and referred to the
photograph MW 1/2. But he did not take the statement from DC Fox.

I think the most likely explanation is that there was some delay in adding DC Fox’s
statement to the body file, so that when Detective Sergeant Killoch and Inspector
Layton examined it for the purpose of giving evidence it was not then available. If
so, that would clearly have been an unfortunate error. But it does not affect the
verdict of the Inquest.
Paul Carlile

At my interview with her Mrs Stringer said she was convinced that there was
photographic evidence that showed her son Paul Carlile outside the ground and in the
vicinity of Gate C at 14.54 and 14.55, but also inside the ground, on the terraces, at
the earlier time of 14.49.

Inspector Layton gave evidence at the mini-inquest held on 3 May 1990 that Paul
Carlile had been identified by his two sisters on the photographs taken outside the
ground at 14.54 and 14.55. These photographs are of good quality. Mrs Stringer told
me that she had recently come into possession of a video still, apparently from a BBC
video, timed at 14.49 showing Paul on the terrace. She said she could identify him.

Quite clearly both identifications cannot be right. There is another video still of the
terraces timed at 14.58, and again Mrs Stringer said she could identify her son in it.
While it is not impossible that he could be outside at 14.55 and inside at 14.58 it
seems unlikely. The quality of the video stills is in my view very poor and that at
14.49 shows less than half of the person’s face.

I have not been able to draw any definite conclusions and am not sure that it would
now be possible to do so. However, the photographs which show Paul outside the
ground at 14.54 and 14.55 are far clearer than the two video stills of the terraces at
14.49 and 14.58. In my view the West Midlands Police and the Coroner cannot be
criticised for accepting the identification made by Paul Carlile’s sisters.

The other area of concern that Mrs Stringer has is about the evidence of Mr
Hollinghurst, an off duty nurse. There is a passage in a statement by Mr Hollinghurst
dated 15 May 1989 which suggests that when he first saw Paul Carlile he was alive,
but on the ground in the crush. Mr Hollinghurst was aware of a hand grabbing at his
leg. Very sadly, when Mr Hollinghurst got an opportunity some time later to attempt
to resuscitate Paul, he was dead.

Mrs Stringer’s concern was that this was not mentioned at the mini-inquest on Paul
Carlile or when Mr Hollinghurst later gave evidence on Day 26 of the Inquest. But
this aspect of Paul Carlile’s case was considered in full by the Divisional Court.
There is certainly no new evidence in relation to it.
Gary Church

At their meeting with me Mr and Mrs Church complained that PC Webster and PC
Hays claimed in the statements to have done too much on the day of the disaster, and
could not have been in the ground at 3 o’clock as they claimed. As I understand it
their argument is that these two officers could not have been involved with Gary
Church at 3.25.

There is no evidence that PC Hays was involved with Gary at all and he never said
that he was.

PC Webster made a statement which is undated but evidently made soon after the
event. He said he was on duty on the day of the disaster on a mobile patrol which
included PC Hays. Shortly after 15.00 they were in Penistone Road North area when
they received a radio message that there was crowd disturbance at the ground. On
arrival at the pitch he went to the West Terraces and tried to help. After the gate from
pen 3 onto the pitch was opened he formed part of the chain of police recovering
bodies.

He describes one youth whom he helped to resuscitate (not Gary Church), apparently
successfully. In a statement dated the 12th October 1989 he identified himself on
BBC film between 15.25 and 15.27 carrying a young lad, who he identified from
other photographic evidence as Gary Church. He placed him on the pitch and tried to
resuscitate him, unsuccessfully.

Another police officer, PC Haigh, also attempted with this resuscitation.

I cannot see that there is any valid criticism of this evidence.
Ian Glover

The police originally had on the body file a statement dated 7 July 1989 made by PC
Fojut, in which he purported to identify a person whom he had helped to carry across
the pitch to the gymnasium as Ian Glover. The identification was based on a
recognition of clothing shown to the officer in a photograph.

There are a number of inconsistencies between this statement and that of Joseph
Glover, Ian’s brother, who saw him brought onto the pitch from pen 3, and helped to
take him across the pitch. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that at the mini­
inquest Joseph Glover was asked if any police officer had helped to carry his brother
across the pitch to the gymnasium. He said that they had not.

In the result, PC Fojut’s evidence was not included in the inquest summary of
evidence of Ian Glover’s case because it was appreciated that his identification must
have been mistaken. This matter was fully explained at the mini-inquest. In my view
it is clear that PC Fojut had mistakenly identified the person he helped with as Ian
Glover.

Mr and Mrs Glover told me at my meeting with them that they were still confused
about this. It is of course unfortunate that PC Fojut misidentified the person he was
dealing with as Ian Glover, but I do not consider there is now any room for doubt that
Joseph Glover was right and PC Fojut was mistaken.
Philip Ham mond

Counsel for the Family Support group submitted to me that Dr Walker’s evidence
was of critical importance in the case of Philip Hammond, and shows that evidence
given at the mini-inquest in his case was wrong (para 64 written submissions). I do
not accept this. At the mini-inquest P S Killock summarised the relevant part of the
evidence about Philip as follows (2 May 1990 p8 D-G):-

        “Shortly after 1505 hours, following the severe crushing in the West Stand
       terracing, Police Constable Stephen Taylor went into the tunnel leading to
       the West Stand terraces. A t the end o f the tunnel he saw a boy who he now
       knows to be Philip lying on the ground. The Officer, with assistance from
       Police Constable Andrew James Shiel, carried Philip and placed him in an
       ambulance which was in attendance at Leppings Lane.

       Attempted resuscitation was then carried out by Police Constable Taylor,
       Ambulance Officer Jane Mojfatt and Ambulance Officer Alan Smith. The
       ambulance was then driven to the Northern General Hospital by Police
       Constable Shiel and during that journey the Police Constable and the
       ambulance crew continued attempted resuscitation.

       Upon arrival at the hospital Philip was taken into the Casualty Department
       where further treatment was carried out by a doctor who unfortunately has
       not been identified, sir. After some twenty minutes the doctor stated he
       could not detect any pulse or signs o f life and Constable Taylor took Philip
       into the plaster room which was being used as a temporary mortuary at the
       hospital.

       D r Janet Rosemary Doore shortly afterwards examined Philip in the plaster
       room and certified life extinct”.

In answer to the Coroner Sergeant Killock gave further details of Philip’s case,
including the fact the doctor tried for twenty minutes to revive him. The
unidentified doctor was Dr Walker. The hospital record of Philip Hammond has no
relevant information on it and it was not appreciated at that time that he was the
second patient referred to in Dr Walker’s statement of 20 July 1989.

Dr Slater, who was the pathologist in this case gave evidence. He said that his
autopsy of Philip showed signs of medical intervention in that three ECG electrodes
were positioned on his body (inquest, page 3F). In answer to a leading question
from Mr Fraser, who appeared for the family, he said (page 5E):

        “Q. D r Slater, correct me if I am wrong, but I think by the time Philip had
       got to hospital he was dead? - A. Yes, I shouldn’t be surprised in my
       profession. I was somewhat surprised that Philip was taken to the Northern
       General Hospital because my autopsy finding was such that I would have
       thought he would have died extremely quickly and become unconscious
       instantaneously at Hillsborough. I have asked the Officers involved with this
       and I understand Philip was not seen by a doctor at Hillsborough. I think
       this explains that only essentially lay people saw him and, in my opinion,
       Philip would have been brain dead at Hillsborough ”.

Having heard the evidence summarised by P S Killock Dr Slater was recalled and
asked about it. He accepted that it was theoretically possible for the heart of
someone in cardiac arrest to be restarted. But he thought that a lay person, namely
a policeman might be mistaken in detecting a pulse. Mr Wardrope, Accident and
Emergency Consultant at the Northern General, also gave evidence in relation to
Philip Hammond. He said (page 23C):

       “In the initial part o f the incident I was sending people who came in with a
       cardiac arrest, patients undergoing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and
       external cardiac massage, I sent them to the resuscitation room initially to
       see whether they could have a chance o f being brought round, to start the
       heart going. The fa ct that the only post mortem evidence were three ECG
       electrodes, I think possibly he was sent to the resuscitation room but the
       ECG showed no cardiac activity, and because o f the great pressure on the
       resuscitation beds at that time he would be sent to the mortuary ”.

Mr Wardrope also said that if someone underwent a resuscitation attempt he would
not have been triaged dead. (P26B). What Dr Walker’s evidence does is to
confirm that Philip was not dead on arrival, but he died very soon afterwards. This
would mean that Dr Slater’s opinion - which was in any event at variance with the
other evidence given at the mini-inquest - was wrong to that extent.

I entirely understand that it is important to Philip’s family that he died somewhat
later than Dr Slater thought. But it is not something that can impugn the inquest
verdict of accidental death. Nor does it support the conclusion that Dr Slater’s
opinion in other cases was wrong.

In written submissions to me dated 3 December 1997 Mr Hammond, Philip’s
father, claims that Mr Fraser, the solicitor acting for the Hillsborough Steering
Committee was not acting for all the families, including the Hammonds, when
arrangements were made in respect of the mini-inquests. He also says that Mr
Fraser was being paid by Municipal Mutual Insurance (MMI), insurers for the
South Yorkshire Police, the implication being that he did not properly represent the
families.

These claims are based on a misunderstanding. It is clear from Mr Fraser’s letter
of the 9 March 1990 addressed to the firms of solicitors acting directly for the
families (in the Hammonds’ case Bartlett & Son) that Mr Fraser would be acting on
an agency basis for these solicitors at the mini-inquests unless the client wished
otherwise, in which case they could appear in person or through their own
solicitors.

So far as MMI paying his costs are concerned, it is quite clear that Mr Fraser was
not retained by MMI and there was no conflict of interest. In fatal cases where
civil liability is established, it is perfectly proper for the dependants to recover, as
part costs in the action, reasonable expense of legal representation at the Inquest. In
my view what MMI accepted in this case was that the attendance of Mr Fraser,
whether as directly representing a client or as agent for other solicitors representing
the families, could be regarded as a reasonable expense for this purpose. To that
very limited extent they were meeting his costs, but he was not retained by them
and was in no way acting on their behalf or under their instruction.
Victoria and Sarah Hicks

Mr and Mrs Hicks had the terrible misfortune of losing their two daughters Sarah and
Victoria.

Victoria

When I met Mr and Mrs Hicks in Liverpool in October their main concerns in respect
of Victoria related to the evidence of Paul Taylor and that of PC Marshall. I have
dealt with Paul Taylor’s evidence in Chapter 4. In a submission which I received on
8 January 1998 Mr Hicks disputes the part which PC Marshall says that he played in
recovering Victoria from pen 3, taking her to the ambulance and accompanying her to
the hospital.

Mr Hicks says that he has no recollection of the presence of any police officer other
than PC McGuinness assisting with Victoria. He believes that PC Marshall’s
evidence is untrue and that he played no part in assisting with Victoria.

A number of witnesses in addition to Mr Hicks himself helped with Victoria.

PC McGuinness made three statements. The first is undated. He said:

        “Eventually I made my way back through the West Stand and onto the pitch,
        assisting officers to carry another girl onto the pitch. Whilst fire and Police
        Officers attempted to assist her I ran to the gymnasium where I collected an
        oxygen cylinder and mask.

       I brought this to the girl and attempted to resuscitate her. Together with the
       girls father Mr Hicks we put the girl ‘Vicky ’ into an ambulance and travelled
       to the Northern General Hospital. Mouth to Mouth was administered
       throughout the journey to the hospital and then on arrival the hospital
       medical staff took over. After assisting a doctor at the hospital I was told that
       Vicky was dead. ”

PC McGuiness’s second statement is dated 8 May 1989. It is much to the same effect
but he says that he performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on Victoria in the
ambulance.

His third statement is dated 6 July 1989. It is concerned with visual identification
from photographic material. He identifies himself at 15.38 running towards the
ambulance with the oxygen bottle.

Two things should be noted about PC McGuinness’s evidence. The first is that there
is no mention of a second police officer in the ambulance, but neither is there any
reference to ambulance man Tony Edwards, the nurse or anybody else other than Mr
Hicks who was on the scene or travelled in the ambulance. Secondly, he does not say
that Victoria was passed over the radial fence into pen 2.
Paul Winston Turner was a spectator in pen 3. He made two statements. In the first
dated 31.5.89 he said that he assisted in taking bodies from police officers through the
perimeter gate to pen 3. He said:

        “We then returned to the gate and the same four officers met us with a young
         woman. I don ’t know where they had collected her body from. Me and the
         dark haired lad had an arm each to carry her and one Police Officer had
       both her legs. We carried her passed the 2 men we had already taken onto
       the pitch and we laid her perhaps 8 or 10 yards (8 or 10 yds) further into the
       playing area from the touch line. ’’

In a statement dated 16 November 1989 he identified the girl as Victoria Hicks from
photographic evidence.

PC Marshall made a statement dated 10 July 1989. He said:

        “After moving numerous bodies I helped an officer lift a young girl out o f
        the pile o f bodies. We walked to the fence with her and I jum ped onto the
        perimeter, carrying her in my arms towards an ambulance.

        After leaving her on the grass fo r a short while a further officer approached
        me holding an oxygen bottle, he said, Come on do you know first aid... we
        can save this one I carried the girl to the rear o f an open ambulance placing
        her along the seats. Almost immediately two others were placed in the van,
        one a youth being put on its floor. The ambulance then shut its doors and we
        set o ff at speed to the N. G.H.

         Throughout the journey we attempted to revive the girl using chest and heart
         massage, the mask o f the oxygen being placed intermittently over her mouth
         as we tried to pump air into her body. The girl was Victoria Hicks. Her
        father was trying mouth to mouth after I had cleared the vomit from her
         mouth. The second girl in the ambulance was I believed her older sister.

        Upon arrival at the N. G.H. I carried the body o f the girl into the hospital and
        placed her on a wooden bench, the only free furniture in turn I then carried
        the youth, my strength seemed that o f ten, the hospital was in chaos with
        bodies everywhere and medical sta ff running about. ”

He said that Mr Hicks had been abusive to him in the hospital.

 Fireman Peter Mulcrome also assisted with Victoria. In his first statement he
wrongly described her as having blonde hair, but he later corrected this on being
shown photographs. His reference to blonde hair was obviously a mistake.

Tony Edwards was the ambulance man concerned. I have discussed his evidence at
length in the main body of my report. He says that there were three bodies in the
ambulance, a nurse, two police officers, two spectators (one of whom was Mr Hicks)
and himself. He treated Victoria and showed how to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
while the spectator did cardiac massage. He remembers nothing of the journey.

In his very detailed comments which reached me on 8 January 1998 Mr Hicks makes
a number of criticisms of PC Marshall’s evidence, and for that matter PC
McGuinness’s evidence as well. Although PC Marshall may be inaccurate in matters
of detail, I can see no reason to doubt that he assisted in recovering Victoria from pen
3, putting her in the ambulance and travelling with her in the ambulance. There were
obvious omissions from PC McGuinness’s statements, but there is nothing otherwise
inconsistent between them. Mr Edwards’s statement confirms the presence of a
second police officer in the ambulance.

The evidence of PC Marshall was accurately summarised in the summary of the
evidence on the body file for Victoria Hicks, and a copy of this was sent to Mr Hicks
before the mini-inquests. No point was raised in relation to PC Marshall’s
participation. I find it entirely understandable that in the terrible circumstances in
which he found himself Mr Hicks, whose concentration must have been almost
entirely on Victoria and Sarah, did not take in what others around him were doing.

Mr Hicks, in his latest submission, says that the reason why he did not question what
was said in the summary about PC Marshall’s participation is because he was
beginning to doubt his own memory and that he was still in a state of deep shock.
Had the matter been raised at the time, it is possible that some of the minor
discrepancies which exist, such as PC McGuinness’s omission to mention others in
the ambulance, and who exactly performed resuscitation on Victoria, might have been
capable of resolution. I do not consider that it will be possible to resolve these matters
now and I have not thought it right to delay submission of my report in an effort to do
so.

In his latest submissions to me Mr Hicks raises a very large number of points of detail
relating to the contents of, or omissions from, the body file relating to Victoria. It is
not possible for me to deal with all these extremely detailed questions. None of them,
singularly or cumulatively, could affect the verdict of accidental death, and neither do
they affect the question of where and when Victoria died. They do not justify the
suggestion that there has been some deliberate concealment or suppression of
evidence. For reasons I have already explained, it is only to be expected that there
will be differences of recollection among witnesses.

But I will nevertheless try to deal with some of these points.

Omission o f statements from Victoria’s body file

Mr Hicks complains that the following statements by PC Stephen Taylor, PC Andrew
Sheil, Iain Boileau, Neville Udall and James Wardrope were wrongly omitted from
the file.

PC Stephen Taylor refers in an undated statement to meeting a Liverpool supporter
at the Northern General Hospital who said that two of his daughters had been killed.
He goes on to describe what happened. Mr Hicks says this must be a reference to
himself although he is not identified as such. He disputes some of the detail, but it is
not clear whether he accepts that he had an encounter with a police officer on the lines
described by PC Taylor. In a further statement dated 3 May 1989 PC Taylor makes
no reference to this incident.

PC Andrew Sheil made two statements, in one of which he refers to one of the 11
bodies which he saw in the mortuary at the Northern General Hospital as being
female. Again Mr Hicks says this must have been a reference to Victoria, although
she is not identified in the statement.

Iain Boileau was a spectator. He made two statements. In the second dated 9
January 1990, he speaks of helping to put a girl into an ambulance and says that her
father was present. From the context of the statement this appears to be a reference to
Victoria and he identifies Mr Hicks as the man, having subsequently seen him on
television.

Neville Udall was a mortuary technician who was involved with all the bodies in the
mortuary at the Northern General. He refers to one having been identified as Victoria.

James Wardrope, consultant at the Accident and Emergency Department at the
Northern General Hospital, made a statement referring to the resuscitative treatment
given to those who were taken to hospital, including Victoria.

Mr Wardrope gave oral evidence about this on Day 1 of the main inquest. But it
might have been preferable if the statements of PC Taylor, Iain Boileau and Neville
Udall had been on the Body file. However it is entirely understandable that a
conscious decision may have been taken to exclude them. The involvement of each
of these witnesses is entirely peripheral, and adds nothing of consequence to the
evidence of other witnesses. In my view, PC Sheil’s statement has no relevance.

Sarah

There was clear evidence of what happened to Sarah. She was removed from pen 3
and placed on the pitch. Attempts were made to resuscitate her by, amongst others,
Dr Flenley. These were unsuccessful and Dr Flenley said Sarah was dead. She was
taken to the gymnasium end on an improvised stretcher, where again attempts to
resuscitate her were made until a person who was unidentified, but believed to be
medically qualified, said she was dead. She was taken to the part of the gymnasium
where those who were believed to be dead were placed. Her death was confirmed by
Dr Bull at 16.20.

In his latest submissions, Mr Hicks has expressed his concern about two matters in
particular. The first is a statement by a Liverpool supporter, Tony Bambrock. He
made a statement to the police, dated 2 May 1989. He says that he was in pen 4 and
managed to make his escape onto the pitch and then assisted with the injured. Among
those he helped was a girl who he thought was about 22 years old. She was recovered
from pen 4 and laid on the pitch. He says he knew she was dead. He says that a man
came up and said he was her father. He then left the girl. He says he later found out
that the girl was only 19 and her name was Sarah Hicks.

Mr Hicks had a copy of the statement in December 1989 and sent it in February 1990
to Mr Fraser, who was both his personal solicitor and representing the Families as a
whole. It does not appear that any point was taken on it at the inquests. This is not
surprising. It is clear in my view that this is a case of misidentification. Sarah was
never in pen 4. Mr Barnbrock’s account is wholly inconsistent with that of all other
witnesses if it related to Sarah, which in my opinion it does not. There is no reason
why Mr Barnbrock’s statement should be on Sarah’s body file.

The second matter relates to the police video tape taken in the gymnasium (VRM 2).
A copy of this had been supplied by South Yorkshire Police to Yorkshire Television
at the same time as tapes TB1, 2, 3, and 4. Yorkshire Television allowed Mr Hicks to
view it and copy it. The relevant footage showed someone on the floor in that part of
the gymnasium set aside for recovery. The person concerned is surrounded by people,
mainly firemen, evidently trying to resuscitate him or her.

It is only possible to see the person’s body from the waist down. They are dressed in
light blue jeans with sharp turn-up of 1-2” and dark shoes. It is just possible to see a
white garment on the top part of the body. The footage lasts about one minute. It is
not timed but would appear to have been taken at some time between 15.50 and 16.20.

Mr and Mrs Hicks say that the body is that of a female, and they consider it is Sarah.
I have examined the tape carefully. The body may well be that of a young woman,
but I do not think one can be sure. The jeans are much lighter than those in the
photograph of Sarah’s clothes which is on the body file and the shoes do not appear to
me to be the same, though this is more difficult to tell. In my judgement it is not
possible to make a reliable identification from the video footage. It does not cast any
reasonable doubt on the very clear evidence to which I have already referred.

I have carefully considered Mr Hicks’ comments on the witnesses relating to Sarah. I
do not consider they justify any suggestion that evidence has been concealed,
suppressed or slanted in favour of South Yorkshire Police.
Richard Jones

At my interview with Mr and Mrs Jones about the death of their son Richard they said
that they were concerned that statements made by Mr Jones had apparently gone
astray and not been provided by the police when he asked for them. Mr Jones told
me that he made three statements to the police in the early hours of the Sunday
morning after the disaster (16 April). One of his statements identified Richard, one
identified Richard’s girlfriend Tracey Cox, who was with him and was also killed, and
the third was an overall statement. He said they hadn’t got the statement relating to
Tracey.

In the body file for Richard Jones there are three statements made by his father. The
first, dated 16 April 1989, deals with the identification of both Richard and Tracey.
The second and third dated 15 August and 23 November 1989 deal with identification
from photographic material. I think these would have been the only matters upon
which Mr Jones could or would be likely to give relevant evidence.

Mr Jones also told me he had doubts of the reliability of the evidence of PC Bromley.
PC Bromley was involved in the rescue operation. In a statement dated 3 May 1989
he said he saw a man lying unconscious on the pitch. Two supporters were attending
him, but he thought he was dead.

PC Bromley said that he assisted another person to the gymnasium and then returned
to the pitch. He saw a group of supporters carrying a body on an advertisement
hoarding -

       “The body on the hoarding was, I believe, the same body I had seen earlier on
       the pitch. All I can remember about the clothing on the body was that the man
       was wearing grey coloured trousers. ”

He said that, with another officer, they attempted resuscitation without success and
that he then accompanied the body to the gymnasium and stayed with it until Mr
Jones identified it as that of his son. Mr Jones said that Richard was in fact wearing
blue jeans and he therefore considered that PC Bromley cannot have been with
Richard’s body as he states.

There is a photograph of Richard’s clothing including his trousers on the body file.
The colour reproduction in the photograph may not be perfect but the trousers could
easily be described as grey, although I suspect they are much washed jeans. I do not
consider this is a sufficient basis for doubting PC Bromley’s evidence.
Michael Kelly

At her interview with me on 8th October 1997 Mrs Sinclair raised her concern over
the evidence of PC Maugham in relation to the death of her brother, Michael Kelly.

In a statement dated 15th February 1990 PC Maugham stated that he was approached
at the West End of the pitch (the Leppings Lane end) by two men carrying a person
who they said was their friend. They asked him to help. He saw that the man was
blue in the face and appeared not to be breathing. He attempted to resuscitate him.
After a while he started to breathe but kept slipping back into unconsciousness.

PC Maugham assisted in carrying this man to the other (Kop) end of the ground,
where he was handed to the care of a St John Ambulance man. He then went back to
the Leppings Lane end where he rendered further assistance. He later identified the
person he had helped to carry as Michael Kelly from photographic evidence, though
he was by no means certain.

PC Maugham’s evidence was accurately summarised at the mini-inquest by Inspector
Layton who also said that since that time PC Maugham had discussed the
identification with Michael Kelly’s sister and he was now satisfied that it was him.
At the family’s request PC Maugham was called to give evidence at the main inquest,
and he said that when he handed the person over to the St John Ambulance man he
was still breathing.

All this evidence was considered by the Divisional Court, because it was alleged to
them that Inspector Layton had misled the Court in his summary of PC Maugham’s
evidence. The Court rejected this.

The point that now troubles Mrs Sinclair appears to be that PC Maugham was
summoned away from Michael Kelly to form a cordon across the pitch instead of
attending to the dead and dying. This criticism seems to me unfair. PC Maugham
handed over the person he was carrying to qualified hands. He did not neglect the
people who were still in trouble at the West End of the ground. He said that he
rendered further assistance there until he was asked to help make a cordon.

I have examined the body file for Michael Kelly. It is clear that there is a marked
conflict between the evidence of PC Maugham, if he has correctly identified Michael
Kelly, and that of two other police officers, PC Wilmot and PC Lally.

Both PC Wilmot and PC Lally, in statements dated 3rd May 1989 and the 7th May
1989 respectively, describe finding a man lying unconscious on the pitch near the
goal. He was checked for signs of life and there were none. They took him on a
stretcher to the gymnasium where he was again checked for signs of life. At 15.59 Dr
Byrne certified death in PC Wilmot’s presence.

PC Wilmot remained with this person’s body, which was given the body number 72.
Evidence from other witnesses proves that the person was later identified as Michael
Kelly. It is true that there is a period of about 20 minutes between 15.40 and 15.59
during which PC Wilmot does not appear to have been with the body.

This evidence was summarised at the mini-inquest and the conflict with that of PC
Maugham must have been apparent. The St John Ambulance man referred to by PC
Maugham has not been identified and it is not known what happened to the person
whom PC Wilmot handed over to him.

It is impossible to resolve this conflict now and it is not in fact one which Mrs Sinclair
raised with me. It seems to me more likely that PC Maugham was mistaken in
thinking that the person whom the two men had brought to him at the Leppings Lane
end of the ground was Michael Kelly.
Graham Roberts


There are two problems in this case.

The first is an apparent conflict between the evidence of two police officers as to
when Graham Roberts died.

PC Yates described treating a man (later identified as Graham Roberts) lying on the
terrace about 15-20 feet from the tunnel entrance, partially concealing the body of a
youth. It appeared that he had been dragged there by supporters. He pulled the man
off and left him in the prone position. He said he appeared to be dead.

PC Best helped to carry a number of persons from the area near to and in the tunnel.
One of these he identified as Graham Roberts. He said that he carried him to an area
of the lane near the gates and as he put him on the ground he was breathing. Moments
later he returned with another body and saw that the man was dead.

Neither PC Yates nor PC Best gave oral evidence, and so far as I am aware there was
no request by Mr Fraser, solicitor for the Steering Committee representing the
families, that they should. But the conflict between their accounts was explored as
far as possible at the mini-inquest. It is not possible to resolve it now. In the light of
the pathologist’s evidence, it seems probable that PC Best was mistaken in believing
that Graham Roberts was breathing when he put him down.

The second conflict was between the statements of PC Sinclair and PC Wadsworth.

PC Sinclair stated that about 16.15 on the 15th April he went to the Leppings Lane
side of the stadium and was allocated a body. He stayed with the body while Dr
Ashton certified death at 16.25 hours and when it was taken to the gymnasium, until it
was identified at 01.50 hours on 16th April as that of Graham Roberts. This was the
evidence given at the mini-inquest.

PC Wadsworth said that he attended the Leppings Lane End and gave mouth-to-
mouth resuscitation to a casualty with the aid of a resuscitator. He did this for about
10 minutes whilst an ambulance man and another attendant fitted a drip to the man’s
arm. PC Wadsworth said that the man was put in an ambulance and that, before that
happened, he had a pulse.

In a subsequent statement he purported to identify this person from photographs as
Graham Roberts. This evidence was not referred to at the mini-inquest, and PC
Wadsworth’s statements do not appear on the body file.

It is quite plain in my judgement that PC Wadsworth was mistaken in his
identification. Graham Roberts was never taken to hospital. It is true that some
bodies were collected and taken by ambulance from the Gate C area at Leppings Lane
to the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium. But there is no evidence that this
happened to Graham Roberts. In view of the resuscitative treatment which the
person whom PC Wadsworth describes had received, and the evidence that he had a
pulse, it would have made no sense for an ambulance to have taken him to the
mortuary rather than to hospital.

The inconsistency between PC Sinclair and PC Wadsworth was one relied upon by
Counsel for the Family Support Group in their written submissions to me. When
however I pointed out that Graham Roberts had not been taken to hospital and
therefore it seemed that PC Wadsworth was mistaken, I understood Counsel to accept
this. I have had no further submissions from the legal representatives on this matter.
Andrew Sefton

I met Mr and Mrs Sefton, Andrew’s parents, in Liverpool together with their daughter
and son-in-law and Professor Scraton. Counsel for the Family Support Group also
discussed Andrew Sefton’s case in their written submission to me.

Both at my meeting with his family and in Counsel’s written submission to me it was
said that police officers had made inconsistent statements about Andrew Sefton. The
two officers concerned are PC Shipley and PC Kearney.

PC Shipley made two statements and I was told that these were inconsistent with each
other. In an undated statement, he said that only when he reached the Leppings Lane
goal area did he become aware that people were dead and dying around him. He tried
to calm and comfort people, and

       “At some stage I assisted in getting injured supporters onto hoardings fo r
       transportation towards any available medical facilities

PC Shipley then spoke in his statement about trouble between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest fans. He continued

       “after a short time I continued to assist the injured to reach medical facilities
       at the rear o f the Kop, in the new formed medical area, ie the gym area

In a further statement, dated 13th September 1989, PC Shipley said that he dealt with
several persons who were injured or dead but he could only identify one. That was
Andrew Sefton, whom he identified from photographs shown to him. He identified
himself as being involved, with other people, in carrying Andrew Sefton on a
hoarding. This photograph is timed at 15.30. He did not say that he had performed
any resuscitative measures.

At the mini-inquest on Andrew Sefton Inspector Sawers summarised the evidence of
Patrick Shannon, a Liverpool supporter who attempted to resuscitate him and later
carried him across the pitch with PC Shipley. Mr Shannon said that as he gave
Andrew Sefton mouth-to-mouth ventilation a police officer gave heart massage.
Inspector Sawers said this officer was “believed to be PC Shipley”. I do not know the
source of his belief and Inspector Sawers was not asked about it by Mr Fraser who
represented the family. It may be the belief was mistaken. But there seems no reason
to doubt that some police officer gave heart massage as Mr Shannon says. I can see
no inconsistency between PC Shipley’s two statements.

Counsel for the Family Support Group said in their written submissions to me that PC
Kearney had given conflicting statements as to where he took custody of Andrew’s
body. In his first statement dated 19th May 1989 he said that he was ordered to move
from the pitch to

        “behind the north stand to the area o f the gymnasium and police room. Whilst
        at this location an unidentified man (Andrew Sefton) was carried into the area
       on an advertisement board. I checked his body fo r signs o f life but none could
       be found. The body was then taken into the gymnasium where it was placed
       on the floor ”.

PC Kearney remained with the body until it was identified. In a statement dated 4
July 1989 in which he identified himself beside the body in a temporary mortuary, he
said “I took over this body outside the gym after ha lf a dozen fans had dumped him
there. ”

I cannot detect any inconsistency in these statements. Counsel asserted that in his
statement of 19th May PC Kearney had said that he “took custody of Andrew’s body
when it was brought into the gymnasium”. But this is not what he said.

In her interview with me Mrs Sefiton expressed concern that Andrew had in fact died
much later than the evidence presented to the mini-inquest indicated, because when
she identified his body at 0300 on the Sunday morning (16 April) his face was still
warm. I do not think it is right to draw this conclusion. The Coroner asked the
pathologist (Dr Shortland) about this at the mini-inquest on Andrew Sefton.    He
said (transcript 19 April 1990, page 3)

        “Q - One o f the things that worried Mrs Sefton was that when she went along
       to identify the body .... she thought that the body still appeared warm to
       her?.... A - Yes, I think that there are certain features which you have to take
       into consideration, first o f all, the build o f the individual... the ambient
       temperature is important and possibly the proximity with the large number o f
       bodies, the proximity o f the bodies together actually retained heat within them.

       Q - I think Mr Sefton was either in a body bag or wrapped in some form o f
       blanket.... Would that make any difference? A - Yes, I think it would’

       Q - I f he had been...? A - Enclosed”.
Christopher and Kevin Travnor

Mr and Mrs Traynor had the great misfortune of losing two of their sons, Christopher
and Kevin. In their interview with me they expressed concern about what they
considered inconsistencies or inadequacies in the mini-inquest evidence and body
files.


Christopher

At the mini-inquest on Christopher Traynor Det Sgt McCombie summarised the
evidence relating to Christopher. This included that of Mr N J Langley, a spectator,
who said in a statement dated 3rd May 1989 that he had fallen in one of the pens and
had been helped up by someone he later identified as Christopher Traynor. The
problem with this evidence was that Christopher was undoubtedly in pen 3 and Mr
Langley said that on leaving the tunnel he had gone to his left into pen 4. It is clear
that attempts were very properly made to reconcile the conflict over a period of time,
but it had only been resolved on the evening before the mini-inquest when it emerged
that Mr Langley had been spun round on leaving the tunnel and may have been
disorientated. He may in fact have been facing the tunnel when he said he had gone to
his left, which would put him in pen 3.

All this was explained at the mini-inquest (27 April 1990, p4-6). There is in fact no
copy of Mr Langley’s statement on the body file. I think this was an error. It should
have been there, since Mr Langley identified Christopher Traynor in his statement.
However his clear statement that he had gone into pen 4 makes it understandable that
doubt may have been entertained as to the relevance or accuracy of his identification.
In the event the matter was resolved at the mini-inquest and Mr Fraser, who appeared
for the families asked no questions.


Kevin

There is a discrepancy between the evidence of PC Turner and that of PC Howell. PC
Turner helped to remove Kevin from pen 3, laid him on the pitch and a little while
later with the assistance of fans carried him on a hoarding to the gymnasium. He
stayed with Kevin’s body until it was identified.

PC Howell thought that he had assisted in carrying a body, which he subsequently
identified as Kevin, from the pitch in front of the terraces to the Kop end where he
was placed on the pitch at the comer. Having seen photographs taken of the deceased
in the mortuary and of his clothing, he said he was 99% certain it was Kevin. PC
Howell’s statement was not on the body file relating to Kevin. This is obviously
because it was thought that his identification must be mistaken. There is in my view
no reason to doubt PC Turner’s evidence.
Kevin Williams

I have discussed the evidence of PC Bruder and WPC Martin in Chapter 4, part 1.

In her memorial to the Attorney General Mrs Williams, Kevin’s mother, submitted
transcripts of interviews with two other witnesses conducted by researchers compiling
the Cook Report TV programme. These people said that they had helped to carry
Kevin Williams across the pitch on a hoarding.

I have not been provided with any signed statement by either of these two witnesses,
nor have I been invited to interview them. The first, Mr O’Keefe was a qualified first-
aider. In spite of some persistent questioning by the Cook Report researchers it is
extremely difficult to discern a clear answer from Mr O’Keefe as to whether he
thought Kevin was still alive when he and the others carried him across the pitch and,
if so, why.

At one point Mr O’Keefe said Kevin appeared to be alive, but the next moment he
said he didn’t really know. Mr O’Keefe’s main reason for thinking Kevin might have
been alive at that time was that he and the others were rushing him across the pitch,
and he didn’t look as blue as some others.

The second witness interviewed by the Cook Report researchers is Steven Hart. His
evidence is equally difficult. When the researchers first ask him what condition Kevin
was in, he does not really answer the question. Effectively he appears to say that he
does not know if Kevin was alive, but that he was not off colour and they were
anxious to get him to the other end of the pitch as quickly as possible. But after what
appears, from the transcript, to be a break he appears more positive, “He was alive
because you knew he was alive”. Mr Hart says he could see that some people were
clearly dead. Kevin did not look like them. This appears to be the basis of his
opinion, rather than that there were definite signs of life.

Mr Hart also made a statement to the police, dated 24 May 1989. In this he describes
seeing a policeman giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a young lad on the pitch.
He later describes coming back to the lad who was lying alone with his eyes closed.
He thought he was unconscious and with a couple of other supporters placed him on a
hoarding. “As we lifted him on to the board a policeman came forward and pulled
the lads jumper up and over his face and I realised then that he was dead”. They then
carried him to the other end of the pitch. It seems clear that this must have been
Kevin, although he never identified him as such, since this is the only casualty that he
refers to as being dealt with in this way.

In my view this evidence adds nothing to the evidence of PC Bruder.

 It is I think necessary to refer to the evidence that Dr Slater gave about PC Bruder’s
 account at the mini-inquest on Kevin Williams (4 May 1990, page 13B):

        Q. “In the light o f what you heard and what we have heard now, do you feel
        that this lad died, i f you like, in the totality sense, I do n ’t mean that his skin
       was dead, but in lay terms at the point in time when Mr Bruder was with
       him? ”

       A. “Yes, sir, I am quite confident o f that. When one speaks to lay people who
       have experienced people dying, a word which is recurrent in these
       descriptions o f death is the way that individuals turn grey. In fact, I was very
       impressed by the content in PC Bruder’s statement o f the word 'grey
       recurring several times. To me as a doctor that implied that that was the point
       o f whole body death. In fa ct Ife e l that it was probably around that time that
       K evin’s whole body died. His brain had died twenty/twentyfive minutes
       before that at the time o f the crushing, but his whole body died at the time PC
       Bruder was with him. ”

Assuming, therefore, that Kevin was alive at 15.35 or shortly thereafter when PC
Bruder and the St John Ambulance people were attending him, I do not think it is
possible to say that his life could have been saved. In a report dated 29 October 1993
which was considered by the Divisional Court, Dr Iain West, Consultant Forensic
Pathologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, who was then advising Mrs Williams
referred to the injuries to Kevin’s neck. His report continues:

        “This type o f injury is amenable to treatment in the form o f an emergency
       tracheotomy or a crico-thyroidotomy. Whilst an emergency tracheotomy is a
       relatively major procedure, this crico-thyroidotomy is a simpler procedure
        which involves the passage o f a tube through the membrane between the
        thyroid and cricoid cartilages. It is possible that i f one o f these procedures
        had been carried out at the scene then he would not have suffered from the
       fatal asphyxia which led to his death.

        Both crico-thyroidotomy and emergency tracheotomy can be performed in the
       field although, in the latter instance, with difficulties owing to an increased
        likelihood o f haemorrhage at the operation site ”.

There is a difference of opinion between Dr West and Dr Slater. Dr West’s opinion is
based upon photographs and Dr Slater’s post-mortem report. He did not therefore
have the advantage of carrying out the post-mortem. Their difference of opinion has
been enlarged upon in letters to me from Dr West, dated 12 December 1997, and from
Dr Slater, dated 22 December 1997.

It is Dr West’s view that the sole injury was to the neck. He points to the absence of
bruising on the chest. Dr Slater accepts that there was an injury to the neck, but
contends that the primary cause of death was the crushing of the chest, with the injury
to the neck being contributory but secondary. He relies on ‘the extensive cyanosis
extending down to the upper part of the chest. This was particularly severe down to
the level of the clavicle and unequivocally present but less severe to a level
approximately below the nipples’. The absence of bruising to the chest was a
common finding in those who unequivocally died of crush asphyxia at Hillsborough.
Dr Slater supported his conclusion by a finding of bruising within the heart itself. He
also points out that there was no bruising of the neck muscles. Oedema and swelling
of the larynx was also absent; this might be expected to be present if the sole injury
was to the neck. It is unfortunate that there is this difference of opinion between
distinguished pathologists. I am very far from being persuaded that Dr Slater is
wrong.

Mrs Williams considers that Dr West’s view is supported by a change in some
information on the Coroner’s Certificate after the inquest. The original certificate,
dated 28 March 1991, gave the cause of death as ‘Traumatic Asphyxia’. At that time
certain information was also required for statistical purposes. In answer to the
question ‘parts of body injured’ - the answer was ‘chest’. As a result of her
communications with Dr West, Mrs Williams wanted this changed to ‘neck’.
Mr Dorries, who by then had taken over as Coroner from Dr Popper, raised the matter
with Dr Slater. He was not disposed to dissent. By this time, 1996, the same
statistical information was no longer required and similar questions to those in the
1991 form were not asked.

Mr Dorries was however prepared to issue an amended certificate, dated 4 April 1996.
The cause of death was still given as Traumatic Asphyxia. But in Part V of the form
in answer to the question ‘Details of how accident happened’, the form now reads:
‘Sustained crush injuries at football ground’; Type of injury: ‘Crush’; Parts of body
injured: ‘Neck’. This is not inconsistent with Dr Slater’s opinion, since the only
visible external injury is to the neck. But I think that if Dr Slater had foreseen the
problems that Mrs Williams was to continue to have on the matter, he might have
been wiser to point out to Mr Dorries that his opinion as to the cause of death had not
changed and that the primary cause remained the crushing of the chest, although the
only external injury was to his neck.

Even if Dr West is correct, in my view there was no realistic possibility that Kevin
Williams’ life could have been saved. The St John Ambulance personnel, in whose
charge he was, were neither trained nor equipped to perform either operation
suggested by Dr West. I cannot see that there was any basis upon which a diagnosis
could have been made which indicated the need for such an operation. Dr West
described the symptoms which indicate the need for a cricothyroidotomy as ‘only
being apparent in somebody who was still alive and would be shown by the
difficulties that individual is experiencing in breathing. This would take the form o f
increased and exaggerated respiratory movements involving the chest accompanied
by fairly characteristic noises emanating from the throat and resulting from the
individual attempting to draw in air through a severely constricted airway ’.

This is quite inconsistent with the evidence of PC Bruder, who is the only reliable
witness on Kevin’s state.
APPENDIX 10


Ten ‘unresolved’ questions?


1.    At the time of the ‘Hillsborough’ television programme in 1996 the
      programme makers, Granada Television, identified in a letter to Mr David
      Maclean MP, then a Minister at the Home Office, what they said were ten
      unresolved questions about the disaster. Eight of these questions were
      addressed quite plainly by Lord Taylor. He answered them in as far as
      answers are possible, and I think the answers he gave were right.

2.    Lord Taylor did not specifically cover the other two questions. But the
       answers to them are again in my view quite evident.

3.    I set all ten questions out below, together with some discussion of them which
       I have mainly taken from Lord Taylor’s interim report. Collectively they
       point to the ‘failure o f police control’ which Lord Taylor concluded, and I
       agree, was the main cause of the disaster (paragraph 278 of his interim report).


Why was Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield put in charge o f a major semi-final
only 21 days be fore the game, when he was relatively inexperienced at policing
matches? _

4.    Lord Taylor gives a clear account of this aspect of the disaster. He said in his
       interim report

              ‘At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been under the control o f Chief
              Superintendent Mole, then Commander o f F Division within whose
              area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
              the FA broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over
              command o f F Division on 27 March to Superintendent Duckenfield on
              the latter’s promotion to Chief Superintendent. Both were present at
              an initial meeting on 22 March, but on 27 March Mr Mole bowed out
              and Mr Duckenfield took over ....It might have been wiser to have left
              Mr Mole in charge o f this operation. On the other hand, it is quite
              understandable that Mr Duckenfield should have been expected to take
              command o f events in his Division from the date o f his promotion’
               (paragraphs 47 and 275).
Why were, there no barriers or cordons to filter the crowd and prevent a build-up
outside the Leppinvs Lane end o f the ground i f as the fans insist, there were the
previous year?

5.      There is a conflict between the evidence of the police and that of supporters.
        The fans say that in 1988 the police operated barriers and cordons along
        Leppings Lane to filter out those without tickets and control the flow of
        people towards the ground. The police say they did not. Both fans and
        police however agree that there were no such barriers or cordons in 1989.
        Lord Taylor examined this question. He concluded

                "As to 1988, there was a very large and consistent body o f evidence
                that, on the day, the police in Leppings Lane conducted an efficient
               filtering exercise      1 do not believe that so many witnesses without
                either opportunity or reason to put their heads together could be
                mistaken about what they experienced on that occasion. Yet the police
                maintain that no filtering exercise other than on a random basis was
                carried out in 1988 and that their policy and practice then were no
                different from those o f 1989. The answer .... m ust.... be that whilst
                the policy was no different, in practice the policing in 1988 was more
                efficient and was not put to the same test and strain as a year later
                (interim report, paragraphs 214 and 215).


Why was the game not delayed, as a number o f police o fficers thought it should have
been, when it became obvious that it would not be possible to get all the Liverpool
fans safely into the ground before the 3 p.m. kick-off?

6.      Lord Taylor examined this issue also. He gives his answer at paragraphs 226
        and 227 of his interim report.

               ‘At various stages in his evidence (at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry) Mr
               Duckenfield gave three accounts o f why he thought it too late to
               postpone kick-off. Once it was that one o f the teams had already come
               onto the pitch. Then it was that a group o f photographers at the
               tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams were coming out.
               Finally, he did not know why he thought the teams were coming out.
               They did not in fa ct come onto the pitch until 2.54 p.m., two minutes
               after Gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked fo r a
               postponement o f the kick-off before Gate C was opened. It should not,
               however, have needed a Police Constable in the thick o f the crowd
                (and there were others o f like mind) to think o f postponing the kick-off.
                The need should have been clear in the control room.

                The truth was that Mr Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had
                discussed with Mr Murray. Kick-off would not be delayed unless there
                were some major cause fo r delayed arrivals, eg a jam on the motorway
                or fo g .... Faced with a situation which was becoming dangerous,
              crowd safety should have been the first consideration. Kick-off should
              have been delayed’.


 Why didn’t the police recognise overcrowding on the Leppings Lane terrace when eye
 witnesses, including football commentator John Motson. were aware o f the problems
fifteen minutes before kick-off?

7.     This again is a question which Lord Taylor discusses in his interim report.
       He has a chapter about it (Chapter 13). He concludes

               ‘As the stream from Gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in
               the control room could be expected to keep a close watch on pens 3
               and 4. They had a direct view o f them from an elevated position
               through their window. Although they had no field-glasses, there was
               the zoom facility on the TV camera... pens 3 and 4 became more and
               more crowded, surges took place, fans were showing and signalling
               distress. None o f this was seen or recognised in the control ro om ....

               ... the combination o f no instructions (to police) as to overcrowding
               and a strong prohibition on opening the gates (from the pens onto the
               perimeter track) was likely to make police recognition o f crushing slow
               and their response reluctant. Small wonder that the growing pressure
               between 2.50p.m. and 2.59p.m. went unheeded or certainly
               unremedied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem, the
               rule required the consent o f a senior officer before a gate could be
               opened....

               Naturally, one would hope that common sense and humanity would
               make some officers cut through the rules and open a gate i f fans were
               clearly in distress...

                 This is what happened, but not until officers recognised the distress
                and even then not immediately... there was a period during which the
               failure to recognise the problem and the inhibition against tackling it
                caused vital time to be lost ’ (interim report paragraphs 244 to 248).

 8.     Elsewhere in his interim report Lord Taylor says (paragraph 78)

               ‘In the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything
               amiss in pens 3 and 4 until the first fans spilt out onto the perimeter
               track ju st before kick-off. Then, the officers in command assumed that
               there was an attempted pitch invasion
Why w asn’t the tunnel leading to the central pens closed when they became full, the
procedure adopted at the previous year’s semi-final?

9.     Lord Taylor’s interim report says (paragraph 230)

                ‘Since pens 3 and 4 were fu ll by 2.50 p.m.. the tunnel should have been
                closed o ff whether Gate C was to be opened or not. The exercise was
                a simple one and had been carried out in 1988. All that was
                necessary was fo r a few officers to act as a cordon to the tunnel and
                divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately the 1988 closure seems to have
                been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not
               figure in the debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the
               planning fo r 1989\


 Why did C hief Superintendent Duckenfield mislead the Secretary o f the FA by telling
 him, that fans had forced open Gate C. when the o fficer knew he had given the order
fo r it to be opened?

10.    Lord Taylor says of this (paragraphs 283 and 284 of his interim report) that

               ‘Most surprisingly (Mr Duckenfield) gave Mr Kelly and others to think
               that there had been an inrush due to Liverpool fans forcing open a
               gate. This was not only untruthful. It set o ff a widely reported
               allegation against the supporters which caused grave offence and
               distress .... I can only assume Mr Duckenfield’s lack o f candour on
               this occasion was out o f character. He said his reason fo r not telling
               the truth was that if the crowd became aware o f it there might be a
               very hostile reaction and this might impede rescue work. He did not
               wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
               officer. However, reluctance to tell Mr Kelly the truth did not require
               that he be told a falsehood. Moreover, although Assistant Chief
                Constable Jackson was at hand, Mr Duckenfleld did not disclose the
               truth to him until much later.

                The likeliest explanation o f Mr Duckenfield’s conduct is that he simply
                could not face the enormity o f the decision to open the gates and all
                that flowed therefrom. That would explain what he said to Mr Kelly,
                what he did not say to Mr Jackson, his aversion to addressing the
                crowd, and his failure to take effective control o f the disaster situation.
                He froze
 Why did it take half an hour after the first crushing began to pull down the 10 fo o t
spiked fence which trapped the fans, and whv were the gates which led on to the pitch
too small to be effective in an emergency evacuation?

11.    The sequence of events is clear from Lord Taylor’s interim report. He says
       that

               ‘At about 3.10 p.m. a request came from the perimeter fence fo r bolt
               croppers to cut the wire mesh. Sergeant Goddard contacted the police
               garage close by without success. A t 3.13 p.m., PC Bichard requested
               Headquarters to call the fire service to bring hydraulic cutting
               equipment to the Leppings Lane entrance .... fire appliances arrived
               at both Leppings Lane and Penistone Road at 3.22p.m. A t both
               entrances their arrival surprised police who were uninformed as to
               why they had been called or where they should go ....

               A t the Kop end, Leading Fireman Housley arrived with an emergency
                tender and station Officer Fletcher in another appliance, each with a
                crew. The emergency tender came along the roadway by the south
                stand but owing to its height was unable to proceed further .... Mr
                Fletcher and his men ran along behind the south stand carrying
                cutting equipment and oxygen cylinders. When they arrived at the
               fence, the cutting equipment was not required as by then the last o f the
                dead and injured were being removedfrom the pens .... ’ (interim
                report, paragraphs 101-104).

               ‘The perimeter gates in the pens were not designed as exits. They were
               intended to afford access by the police to cope with any local disorder
               or an emergency. The kind o f emergency contemplated was not
               massive crushing but, fo r example, the collapse or illness o f an
               individual.... The need to provide fo r speedy and large scale
               evacuation from the front o f the pens to the pitch was not anticipated’
               (interim report, paragraphs 258-9).


Whv was no public address announcement made - either informing the fans as to what
was happening, asking for their help or fo r anv medical personnel at the ground to
help, until 3.30?

 12.    Lord T ay lor ’s interim report says

                ‘Apart from the message to clear the pitch and the belated call for
                medical assistance about 3.30p.m., no information or advice was
                broadcast on the public address system. Mr Duckenfield feared that
                the crowd might turn hostile or might all attempt to leave together
                thereby hampering the emergency services if they were given
                information about what had happened. The result was that apart from
                those close enough at the west end to see the terrible truth fo r
              themselves, the majority o f the crowd were left in ignorance ’ (interim
              report, paragraph 97).

13.   Lord Taylor had more to say about Mr Duckenfield’s reluctance to address the
      crowd at paragraph 284 of his interim report. I have quoted that above.


Why, when 42 ambulances reached the ground, did more not get on to the pitch where
the dving and severely injured, were in urgent need o f trained medical help?

14.   As I mentioned when discussing the rescue operation in Chapter 3 of this
      report, Lord Taylor made it quite clear that ‘no valid criticism can be made o f
      the response by the St John Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS (the South
      Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service) or the fire brigade ... I fin d that
      all three ... services .... responded promptly when alerted, that they brought
      appropriate equipment and that their personnel operated efficiently ’ (interim
      report, paragraphs 296/7).

15.   The video evidence is that three ambulances went onto the pitch, one St John
       Ambulance and two SYMAS. They drove very slowly because of the large
       crowds of people moving about. It would have been impracticable for
       substantially larger numbers of ambulances to have come onto the playing
       area. There was only one route for them on and off, which was also being
       used by fans and police carrying the dead and injured off the pitch towards the
       gymnasium and would have formed a bottleneck.

16.   It would have been extremely difficult for triaging to take place on the pitch
       given the chaotic conditions there. The gymnasium, which was used instead,
       was the only practicable alternative for those victims who had been brought
       out from the front of the Leppings Lane pens. In the circumstances it was
       quicker for victims to be taken there in the way that they were, on stretchers
       and improvised stretchers, that it would have been to use fleets of ambulances.
       As it was the ambulances were mainly used to take injured people from the
       gymnasium to hospital. I think that this was in the circumstances the most
       effective way of using them.


Why did on.lv 14 o f those who died go to hospital?

17.   Part of the gymnasium at the ground was used as a temporary mortuary and
       the bodies remained there for some hours until they were removed to the
       Medico-Legal Centre at Watery Lane, Sheffield, where the post-mortems were
       carried out. I have dealt in Chapter 5 of this report with suggestions that
       people were confirmed as being dead on the basis of insufficient examination.
       It is clear that this was not the case. The bleak but simple truth - one of many
       bleak truths about that terrible day - is that the ambulances were better used to
       take the injured to hospital rather than the dead.

      Thank you for your letter of 17 April about
the disaster at Hillsborough football ground.

      As you know, I vent to the ground on the day
after the tragedy and I visited St Helen's on
Friday, so I have seen something of the grief
inflicted on Merseyside by this terrible event.

      My office will mention your kind offer of
assistance to Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry to Mr
Robert Whalley, the Secretary to the inquiry, (who
is at the above address). I am sure he would be
glad to receive any comments or suggestions which
you are able to provide.

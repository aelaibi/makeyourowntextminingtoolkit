particular          coach       I was       in charge        of and no alcohol                 was     found.

All    four     coaches         set     off from A n fi e ld at the                same    time.         The       club

checked they found no alcohol.                             They        then a d he r e d a sticker             to the

resumed our           journey          to Sheff ie ld .         Traffic, flow was               heavy and very

congested.           R oa d wo r ks      on the M 6 2        caused some           delay.

parking       location.              This    p os ition was            some    f if te en minutes walk               from

P a s s e n g e r s a l i g ht e d the    coach and began to make their way on foot                                to

the football         stadium.            There were      police    officers       on duty w i t h i n the

coach     park a ssig ne d to the s ec urity of the                     coaches.        Once     the

coach was empty of             p assen gers        I w a lk e d to the H i l l s b o r o u g h s ta d iu m

w i t h another      steward

We w a l k e d to the gr ou nd along Hali fa x Rd,                     there were       large     n umb er s        of

s u p p o r t e r s making    their way       in the same direction,               the s up po r te r s            I

saw were all         orderly an d good humoured.                   I saw supp or te rs          ou tside a

public      house    in H a li f ax Rd.           They were all         well    behaved and          I could

hear    singing,       this was          a regular     scene at major matches.

I a r r i v e d at the L ep pi n gs         Ln entance at about               12QQ h r s , mysc^lf and

                          were     in p os se ss io n of West           stand seating          tickets,            the

se at ed turnstiles were                 to the    left as you ente re d L ep pi ng s Ln.                     I

could see and hear             that       the West     stand t er races         t urnstiles       to my           right

were    ext re me ly     congested,         there were       hundreds         of supporters,           I could

see that      there a p p e a r e d to be          crushing     in that area.            S u pp o r t e r s   were

screaming.          I could see several              s up po rt er s    climbing       over    the     terrace

turnstiles.          I c o u l d n ’t u nd er s ta n d why at          that    time.     It a p p e a r e d as

t ho ug h something was wrong.                    There was     no control        or order        in that

a re a of the t er ra ce d turnstiles.                  I saw at        least    two    police       vans

parked near         to the L ep pi n gs Ln entrance.                   T he y were sat        in the      vans,

they did not get out a nd assist w it h                      crowd      control    and d i r e c t i o n

outs id e    the Leppi ng s       Ln turnstiles.             T here were        police     h o r s e s but         they

were    ineffective          in controlling          the numbers.             I could see then that

there was a problem.                I had only seen similar                   scenes at Wembley.                   It

only took minutes            for me        to pass     t h ro ug h my particular           turnstile,

my se lf and                                  hen made       our w ay to our           p articular        seats

the West        stand w it h a good view,

I o bs e r v e d some five minu te s              before      kick off          that    pens three an d four

beh in d the goal was              overflowing.            I said then to                                          that

I thought        there were         problems        in that area after                 kick off.        I could

see at the /'font of               pens    three and four               supp or te rs were        climbing         the

pe                -ence.         I knew there was som et hi ng wrong,                        police    officers

we      ______ ig      the s up po r te r s      back      in.          I saw a s up porter           being    passed

over     head       in the       pens   behind the          goal,        they    laid him on the ground.

He wasn't moving.                 I kne w something was wrong.                        For    some two m i nu te s            I

saw more and more                poeple    climbing over             the      front    perimeter       fences.           I

t hen saw       police     officers        then a ss i st i ng s up po rt er s              to get    out    from the

their way to the area.                    I saw s upporters              ripping       hoardings       up and

putting       injured s up po r te r s        on them.            The    pitch      looked     like a battle

ground.         There was         bodies    everywhere.              People were            running    round

frantic..        I stayed         in my seat o bserving                 the    incident until          ten to four

(1550)      in the a fternoon.              I then        left     the     ground of my own

a ccord.        In the L e pp in gs        Ln v ic inity          I saw       police    in large       numbers,

there were         suppo rt er s        crying and shouting at                  police o bv i ou s ly        in an

extreme       emotional          state.

I was w o r r i e d about          the A n fi e l d    travel        club s upporters           so    I made my

w ay to Hali f a x R d to           check     returning           s up po rt er s     to the    coach.        Four       of

my    p a s s e n g e r s were    found to be m i s s i n g , three              of w h i ch    came from

S t o c k s b r i d g e Vill ag e a nd one       from Padgate,                W arrington.       Through       other

supporters         I e s t a bl i sh e d the      personal         details       of the three          lads       from

S t o c k s b r i d g e , no one    knew the       identity of the y ou th m is si ng                   from

Padgate.            He t r a ve ll ed alone.          I    knew his m e m b e r s h i p number,             but    did

not    know his        name.       I re co ve re d a       d enim jacket, w i th ac ream                collar      from

one    of the seats,             inside    one of the         pockets was a train t im e ta b le                    for

y ou t h from Warrington.                  I had sold him a L iv erpool                     programme      on the

j o u r n e y to the        game,    this     too was still            in the jacket.

I made        extensive       enq ui ri es at and a ro u nd               the    ground      to try a nd       locate

the four missing              passengers.           At one      time       the     coach and the        existing

o cc u p a n t s    drove    back    to the ground.             I went          into the ground w it h

a no t he r    steward                                      to enquire about            the missing

passengers.            I had three          of the four         passengers           names.        I spoke         to a

Police        Inspector and          told him        I had four m i ss in g            passengers       he said

"So what? u

We    could not believe              his a tt it ud e and strong words were                        exchanged.             I

did not        swear    but     I told      him he was         callous and had not s hown any

dignity.            Two other       p o li ce me n then       came     to my assistance,             they got on

the    coach and d ir ec t ed us to H a m m e r t o n Rd                   police     s t at io n where        I     was

then able           to furn is h the        police w it h the m i ss in g              passengers       details.

A fter     cons u l t a ti on w i t h officers and social                       work er s    I then r et ur ne d to

the    coach with them to e st a bl i sh from other                             supporters any other

specific           details    of the missing.

The    coach then           returned to A n fi e l d a nd a r r i v e d at about                   IQ pm      (2200

hrs).         I was    unable       due    to the time        to e s t a b l i s h the miss in g           youths

full     name and a d dr es s         by    reference        to his m e m b e r s h i p       number as       the

A n f i e l d Travel        C lu b premi ses were           closed.

It w a s n ’t until          M on da y mo rning,        I e s t a b l i s h e d that        the m i ss in g   youth

from W a r r i n g t o n was        Ian W H E L A N a nd he      in fact was dead as a result                         of

the    incident at Hill'

I s u b s e q u e n t l y gave      Ian WHELffife* jacket            to                           at the A n f i e l d

On a s ubsequent             trip    to W i m b l e d o n   I e n q u ir e d w it h these A n f i e l d            travel

             ground.        No one    could assist w it h this as        Ian was a very quiet

             lad and always          t ra v el l ed alone.    I can recall      that   Ian W H E L A N sat on

             a double       seat   on his    own,   there were only two empty seats             on the

             coach an d one was          next    to him.

             To   clarify an earlier            point w he n the    coach was    checked for alcohol         the

             police officers also            checked everyones m a t c h ticket and found them to

             be   in order.

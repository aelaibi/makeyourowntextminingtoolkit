                 CORRESPONDENCE FROM DAVID ALTON MP
              RE: THE CASE OF             - EUTHANASIA

1.     You will recall our conversation regarding a file on |                which David
Alton MP handed to Secretary of State following their meeting on Euthanasia and Advanced
Directives on Monday 27 June 1994.

2.    Mr Alton has now sent me all the relevant papers which is discussed in his letter of
14 October.

3.      I would be grateful if you could please provide me with advice on this including a YJ
reply for SofS’ signature. You will note in Mr Alton’s letter that he would like his
constituent’s name quoted in the draft.

4.     If you have any queries concerning this request please do not hesitate to contact me.

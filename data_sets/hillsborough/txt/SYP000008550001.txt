             I am a Cadet                            x
                                    in the Saint Johrs^s Ambulance Brigade and have been in

             the E3rigade for 5 years.                On the    15th April       1989 <150489),     I was

             posted to the football              ground at Hillsborough.             I went to my usual

             position        in the ground,         which is in the        corner of the West Stand by
                 QJP\~T
             pen 6 and 7.              I was with                         and                    , the y a r e

            also      cadets



            About two minutes               into the game      I saw some Liverpool       fans   climb over

            the fencing from the central                  two terraces and onto the perimeter of

             the pitch,           as they did this        the Police helped them over and then took

            them to the side terraces.



             I then saw more fans              climb over the fence and lie down on the
                                                                                                 PAGE

           •football     pitch.



           We asked another Saint John's adult             if we could go back to the First

           Aid room and help o u t , he said we could and we made our way there.

           Two Police Of f i cers came up to us with a man with chest               pains,       who

           we took to the First Aid Room.             He was holding his       chest,    I would

           describe him as about 26 years 5*5 tall,             medium buiId,      dark brown

           hair,    quite      long and a bit curly.      I think he had a neck chain on.

           He was wearing a sweat shirt,            I c a n ’t remember what    colour    it was,

           blue jeans,         training shoes,    I don't know what   colour, we took him

            into the First Aid room and handed him over to a woman Saint J o h n ’s

           Officer.       We then went out to where the Police vans were parked,

           underneath the North stand and put some blankets on the floor for

            people to lie on.



           We then asked a Saint J o h n ’s woman Officer          if we could sit        in a

           Police van to keep out of the way.             We stay in the van until          it was

           almost time to g o .        We then made our way back to Mr                   s car,    he

           was the Officer who bought us to the match.

                                                                                             SIGNED

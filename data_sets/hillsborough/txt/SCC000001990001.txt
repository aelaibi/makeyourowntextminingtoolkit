                                              EXPLANATORY NOTE
                                       (This note is not part of the Regulations)
  These Regulations, which apply throughout Great Britain (except the Isles of Scilly),
replace the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 (" the 1976 Regulations "’) and the
Safety of Sports Grounds (Amendment) Regulations 1986 (which apply in England and
Wales, except the Isles of Scilly) and the Safety of Sports Grounds (Scotland) Regulations
1976 (" the 1976 Scottish Regulations").
   Regulations 8 to 13 of the 1976 Regulations and regulations 9 and 10 of the ! 976 Scottish
Regulations made provision for the procedure for appeals to the ~cretarv of State in
respect ofsafety certificates under section 5 ofthe Safetyof Sports Ground 5 Act i975 (’" the
 1975 Act"). When the amendments made by section 22 of the Fire Safety and Safety of
Places of Sport Act 1987 (" the 1987 Act ") come into force, those appealswill be made to
magistrates’ courts in England and Wales and by summary application in Scotland and
regulations 8 to 13 of the 1976 Regulations and regulations 9 and 10 ol the 1976 Scottish
Regulations will no longer be necessary. By virtue of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places
of Sport Act 1987 (Commencement No. 1) Order 1987 (S.I. 1987/1762). Par,. II of the 1987
Act (in which section 22 is contained)comes in-o force on I st Januarx ! 9,~Y, the same date
          as the coming into force of these Regulations. Accordingly, these Regulations no longer
          include provision corresponding to regulations 8 to 13 of the 1976 Regulations and
         regulations 9 and 10 of the 1976 Scottish Regulations (the enabling power for which is, in
         any event, replaced by section 22 (7) of the 1987 Act) but provide instead (in regulation 6)
         for the time within which an appeal must be brought before a magistrates" court in England
         and Wale,~ or by summary application in Scotland.
            These Regulations also differ from the 1976 Regulations and the 1976 Scottish
         Regulationg in that they no longer prescribe a minimum time before the event for which
         the application is made for the submission of an application for a special safety certificate.
         They also do not require the local authority to have made decisions in respect of such
         applicatic:.~ ~y specified periods.
            Regulat,~n 5 of these Regulations requires certain notices to be given to interested
        parties (as defined) and a newspaper notice to be published. Regulation 8 of these
        Regulations differs from regulation 14 of the 1976 Regulations and regulation I 1 of the
         1976 Scottish Regulations in that it allows local authorities to charge fees in respect of
        applicat~c~r:s for the replacement and transfer of safety certificates as well as for
        applicatiora~ for their issue and amendment.
           These Regulations also differ from the 1976 Regulations (as mended) and the 1976
        Scottish Regulations in that they refer only to sports grounds and not to sports stadia in
        consequence of the amendments made to the 1975 Act by section 19 of, and Schedule 2 to,
        the 1987 Act (which provisions also come into force on 1st January 1988 by virtue of the
        Commcnccment Order referred to above).
           Regulation 7 of these Regulations is a new provision which prescribes the period within
        which appeals in respect of prohibition notices (and amendments to those notices) issued
        under section 10 of the 1975 Act (as substituted by section 23(1) of the 1987 Act) must be
        bro~:ght under section 10A (1) and (2) of the 1975 Act (as inserted by section 24 of the 1987
        Act).

        1.0   The standards of safety to be achieved as laid down in this certificate
              are based on recommendations contained in the Guide to Safety at Sports
              Grounds (new edition 1986 published by H.M. Stationery Office)
              applicable to designated sports grounds and the final recon~nendations
              of Lord Justice Taylor in his final report on the Hillsborough Stadium
              Disaster.

        2.0   OFFENCES AND PENALTIES

        2.1   It is an offence for the Holder or any responsible person to:-

              (a)   Contravene any term or condition¯ of this certificate,

              (b)   Admit spectators to the sports ground at any time when a Safety
                    Certificate is not in force;

              (c)   Admit spectators to the sports ground in contravention of a Court
                    Order.

              The penalty is, on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding the
              statutory maximum (£2,000) or, on conviction and indictment, a fine or
              imprisonment not exceeding 2 years or both.

                 safety of persons at the sports ground, the Holder of the certificate
                 shall, before the carrying out of the proposals is begun, give notice
                 of the proposals to the local authority.

           4.2   Sub-Section 1 above in particular requires notice when it is proposed
                 to alter the entrances to or exists from a sports ground or any part of

                 authority or against the inclusion of any terms and conditions imposed
                 by the certificate. The time limit within which appeals must be lod~ed
                 and the procedures to be followed are set out in the Safety of Sports
                 Grounds Regulations 1987.

                 CAPACITY

           1.0   The capacity of the sports ground has been calculated with due
            f    reference to the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds and Recommendations
                 (7-10) and (32 and 33) of the Final Report of Lord Justice Taylor into
                 the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.

           2.0 Recommendations 7 to i0 state:

                 Maximum Capacities for Terraces.

                 7.    Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are
                       self-contained, the Safety Certificate should specify the maximum
                       number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

                       A pen or area is to be deemed "self-contained" notwithstanding
                       that it has a gate or gates affording access to another pen or
                       area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

                 8.    Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance
                       with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide ("the Green Guide Figure")
                       subject to the following qualifications:-

                       (a)   the maximum density permitted under paragraphs 221 and 222
                             of the Green Guide (when the terrace or viewing slope is in
                             good condition) should be 47 not 54):

                       (b)   the minimum figure specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 (when
                             the terrace or viewing slope materially derides from the
                             recommended) guidelines, so as to constitute a possible
                             hazard to individuals closely packed) should be 0 not 27;

                       (c)   in arriving at "the Green Guide Figure", proper and
                             realistic allowance must be made for all factors which
                             should reduce the permissible density including those
                             specified in paragraphs 220 to 224 inclusive of the Green
©                            Guide.

                 9.    Arrangements should be made:-
                       (a)   to limit the number of spectators entering each
                             self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity figure
                             assessed in accordance with Recommendation 8 above either
                             electronically, mechanically, by a ticketing arrangement, by
                             counting or otherwise; and

                       (b)   to close off further access to such pen or area when its
                             maximum capacity is about to be reached.

                 i0.   The maximum notional rate at which spectators can pass through a
                       turnstile should be 660 persons per hour, not 750 per hour as
                       stated in paragraph 47 of the Green Guide. The maximum rate for
                       any particular turnstile must take full account of all
                       circumstances including those given as examples.




SC2AAB/5
           3.0       Recon~nendations 32 and 33

                     32.      Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow
                              measured (if this has not already been done following the Interim
                              Report). Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to ensure
                              that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the
                              rate anticipated.

                     33.      The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the
                              turnstiles serving it should be such as to ensure that all the
                              spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass
                              through the turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done,
                              the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced accordingly.
                              Since this Recommendation includes terms and conditions within the
                              scope of the original section 2(2)(c)(i) of the Safety of Sports
                              Grounds Act 1975, it should be given effect in the Safety
                              Certificate (see Recommendation 24).

                      THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
                                 15 APRIL 1989

                                    INTERIM REPORT OF INQUIRY

                                             INTRODUCTION
  1. On 15 April 1989 a football match to decide a semi-final round of the FA Cup competition was to be
played between the Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Clubs. The neutral venue chosen was Hillsborough
Football Stadium, Sheffield Wednesday’s ground. Only six minutes into the game, play was stopped when it
was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal had been severely crushed. In the result,
95 died and over 400 received hospital treatment.
  2. On 17 April 1989 1 was appointed by you to carry out an Inquiry with the following terms of reference:

     To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
     recommendations about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events.
   3. Two Assessors were appointed to assist me: Mr Brian Johnson QPM, Chief Constable of Lancashire,
and Professor Leonard Maunder OBE, BSc, PhD, ScD, FEng, FI Mech E, Professor of Mechanical
Engineering at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Their help has been invaluable and I am very grateful
for their expert advice and wise counsels. While the sole responsibility for this report is mine, I am comforted
in the knowledge that both Assessors agree with it.
  4. Mr Robert Whalley was appointed Secretary to the Inquiry. He and his assistants have worked
prodigiously and skilfully to give me all the advice and support I could have wished. I also wish to acknowledge
the help I have received, as always, from my clerk, Mr Ernest Pott.
   5. The policing arrangements for 15 April were in the hands of the South Yorkshire Constabulary. The
efficacy of those arrangements and their implementation was from an early stage called into question. It was
therefore decided that the investigation of the disaster and the gathering of evidence for this Inquiry should be
conducted by an independent police force. Mr Geoffrey Dear QPM, Chief Constable of West Midlands
Constabulary, undertook this task. He was made responsible directly to me; he appointed Assistant Chief
Constable Mervyn Jones to take full-time charge of the investigation. I am deeply indebted to both of them.
   6. On 18 April I visited Hillsborough Stadium. I inspected the scene of the disaster on the terraces and all
relevant parts of the stadium and its approaches. My Assessors and I have made further visits during the
Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool on 21 and 29 April.
   7. The Lord Mayor and the Sheffield City Council kindly offered to make the accommodation and facilities
of Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing of oral evidence. This offer was gratefully accepted and I would
like to record my thanks for those facilities and for the co-operation afforded to the Inquiry by the authorities
in Sheffield.
   8. On 28 April 1989, I held a preliminary hearing to announce the date when the oral evidence would begin,
to give some directions as to the procedure I intended to follow and to hear applications from those wishing to
be represented at the hearing. I accorded representation to the following:
       (i) Those bereaved or injured as a result of the disaster.
       (ii) The Football Supporters’ Association.
       (iii) The Football Association.
       (iv) Sheffield City Council.
       (v) Sheffield Wednesday Football Club together with the Football League, the Club’s casual staff and
              their insurers, the Sun Alliance.
       (vi) South Yorkshire Constabulary.
       (vii) South Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority.
Subsequently, during the hearing, I further accorded representation to:
     (viii) Trent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service
            (SYMAS).
and (ix) Dr W Eastwood, consultant engineer to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

  9. Since the circumstances of the disaster raised urgent questions of safety, especially at football grounds,
you indicated at the outset that you would welcome any recommendations, even of an interim nature, which I
might be able to give in advance of the new football season due to commence in mid-August 1989. I therefore
announced at the preliminary hearing on 28 April that I would conduct an oral hearing with all possible
expedition as the first phase of the Inquiry to discover the facts and causes of the disaster and enable me to
make any immediate interim recommendations necessary in the short term.

   10. The West Midlands Police investigation began on 24 April. A "Freephone" number was advertised to
enable members of the public, especially those who had attended the match, to offer their evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this number was available for three days on 28 different lines. The response from the public
was such that the lines were continued for a further three days by the end of which 2,666 calls had been
received. There were also many written offers of help. Some 440 West Midlands officers were deployed on the
Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in Birmingham, Liverpool and
Sheffield and computer technology was used to the full. In all some 3776 statements were taken. There were
also some 1550 letters to Ministers, to the Inquiry and to me personally all of which I read. The police,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the BBC had video cameras filming at the ground on 15 April. In
aggregate, they recorded some 71 hours of film covering the period before, during and after the disaster. Thus
the material gathered and potentially available for presentation at the oral hearing was enormous. From this
mass it was essential to select only sufficient good and reliable evidence necessary to establish the facts and
causes of the disaster.
   11. Where it seemed likely that any allegation or criticism might be made of the conduct 0fany person or
party, the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the party concerned
setting out the likely grounds for complaint. This followed the practice established by the Royal Commission
on Tribunals of Inquiry (the Salmon Commission).
  12. The hearing began on 15 May. It continued, sitting long hours, for 31 days concluding on 29 June. In
that period, 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel’s submissions were delivered in writing on 7 July and
on 14 July I heard their brief oral submissions supplementing the written argument.
  13. Witnesses were not sworn. Since this is a departmental inquiry, there was no power to administer the
oath but there was no instance of any witness giving evidence which I considered might have been different
had he or she been sworn.

   14. The witnesses called were only a small fraction of those from whom statements were or could have been
taken. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that they were sufficient in number and reliability to enable me to reach the
necessary conclusions. To have called more would have prevented me from presenting an interim report in the
required time and would not have added significantly to the relevant evidence. I have, however, been able to
take into account many written statements in addition to oral testimony.

   15. Apart from the evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry which was drawn from statements taken by
the West Midlands Police and others volunteered by individuals, each of the represented parties was given full
opportunity to put forward any witnesses they considered should be called. A final submission was made by
Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police that since the investigation by West Midlands Police is still continuing,
all the evidence has not been assembled and it would be unsafe for me to make findings of fact. I should
therefore make clear that the investigation continues principally to furnish as much detail as possible to HM
Coroner for the City of Sheffield as to the cause of death, the precise position at death and the care and
movement of each of the 95 victims individually. I am assured by Chief Constable Dear and Assistant Chief
Constable Mervyn Jones that it is most unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter or add to
the history of events which emerged at the hearing.

  16. I should like to thank all those who made it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
event and for evidence to be efficiently presented and tested so as to give a full and fair account of what
happened in all its aspects without irrelevancy or duplication. I pay tribute particularly to the West Midlands
Police for their speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to all those responsible for processing it.
The most eloquent tribute to the fairness and thoroughness of the police investigation came from the Secretary
of the Football Supporters’ Association. He said there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to whether that
investigation would be fair and objective. His Association therefore collected 200 witness statements
themselves. Having heard the opening statement by Counsel to the Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered
by the police, he found that it accorded entirely with his Association’s evidence and the initial anxiety was
wholly dispelled.
   17. Before and during the Inquiry I derived great assistance on a wide range of technical issues from the
Health and Safety Executive who providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research and Laboratory
Services Division) where tests were conducted and reports prepared swiftly and efficiently. This was done
in close consultation with Professor Maunder. I am most grateful to the Director, Dr A Jones, and to the
Deputy Director, Dr C E Nicholson, for their invaluable help.

  18. I wish to commend Counsel to the inquiry, Mr Andrew Collins QC, Mr Alan Goldsack and Mr
Bernard Phillips for their industry, care and fairness in selecting and presenting the necessary evidence; also,
Counsel for all those represented who tested that evidence fully but expeditiously. This Interim Report could
not possibly have been prepared in so short a time had I not had the whole-hearted co-operation of all those
mentioned and many others.

   19. The second phase of the Inquiry will be directed to making final and long term recommendations about
crowd control and safety at sports grounds. I need to consider in depth information, opinions and arguments
from a wide range of sources and contributors both here and abroad. It was clear from the outset that this
second phase could not be carried to completion before the next football season. However, at an early stage of
the oral hearing I invited evidence from all who wished to contribute to it and specifically from many sporting,
local authority, emergency service and police bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked that submissions
should be in writing and should be made promptly so that the second phase of the Inquiry could
follow immediately after the first. I shall now proceed to consider the large body of written evidence which has
been submitted. I shall want in some instances to have further oral evidence or discussion in conjunction with
my Assessors. We will also need to make a number of visits and inspections.

  20. I now present my Interim Report and Recommendations. I shall prepare my Final Report and
Recommendations as soon as reasonably possible.




1 August 1989                                                                               PETER TAYLOR
                  PART I - WHAT HAPPENED AT HILLSBOROUGH?
                                                 CHAPTER 1

                         THE GROUND AND PRE-MATCH ARRANGEMENTS
Fixing The Venue
  21. On 20 March 1989, the Football Association (the FA) requested that their Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium. The corresponding
semi-final between the same two teams had been held there in April 1988. The arrangements had been
successful in the view both of the police and of the host club. Sheffield Wednesday (the Club) were therefore
willing to accommodate the 1989 match. South Yorkshire Constabulary were prepared to police it but only if
the ticketing arrangements were the same as those for 1988. Otherwise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
Those arrangements did not please Liverpool or its supporters either in 1988 or 1989. They thought the ticket
allocation was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police requirement was
accepted and the match was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

The Ground
  22. The Hillsborough Stadium is some 2’~ miles to the north-west of central Sheffield in the district of
Owlerton. The ground was opened in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river Don. The pitch lies
roughly east to west. A plan of the ground and its immediate environs is at Appendix 1.
  23. The west end, with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings Lane end. The
east end abuts on Penistone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river Don and to the north a residential street,
Vere Road, which runs between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North.

   24. Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the Directors’ and players’
entrances, and to the administrative block under the stand. The roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
access between Penistone Road and Leppings Lane, but there are gates which can shut it off at each end. There
is some car parking along this roadway principally for Directors, players and employees of the Club. The south
stand dates from 1914 and is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8,800.5,500 of those are
roofed over and 3,300 are uncovered.
  25. The north stand is also all seating and accommodates about 9,700. Behind it is a gymnasium or sports
hall. There are also a first aid room and police room close by.

  26. The east end is all terracing and is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlarged and roofed over in 1986 and
now accommodates some 21,000 standing spectators. There are crush barriers in the Kop running parallel to
the goal line but no dividing fences to prevent free movement from side to side.

   27. At the west or Leppings Lane end of the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. Behind it is the west
stand which provides covered seating and was built in 1965 for World Cup matches, some of which were held
at Hillsborough in 1966. The covered stand accommodates 4,456 seated spectators. The terracing in front of it
extends higher in the corners between the stands and its total capacity was stated to be 10,100. At both the Kop
end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by perimeter fencing. The fencing is about eight feet high
mounted upon the low wall at the foot of the terracing. At the top of the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
angle for some 15 inches to make it difficult for anyone to climb over towards the pitch. There are gates at
intervals along the perimeter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch. These gates are less than a
metre wide and were designed to be opened only from the pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.
They are marked and numbered on the plan Appendix 1.

  28. Unlike the Kop end, the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line but radial
fences at right angles to it, dividing the area into pens. This division was begun after an FA Cup semi-final in
 1981 when crushing occurred due to overcrowding and gates had to be opened. It proceeded in stages, the final
arrangement being shown on the plan Appendix 1. The first section of the west terracing moving south to north
contains gates 1 and 2 and is known as pens 1 and 2 although in fact constituting only one pen. Next is pen 3
with one gate; next pen 4 with one gate; pen 5, which is extremely narrow, was intended as a sterile area to
divide pen 4 from pen 6. This was to isolate home and away fans on occasions when both might be
accommodated on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west corner. Pens 5, 6
and 7 each have a perimeter gate. At the back of the pens, under the front of the west stand, there is a gate in

                                                        4
each radial fence. When those gates are open, the back row of the terracing is intended to permit access from
pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, when substantial numbers are present, those gateways are not
readily visible or accessible. The present layout of the pens, fences, crush barriers and gates has resulted from a
series of piecemeal changes. The nature and effect of those changes must be considered later.

The Turnstiles
  29. Because of the housing in Vere Road there is no access from the north side of the ground. Along
Penistone Road North there are some 46 turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop and to the east
end of the north stand. They are marked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. The 12 numbered 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the north stand but were not used for that purpose on 15 April in order to segregate supporters of the
two teams as appears later. Two of them, 77 and 78, were however used for access to the Kop.

  30. At the south side of the ground there were 24 turnstiles (numbered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
numbered 37 to 42 led to the Kop and the rest to the south stand.

  31. In summary, the south and east sides of the ground accommodated some 29,800 whose access on the
day was through 60 turnstiles.

  32. The other two sides of the ground, north and west, with a capacity of 24,256 were fed solely from the
Leppings Lane entrance where there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to the Ground
  33. Most supporters were expected to come by road although rail transport was available. Nottingham
supporters travelling by train would arrive at the main line Sheffield Midland Station whence they would be
directed and escorted northwards by the police. They would arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
Nottingham supporters travelling by coach, mini-bus or car would approach Sheffield from the south mainly
on the M 1. Again their arrival at the ground would predominantly be via Penistone Road or Herries Road.

   34. Liverpool supporters travelling by normal rail service would arrive at Sheffield Midland Station just
like their Nottingham counterparts. The police aimed to segregate the rival fans and put them into separate
coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
catering solely for football supporters and situated to the north of the ground. A police escort was available to
conduct them on foot to the Leppings Lane entrance. Those coming from Liverpool by road would approach
Sheffield either via the M62 and down the M 1 from the north or across the Pennines from the north west. All
such routes would bring them to the ground via one or other limb of Leppings Lane as shown on Appendix 1.
Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north and west; arrivals from Nottingham
would be from the south and east.

Allocation of Places and Tickets
  35. Experience in recent years has produced a policy of segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
of rival teams. The need for this policy to be maintained was endorsed and emphasised by the Popplewell
Report following the Bradford City disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1988 semi-final the police decided
that sections of the Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation of
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans. The section to be granted to each was determined by the direction
whence each predominantly approached. Thus, Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides of the ground
for which access was from Leppings Lane. Nottingham Forest were allotted the south and east sides with access
from Penistone Road.

   36. The effect of the decision was that for this all-ticket Cup Tie, Liverpool were allotted only 24,256 places
as against 29,800 for Nottingham Forest. This, although average attendance of supporters at home matches
was substantially higher at Liverpool than at Nottingham. Moreover, with standing tickets at £6 and seats at
£ 12, Nottingham Forest had 21,000 standing places compared with Liverpool’s 10,100. So, Liverpool’s
allocation was more expensive as well as smaller. Understandably, Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
of places and tickets. They sought with some support from the host club and the FA to have it changed in
1988, but the police were adamant. To switch ends would, in their opinion, have involved rival supporters
crossing each other’s paths when approaching the ground thereby frustrating attempts at segregation and
creating a risk of disorder. In 1989, when the same plan was proposed, Liverpool again challenged it. The
police, however, maintained their view, adding that those who had attended in 1988 would be familiar with the
arrangements and that any change would lead to confusion.
Access from Leppings Lane
   37. As the plan Appendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck or forecourt at
a bend in Leppings Lane where, coming from the north, it turns to the south-west and crosses a bridge over the
river Don. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north and west of the ground. They
were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs of Leppings Lane and would converge on the
forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line of railings with six sets of double gates. Inside
those perimeter gates is the short approach to the turnstiles. As shown in the photographs Appendix 2, the
latter are in two sections divided by a fence. The northern section consists of turnstiles 1 to 16. Numbers 1 to
 10 gave access to the north stand. Thus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9,700 with north stand seats. Their
tickets were marked "Entrance A" and were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
letter A above them and brown boards on the wall.

   38. Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for those with seats in the west stand. Thus 4,456 were served by six turnstiles.
They were the next block to the right of those marked A. However, instead of these turnstiles and the west stand
tickets being marked B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were marked C. Their colour-code on
tickets and boards was red.
   39. On the other side of the dividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
10,100 with tickets for the west terracing. Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. This was because there
had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the sequential numbering continued from 19 upwards
on the south side of the ground. When the number at Leppings Lane was brought up to 23 the present
arrangements of 1 to 16, A to G and then 19 upwards was adopted to avoid re-numbering all round the ground.
However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. "Entrance B" also appeared on tickets for the west
terrace. Thus, the three blocks of turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane end read from
left to right A, C, B. The colour-code for west terrace tickets and the boards beside turnstiles A to G was mauve.
To the right of turnstile G is a tubular steel barrier to divide the queue for that turnstile from the roadway to the
south stand.

Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
  40. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. There is an exit gate (marked A
on Appendix 1 ) between turnstile 1 and the adjacent housing.

  41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 and 7 and the steps to the west stand. There is a
wall dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G. It had been built to segregate home and away fans at a
time when the Club intended they should share the west terrace. That idea was not pursued but the wall
remained. There was, however, a gateway in the wall which did permit access between the two areas. An exit
gate (marked B on Appendix l) was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

  42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse bounded on the left by the wall just
mentioned and on the right by the wall of the private roadway coming from the south stand to Leppings Lane.
There was an exit gate in the latter wall (marked C on Appendix 1) just inside turnstile G.
  43. All three exit gates, A, B and C, were of concertina design. They could be opened only from the inside
and were not intended for entry of spectators into the ground.
   44. Those entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. They could by
moving to the right go round the south end of the west stand and gain entry into pens 1 and 2. They could go
through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse behind turnstiles 11 to 16 and then round the north
end of the west stand into pens 6 or 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting them to take either of
those courses. The obvious way in was straight ahead of the turnstiles where a tunnel under the middle of the
west stand gave access to pens 3 and 4. Above its entrance in large letters was the word "Standing" and a large
letter "B’. Thus B ticket holders were drawn towards the tunnel.
  45. The length of the tunnel is some 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels offbut finally descends
towards the terraces at a gradient of 1 in 6. As it emerges onto the terrace, the way ahead is bisected by the radial
fence between pen 3 on the right and pen 4 on the left. A short spur of brick wall projects forward from each side
of the tunnel at its mouth. Those emerging are thus guided straight forward rather than to either side. The
photograph at Appendix 3 shows the west stand and terraces.
   46. As with the layout on the terraces, the configuration of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the areas inside
them was effected by a series of piecemeal changes. Again, it will be necessary to analyse their resultant effect.
Policing Arrangements
  47. At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been under the control of Chief Superintendent Mole, then
Commander of F Division within whose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
the FA broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over command ofF Division on 27 March to
Superintendent Duckenfield on the latter’s promotion to Chief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 March, but on 27 March Mr Mole bowed out and Mr Duckenfield took over. Under him were
Sector Commanders, all Superintendents with much experience of policing football matches at Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular, Superintendent Marshall was in charge of the area outside the Leppings Lane
entrance and the approaches to it. Superintendent Greenwood was in command inside the ground, but this
included the area between the turnstiles and the perimeter fence. They thereby swapped roles from the
previous year. Under Mr Duckenfield’s overall command were some 801 officers and men on duty at the
ground plus traffic officers and others from D Division to deal with the influx of supporters into the city centre.
In all, therefore, some l, 122 police were deployed for this match amounting to about 38 per cent of the total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the mounted section of 34 were officers from Liverpool and Nottingham to
assist respectively in marshalling their home supporters. The total at the ground was divided into serials
consisting usually of eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. The serials were posted to duties
at various stations in and around the ground in three phases: before, during and after the match. All of this
was provided for in an Operational Order which followed closely the Order drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
and took into account the force’s "Standing Instructions for the Policing of Football Grounds". The Order
described the duties of each serial at each phase. It was supplemented by oral briefings before and on the day of
the match.

Sheffield Wednesday’s Arrangements
  48. The Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile operators for duty on 15 April. The stewards
were briefed as to their duties on the morning of the match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the
ground. They wore yellow tabards. The Club’s control room, situated below the south stand, could
communicate by VHF radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in their control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A computerised counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the running total of
spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end, there would be
separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). When the total for any section was within 15 per cent of its permitted capacity a warning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing that warning would occur when the numbers were within 15 per
cent of the total terrace capacity of 10,100. What the system could not do was monitor the distribution of fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no warning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

Police Communications
  49. The nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west corner of the
ground between the south stand and pen 1 of the west terracing. The box is elevated and reached by a number
of steps. It has windows commanding views across the pitch and straight along the line of the west perimeter
fence. The box is very small and has seats for only three officers. Superintendent Murray was in control of it
and was advisor to Mr Duckenfield as he had been to Mr Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant
Goddard who operated the radios. The third seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone
and public address systems. At the back of the box stood Police Constable Bichard who was in control of the
police closed circuit television system operated by a row of consoles on a bench in front of him and behind the
three seated officers.

  50. There were five television screens showing views of five roving cameras fixed at high points on the
stands and directed both inside and outside the ground. There was also a master screen which flicked in
rotation from one camera view to another and which made a video recording. The cameras have a zoom
facility to close in on any point of interest. Specifically, there were good camera views of the west terracing, of
the Leppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them of Leppings Lane itself.

  51. The Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
ground and outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed under the police control box, to relay
music before the match, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
speakers or if appropriate to one area only.
   53. Radio contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside and outside the ground was
UHF on channel 25. There was a W1 FU portable base station in the control box and if it failed there was a
stand-by station under the operator’s bench. Hand sets were issued to all ranks of Sergeant and above.
Community Constables on duty would already have their own. Other Constables had no radio.
Communication was on "talk through" i.e. any message from any source would be heard by everyone tuned in
and if rnore than one source spoke messages could become garbled. Ear pieces were issued to some officers in
an attempt to overcome the loud crowd noise which made receipt of signals very difficult. There were other
radio channels open to Sergeant Goddard: VHF to police Headquarters at Snig Hill, channel 35 to F1
Sub-divisional Headquarters at Hammerton Road and channel 19 used by CID. There was also a set tuned to
Sheffield Wednesday’s radio system between its control room and the stewards.

                                   15th APRIL: THE BUILD-UP TO 2.30pm

Early Arrivals
   54. 15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Saturday. The match was a sell-out, so 54,000 ticket holders
were expected. Others would come without tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain access otherwise.
The following account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western approaches and the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite early in
small numbers. Some brought cans of beer with them and were seen drinking as they walked; others took
advantage of the weather and sat about on walls and open spaces. When the public houses opened, many
resorted there, drinking inside or spilling out into the sunshine. Leppings Lane and its environs comprise a
mixed shopping and residential area. Local residents saw groups of Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
house or off-licence. Many were asking for tickets or "spares". There were a few touts selling them at inflated
prices. From an early stage, some of the fans were using private gardens and yards to urinate. As the morning
wore on, numbers increased. Requests for tickets and trespass to urinate also increased. Still the prevailing
mood was one of carnival, good humour and expectation.

Public Houses
  55. There were some 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am.
Liverpool supporters did visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great amount of alcoholic drink was
bought there.
  56. Opening time at public houses was in general 11 am. Some remained closed all day. Of the others, some
72, mostly in the city, were frequented by local patrons only. Some 23 public houses, however, served over a
hundred Liverpool supporters each. Another 51 served more than 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
many supporters drank enough to affect their mood. At first excitement: later frustration.

The Gathering Crowd
   57. Towards the end of the morning, fans gathered on and around the bridge near the Leppings Lane
entrance. They seemed reluctant to enter the ground early. All turnstiles were open at 12 noon and one or two
as early as 11.30 am. Some 53 police had been deployed to operate outside the turnstiles and in the Leppings
Lane area. They enquired at random whether fans had tickets. Those who had not were advised to go away;
nevertheless, many returned more than once. Those who had tickets were guided in the right direction. The
police tried to persuade them to enter the ground early. Officers, male and female, had been posted outside
each turnstile with the duty of searching entrants for weapons, drink or drugs. Once through the turnstile, an
entrant was liable to be searched again by one of a serial of officers positioned just inside.

   58. At about 12 noon Chief Inspector Creaser asked Superintendent Murray whether the pens on the west
terrace were to be filled one by one successively, but was told that they should all be available from the start and
the fans should find their own level.
   59. By 2 pm it was apparent to those inside the ground and those monitoring events in the police and Club
control rooms that the number of Nottingham fans in their places greatly outnumbered those from Liverpool.
The Kop and the south stand were filling up steadily, but the north and west stands were half empty. It was
noted about that time that the turnstile figures showed only 12,000 had entered as against 20,000 at the same
time the previous year. On the west terraces, although pens 3 and 4 were filling, the wing pens 1,2, 6 and 7 were
nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 and 4 to move forward and make room for
others.
  60. There had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. This time, there was only one. It arrived
early, just before 2 pm, at Wadsley Bridge station. The 350 passengers were met by both mounted and foot
police officers who escorted them in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. They were orderly and passed through
the turnstiles into the ground by about 2.20 pm without incident.

  61. By this time the police Traffic Division reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the majority of
Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. The numbers converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
increasing rapidly. Between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles the crowd became congested. There was no
longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx filling the whole approach area. The foot officers
outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone and had difficulty in searching even selectively.
Mounted officers in and outside the turnstile area were having difficulty manoeuvring in such a dense crowd.
The police were beset by fans bemused by the ticket and turnstile labelling asking for directions. Many had
been drinking but up to and just after 2.30 pm the mood remained good.
   62. Superintendent Marshall was on foot amongst the crowd. He became anxious about the numbers
coming down Leppings Lane and spilling out onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving. At 2.17
pm he radioed to control to have motor traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. This was eventually done at about
2.30 pro. Up to this time, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles and the numbers still approaching, there
was still no panic in the crowd; no perception of crisis by the police. In the control room Mr Murray, who could
see Leppings Lane on the video, advised Mr Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. Mr
Duckenfield reaffirmed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be ordered only if there was some
major external factor such as fog on the Pennines or delay on the motorway: not if spectators merely turned up
late even in large numbers,

                                                CHAPTER 3

                                   THE CRISIS AT THE TURNSTILES

   63. In the 20 minutes from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm there were crucial developments both inside and outside
the ground. In pens 3 and 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as more fans came through the tunnel to the
favoured area behind the goal. By 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a degree which caused serious
discomfort to many well used to enduring pressure on terraces. The numbers at that time were clearly in excess
of the maximum density stated by the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 Edn) (the Green
Guide) i.e. 54 persons per 10 square metres. (Although the Green Guide has no statutory or legal force, it is the
only official advice available about safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens 1, 2, 6 and 7, there was still
ample room and bare patches of concrete were visible.
  64. Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As more arrived at the back the crush at the
front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles became more difficult. Their efficiency was impaired and their rate
reduced. Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the build-up increased. The foot
officers outside were unable to function and in danger themselves so they went through the turnstiles and out
again through gate C where they did what they could to relieve pressure by the tubular barrier. The mounted
officers were surrounded by the dense mass of people and became ineffective. Superintendent Marshall was in
the midst of the turmoil. He extricated himself and stood on a parapet of the bridge to get a clear view. A
drunken fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a mounted officer. But these were isolated acts by
individuals; the menace came from the massive numbers single-mindedly determined to be in for the kick-off
with time running out. At the back of the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack of progress as 3 o’clock
approached. Some, mostly young men who had been drinking, tried to push and force their way forward. At
the front, people were jammed together and against the turnstile walls. Some panicked as the pressure
intensified. Some youngsters and women were fainting and in distress. They were helped out through the
tubular barrier by turnstile G or were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans climbed up and over the
turnstile building or on to the dividing fence. This was to escape the crush rather than to gain free entry since
most of them had tickets.
  65. At 2.44 pm Mr Marshall radioed for reinforcements, for the Tannoy to request the crowd to stop
pushing and for a vehicle with loudspeaker equipment to come and request the same. Unhappily, at about 2.40
pm, radio communication on channel 25 became defective. For a period of two or three minutes the control
room lost contact. A communications officer came promptly and switched to the standby station. With the use
of a handset at control, contact was restored. Despite this hiatus, two of Mr Marshall’s requests were received.
The Tannoy was used but with little effect. Reinforcements, including mounted officers from Penistone Road,
were sent. The third request, for a Landrover, was received direct by its driver PC Buxton who arrived at 2.46
pm and urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. This was no more effective than the Tannoy. The
mounted officers besieged near the turnstiles came outside the perimeter gates. An attempt was made to shut
them against the crowd outside, to enable the throng inside to be dispersed or at least thinned through the
turnstiles. The pressure from without, however, opened the gates again. Mounted officers, now reinforced to
greater numbers, formed a cordon across the elbow of Leppings Lane from the sweet shop to the bridge, again
with the object of reducing pressure inside the gates. They were successful in this for some minutes despite
desperate individuals forcing their way under or between the horses. However, this exercise was overtaken by a
more dramatic relief of the pressure.
"Open the Gates"
  66. Between 2.40 pm and 2.45 pm the crowd inside and outside the turnstile approach had swelled to
over 5,000. At the head of the phalanx conditions had become intolerable. Those who got through were short
of breath and sweating profusely. Many complained to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
and asked them in forceful terms to do something. Exit gates A and B were being shaken. It was clear the crowd
could not pass through the turnstiles by 3 pm. Police Constable Buxton radioed from the Landrover to control
asking that kick-offbe postponed. The suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

  67. Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had become unmanageable. Although loth to do so, since it
was contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure.
Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. Other senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he
radioed control to permit the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm, whilst Mr Duckenfield was considering the
request, gate C opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
advantage and about 150 managed to get in before a mounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. Mr
Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He repeated it a third time, adding that if the

                                                       11
gates were not opened someone was going to be killed. In the control room, Mr Duckenfield had not made a
decision. Mr Murray asked him "Are you going to open the gates?". Mr Duckenfield gave the order and Sgt
Goddard radioed to Mr Marshall "Open the gates". Neither the Club control room nor any police officers
inside the turnstiles were told of this order before or after it was given or of any action it would require.

  68. At 2.52 pm, gate C was opened wide. Fans behind turnstiles A to G and from the concourse beyond
came round to flow through it in large numbers.

   69. About two minutes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite the gateman’s
objection, for it to be opened. If it was not, he said, "It’ll go and someone will get killed". Permission was given,
but this time reserve serials were alerted to monitor the inrush towards the north stand. Gate B was also briefly
opened against the gateman’s wishes and about 200 of those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
left.

  70. The largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the five minutes it was open about 2,000 fans passed
through it steadily at a fast walk. Some may have had tickets for the stands. No doubt some had no tickets at all.
The majority had tickets for the terraces. Of these, some found their way either right to pens 1 and 2 or left
through the dividing wall to 6 and 7. But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnel in front of them.

                                              THE DISASTER

   71. The initial influx through gate C, augmented by entrants via the turnstiles, came through the tunnel
with great momentum. Fans spoke of being swept through, feet offthe ground. The 1 in 6 gradient accelerated
their progress. Upon reaching the crowded pens, some wished to go back but were unable to do so. The new
arrivals found themselves pushed forward and the pressure became intense. At 2.54 pro, shortly after this
influx began, the teams came onto the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. Many were now
acutely uncomfortable and some were in distress. The mass seethed about but voluntary movement by any
individual was difficult; hands down could not be raised and some fans found it hard to breathe. Still the flow
continued through the tunnel causing further surges forward. There were shouts for help and for the gates to be
opened to the pitch. Police officers on the perimeter track did not immediately react. In the deafening noise
from chanting and shouting they did not at first recognise the problem. Realisation came at different moments
to different officers in different places.
  72. Gate 3 sprang open under the intense pressure from within. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
afterwards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. Those seeking to escape were urged and pushed back. Gate
4 was opened by a policeman who noticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it and were directed
to the wing pens where there was still ample room. Meanwhile, gate 4 was closed again and then re-opened. At
gate 3, a Constable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his written orders and radioed for permission to
open that gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon himself to open it.
  73. Just before 3 pro, the match kicked off. At the same time, gate C, which had been closed at 2.57 pm,
was reopened and a steady trickle continued to enter through the tunnel.
   74. To escape the crush, fans began climbing the radial fences out of pens 3 and 4 into pens 2 and 5. Others
tried to get over the front perimeter fence but were at first turned back by police who feared a pitch invasion.
Near the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the point of collapse and in some instances death but
they were held upright by pressure all round. Further back, most were so preoccupied with the pain of being
pressed against barriers and with breathing problems that they saw nothing of the game. But at the rear there
were many who, although cramped, were watching the football unaware of the distress at the front.
  75. At 3.04 pm, Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. There was a roar from the
Liverpool fans and at the same time a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. The several surges which occurred after
the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens towards the pitch. The force became such as to twist
and break two spans of a crush barrier towards the front of pen 3. The evidence does not establish with
certainty when this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm. But I am sure it occurred after
the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. When the barrier broke those whom it had
supported were projected towards the perimeter fence. Many fell and the involuntary rush of those behind
pressed them down. The crushing force was transmitted and dispersed so that all along the front of pen 3 fans
were pressed hard up against the low wall and the wire mesh of the fence above it.
  76. In pen 4 no barrier broke. Nevertheless those at the front were crushed against wall and fence. Further
back, two barriers were bowed and some individuals succumbed to the pressure around them.
   77. Surges on terraces are common. Usually, they go forward, then recede. Here, with the weight of
numbers, there was no receding. The pressure stayed and for those crushed breathless by it, standing or prone,
life was ebbing away. If no relief came in four minutes there would be irreversible brain damage; if longer,
death.
  78. In the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything amiss in pens 3 and 4 until the first
fans spilt out onto the perimeter track just before kick-off. Then, the officers in command assumed that there
was an attempted pitch invasion. They called up reserve serials waiting in the gymnasium and all available
officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was made to HQ for dog handlers.
   79. Superintendent Greenwood, the Ground Commander, was by the players’ tunnel at the kick-off. He
noticed fans on the track and went to the west end behind the goal. As he approached, he did not think the pens
overcrowded until he was very close and saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
situation "retrievable" if those higher up the pen relieved the pressure. He climbed on the wall below the fence
and signalled with both hands to those behind to move back. Other officers joined him. It was impossible.
Those fans who would have wished to comply were powerless to do so. Behind them, there were still many

                                                       13
unaware of the crisis, watching the game. The football continued to joyous shouting and singing round the rest
of the ground while those crushed and trapped slowly expired.

   80. When Mr Greenwood’s signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for the match to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his arms towards the control
box. Mr Duckenfield sent Mr Murray down from the box to have the match stopped via the linesman, the
agreed emergency drill. Before he could do so, Mr Greenwood ran over the pitch to the referee who stopped the
game. It was 5’~ minutes past 3.




                                                      14
                                                 CHAPTER 5

                                             THE AFTERMATH
Rescue Attempts
   81. From 3 o’clock, gates 3 and 4 had been open and remained so. At first, fans had walked or staggered out
winded and faint. But the final surge at 3.04 pm, and the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a horrendous
blockage of bodies. The dead, the dying and the desperate became interwoven in the sump at the front of the
pens, especially by the gates. Those with strength left clambered over others submerged in the human heap and
tried to climb out over the fence. They were now helped by police and other fans who hauled them up and over.
Numbers of fans were climbing over the radial fences into adjacent pens. At the back, many were hauled up
into the west stand to relieve the pressure.
   82. The steps from the sump at gateways 3 and 4 were so congested with bodies live and dead that each had
to be prised from the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A number of individual
officers and fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow that only two or three
could get at the entwined bodies Willing hands got in one another’s way. More officers arrived from the
gymnasium and elsewhere in the ground. Many used their own initiative to help those laid out on the pitch, to
assist in getting others over the fencing and to comfort the distressed. But some stood in groups near the
perimeter fence not knowing what to do. They had been summoned in response to what was thought to be a
threat to public order. What they found was a horrific scene of carnage and some young officers were shocked
into impotence by what they saw.

  83. It was truly gruesome. The victims were blue, cyanotic, incontinent; their mouths open, vomiting; their
eyes staring. A pile of dead bodies lay and grew outside gate 3. Extending further and further on to the pitch, the
injured were laid down and attempts made to revive them. More and more walking survivors flooded out on to
the pitch as the players left. The scene was emotive and chaotic as well as gruesome. As the enormity of the
disaster was realised, many of the fans milling about were bitter and hostile to the police, blaming them for
what had happened. Officers were confronted, abused, spat upon and even assaulted. A small number of
hysterical fans had to be subdued.

   84. Adding to the chaos, a number of press photographers dodged about among rescue workers apparently
avid to secure photographs at point blank range of those dying through the wire mesh and those laid on the
pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them. Police had to intervene.
   85. At about 3.12 pm, Chief Superintendent Nesbit, Commander of the Traffic Division, arrived on the
pitch. He took charge at gate 3 and organised a chain of officers to simplify and expedite the extraction of
casualties from the pen. In the absence of any mechanical means, police and fans together pulled and worked
at the wire mesh with their bare hands and their feet to breach the fencing. They succeeded in both pens,
enabling officers to get in and fans to be got out.
   86. By now, some officers of their own initiative went round from the pitch to the tunnel where they met
other officers from the turnstiles and the west stand. Together, they tried to persuade fans at the rear of the pens
to go back through the tunnel. Some complied, but many resisted, wishing to stand their ground. Casualties
were brought out through the tunnel, and as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
further in and bring out more casualties, dead and alive. They were laid on the ground in the concourse outside
the tunnel and attempts were made to revive them.
First Aid
  87. The St John Ambulance Brigade had some 30 personnel posted round the ground for the match - 25
adults and 5 junior cadets, They were quickly on the scene when the first casualties emerged and sought to
revive them. Their Divisional Superintendent, Mr Wells, tried unsuccessfully to help those pressed against the
fencing by feeding oxygen to them through the mesh until they could be got out.
  88. Dr Purcell, Sheffield Wednesday’s doctor, came from his seat in the south stand and attempted
resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he moved from patient to patient doing what he could,
but in most cases it was too late.
  89. At 3.13 pm a St John’s ambulance came onto the pitch at the north-east corner and drove to the
perimeter fence close to gate 3. There was no call for doctors and nurses on the public address system until
nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the minutes ticked past, some of them came onto the pitch to help of their

                                                        15
own accord when they saw the casualties and the ambulance and realised the gravity of the situation. Many
fans also worked prodigiously in attempts to revive the dead and the dying, in some cases their own relatives
and friends. Artificial respiration, mouth to mouth respiration and cardiac massage were applied by the skilled
and the unskilled but usually in vain. Those capable of survival mostly came round of their own accord. The
rest were mostly doomed before they could be brought out and treated.
   90. There was an urgent need to get casualties offthe pitch and to hospital. There were six stretchers in the
first aid room and three in the St John’s ambulance. They were quickly brought into use. Then the fans
improvised by tearing down the hoardings around the edge of the pitch and against the stands so that lengths of
board could be used as stretchers. Improvising in this way, parties of fans and police ran repeatedly the length
of the pitch bearing casualties to the north-east corner. A number were dead on arrival there.
In the Control Room
   91. Mr Duckenfield stayed in the control room. Chief Inspector McRobbie was there in civilian clothes as
 an observer. Mr Duckenfield sent him down to the track to tell a policewoman at gate 1 to admit those
 displaced from the centre pens. Mr Duckenfield did not realise there were injuries until he saw someone laid
 on the pitch. Even then, he did not realise the nature of the problem or its scale.
  92. Mr Murray returned from his attempt to stop the match and Mr Duckenfield sent him down again to
clear the pitch and assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear the pitch. This was
because Mr Duckenfield could not from the control room see clearly what was happening for the milling and
increasing numbers.

  93. The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations), Mr Jackson, had attended the match in civilian clothes as
a guest of the Club. He came from his seat in the south stand to ask what had happened. Mr Duckenfield was
unable to say; he did not tell Mr Jackson that the exit gates had been opened on his authority. Mr Jackson went
down to the pitch to discover the situation.
  94. At 3.06 pm Mr Duckenfield, still primarily concerned about public order, caused a message to be sent
to Headquarters asking for Operation Support. That was a call for all available additional police resources to
come to the ground to strengthen the police presence.
   95. Mr Jackson was told by Mr Greenwood that there were casualties and returned immediately to control
to make sure emergency services were alerted. Meanwhile, Mr Murray had seen the plight of those behind the
fence. He radioed to control that a fleet of ambulances was required. He also asked for a Tannoy broadcast to
those in the pens to move back but there is no clear evidence that it was made.
  96. Only when Mr Duckenfield received the request for a fleet of ambulances did he realise the nature and
gravity of the situation. Then, supported by Mr Jackson, he caused messages to be sent converting Operation
Support into calls for the Major Disaster Plan.
No Information
   97. Apart from the message to clear the pitch and the belated call for medical assistance about 3.30 pm, no
information or advice was broadcast on the public address system. Mr Duckenfield feared that the crowd
might turn hostile or might all attempt to leave together thereby hampering the emergency services if they were
given information about what had happened. The result was that apart from those close enough at the west end
to see the terrible truth for themselves, the majority of the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
Nottingham supporters in the Kop, still thought there had been a pitch invasion or other misbehaviour by
Liverpool fans. They continued singing and chanting incongruously. This infuriated some Liverpool fans who
were already distraught. A few began to run towards the Kop end. The police feared violence might result on
top of the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large number of officers to form a line across the
width of the pitch at the Kop end and advance up to the halfway line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
moved. There the line stood as an insurance against disorder but doing nothing. Other officers were posted to
the perimeter track facing the north stand for the same purpose. To those distressed and distraught who
wanted urgent action, this large contingent of passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
intensified.
Misinformation
 98. At about 3.15 pm, Mr Graham Kelly, Chief Executive of the FA, Mr Kirton also of the FA and Mr
Graham Mackrell, Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday, went to the control room for information. Mr
Duckenfield told them he thought there were fatalities and the game was likely to be abandoned. He also said a

                                                      16
gate had been forced and there had been an inrush of Liverpool supporters. He pointed to one of the television
screens focussed on gate C by the Leppings Lane turnstiles and said "That’s the gate that’s been forced: there’s
been an inrush". Inevitably Mr Kelly was interviewed a little later live on television. He spoke of the two stories
concerning the gate - the fans’ account that the police had opened it, the police assertion that the fans had
forced their way in.

  99. About 3.30 pm there was a further meeting in the Club’s boardroom. Mr Duckenfield went there and
met Mr Kelly, the referee and representatives of the three clubs. ACC Jackson was also there. Mr
Duckenfield indicated the match was likely to be abandoned although no firm ruling was given. He added that
he did not want people to know it was to be abandoned lest the dispersing crowd hamper the emergency
operations.

Public Announcements
   100. Later the managers of the two teams were asked to go to the control room. They were invited there to
make a public announcement to calm the crowd. Mr Kenny Dalglish agreed to do so. He told the crowd that
there were problems and asked them to assist the police and those rendering first aid. He asked for calm and his
message was well received. It was then 3.56 pm. At 4. l0 pm it was announced that the match was abandoned
for that day. Again that message was received calmly by the crowd most of whom behaved responsibly as they
dispersed.

Fire Brigade
   101. Meanwhile the emergency services had been in action. At about 3.10 pm a request came from the
perimeter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the wire mesh. Sergeant Goddard contacted the police garage
close by without success. At 3.13 pm, PC Bichard requested Headquarters to call the fire service to bring
hydraulic cutting equipment to the Leppings Lane entrance.

   102. There was no arrangement for a fire officer to be present during the match. However, the Major
Disaster Plan required all emergency services to be alerted. After ’phone messages which must be described
later, fire appliances arrived at both Leppings Lane and Penistone Road at 3.22 pm. At both entrances their
arrival surprised police who were uninformed as to why they had been called or where they should go.

  103. At Leppings Lane a police Inspector told Station Officer Swain "I don’t really think we need you".
Another police officer then asked for more resuscitators as people were dying so Mr Swain radioed for ten fire
appliances. Each carries oxygen and resuscitation equipment.

   104. At the Kop end, Leading Fireman Housley arrived with an emergency tender and Station Officer
Fletcher in another appliance, each with a crew. The emergency tender came along the roadway by the south
stand but owing to its height was unable to proceed further. It therefore backed out and went to the Leppings
Lane entrance losing some eight minutes. From there, Mr Housley and his crew went onto the pitch with
resuscitation equipment. They rendered help there and later at the gymnasium. Mr Fletcher and his men ran
along behind the south stand carrying cutting equipment and oxygen cylinders. When they arrived at the
fence, the cutting equipment was not required as by then the last of the dead and injured were being removed
from the pens. Mr Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area under the police box and firemen assisted in carrying
victims as well as rendering first aid on the pitch.

South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYMAS)
   105. Before 1986 there had been no SYMAS representative routinely present at Hillsborough matches. The
Club was content, as indeed are many other clubs, to rely upon the St John’s Ambulance Brigade and a 999 call
if necessary. From 1986 onwards, after representations, the Club provided two seats in the south stand for
SYMAS staff at League matches. At one stage it was suggested they would be best placed in the north stand
close to the gymnasium which had been designated as the casualty centre in the event of a major incident. The
south stand seats were allotted as they placed the SYMAS staff closer to the players’ tunnel should a player be
injured. These seats were, however, not available at Cup semi-finals. SYMAS representatives nevertheless
attended at the semi-finals by arrangement with the police in 1988 and again in 1989. The SYMAS officers
stood on the ramp leading to the pitch at the north-east corner. They had one ambulance outside the ground
and one on standby.

   106. On 15 April 1989, Officers Higgins and Eason were at the ground with an ambulance and crew. They
noticed fans on the track and went to the Leppings Lane end whilst the game was still in progress. They began
to attend to casualties. Meanwhile, at 2.59 pm, there had been a call from Police Constable Waugh at police

                                                        17
Headquarters to the Hillsborough police control asking if ambulances were required. This was on the
instruction of Chief Inspector Edmundson who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
himself, crowd noise and snatches of speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress and possible injuries. The
reply from the control box was: no reports of injuries but keep standing by. At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
ground that there might be injuries, police Headquarters notified SYMAS that ambulances might be required.
Then, seconds later, Mr Murray’s request for a fleet of ambulances was relayed to SYMAS. They reacted at
once. Ambulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entrance at 3.13 pm and at the Penistone Road
entrance at 3.17 pm. In all, some 42 ambulances attended, 31 of them from SYMAS and 11 from
neighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm, they had conveyed some 172 casualties to the Northern General
Hospital and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

Gymnasium
   107. The gymnasium had been in use for serving meals to the police. When the Major Disaster Plan was
ordered, it was cleared and divided into two. One end became a temporary mortuary; the other was used as a
casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed and improvised, brought in more and more
casualties, the scene was initially and inevitably chaotic and harrowing. There was intense distress amongst
the injured and bereaved; relatives were reluctant to be parted from the dead and sought to revive them. There
were people looking for missing friends and relations; there were recriminations, there were scuffles. Some of
those involved were the worse for drink. Doctors and nurses had followed the casualties in from the pitch and
sought to attend the injured as best they could in the adverse circumstances. Those in most urgent need of
hospital treatment were taken to ambulances as they arrived, triage being employed to determine priorities.
Doctors were requested by the police to examine each person thought to be deceased to confirm and certify
death. A police Constable was detailed to attend and guard each of the dead and a photograph of each was
taken by a police photographer so that relatives coming to identify bodies could be spared the ordeal of
searching amongst all who had died.

The Dead and the Injured
  108. Of the 95 who died, the evidence suggests that at least 16 and probably 21 came through gate C after it
opened at 2.52 pm. That is established by the statements of relatives and friends who came through with them
but survived.

   109. By commendable hard work, a team of pathologists headed by Professor Usher completed
post-mortem examinations on all the deceased within 48 hours. They found that 88 of the victims were male
and seven female. Thirty-eight were under 20 years of age, 39 were between 20 and 29 years and only three were
over 50. In virtually every case the cause of death was crush asphyxia due to compression of the chest wall
against other bodies or fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In all but nine cases that was the sole cause.
In one, pressure on the chest had been so great as to rupture the aorta; in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck or chest; in the remaining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. Thirteen of those were rib fractures. However, one was a fractured femur, one a fractured
radius and the remaining three involved fractures of bones or cartilages round the voice box. These injuries
suggest the victims may have been trodden while on the ground.
  110. Blood samples were taken from the dead. No alcohol was found in any of the females. Of the males, 51
had no more than 10 milligrams per cent in their blood which is negligible; 15 had over 80 milligrams per cent
and six over 120 milligrams per cent.

  111. Although the great majority of those who died were in pen 3, at least five were in pen 4. Most deaths
occurred at the front of the pens but there were a few fatalities further back.

  112. In all, some 730 people complained of being injured inside the ground and 36 outside it. Of the 730,
about 30% are thought to have entered through gate C after 2.52 pm. The largest category of injury was
bruising, especially to the ribs and chest.

                                         SPECIFIC INCIDENTS

  113. I have given my findings as to the basic factual background and the main sequence of events in
narrative form. There was very little conflict as to the principal events save as to some timings and numbers.
Indeed, the consistency of the evidence has been a remarkable feature of this Inquiry. The experiences of most
witnesses were unforgettable and no doubt the early hearing helped to preserve accurate memory. Also, the
existence of timed videos and photographs and of logged and taped messages provided reliable checks by
which to prompt and test witness recollection. Accordingly, I have not for the most part burdened the narrative
with citations from the evidence of individual witnesses.
   114. However, there were several instances of detailed evidence and assertions being highlighted by the
media in dramatic and emotive terms during the hearing. Since some of those much-publicised incidents gave
rise to unfair criticism, they ought to be the subject of specific findings. I have therefore dealt with them
individually at Appendix 6.

                               PART II - WHY DID IT HAPPEN?


                  "Events of the magnitude of Hillsborough don’t usually happen just for one
              single reason, nor is it usually possible to pin the blame on one single scapegoat...
              . . . Disasters happen because a whole series of mistakes, misjudgments and
              mischances happen to come together in a deadly combination."
                                                               Dr John Habgood, Archbishop of York, preaching at
                                                              the Hillsborough Memorial Service on 23 April 1989.

   I 15. This disaster was the worst in the history of British football. It happened because pens 3 and 4 became
grossly overcrowded. They were uncomfortably overcrowded by 2.50 pm at least to a degree which required
that they should be closed to further arrivals. Even the numbers coming through the turnstiles in the last 10
minutes would have increased the pressure beyond danger point and there would have been injuries if not
fatalities. As it was, the influx through gate C after 2.52 pm so increased the pressure in the two pens as to
cause fatal crushing.

   116. The overcrowding up to 2.52 pm was due to a number of factors which can be considered broadly
under three heads.
   (i) The layout at the Leppings Lane end.
  (ii) Lack of fixed capacities for the pens.
 (iii) Lack of effective monitoring of the terraces.

   117. The crushing and fatalities after 2.52 pm must be considered under a number of headings.
  (iv) The build-up at the turnstiles.
   (v) The blunder on opening the gates.
  (vi) The barriers in pen 3.
 (vii) The crushing not recognised.
(viii) The response of the police.
  (ix) The perimeter gates were too small.

                                                 CHAPTER 7
                             THE LAYOUT AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END
  118. I have already observed that the layout of the turnstile area, of the terraces and of the concourse
between them was the result of piecemeal changes. A brief history of these changes is now necessary.

The History
   119. Before 1965, the Leppings Lane end consisted entirely of terracing like the Kop. In that year, the west
stand was built and the terraces remaining in front of it were truncated to their present depth, front to back. As
to width, they consisted of a single standing area with no dividing fences. During the early 1970’s, hooliganism
and pitch invasions made it necessary to prevent access to the playing area and the perimeter fences were
therefore erected in 1977.

   120. Section 1 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 empowered the Secretary of State to designate a
sports stadium having, in his opinion, accommodation for more than 10,000 as a stadium requiring a
certificate from the local authority. Hillsborough was so designated with effect from 1 January 1979 by SI
1978/1091. In anticipation of that date, Sheffield Wednesday instructed Eastwood and Partners, a firm of
consulting engineers, to act on their behalf especially in their dealings with the local authority. Dr Eastwood,
the principal of the firm, is a highly experienced civil and structural engineer and has advised several major
football clubs. He recommended that a number of additional crush barriers should be added since those
already in place were insufficient to comply with the Green Guide (1976 edition). That work was approved
and carried out during 1979.

  121. The relevant local authority at the time was the South Yorkshire County Council. It set up an Officer
Working Party consisting of representatives of the police, the fire service, its own building surveyor’s division
and its own legal and administration department. The Working Party made inspections and consulted with the
Club and Dr Eastwood. A Safety Certificate was issued on 21 December 1979 for an indefinite period. It has
remained in force ever since and has not been amended.

   122. Schedule 3 of the certificate sets out the maximum crowd capacity for various areas in the ground. The
figure for the west terrace is 7,200 and for the north-west terrace 2,900. These figures were intended to be in
accordance with the Green Guide (1976). Paragraph 15.4 provided for a maximum "packing density" of
between 54 and 27 persons per 10 square metres depending on the condition of the terrace. Dr Eastwood had
calculated 8,000 for the west terrace on the basis of 54 per 10 square metres. He thought this a justified starting
figure in view of his improved system of barriers. However, he reduced it to 7,200 because there were no
gangways on the terrace and he did not think it feasible to provide any. So, the total figure for the Leppings Lane
terraces was and is 10,100.

The 1981 Semi-Final
  123. As already mentioned, there was crushing at the Cup semi-final in 1981. The match was between
Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The police debriefing minutes after the incident
prophetically refer,

  "to the late arrival of a large number of spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane
  enclosure when the match started. The flash point occurred when Tottenham scored" (at the Kop end) "after
  only three minutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was happening and caused a
  crush, which resulted in the injuries".

  124. Those being crushed called for the perimeter gates to be opened onto the track. There was no
immediate reaction, according to Mr Vaux who was there, but fortunately a police Inspector gave instructions
and the gates were then opened. About 250 came out onto the track. There were broken arms, legs and ribs and
38 were treated either in hospital or by the St John Ambulance Brigade. It is clear from the documents (a) that
the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure of l 0,100 had been exceeded by over 400 (b) that the police
shut off further access to the terraces because of crushing, and (c) the police view after the event was that the
capacity figure of 10,100 in the Safety Certificate was too high. This latter view was communicated to the Club
by the Chief Superintendent then in command of F Division but it was not pursued.


                                                       21
Three Pens
   125. After this incident in April 1981 the police requested that the terrace should be divided into sections.
The object was to improve crowd control by reducing sideways movement. Division would enable more even
distribution to be effected when there was a capacity crowd. It would also enable the west end to be used for
both home and away supporters who could be segregated in separate pens, if necessary with an empty pen
between them.
   126. This proposal was agreed by the Club and the Officer Working Party and was approved by the local
authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in November 1981. They are the fence now separating pens
2 and 3 and that now separating 5 and 6. The result was to divide the whole terrace into three pens. Access from
the concourse to the middle pen was through the tunnel and to the wing pens round the sides of the west stand.
Dr Eastwood suggested and illustrated an altered layout which would have provided separate access through
separate banks of turnstiles to the north stand, to each end of the west stand, and to each of the three pens.
Whilst the main object of this was segregation, such a layout would have enabled each of those areas to be
monitored numerically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its maximum capacity was not exceeded. The plan was
not adopted. The maximum capacity for the new centre pen was calculated at 2,200, but no alteration was
made to the Safety Certificate so to limit it nor was there any means mechanically of counting the numbers
going into that pen.
The 1985 Changes
   127. By 1985, Sheffield Wednesday had been promoted to the First Division and was drawing larger
crowds. The improvement of the Leppings Lane end was raised again by the Club and Dr Eastwood prepared a
number of drawings. These illustrated various schemes for achieving segregation by providing more turnstiles
in separate banks and divisions of the concourse. The police wanted further divisions of the terrace itself,
again to improve control and segregation. There was much discussion of these schemes which included
suggestions of 29 and even 34 turnstiles in total. In the result, the following alterations were carried out in
1985.
New Radial Fences
   128. On the terraces, two more radial fences were fitted. One divided the existing central pen into the
present pens 3 and 4. Gates were fitted at the mouth of the tunnel to enable each of those pens to be closed off.
The second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create the narrow pen 5 intended to be a sterile area. Until
those two fences were added there existed only perimeter gates 1,2, 4, 5 and 6. The creation of pen 3 required a
new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.
Barriers
   129. The lines of the new radial fences ran across existing crush barriers so that without modification those
barriers would have run through the fencing. The police considered the barriers would be used by fans as
convenient mounting points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating their object. They therefore wished
spans to be removed from the barriers. Had their wishes been met in full the result would have been an
unimpeded run in pen 3 from the mouth of the tunnel down the south side of the new fence to the perimeter. Dr
Eastwood dug his heels in against that proposal which he rightly regarded as dangerous. He did however agree
to some modification to the middle row of barriers in the newly created pen 3, chiefly to facilitate access.
Likewise in the new pen 5. The 1985 modifications to the pens are shown on the plan Appendix 4.

The Turnstiles and Concourse
   130. At the entrance, modification but no increase in number was made at the turnstiles. The bank 1 to 16
was divided from A to G by the metal fence now in place and that division was projected across the concourse
inside the turnstiles in the form of a brick wall. A personnel gate was provided for access through that wall but
was enlarged to its present size at the request of the police. Those alterations were made in the interests of
segregation. The more elaborate divisions which Dr Eastwood had suggested, giving separate access to each
sub-division of the accommodation, were not pursued for financial reasons. In May 1985 the Bradford
disaster occurred. The south stand at Hillsborough had wooden decking and the Club realised it would have to
undertake expensive remedial works there. The cantilever roof of the same stand was also discovered to
require expensive repairs.
   131. In fact, shortly after the new dividing fence and wall had been built at the Leppings Lane entrance and
concourse, the Club, by agreement with Chief Superintendent Mole, ceased to accommodate home supporters
at the Leppings Lane end. There was therefore no longer any need for segregation at that end, but the wall
remained.

                                                       22
       132. Also in 1985, electronic counting equipment was installed at all turnstiles. This conveyed the running
    count for each bank of turnstiles, for example A to G, to a television screen in the Club control room where the
    figures were displayed. In 1986, an electronic eye was installed in each turnstile booth to catch and record
    anyone who climbed over the turnstile.

    Barrier 144
       133. In June 1986, the police requested that the crush barrier nearest to the tunnel at the entrance to pens 3
    and 4 should be removed to assist the flow of fans into the pens. They found it caused obstruction because it
    was in a good viewing position and spectators liked to stand against it in numbers thereby blocking access by
    others further into the pens. The police also suggested it might hamper effective evacuation through the tunnel
    especially in an emergency. Dr Eastwood considered the pros and cons of this proposal and accepted the police
    view. The Officer Working Party approved the proposal at a meeting on 7 August 1986 on site. Authority was
    given then and there by Mr Bownes on behalf of the Sheffield City Council which had taken over responsibility
    for the Safety Certificate from South Yorkshire County Council on 1 April 1986. Two spans of the barrier were
    therefore removed, leaving only one span in pen 4 as shown on Appendix 4.

    Effects of the Layout
       134. The result of these changes was to divide the terrace into a number of small areas without providing
    any computerised or mechanical means of limiting entry numerically into any one area if all areas were open
    for choice. Before the fences and pens had divided the terrace, the overall figure of 10,100 could be monitored
    via the turnstiles and in theory the crowd could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was not possible strictly to
    ensure compliance with Schedule 3 Part 1 of the Safety Certificate which prescribed a maximum of 2,900 for
    the north-west terrace and 7,200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 of the Safety Certificate
    provides:
      "The number of spectators admitted to the Stadium and to the several areas of spectator accommodation
      within the Stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1 of Schedule 3".

      The Club had to rely upon visual monitoring.
       135. The situation became worse however with the division of the west terrace into pens. Not only were
    there more and smaller discrete areas but some were likely to attract more than their appropriate share of the
     10,100 total. It is well recognised that the area behind the goal is very popular. Moreover, the position of the
    tunnel vis-a-vis the turnstiles A to G, its labelling and the absence of signposts advertising the wing pens would
    draw to it those with terrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely that pens 3 and 4 would fill to capacity and
    indeed exceed it unless preventive steps were taken. Had Dr Eastwood’s plan for separate turnstile access to
    separate sections with separate toilet and refreshment facilities been implemented, total computerised control
    could have been kept.

                                                   CHAPTER 8
                             LACK OF FIXED CAPACITIES FOR THE PENS
  136. In 1981, when the terrace was divided into three areas, Dr Eastwood gave the Club the figure of 2,200
capacity for the centre pen. He based this on the Green Guide, making such allowances as he thought right. No
doubt the numbers could have been counted in via the turnstiles if only that pen was in use or if such pens as
were in use were filled sequentially, but not otherwise.
  137. After the 1985 changes, Dr Eastwood did not himself give any figures for the new pens 3 and 4.
Someone on his staffhowever split the figure 2,200 into 1,200 for pen 3 and 1,000 for pen 4. Those figures did
not even take account of the fact that pen 5 had been carved out of pen 4 which was bound to have a reducing
effect on capacity. Nevertheless, the figures of 1,200 and 1,000 were put on a drawing emanating from
Eastwood and Partners and the figures have been notionally regarded since as applicable by the Club and the
police. They are in fact too high.
  138. Dr Nicholson, at the Research and Laboratory Services Division of the Health and Safety Executive,
has calculated that the figures for pens 3 and 4 respectively would be 1,015 and 1,036 if the strength and
spacing of the crush barriers had complied with the Green Guide. But they did not.
Departures from the Green Guide
   139. In pen 3, four out of five gaps in the lines of crush barriers do not conform with paragraph 115 of the
Green Guide (1986). In pen 4, nine out often do not conform. In particular, the spans taken out of the barriers
in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess of the maximum of 1.4 metres prescribed. One gap was 57% wider than
the Green Guide maximum. Moreover, that gap was in direct diagonal line from the mouth of the tunnel to the
barrier which collapsed. Dr Eastwood justified these larger gaps by the absence of gangways. Fans had to be
able to get in and out and standard gaps tended to get blocked up. The effect of his reasoning was that the
absence of gangways, recognised as having a safety function, led to the sacrifice of a second safety feature,
namely gaps of strictly limited width.
  140. Again, the removal of barrier 144 was bound, as Dr Eastwood conceded, to affect capacity. In fact it
did more, as I shall indicate later.
   141. Capacity should also have taken account of two further departures from the Green Guide. If, as was
the case, the perimeter gates were not regarded as exits, some 40% of those in pens 3 and 4 were more than 12
metres from an exit (and there was no gangway) contrary to the aim of paragraph 96. Four out of five of the
crush barriers in pen 3 and six out ofnine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
were the old barriers which had been repaired and plated where their bases had corroded and fresh concrete
had been applied, raising the level of the steps. The point is not academic since, in the event, many fans were
bent painfully over barriers under great pressure.
   142. Dr Nicholson calculated that when all relevant factors regarding the configuration and the Green
Guide are taken into account, the maximum capacity for pen 3 should have been 822 and for pen 4, 871.
Safety Certificate
   143. Whatever should have been the maximum capacities for pens 3 and 4, the fact is that no figures at all in
respect of them were put into the Safety Certificate. Despite all the changes in layout of the fences and barriers,
the two figures, 2,900 for the north-west terrace and 7,200 for the west terrace, have remained as the only
maxima with which the Club has to comply.
  144. Section 2(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 provides (so far as is relevant):
  "A Safety Certificate shall contain such terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or
  expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in use..."
  Section 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):
  "Without prejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety Certificate-
  (a) shall specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium;
  (b) may specify the maximum number to be admitted to different parts of it;
  (c) shall include terms and conditions-
  ... (iii) as to the number, strength and situation of any crush barriers."


                                                      24
Section 2(2) was repealed by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987, section 19, which
gave power to the Secretary of State to lay down, by order, terms and conditions. No order has yet been
made and guidance from the Home Office has recommended local authorities to approach their
function under section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2(2). (See Home
Office Circular 71 ! 1987 dated 25 November 1987, Annex A, paragraph 6.)

  145. It is clear that when the certificate was first issued the South Yorkshire County Council went
further than simply to fix the maximum numbers for the whole Stadium. They prescribed figures for
each part of the ground not merely by the four points of the compass but by specified sections.

  146. Section 8(1) of the 1975 Act requires the holder of the certificate before carrying out any
proposals to alter or extend the stadium or any of its installations while a Safety Certificate is in
operation to give notice of those proposals to the local authority. That obligation is specifically
repeated in Sheffield Wednesday’s certificate at Schedule 2 Paragraph 5(2). The Club complied with
the requirement. Having received notice of the alterations to the pens and the barriers, the local
authority ought, in my view, to have amended the Safety Certificate accordingly. They did not do so.

Why was the Safety Certificate not Amended?
  147. Although Dr Eastwood acknowledged that the various changes to the layout would have had
an effect on capacity, he did not take active steps to see that appropriate amendments were made. He
says he mentioned from time to time that the alterations would have an effect on capacity and that he
did not realise the Safety Certificate was not regularly updated. However, I find two memoranda in
early 1987 highly significant. Dr Eastwood’s assistant Mr Strange was concerned with queries from
the FA as to Hillsborough’s capacity for a semi-final. Mr Strange recorded these questions in a
memorandum:-

  "Has any account been taken for alterations done on Leppings Lane over the last few seasons? Is the 10,200
  or so figure still correct? I said that in my opinion it needs to be adjusted, better do it now than later."

  148. Mr Strange’s next memo (a few days later) records as follows:-

  "Dr Eastwood says leave the capacity at Leppings Lane end as it is, providing police have gates under West
  stand open so that people can distribute throughout the terrace evenly."

Although he says the last nine words do not report him accurately, Dr Eastwood accepts the rest of that
message.

   149. In my view the provisions as to capacity in the Safety Certificate ought to have been reviewed and
altered. The unhappy situation is that the police believed even the overall figure of 10,100 to be too high as far
back as 1981. That was reported to the Club but apparently not to Dr Eastwood. Meanwhile, that global figure
had been rendered academic by the sub-division of the terrace which was not reflected in the Safety Certificate
at all. If proper maximum figures had been inserted in the certificate for each of the pens, the Club and the
police might well have been prompted to find some means of limiting the numbers entering those pens other
than by visual monitoring. This could have been done by implementing one of Dr Eastwood’s plans for totally
separate sections, turnstile to viewing area. It could have been done by insisting on sequential filling of pens at
all matches; alternatively, by counting fans into each viewing area.

The City Council
  150. That the Safety Certificate was not amended and individual capacities not reviewed cannot be laid
solely at Dr Eastwood’s door. He was, after all, consultant engineer to the Club and responsibility for the
certificate was that of the local authority. When the South Yorkshire County Council handed over to the
Sheffield City Council, the latter delegated all its powers and duties under the 1975 Act to its General Purposes
Panel. Apparently, therefore, the decision-making body on behalf of the Council was that Panel, although two
specific functions were delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department - the power to issue a
prohibition under section 10 of the 1975 Act and the power of entry and search under section 11 of the Act.

   151. In practice, Mr Bownes, the Council’s Chief Licensing Officer in the Administration and Legal
 Department, bore the brunt of the Council’s duties under the Act.


                                                       25
   152. The Officer Working Party was superseded by a Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group, but
apart from the change of the name the system continued as before. Mr Bownes attended the inspections
and meetings of the Advisory Group together with the representatives of the police, the fire service, the
department of health and consumer services, and the building engineer’s division of the Council. The
latter was an engineer and ought therefore to have been alive to the same issues as Dr Eastwood.

  153. The Advisory Group seems to have worked in a very informal manner. A short passage from Mr
Bownes’ evidence gives the flavour of it:-

   "Q      Who was taking the lead in the working party as you understood it?

     A     That is a good question, sir. Leads were coming from several different directions really.
     Q     Who chaired it, if anyone?

     A     Nobody as such, sir. It was an inspection rather than a meeting as I understand it.

     Q     Who decided what should be inspected?

     A     Effectively the group itself, sir, it seemed to me. There was also some input from the Club
           representative as to, if you like, an element of direction as to what should be looked at.

     Q     Apart from the inspections the working party met, presumably, or did they only meet on
           inspections?
     A     No, sir, I have referred to three previous meetings.

     Q     Who took the chair when it met?
     A     I suppose it could be said that I did, to some extent.

     Q     There is no point in having inspections unless you form conclusions as a result of that inspection, is
           there?
     A     That is correct.
     Q     There must presumably have been some meeting following the inspection at which you all sat down
           together and decided what, if anything, should be done.

     A     There was not, to my recollection, no.

     Q     How did you decide what should be done, if anything needed to be done?
     A     There were discussions on the site, particularly in relation to barrier 144, which took place at the
           time.
     Q     Nothing more than that and no record anywhere of any decisions that were made?

     A     No, sir."
The decision to remove barrier 144 was assented to on behalf of the City Council by Mr Bownes. It was not
referred to the General Purposes Panel. Whether Mr Bownes strictly had any power to assent to it is to say the
least very doubtful. But he himself admits that he was ill-equipped to do so. He knew very little about football
grounds. He had read the file passed on from South Yorkshire County Council and assumed all had been run
satisfactorily by them.
  154. It was recorded, however, in a report which Mr Bownes drafted that "the conditions (in the Safety
Certificate) give some cause for concern as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas". The
report to the General Purposes Panel suggested that new Safety Certificate conditions should be drafted.
   155. The task of revising the Safety Certificate was begun in June 1986. In July 1987, a draft was sent to the
fire service to which they replied in August. In September 1987, the Panel was informed that the redrafting was

                                                      26
"progressing steadily" and should be submitted to the Panel in October. The final draft was not circulated until
30 March 1989, 16 days before this disaster.

   156. Meanwhile, the Safety Certificate has remained unamended since 1979. The enlargement of the Kop
in 1986 increased its capacity to 21,000. Although this was known and agreed by the Council it had not been
the subject of any change in the certificate which still showed the capacity of the Kop as 16,850. Mr Mackrell,
Sheffield Wednesday’s Secretary, raised the question of amendments to the Safety Certificate and in particular
with regard to the Kop in April 1987 with Eastwood and Partners but nothing resulted.

  157. Sheffield United Football Club was designated under the 1975 Act on 3 July 1984. A Safety Certificate
was about to be issued by South Yorkshire County Council at the time it handed over to the Sheffield City
Council on 1 April 1986. No certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United.

   158. The explanation given for these delays was pressure of work. Mr Bownes as Chief Licensing Officer
was responsible for 32 other licensing systems when this one was added to his burden. He had a staff of only
five. I fully accept that the addition of further statutory responsibilities to the already heavy workload of a local
authority with curbs on its expenditure creates problems. But it is clear that the attention given to this
important licensing function was woefillly inadequate.

Summary
   159. The Safety Certificate contained no maximum figures for individual pens. There was therefore no
sanction or provision focussing attention as to the need to limit entry to the pens by numbers. The layout at
Leppings Lane as it evolved made electronic or mechanical control over numbers entering individual pens
impracticable if all pens were to be available. Given an important match and a capacity attendance, fans were
likely to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 and 4. Those pens were likely to become overfull well before
warning came from the turnstiles that numbers were approaching the terrace maximum of 10,100. Control
over numbers and the avoidance of overcrowding therefore depended entirely on visual monitoring of the
crowd.




                                                         27
                                                 CHAPTER 9

                       LACK OF EFFECTIVE MONITORING OF THE TERRACES
  160. Monitoring the spectators on the terraces so as to avoid overcrowding involves observing the numbers
and their distribution in each area, making decisions as to when an area is "full", taking steps to close it off
and moving spectators from one area to another, if necessary. It is a function beset by three problems. 1) Who
should carry it out? 2) When is an area "full"? 3) Fear of hooliganism.

Who should Monitor the Terraces?
   161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be the police? Should it be both? Or should it be by
arrangement, depending upon the ground or section of the ground in question?
   162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a match on its premises for reward is
responsible for securing safety at that event. The Green Guide (1986) provides:

       " 23. The safety of the public inside the ground is the responsibility of those who stage the event and
              administer the ground in which it is held, ie the "management". This responsibility applies in
              both normal and emergency situations...

        195 .... there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:

              (a)   controlling or directing members of the public who are entering or leaving the ground, to
                    help achieve an even flow of people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal of spectators on
                    the terraces or viewing slopes;

              (b) patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarms or extinguishing
                  fires;

              (c)   manning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which
                    are continuously open whilst the ground is in use;

              (d)   assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control; and

              (e)   undertaking specific duties in an emergency."
The Interim Popplewell Report
   163. There was considerable controversy in the course of the public inquiry held by Mr Justice Popplewell
in 1985 as to the responsibility of the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 of his interim report, Mr Justice
Popplewell quoted from a report produced for the Minister of Housing and Local Government in 1969 as
follows:-

  "The responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police and the club operating the
  ground. The broad line of division being that police are responsible for movement of spectators in public
  thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the control of
  spectators once they are on the club’s premises..."

Mr Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observe that in practice the police
have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph 3.8):

  "It follows, therefore, that as a matter of practice, while the physical safety of the building and the
  maintenance and good housekeeping of the ground must always be the responsibility of the club, the police
  have to take the de facto responsibility of organising the crowd, with all that entails, during the game..."

Mr Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation of the ground as a procedure in which only the police
could bear the responsibility of supervising the organisation of the crowd.

The Final Popplewell Report
   164. He harked back to this subject in chapter 4 of his Final Report. There, he came down more firmly in
favour of holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said "Because, as a matter of


                                                       28
practice, police officers have regularly attended in large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow been
assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for control of what goes on inside the ground has passed from
them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcement of law and order. Those responsible
for organising a private function, however, have the primary and continuing obligation and responsibility to
ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises." Mr Justice Popplewell ended that
section as follows: "It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club, or the occupier of the ground
who is putting on the function, that the primary and continuing obligation rests."

   165. There remains, however, the question whether there are some grounds or parts of grounds where the
club may need to rely upon the police (whom they pay to attend) to control filling of pens and monitoring them
for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the club, they may need,
and by agreement be entitled, to employ the police to act as their agents in certain circumstances. This very
difficult and grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed in greater depth at stage two
of this Inquiry.

Arrangements at Hillsborough
  166. What is clear, however, is that de facto the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibility for
control of the pens at the Leppings Lane end. The evidence of the senior officers who had been concerned with
policing at Hillsborough over the years was all one way on this point. Only Mr Duckenfield, who had not
policed at Hillsborough for some 10 years prior to 15 April, took a different view.

   167. Mr Lock is now security officer at Sheffield Wednesday and was formerly a police Superintendent at
Hillsborough matches occupying Mr Murray’s role. He claimed there had been a formal although unwritten
agreement between the Club and the police in about 1982, whereby the police agreed to steward the Leppings
Lane end of the ground. Such a formal agreement is denied by other senior officers and I do not accept that any
formal agreement was reached. Nevertheless, a practice or arrangement did develop which was known and
accepted by both Club and police. Its effect was that throughout the ground the stewards were responsible for
manning exits and entrances, for controlling entry into the stands, for assisting spectators to their seats in the
stands and for helping to control the exits after the match. They were also responsible at the Kop end on the
terraces for keeping gangways clear and helping to control the crowd which usually consisted of home
supporters. At the Leppings Lane end, however, there were no gangways on the terraces and the crowd
consisted usually (and always since 1987) of away supporters. Mr Mole and other senior officers accepted that
it would have been unreal and unreasonable to expect stewards to go onto those Leppings Lane terraces. They
would not have been effective there; moreover, they could well have been in some danger from hostile away
supporters. The police accepted, therefore, that the proper filling of the pens and monitoring them for
overcrowding could and would not be carried out by stewards. Many stewards have tended to be either
extremely young or somewhat elderly. They are paid only a modest sum (£9 at Hillsborough) and they are not
suitable either by physique or by training to cope on a crowded terrace with no gangways.

Case for the South Yorkshire Police
  168. Notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence from senior police as already mentioned and from the
Club, Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police continued throughout the hearing to contend that the Club and
not the police were responsible for filling and monitoring the pens and that this was well known to both parties.
He maintained that the police were there essentially to secure and preserve law and order. Quite apart from the
police evidence to the contrary at this Inquiry, the official stance of the South Yorkshire Police has not always
been to that effect.
Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club Limited
   169. In March 1986, the South Yorkshire Police Authority obtained a judgement against Sheffield United
Football Club for money due for police services provided at Sheffield United’s matches. The defence had been,
inter alia, that the police were not providing "special police services". They were doing no more than
performing their normal police duties of securing and preserving law and order amongst a crowd. The police
argument was that they had additional duties. In his judgement, Boreham J summarised the instructions for
policing as providing for:-

  "(a) the maintenance of enforcement of law and order;
   (b) the enforcement of the Club’s ground regulations, many of which are concerned with law and order;

   (c) the safety and comfort of the spectators, officials and players."


                                                       29
He referred to the argument of Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police as follows:-

  "Thirdly, here the police were not discharging their own duty to the public; they were in fact discharging the
  Club’s duties to the spectators whom the Club invited to the ground. The Club chose to invite large numbers
  to their private premises; it was the Club’s duty to provide for their safety, health and comfort. They could
  have employed a security firm as banks and others have to do to protect their interests; they chose to request
  the police to perform those duties knowing that the police expected payment. Fourthly, the police within the
  ground provided services which it was not within the scope of their public duty to perform. For instance,
  they assisted in crowd management and in the enforcement of such ground regulations as refused entry to
  those who tried to enter without paying or prohibited spectators encroaching on parts of the ground which
  their entry fee did not entitle them to enter. It may be, submits Mr Bentley, that the maintenance of law and
  order was the predominant aim but there were other services performed."

The learned Judge found:-

  "In addition to what may be called their law and order role the police were expected and did take part in
  crowd management, ensuring the safety of spectators, the enforcement of the Club’s regulations and to be on
  hand to assist in the event of some emergencies such as fire or accidental injury."

Police Practice at the Leppings Lane End
   170. At League matches at Hillsborough, the police practice was to decide in advance how many and which
pens would be used. Ifa modest crowd was anticipated only one or two pens might be needed. It was better to
confine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent them running about and (b) to reduce the number of police
required. The practice was then to fill the pens one by one. This involved making a judgement as to when a pen
was full. There would then be a police decision to close that pen and fill another. It was regarded as impractical
and unsafe for police officers (just like stewards) to go onto the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
This meant that monitoring the numbers in any pen had to be done from vantage points outside it. Here, the
police were much better placed than the stewards. There was a good view from the control box and the
television screens there. There were officers on the perimeter track. No stewards were placed there because
having both police and stewards interfered with the viewing. There were also police in the west stand who
could look down on the pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give the police a good appreciation of
the state of the terraces, When it was necessary to shut offaccess to the pens officers on the concourse could be
informed by radio and could take the necessary steps.

"Find Their Own Level"
   171. At Cup semi-finals, a different approach was adopted. All the pens were opened from the start and the
policy was "to let the fans find their own level". This phrase was repeated again and again by police officers at
the Inquiry. What it meant was that no specific direction was given to fans entering through the turnstiles.
They were free to go wherever they wished on the terraces. If they became uncomfortable or wished for any
other reason to move their position, then theoretically they could move elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
the fans on the terraces would level themselves out and that distribution would be achieved without police
intervention. On these occasions, the gates at the top of the radial fences were locked in the open position. It
was sought to argue, therefore, that there was freedom of movement from one pen to another enabling fans to
"find their level".

   172. This argument was bad both in theory and in practice. In theory, the whole object of the radial fences
had been to achieve even distribution by directing fans into desired positions. To say then that they could move
freely from one pen to another would defeat the object and enable fans to go from a less popular to a more
popular area without inhibition. In practice this did not happen because the position and size of the gates was
such that once a substantial number of spectators were in, the gates were unnoticeable and inaccessible
especially to those towards the front who might have most need of them.

  173. The same argument was deployed to suggest that individual maximum capacities for individual pens
need not be assessed since the presence of the open radial gates still meant that the terrace was one area. In
practice this simply was not so. The photograph at Appendix 5 taken from the north stand at 2.59 pm shows
very clearly the congestion in pens 3 and 4 contrasted with the sparseness in pen 6. This gives the lie to the
suggestion that the fans could, if uncomfortable, "find their own level".

  174. The effect of this policy was that whereas at League matches the police had to make a positive decision
when to close one pen and open another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was much more likely, the police

                                                      30
    left it to the fans themselves to "find their own level". Effectively, they were left to monitor their own comfort
    and safety so as to avoid overcrowding. The police would only intervene when there was some overt sign that an
    area was "full".

    When is an Area "Full"?
       175. Over the years, spectators on terraces have come to accept conditions which are often very
    uncomfortable and not infrequently downright dangerous. They are subjected to buffeting and squeezing to
    get in and out of the terraces. They are packed tightly and exposed to surging and swaying during the match.
    They put up with these conditions because they are devoted to the game and because there is little they can do
    about them. They believe the discomfort will pass and nothing very untoward will happen. Usually that is the
    case and they are reassured by it. Most clubs have not, until very recently, consulted their supporters as to their
    grievances or suggestions. The practice has been to pack them in on the assumption that if they are prepared to
    put up with it the conditions must be tolerable. Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
    in recent years, this has been due principally to the increased proportion of seating as against standing
    accommodation. Terraces have still been packed.

       176. It is said that many fans enjoy these features of terrace viewing. Clearly close proximity, shared
    discomfort, weathering sways and surges together and chanting the same songs and slogans en masse do evoke
    good humour and have produced a spirit or cult of the terraces which many enjoy. Equally there are many who
    simply endure these things for the football, for a cheap ticket or indeed for the chance of getting in at all. And
    before Hillsborough most fans on the terraces, even if they enjoy the hurly-burly, had not realised the narrow
    margin of safety between an uncomfortable crush and a fatal one.

       177. The Green Guide sought to improve safety and comfort by laying down criteria for maximum
    capacity, ie defining what is "full". The standard set was 54 persons per 10 square metres in favourable
    conditions but fewer, down to 27, in less favourable conditions. The tendency may have been to aim off too
    little from the higher figure for shortcomings in the layout. Certainly the figures considered appropriate in
    pens 3 and 4 at Hillsborough were too high, as already indicated.

       178. Even taking the highest figure suggested in the Green Guide, the problem remained that those
    supposed to be monitoring pens visually had and have little idea of what 54 persons per 10 square metres look
    like. Mr Duckenfield’s opinion was that when a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be "shoulder to
    shoulder and chest to back". That view may derive from seeing the sort of density crowds regularly endure
    without injury resulting. But it is much more dense than the Green Guide maximum.
      179. The South Yorkshire Fire Brigade provided the Inquiry with photographs of people standing in an area
    of 10 square metres at various densities of packing. Together with my Assessors and others, I took part in a
    similar experiment at the Health and Safety Executive’s Sheffield laboratory. We stood in a room of measured
    area at densities of 54, 80 and 100 per 10 square metres. It was clear from the photographs and from our
    experiment that the maximum density set out in the Green Guide left considerably more room than those
    monitoring the terraces would have left before declaring an area "full".
      180. The tendency has been to allow the pens to fill until the fans complain or show signs of discomfort. If
    the density at the front appeared less than at the back, the Tannoy would invite the fans to move forward to
    make room for more. The evidence before the Inquiry and many anecdotal letters I have received clearly show
    there have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caused
    discomfort and sometimes, for brief periods, fear. Usually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
F   eases and the incident passes unrecorded.
      181. After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final, Hillsborough was not chosen again by the FA until 1987.
    There was evidence that the central pens were uncomfortably overcrowded on that occasion and again at the

L   1988 Cup semi-final, although entry to the tunnel was blocked off by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
    because the pens were deemed to be "full".

     Fear of Hooliganism
       182. Over the last few years, hooliganism at and associated with football matches has strongly influenced
     the strategy of the police. In their plans and management they have concentrated on averting or containing
     threats to public order. This is understandable and indeed commendable. But it has led to an imbalance
     between the need to quell a minority of troublemakers and the need to secure the safety and comfort of the
     majority. In the police Operational Order, the emphasis was upon prevention of disorder and in particular
     prevention of access to the field of play. There was no express requirement that officers on the perimeter track

                                                            31
or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces. Indeed, the view was
expressed in evidence that packing fans close together on the terraces assisted in controlling the unruly since
the less room they had the less scope there was for misbehaviour.

Summary
   183. Although the police had accepted de facto responsibility for monitoring the pens, their policy on the
day was to leave fans to "find their own level" and to concentrate their own attention on possible disorder.
Whilst in theory the police would intervene if a pen became "full", in practice they permitted the test of
fullness to be what the fans would tolerate.
  184. By 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
uncomfortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries; to allow in a large stream was
courting disaster.

                                                  CHAPTER 10

                                   THE BUILD-UP AT THE TURNSTILES

   185. The decision to open gate C, and subsequently gates A and B too, was forced on to the police by the
crowd conditions which developed outside the turnstiles. The crush was so severe that injuries were being
suffered and deaths were feared unless the pressure could be swiftly relieved. Why the crowd pressure had built
to such intensity was one of the principal issues during the hearing. The suggested causes must be considered in
turn.
The Physical Layout
   186. I have already described and illustrated the approach to the turnstiles (Appendices 1 and 2). At
Penistone Road and at many other grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced and with a
sufficient waiting area for queues to form. Not so at Leppings Lane. The building line, the bridge over the Don
and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to perimeter gates set in an arc, and across a short
forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. The pairs of turnstiles were close together and the forecourt, especially
as divided by the metal fence, provided little space for a waiting crowd.

The Number of Turnstiles
  187. The decision to fill the whole ofthe north stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23 turnstiles
there to admit 24,256 spectators. Of those, the seven turnstiles (A to G) serving the terraces had to admit
10,100, ie an average of just under 1,450 through each turnstile. At the Penistone Road end, 29,800 were
served by 60 turnstiles, or just under 500 per turnstile.

   188. The Green Guide recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which spectators can pass through
turnstiles depends on a variety of local circumstances but states "in general based on observation and
experience, it is unlikely that the maximum notional rate per turnstile would exceed 750 per hour". Since the
semi-final was an all ticket match requiring no cash transactions, the Club considered that a higher rate of
about 1,000 per hour per turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assumes the turnstiles
working at maximum efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly 1 ’/2 hours to admit all those with terrace
tickets. At 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

   189. The Green Guide provides (paragraph 44):-

  "Turnstiles should be of such numbers as to admit spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are
  kept waiting for admission...".

   190. The Officer Working Party had discussed in 1985 the need, and Dr Eastwood’s various schemes, for
improvement of the turnstile arrangements. The mathematics are elementary. Both the police and the Club
should have realised that the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the waiting area outside them would be under strain
to admit all the Liverpool supporters in time. Success depended on the spectators arriving at a steady rate from
an early hour and upon the maximum turnstile rate being maintained. In fact neither of these requirements,
which are inter-linked, was fulfilled. That they might not be so was in my view foreseeable.
The "Late" arrival of Liverpool Fans
   191. Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd waiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5,000 and became
unmanageable. The case made for the police was that large numbers of Liverpool supporters arrived late; a
high proportion of them were drunk and unco-operative; a high proportion had no tickets; all of them were
hell-bent on getting in on time. They say this was unforeseeable and explains why they lost control.

   192. Whether those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm were "late" was much debated. The ticket
simply requested its holder "to take up [his] position 15 minutes before kick-off’. That may have been
intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be unreasonable for a
standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm. Whether they were "late" or not,
however, there was certainly a large concentration of Liverpool fans arriving at about 2.30 pm and after.
Traffic Delays
  193. It is unlikely that traffic conditions had any significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
Liverpool traffic routes. There were roadworks on the M62 which was the recommended route. At various
points the carriageway was reduced from four lanes or three lanes to two, but no serious delays were reported.

                                                         33
On the M63 there were longer delays due to a contraflow and at its junction with the A560 there was heavy
congestion due to volume of traffic. However, the Liverpool routes were clear by 2.20 pm and those witnesses
who complained of delays en route had nevertheless managed to be in range of the ground in ample time.

Fine Weather and Drinking
   194. The likeliest explanations for the sparse Liverpool attendance in the ground before 2.30 pm were four-
fold - the warm weather, drinking, disinclination to enter the ground early and prolong the standing, and a
tendency of Liverpool supporters to cut it fine.

   195. The police emphasised that at the 1988 semi-final there was no comparable build-up of"late" arrivals.
They claim, therefore, that they had no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988, although the weather
was fine, it was 11 °F cooler than in 1989.15 April was the sort of fine spring day which tempted fans to sit or
stand about in the sun with a drink. If you had a ticket it would seem more pleasant and sensible to relax in that
way than to enter the ground early and stand on the terrace for an extra hour. Pre-match entertainment in the
ground had been advertised but did not take place. Even if it had, it may not have been an encouragement to
many fans to enter so early.

Was Drunkenness a Major Factor in the Crisis at the Turnstiles?
   196. Of those who arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very many had been drinking at public houses or had
brought drink from home or an off-licence. I am satisfied on the evidence, however, that the great majority
were not drunk nor even the worse for drink. The police witnesses varied on this. Some described a high
proportion as drunk, as"lager-louts" or even as "animals". Others described a generally normal crowd with an
unco-operative minority who had drunk too much. In my view some officers, seeking to rationalise their loss
of control, overestimated the drunken element in the crowd. There certainly was such an element. There were
youngsters influenced by drink and bravado pushing impatiently at the rear of the crowd thereby exacerbating
the crush. But the more convincing police witnesses, including especially Detective Superintendent McKay
and Chief Inspector Creaser as well as a number of responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in
describing this element as a minority. Those witnesses attributed the crush to the sheer numbers of fans all
anxious to gain entry. There was no criticism of the crowd by any of the witnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm
or even 2.35 pro. What happened then was not a sudden deterioration in the mood or sobriety of those
assembled there. No doubt those coming behind would have had more to drink and would have included the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd became packed into a confined
turnstile area and its very density hampered its passage through the turnstiles.

   197. Superintendent Marshall and other officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police
exhortations to stop pushing and to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In that crush most people
had no control over their movements at all. Two incidents involving police horses illustrate the point. One
horse was found afterwards to have cigarette burns on its rump. Clearly that was the despicable work of a
hooligan whether in drink or not. However, there were also eyewitness accounts of a horse being physically
lifted off its feet by the crowd. That occurred, as the police accepted, without malice or intent but as an
involuntary consequence of crowd pressure which those by the horse’s flanks could not resist any more than the
horse itself.
Reduced Efficiency of the Turnstiles
   198. The labelling of the turnstiles in the order A, C, B was confusing. A fan with a B ticket who went by
mistake to the wrong side of the metal fence would have had the greatest difficulty in getting back and round to
the correct side. The colour coding was inefficient because the coloured wooden panels were affixed to the
turnstile walls so low that they were not easily visible through a crowd. The information on the ticket printed by
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was misleading and its layout unhelpful, as Mr Mackrell frankly conceded.

   199. The result was that in the early stages, police officers were pestered by fans for help as to where they
should go. Later, as the crowd became more dense, fans were presenting their tickets at the wrong turnstiles.
There were also Liverpool supporters who had acquired tickets for the Kop end but sought entry at Leppings
Lane. They caused delays in the turnstile operation when entry was refused and after a while the police
instructed the operators to let them through. There was further delay because the crush made it difficult for
fans to get into the turnstile entrances. Once there, the pressure from behind was such as, on occasions, to jam
them in the doorway or against the paddle of the turnstile. Finally, there were fans without tickets who sought
to enter by offering payment, by seeking to go over or under the paddle or by sliding through with a ticket
holder. All of these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the worst period was only about 600 per
hour per turnstile. The waiting crowd therefore expanded and as the minutes passed frustration grew. Visitors

                                                       34
who had paid for tickets and travelled from afar realised they were making little forward progress. Frustration
increased pressure and induced panic at the front. Determination to get into the match was intensified by
determination to get out of the crush.
Were Fans Without Tickets a Major Factor in the Build’Up?
  200. It has become a fact of football life that fans do turn up at all-ticket matches without tickets. It is not
possible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable estimate of the number without tickets on 15 April. Police
estimates varied from about 200 to about 2,000. There were certainly frequent requests for tickets or "spares"
during the hours before the build-up. Many of those warned offby the police were seen to return to the area.
Some were hanging about on the bridge. Again, however, the police witnesses who most impressed me did not
consider the number of ticketless fans to be inordinately large. This accords with two other sources of
evidence.
   201. First, there was a wide range ofwitnesses who observed inside the ground that the Liverpool end was at
a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 and 4. The north stand still had many empty seats and the wing
pens were sparse. The match being a sell-out, there were clearly many ticket holders to come and they could
account for the large crowd still outside the turnstiles. Had the Liverpool accommodation been full by 2.40
pm, one could have inferred that most or much of the large crowd outside lacked tickets.
  202. Secondly, such figures as are available from the Club’s electronic monitoring system and from analyses
by the HSE suggest that no great number entered without tickets. They show that the number who passed
through turnstiles A to G plus those who entered through gate C roughly equalled the terrace capacity figure of
10,100 for which tickets had been sold. The Club’s record showed 7,038 passed through turnstiles A to G.
However, the counting mechanism on turnstile G was defective, so the HSE did a study using the video film
and projecting figures from the other turnstiles. This gave an assessment of 7,494, with a maximum of 7,644
passing through A to G. Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the number who entered the ground whilst
gate C was open at 2,240 with a maximum of 2,480. Accordingly, the HSE’s best estimate of the total entering
through gate C and turnstiles A to G was 9,734 with a maximum of 10,124. I recognise that these can only be
rough checks because, for example, some with terrace tickets were allowed through turnstiles 1 to 16 and there
would be other similar factors which have not formed part of the assessment. Nevertheless, the figures do
suggest that there was not a very significant body ofticketless fans in the crowd which built up.
The "Conspiracy" Theory
  203. On behalf of South Yorkshire police, the theory was advanced that the "late" arrival of so many
Liverpool supporters was planned to buck the system. The suggestion was that fans without tickets conspired
to arrive late and create such trouble as would force the police to admit them to the match. The slender
evidence upon which this theory rested came from two sources: overheard conversations in public houses and
the antecedent history of Liverpool supporters at away matches.
  204. One witness said he heard three Liverpool supporters saying, in effect, that they would manage to get
in without tickets by causing trouble so that police would open a gate, and that they had done this before.
Another witness heard two of a group of Liverpool supporters say they had no tickets, that they would go to the
ground just before kick-off, that no-one would stop them getting in and that they had not been stopped yet.
Statements were put in relating to two other small groups talking in similar terms.
Liverpool Supporters at Away Matches
   205. The South Yorkshire police prepared a dossier of reports on the behaviour of Liverpool fans at away
matches with the object of showing a pattern of troublesome behaviour by large numbers either without tickets
or with forged tickets. Without setting out the whole history, it can be summarised as follows.
  206. On three occasions Liverpool fans without tickets were allowed into all-ticket matches upon payment.
(At Watford on 13 February 1988, 1,500 were admitted; at Southampton on 24 September 1988, 150 were
admitted; at Southampton again on 12 December 1988, 750 were admitted.) At Norwich on 1 April 1989,
Liverpool supporters arrived without tickets but 1,272 tickets had been returned and fans from both Liverpool
and Norwich were allowed to buy them for cash. A similar situation occurred at Wimbledon on 13 May 1989.
There were six other occasions from 1986 to date, including the Cup finals of 1986 and 1989, when numbers of
Liverpool supporters turned up without tickets or otherwise behaved badly.
  207. Four points must be noted, however. On none of the occasions when ticketless fans were admitted for
payment was the match a sell-out. There was therefore room in the ground on each occasion. At a sell-out fans

                                                        35
might not expect to be allowed in, even for payment. Secondly, no trouble of the kind alleged was encountered
at the 1988 semi-final when Liverpool visited Hillsborough. Thirdly, Liverpool visited Hillsborough again in
January 1989 without any trouble. Finally, no forged tickets were in use on 15 April apart from three crude
photocopies.

No Conspiracy
   208. I have already found that there was not an abnormally large number of fans without tickets on this
occasion. With one or two exceptions, the police witnesses themselves did not subscribe to the "conspiracy"
theory. I am satisfied that the large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm did not arrive
as a result of any concerted plan. There were, I accept, small groups without tickets who were willing to exploit
any adventitious chance of getting into the ground. They, together with the minority who had drunk too much,
certainly aggravated the problem faced by the police. But that main problem was simply one of large numbers
packed into the small area outside the turnstiles.

The Police Operation at Leppings Lane
  209. The Operational Order for 15 April followed closely that laid down for the 1988 semi-final. The
emphasis was on maintaining law and order. Side roads were to be blocked off to prevent damage in residential
areas. Pairs of officers were to patrol streets to prevent "clash of rival supporters". Officers were to watch public
houses, shops and supermarkets "where looting could take place". Outside the turnstiles, officers were to ensure
supporters entering did not have banners, weapons, missiles or alcohol.

  210. Unfortunately, hooligan behaviour has made all these steps necessary. But the only written provision
aimed at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was one enjoining officers "to ensure orderly queues are
formed". There was no provision for controlling the entry of the crowd into the turnstile area.

  211. As long ago as 1924, the Departmental Committee on Crowds stated:-

  "The control of crowds should begin at a point some considerable distance from the entrance to the ground.
  The advantages of an arrangement of this kind are.., in preventing congestion at the entrances to grounds."

This was particularly important at Leppings Lane where the turnstile area was so small and awkwardly laid
out. Ifa large crowd was permitted uncontrolled entry through the perimeter gates, the forming of queues at the
turnstiles and control by officers, whether on foot or mounted, would become impracticable. Those waiting at
the turnstiles would become a single growing mass. Once that happened, it would be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

  212. Whether steps were taken and what steps to avoid this happening was left to oral briefing and ad hoc
instructions on the day.

Previous Experience
  213. The senior police officers said it had never happened before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two previous occasions when the Leppings Lane terraces had been used to fill the whole of the north
and west sides of the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987 and 1988. In 1987, the match was on a Sunday,
scheduled for 12 noon, and kick-off was postponed for a quarter of an hour because of late arrivals.

Policing in 1988
 214. As to 1988, there was a very large and consistent body of evidence that, on the day, the police in
Leppings Lane conducted an efficient filtering exercise designed to keep away those without tickets and
control the flow of fans towards the ground. I do not believe that so many witnesses without either opportunity
or reason to put their heads together could be mistaken about what they experienced on that occasion. Yet, the
police maintain that no filtering exercise other than on a random basis was conducted in 1988 and that their
policy and practice then were nodifferent from those of 1989.

  215. The answer to this conflict must, I think, be that whilst the policy may have been no different, in
practice the policing in 1988 was more efficient and was not put to the same test and strain as a year later. There
was not so large a swell in numbers approaching the ground from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm as in 1989.
Nevertheless, there had been warning signs in 1988. Detective Superintendent McKay gave the following
evidence:


                                                       36
     ,,Q   Were you aware of a build-up of numbers last year towards the latter stages at the turnstiles?

     A     Yes... There was a huge build-up around 10 minutes to 3 when many, many Liverpool supporters
           came at that time. They had been drinking, the ones that I saw and there was quite a sizeable crush
           built-up - sizeable queue.
     Q     Queue or crush?
     A     Compacted queue, built-up in the area by the turnstiles which I believe are marked A to G. That crowd
           reached back almost to the gates. It never got any bigger than that and the turnstiles operated relatively
           freely and they dealt with that crowd. Fans were still arriving at about 10 past 3 but by then the...
     Q     This crowd that you have described of the late arrivals at about 10 to - was it an orderly crowd?

     A     Oh no. No. The orderly crowd had gone in, and when I say they were not an orderly crowd, obviously
           mixed amongst those people were...
     Q     Of course, but taking it generally?
     A     But by and large they had taken a lot of drink on board and they were in such numbers that excluding
           them from the ground was completely out of the question.
     Q     Were they standing in an orderly queue or was there some pushing and shoving?
     A     There was a lot of pushing and shoving. There was an urgency to get into the ground.
     Q     But fortunately it does not appear to have been in nearly such numbers as this year.
     A     It wasn’t."
    Police Intelligence in Advance
      216. Apart from that experience in 1988, the tendency of Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
    unknown. Witnesses said that they get through the turnstiles at their home ground, Anfield, quite quickly and
    tend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent tendency to postpone arrival was noted by the
    Sheffield City Council Advisory Group, with police present, on 23 March 1988. The minute reads:-

      "As far as the turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed of people arriving some 15 minutes
      before the start of the game hoping to gain admission. This trend may be due to the banning of alcohol at
      sports grounds which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the football match. As
      the available turnstiles operated quite effectively for the majority of the time, and that the late arrival
      problem could perhaps only be dealt with by education of the spectators" (sic).
      217. In so far as Liverpool supporters’ behaviour at away matches may have been indicative of what police
    problems might arise on 15 April, most of the facts should have been available at the planning stage. As in other
    forces, South Yorkshire Police had a liaison officer whose job was to seek, receive and collate relevant
    information as to the visiting supporters. The Association of Chief Police Officers’ Guide to Policing Football
    highlights the importance of such liaison:-
      "It is important that the officer responsible for policing the match determines the pre-match planning in the
t
      light of the intelligence at hand. Whilst that intelligence can be obtained from a variety of sources, the prime
      source for football intelligence is the Police National Intelligence System which is based on the network of
T     police liaison officers. Summaries completed by police officers of the home club force are forwarded to the
      visiting club’s liaison officer making available intelligence about fans’ behaviour at both home and away
      fixtures. This information will be collated and made available for future matches involving that club".
      218. The FA had also laid down in a memorandum issued in the 1985/6 season measures to be adopted by
    the away club which included the following:-
      "It is the responsibility of the away club to advise the home club of the recent behaviour of their supporters
      at away matches, irrespective of whether the behaviour has resalted in disciplinary action by the Football
      Association or not".
      219. It does not seem that information of this kind was passed to the Sheffield Wednesday Club or played

                                                           37
any part in the South Yorkshire Police plans. Had the latter been informed of the history, contained in the
dossier and summarised above it may well have influenced police strategy in Leppings Lane.

  220. There is presently a proposal that a national computer-based police football intelligence system should
be set up to make the necessary information readily available.
Police Intelligence on the Day
  221. The unfilled space in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures for entry available from the
Club’s computer and observations on the video screen should have enabled those in the control room to
monitor the numbers arriving and still to arrive at Leppings Lane, Radio contact with mobile (Tango) patrols
detailed to monitor licensed premises in the district could have indicated the numbers still to come. But at 2.30
pm when Mr Murray told Mr Duckenfield they would "get them all in by 3 o’clock" he seems not to have
appreciated that in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were many more still to come. Certainly, Mr
Marshall outside the turnstiles was not told and could not otherwise have known that there were still many
Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.

Mr Marshall and Mr Greenwood
  222. The division of command between these two officers did not help. Mr Marshall was in charge of the
serials outside the perimeter gates in the Leppings Lane area and in the roads beyond. In practice he operated
inside and just outside the turnstile area. Mr Greenwood’s area as Ground Commander extended from the
pitch to the perimeter gates. He in fact stationed himself near the players’ tunnel. He was wholly unaware of the
growing problems at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers who were under
pressure there. No-one in the control room thought to tell him.

Control Lost
  223. In the result, the large concentration of arrivals from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed unrestrained into
the turnstile area through the perimeter gates which were fully open. When that area was full, later arrivals
swelled the crowd out to the forecourt and even into the road. As already recounted, the foot officers at the
turnstiles became trapped and endangered and retired through the turnstiles. The mounted officers could not
operate amidst such a dense crowd in a confined space. They came out of the turnstile area. There were then
the belated attempts to close the perimeter gates and prevent more fans joining the mass until it had a chance to
diminish through the turnstiles; still later the attempt to put a cordon of horses across the entrance.
   224. Despite knowledge of the difficult layout, the very large number of fans to be got through so few
turnstiles and the tendency of fans to arrive in the last half hour, no contingency plans were made to avoid a
crush such as occurred. Even on the day, the need to close Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.30 pm and the
other available intelligence already summarised, should have prompted those in command to take precautions
against such a crush. If some of the perimeter gates had been closed and cordons of mounted and foot officers
had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow of fans into the turnstile area could have been
controlled before that area became engulfed. It was the crush itself which produced the frustration and the
panic and brought out the worst in those who had drunk too much. Earlier control of entry would have
prevented the crush and maintained the good mood which had prevailed until 2.30 pm.
  225. It should moreover have been obvious by 2.40 pm, if not earlier, that a large part of the crowd could
not be admitted until well after 3 pm. Had a decision to postpone kick-offbeen made and announced much of
the frustration and with it the impetus crushing the crowd would have been reduced. A combination of
controlled filtering and a postponed kick-offwould probably have obviated the need to open the gates.
Postponement of Kick-off
  226. At various stages in his evidence, Mr Duckenfield gave three accounts of why he thought it too late to
postpone kick-off. Once it was that one of the teams had already come onto the pitch. Then it was that a group
of photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams were coming out. Finally, he did not
know why he thought the teams were coming out. They did not in fact come onto the pitch until 2.54 pm, two
minutes after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked for a postponement of kick-offbefore
gate C was opened. It should not, however, have needed a police Constable in the thick of the crowd (and there
were others of like mind) to think of postponing the kick-off. The need should have been clear in the control
room.

  227. The truth was that Mr Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with Mr Murray.
Kick-off would not be postponed unless there were some major cause for delayed arrivals eg a jam on the

                                                      38
motorway or fog. I accept that the thinking behind this policy was not callous or punitive. If kick-off is
postponed whenever a proportion of fans choose to leave the public houses late, the practice may grow and
kick-off times would become meaningless. But, a commander must deal with the problem of the day. Faced
with a situation which was becoming dangerous, crowd safety should have been his paramount consideration.
Kick-off should have been delayed.

Summary
   228. The layout of the turnstiles and the number they were required to serve left no margin of safety against
an uneven flow of fans. Because police strategy in advance and on the day did not cater for it, the arrival of a
large number of supporters between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm created an unmanageable crush. The presence of
a substantial minority of fans who had drunk too much aggravated that problem. Having lost control and
rejected the option of postponing kick-off, the police were faced with a serious danger of deaths or injuries.
They were left therefore with no alternative but to open the gates. Superintendent Marshall was right at that
stage to ask for it and Mr Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects of so dramatic a step required
other action.




                                                       39
                                                CHAPTER 11

                               THE BLUNDER ON OPENING THE GATES
  229. The decision to order the opening of the gates was not accompanied or followed by any other order to
deal with the consequences. When gate C was opened, a steady stream of about 2,000 fans poured through it
over some five minutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground somewhere and unless they were diverted
their likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. No warning was issued from the control
room that the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. Neither the Club control room
nor the Chief Steward at the Leppings Lane end was warned. Not even Mr Greenwood, the Ground
Commander, was informed. From 2.47 pm when Mr Marshall made his first request until 2.52 pm when Mr
Duckenfield acceded to it, there were five minutes in which orders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was not done. In evidence, Mr Duckenfield began by saying that no officer made any
wrong decision but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not consider where the people
would go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see the influx on the television screen, no
order was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. Mr Duckenfield said it did not cross his mind to detail
officers on the concourse to shut offthe tunnel. Those officers could not have known from their position how
full pens 3 and 4 were. That was a matter for the control room to monitor from its own observations and using
intelligence from around the ground.

  230. Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm, the tunnel should have been closed offwhether gate C was to
be opened or not. The exercise was a simple one and had been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the
1988 closure seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not fgure in the
debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989.

  231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view of the
pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect
when gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty areas of the wings and this disaster
could still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first magnitude.

  232. Significantly, when permission was given to open gate A, Mr Duckenfield did order serials to go to that
part of the concourse to monitor the influx towards the north stand. He did this because he feared that if fans
went to the north stand without tickets, they would not get seats and, there being no perimeter fences at the
north side, they might invade the pitch. This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety and the risks of overcrowding. Because those entering through gate C could not get onto the
pitch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to monitor them. The possibility of overcrowding simply
was not considered.




                                                       40
                                                    CHAPTER 12

                                             THE BARRIERS IN PEN 3
    Barrier 144
       233. The removal of barrier 144 in 1986 should have reduced the notional capacity of pen 3 as already
    mentioned. But it did more. In the absence of barrier 144, the influx of fans after 2.52 pm met no retarding
    structure as it came into pen 3. The pressure created was free to push fans straight down by the radial fence to
    the lowest line of barriers. The pressure diagonally from the tunnel mouth down to barrier number 124a which
    collapsed was unbroken by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down the pen
    through the gap in the barrier above it created in 1985.

      234. Inspector Bullas, positioned in the west stand, described what he saw looking down on the pens
    around 3 pm.

      "... I saw from the direction of the tunnel a kind of movement down the terracing.., the type of thing that you
      see on the nature programmes, the molten lead flowing down the side of the mountainside, the molten lava ...
      a "river of people" ... going directly towards the pitch but there again spreading ... out."

       235. Dr Eastwood conceded in evidence that the removal of barrier 144 was likely to have contributed to
    the collapse of 124a. Later, he sought to resile from that answer, but I think his earlier admission was correct. It
    was argued that if barrier 144 had remained, the influx from gate C would have built up further back and the
    tragedy might have occurred in the tunnel or might have broken barrier 144 itself. This is speculative and I
    think unlikely. What remained of barrier 144 in pen 4 did not cause a build-up; nor did it collapse. But its
    remaining in position may well have accounted for no barrier further down pen 4 collapsing and for the lesser
    carnage in that pen.

    When did Barrier 124a Fail?
      236. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police sought to argue that this barrier collapsed or may have
    collapsed at about 2.47 pm. His purpose was to suggest that the opening of gate C was not causally linked with
    the crushing and fatalities resulting from that collapse. I have already found that whilst the evidence does not
    permit the time of collapse to be fixed with certainty, it was after 2.52 pm. I now give my reasons:

      (a) I have several times watched the BBC video tape on which Counsel relied. I do not find the incident he
          identifies at 2.47 pm suggestive of a collapse at that time;

      (b) the evidence of fans who were near or at the barrier was overwhelmingly to the effect that the collapse
          occurred at or after 3 pm;

      (c) the biggest group of witnesses was that which related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley’s
          "near-miss" at the Kop end at 3.04 pm;

      (d) the appearance on video and photographs offans in the area ofbarrier 124aaftertheincidentat2.47pm
          and before the final crush is not consistent with it having collapsed so early;

      (e) it is highly unlikely that if so catastrophic an event had occurred as early as 2.47 pm, the police on the
F
          track and elsewhere would have taken until nearly 3 o’clock to realise something was seriously wrong.
          Indeed, if Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in his timing of the collapse, the failure of
          the police to respond for so long would expose them to even graver criticism than that made in this
          Report.

    Dr Eastwood’s Testing of the Barriers
      237. Two sections of barrier 124a in pen 3 collapsed as a result of the overcrowding. That collapse caused a
    number of deaths. Dr Eastwood and his staffhad undertaken the periodical testing of crush barriers required
    by the Green Guide and by the Safety Certificate. Barrier 124a had been tested in July 1988 and passed.

     238. The test had been carried out in accordance with Dr Eastwood’s interpretation of Annex C to the
    Green Guide. That requires an evenly distributed force of 6.0kN/metre width to be applied for 3 five minute


                                                           41
periods, the interval between applications to be as short as possible. A record has to be kept of the amount of
deformation during each loading and of the percentage of recovery. If the recovery is less than 50% after the
third application of force, the barrier has failed the test. If recovery is between 50% and 75%, there must be a
re-test. The question is: 50% or 75% of what? Is the recovery to be in relation to the position of the barrier
before the first application of force or before the third? If the former, a span of 124a recorded 53% at the 1988
test and should have been re-tested. If the latter, it recorded 100% and passed. Unfortunately the Green Guide
is unclear as to the correct interpretation. Dr Eastwood took the latter view and so passed the barrier. He
justified his interpretation in evidence. He said failure to recover to the original position could be due to a
"shake-down" effect related to some giving in the ashes under the concrete or to some other extraneous factor
rather than to any defect in the material of the barrier itself.
   239. I think, after consulting Professor Maunder, that safety ought to have dictated recovery should be by
reference to the position of the barrier before the first application of force. I accept, however, that the Green
Guide is ambiguous and Dr Eastwood’s interpretation is tenable. It has some support from the British
Standards tests on steel structures. Clearly, however, for the future, the Green Guide should be clarified on this
point.

Corrosion
  240. Inspection of barrier 124a, and indeed other barriers at Hillsborough, by the HSE showed
considerable corrosion of the metal at vulnerable points where water could accumulate. Dr Eastwood agreed
that if a significant degree of corrosion was observed on visual inspection, a barrier should be condemned.
  241. The Green Guide does not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides, inter alia:

  "Crush barriers and balustrades should be examined for deformation or any other overt signs of weakness".
Paragraph 6 of Annex C provides:

  "If during any test, even though the barrier.., satisfies the above loading requirements, doubt should arise
  for any reason (including such matters as cracking of the terracing or distortion of connections) as to the
  safety of the barrier ... a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results of this investigation
  remove the doubt as to safety of the barrier... (it) should be deemed to have failed the test".

  242. Since corrosion is a likely cause of deterioration, a revision of the Green Guide should make specific
reference to it.

Causation
  243. Tests done by the HSE suggest that although barrier 124a passed the loading test in 1988 and probably
would have been able to sustain a force which did not exceed the test load, it was unable to resist the load
imposed upon it by reason of the numbers in pen 3, the excessive gap in the barrier higher up the pen and the
absence of barrier 144. Corrosion probably played a part, but the effective cause of the collapse was the
excessive and unanticipated pressure to which the barrier was exposed.

                                               CHAPTER 13

                                 THE CRUSHING NOT RECOGNISED

Observation from Control Room
   244. As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in the control room could be expected
to keep a close watch on pens 3 and 4. They had a direct view of them from an elevated position through their
window. Although they had no field-glasses, there was the zoom facility on the TV camera. The radio was by
then working again and although reception was difficult due to crowd noise and possibly excessive air traffic
on channel 25, attempts could have been made to alert officers on the perimeter track to watch for
overcrowding and report their observations. In the event, pens 3 and 4 became more and more crowded, surges
took place, fans were showing and signalling distress. None of this was seen or recognised in the control room.

Officers on the Track
  245. The 20 officers detailed to the perimeter track were distributed round the pitch so that some five
officers were at the west end. Their written instructions made no reference to the avoidance or detection of
overcrowding. The same applied to the officers in the west stand. Mr Greenwood admitted that his oral
briefings also contained no mention of monitoring the pens for overcrowding.

   246. The Operational Order for 1988 had instructed officers to forbid anyone "access to the track from the
terraces without the consent of a senior officer (except to receive medical attention)". At the end of the 1988
semi-final, there was a minor pitch invasion. Accordingly, that prohibition was emphasised in the 1989
Operational Order by being put into capital letters. The combination of no instructions as to overcrowding and
a strong prohibition on opening the gates was likely to make police recognition of crushing slow and their
response reluctant. Small wonder that the growing pressure and congestion between 2.50 pm and 2.59 pm
went unheeded or certainly unremedied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem, the rule required
consent of a senior officer before a gate could be opened.

  247. "Senior officer" meant an officer of Inspector rank or higher. The Inspector in charge of the 20 officers
on the track was Mr Darling. He stationed himself by the players’ tunnel, the most central position for
supervising his men. In evidence he said:
  "I would only take action ifI thought crowding had got to such a stage that the fans were in danger. I’d then
  inform ground control and I would expect someone deployed to the back of the stand."

  That underlines the inhibition against opening perimeter gates. So did the evidence of one Constable who
said it had been so drummed into officers not to open the gates that when he saw distress in pen 4, he "debated"
with himself before opening the gate, thinking: "If I’m wrong, I’m going to get a right bollocking for this."
Naturally, one would hope that common sense and humanity would make some officers cut through the rules
and open a gate if fans were clearly in distress.

  248. This is what happened, but not until officers recognised the distress and even then not immediately.
Hence, gates 3 and 4, having been opened, were shut again before they were finally opened and at first those
seeking to climb out over the fence were pushed back. This reaction of the police did not go on for as long as
some witnesses believed. They probably misinterpreted the hand movements from Mr Greenwood and others
aimed at persuading fans to move back and relieve the pressure as attempts to stop those climbing out at the
front.
  249. Nevertheless, there was a period during which the failure to recognise the problem and the inhibition
against tackling it caused vital time to be lost.

                                                 CHAPTER 14
                                     THE RESPONSE OF THE POLICE
The Officers in Command
   250. Even when realisation of the problem came to officers on the track, it was some minutes before it
reached the control room. When spectators first appeared on the track, the immediate assumption in the
control room was that a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning of a match. It
became still less likely when those on the track made no move towards the pitch. Mr Motson, the BBC
commentator, recognised and said, well before the match was stopped, that the trouble seemed to be
overcrowding and not misbehaviour. Still, the assumption to the contrary persisted in the control room. Until
Mr Murray radioed for a fleet of ambulances, about 3.06 pm, Mr Duckenfield continued to treat the incident
as a threat to the pitch and to public order. The message calling up all available officers mentioned a pitch
invasion. Operation Support was initiated and dog handlers were requested.
   251. Until Chief Superintendent Nesbit arrived, there was no effective leadership either from control or on
the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. No orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve
pressure. Some officers did this on their own initiative. Apart from the Tannoy request to clear the pitch, no
attempt was made to clear and mark off a casualty area where first-aid could be given without hindrance by
fans and photographers milling about between the bodies. There was no co-ordination of the early provision of
first-aid or of stretcher parties or of the rescue effort through gates 3 and 4. No request for help was broadcast to
doctors and nurses in the crowd until about 3.29 pm when it was too late. Probably, there was little that could
have been achieved in most cases however soon doctors had been summoned, but there were marginal cases
where earlier attention might have made a difference.
   252. The plight of those behind the fencing and the existence of injuries were known to officers at the scene
from 3 pm. But the Major Disaster Plan was not started until 3.06 pm at earliest when the ambulance service
was called. No request for cutting gear or for the fire brigade was made until 3.13 p.m. Again, it is unlikely that
these services could have saved lives if they had been called promptly, but it is possible.
Police on the Pitch
   253. Despite the initial lack ofleadership, many officers did all they humanly could to rescue and revive the
victims. Many supporters who gave evidence paid tribute to these efforts. It is also fair to say that the number
of officers who could at first be usefully involved at the two open gates was necessarily limited.
   254. Chief Superintendent Nesbit’s action in deploying a line of officers across the middle of the pitch has
already been mentioned. I can well understand the resentment it caused. However, the police assertion that a
rush by some fans towards the Kop end raised fears of conflict are well borne out by the video tape. In my
judgement, Chief Superintendent Nesbit was well justified in using some of the many officers called up
pursuant to Operation Support to prevent possible violence. To have had open fighting in a ground where
some 90 spectators already lay dead would have been an unthinkable and obscene development.
Fans on the Pitch
   255. Many fans who escaped onto the pitch alive were in a state of collapse or close to it. Most of those who
retained their strength strove magnificently to assist the victims. They helped pull them clear; they helped with
first-aid; they helped carry the improvised stretchers.
   256. There were fans, however, who were distraught, angry, drunk, or all three. Their conduct in abusing,
assaulting and spitting at the police was disgraceful, the more so since earlier police failures had little to do
with those officers now doing their best for the injured. In addition, there were abuse and assaults on
ambulance men and firemen in the course of their rescue work. This was probably because their similar
uniforms caused them to be mistaken for police. However, although the abuse was widespread, the number of
assaults and spittings was on the evidence comparatively small. In deploring them, one must recognise the
uniquely horrifying experience which those responsible had just suffered and were still suffering.
 False Reports
   257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories reported in the press, and said to have emanated from
 police officers present at the match, of "mass drunkenness". It was said that drunken fans urinated on the
 police while they were pulling the dead and injured out, that others had even urinated on the bodies of the dead
 and stolen their belongings. Not a single witness was called before the Inquiry to support any of those
 allegations although every opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties to have any witness
 called whom they wished. As soon as the allegations I have mentioned were made in the press, Mr Peter
 Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, made a dignified statement dissociating himself from such grave
 and emotive calumnies. Those who made them, and those who disseminated them, would have done better to
 hold their peace.

                             THE PERIMETER GATES WERE TOO SMALL
  258. The perimeter gates in the pens were not designed as exits. They were intended to afford access by the
police to cope with any local disorder or with an emergency. The kind of emergency contemplated was not
massive crushing but, for example, the collapse or illness of an individual. Emergency evacuation of the pens
had been considered by the Officer Working Party. Although fire risk was minimal since the terraces, west
stand and tunnel were of concrete construction, the fire brigade were the principal arbiters of evacuation
procedure. They aimed to be able to empty the pens in six minutes. The plan was to evacuate spectators via the
tunnel. If for any reason that option became impracticable, eg due to a bomb threat, then the alternative route
would be along the back of the terraces, through the gates in the radial fences and round the sides of the west
stand. The fire brigade were satisfied that each of these routes would enable the pens to be evacuated in less
than six minutes, without relying on the gates to the pitch. Those gates would also be available, but their use
was excluded from the calculation of evacuation time.
  259. The need to provide for speedy and large scale evacuation from the front of the pens to the pitch was
not anticipated. The Green Guide (1986) provides as follows:

  "209. Access to the pitch must be made as difficult as possible in normal circumstances while at the same
  time ensuring that the police have effective access to the terraces for the purpose of crowd control and
  enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the event of serious emergency...
  214 .... at some major soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd movement forms a necessary part of the
  safety measures, it may be necessary to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
  circumstances.., but allows for access in emergency.
  215. For most major stadia, whether used for association football or other sports, the pitch perimeter fence
  will be required either to prevent access to the pitch as mentioned above, or at least to discourage attempts
  by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates or other access points (minimum width 1.1 metres) should
  nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency... Provision of such gates or access points is particularly
  important to allow full access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a place of safety in
  an emergency. Such gates or access points should be properly stewarded and clearly
  marked so that immediate access to the playing area or perimeter track can be ensured".

  260. Gate 3 was .82 metres in width; gate 4 was .79 metres in width. There were therefore clear departures
from the Green Guide standard.
  261. The Safety Certificate provided (by Schedule 2 Paragraph 24) as follows:

  The (club) shall arrange for the Stadium to be inspected by a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer... at
  least once each period of 12 months.., and.., shall as soon as possible after each inspection supply to
  the... Council a Certificate by the said Chartered Engineer as to the current compliance or non-compliance
  with.., the appropriate provisions and recommendations of the (Green) Guide of all structural parts of the
  Stadium...
  262. It was argued that there was no breach of the Safety Certificate since the Green Guide specifically
provides for flexibility. However, in my view the Safety Certificate cannot and certainly should not be
interpreted so liberally as in effect to leave such basic requirements as the size of exit gates to the total
discretion of the club and its advisers. One of the matters for consideration at stage two of this inquiry will be
whether, and in what respects, the Green Guide needs to be clarified and toughened.

  263. Dr Eastwood explained the small width ofthe gates by reference to the dilemma facing the police. They
wanted a gate sufficient for its intended purpose ie police access and small scale emergencies. On the other
hand, they did not want a flood gate of such size as to endanger the prime principle of preventing pitch
invasions. In the light of Hillsborough, this is perhaps the most poignant example of the difficulty of achieving
a balance between stopping hooliganism and ensuring crowd safety.
  264. Even if the width of gates 3 and 4 had complied with the present Green Guide standard, they would
have been wholly inadequate to relieve pressure and release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the
Green Guide says nothing about the number of gates required for a pen of given size. Whilst the Club,

                                                         45
Dr Eastwood, the Officer Working Party and the local authority can be criticised for failing strictly to conform
to the Guide, the real failure was common to all those who have been responsible for considering safety on the
terraces. The anxiety to protect the sanctity of the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk
of a crush due to overcrowding. Certain it was, that once the crush occurred on 15 April gates 3 and 4 were
wholly inadequate for rescue purposes.

                                               CHAPTER 16

                                     BRIEF SUMMARY OF CAUSES
  265. The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the failure, when gate C was
opened, to cut offaccess to the central pens which were already overfull.

  266. They were already overfull because no safe maximum capacities had been laid down, no attempt was
made to control entry to individual pens numerically and there was no effective visual monitoring of crowd
density.

  267. When the influx from gate C entered pen 3, the layout of the barriers there afforded less protection
than it should and a barrier collapsed. Again, the lack of vigilant monitoring caused a sluggish reaction and
response when the crush occurred. The small size and number of gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So,
in the initial stages, did lack of leadership.

  268. The need to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the turnstiles. That occurred because, as
both Club and police should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large numbers
demanded of it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The Operational Order and police tactics on
the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival of large numbers should that occur in a short
period. That it might so occur was foreseeable and it did. The presence of an unruly minority who had drunk
too much aggravated the problem. So did the Club’s confused and inadequate signs and ticketing.




                                                     47
                                                CHAPTER 17

                                     THE FA’s CHOICE OF GROUND
   269. The FA were strongly criticised by the Football Supporters’ Association and others for having
imposed the Hillsborough venue on Liverpool for a second year running. The Liverpool supporters had to
travel much further to Sheffield than their Nottingham rivals. The police required that if the match was to be at
Hillsborough at all, Liverpool would have to have the west and north side accommodation. The disadvantages
of that and the disparate numbers of home supporters of the two clubs have already been set out. Liverpool had
had to knuckle under to the arrangement in 1988. They resented having it imposed in 1989. To hold the match
at Old Trafford would have been a perfectly good and acceptable alternative. Indeed, the FA nominated Old
Trafford as the venue for the replay should there be a draw at Hillsborough.

  270. Mr Kelly, the FA’s Chief Executive, sought to give reasons for preferring Hillsborough, but the only one
which seemed to have any validity was that the 1988 match had been considered a successfully managed event.
He admitted that a telephone call from the Chief Executive of the Liverpool Club protesting and putting
Liverpool’s case had not been mentioned to the FA committee which finally decided the venue. Mr Kelly
frankly conceded that "there was an element of unfairness" to Liverpool in choosing Hillsborough for a second
time. I think the decision was ill-considered. No doubt in future the FA will be more sensitive and responsive
to reasonable representations.
  271. However, it was not suggested that the choice of venue was causative of this disaster. The only basis on
which that could be said would be that, because of its layout, the Leppings Lane end was incapable of being
successfully policed for this semi-final. I do not believe that to be so.




                                                      48

                                                  POLICE
Choice of Ends by the Police
   272. There was much bitterness amongst Liverpool supporters that they had to make do again for the
second year with the Leppings Lane end. But, cogent as their complaints were, they amounted to reasons for
choosing a different ground altogether. Given Hillsborough as the venue, I think the police were right to
allocate the sections of the ground as they did. The direction of arrival and the need for segregation made it
sensible and to reverse the 1988 arrangements would have made for confusion. As with choice of venue, I do
not consider choice of ends was causative of the disaster. Had it been reversed, the disaster could well have
occurred in a similar manner but to Nottingham supporters.
Police Planning
  273. The Operational Order for 1989 left much unsaid. Apart from the lack of any provision for late or
congested arrivals, or any provision for the avoidance of overcrowding on the terraces, there was a number of
other omissions. For example, there was no specific deployment of officers to man the perimeter gates. The
Order did not detail the duties of the mounted officers deployed at the Leppings Lane entrance, who included
Liverpool officers to assist in marshalling their own fans. The duties of Superintendents (especially Mr
Greenwood and Mr Marshall) were not defined so as to achieve clarity and efficiency. By an oversight, the
provision requiring mobile (Tango) patrols to assist the emergency services was omitted from the text.
  274. The 1988 Order was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the number of officers deployed in
shopping areas and to emphasise in capital letters the embargo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
with the 1988 event led to complacency. That some thought the pens overfull in 1988 and that the tunnel was
closed offon that occasion did not figure in or influence the plan for 1989.
  275. Mr Duckenfield was promoted and put in charge ofF Division only 21 days before this semi-final. The
pre-planning was already in progress under Mr Mole who had been in command both in 1987 and in 1988. It
might have been wiser to have left Mr Mole in charge of this operation. On the other hand, it is quite
understandable that Mr Duckenfield should have been expected to take command of events in his Division
from the date of his promotion. In view of his lack of experience at Hillsborough and of a semi-final match,
however, it was imperative that he be fully briefed and that he should also brief himself.
  276. He was not informed of the crushing incident in 1981 nor did he make inquiries which would have
revealed it. He did not know the arrangement as between Club and police for monitoring the Leppings Lane
terraces. He did not visit and tour the ground before approving the Operational Order. Although he attended a
match on 2 April, there was only a small crowd present and he left control of the game to the Superintendents.
Policing on the Day
   277. One of the regrettable features of the football scene as it has developed is the enormous expenditure of
money, time and effort in employing large numbers of police all over the country to guard against the sort of
disorder and misbehaviour which have become endemic. Police management of a game of football has become
a military operation. The problems faced and the responses received must be disheartening and may have
tended to harden police attitudes to supporters in general.
  278. It is fair to state that over many years the South Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the
public. They have handled crowd problems sensitively and successfully at a large number of football games
including major matches, during strikes in the coal industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts.
Unfortunately, their policing on 15 April broke down in the ways already described and, although there were
other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control,
   279. In all some 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I must report that for the most
part the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank. There were many young Constables
who as witnesses were alert, intelligent and open. On the day, they and many others strove heroically in ghastly
circumstances aggravated by hostility to rescue and succour victims. They inspired confidence and hope.
   280. By contrast, with some notable exceptions, the senior officers in command were defensive and evasive
witnesses. Their feelings of grief and sorrow were obvious and genuine. No doubt those feelings were
intensified by the knowledge that such a disaster had occurred under their management. But, neither their
handling of problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be
expected of their rank.

                                                      49
   281. Mr Duckenfield leant heavily on Mr Murray’s experience. Between them they misjudged the build-up
at the turnstiles and did little about it until they received Mr Marshall’s request to open the gate. They did not,
for example, check the turnstile figures available from Club control or check with Tango units as to the
numbers still to come. They did not alert Mr Greenwood to the situation at the fringe of his area of command.
They gave no instructions as to the management of the crowd at Leppings Lane. Inflexibly they declined to
postpone kick-off.

  282. When Mr Marshall’s request came, Mr Duckenfield’s capacity to take decisions and give orders
seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening of the gates, he failed to give necessary
consequential orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the emergence of
fans from pens 3 and 4. When he was unsure of the problem, he sent others down to "assess the situation"
rather than descend to see for himself. He gave no information to the crowd.
  283. Most surprisingly, he gave Mr Kelly and others to think that there had been an inrush due to Liverpool
fans forcing open a gate. This was not only untruthful. It set off a widely reported allegation against the
supporters which caused grave offence and distress. It revived against football fans, and especially those from
Liverpool, accusations of hooliganism which caused reaction not only nationwide but from Europe too. I can
only assume that Mr Duckenfield’s lack ofcandour on this occasion was out of character. He said his reason for
not telling the truth was that if the crowd became aware of it there might be a very hostile reaction and this
might impede rescue work. He did not wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell Mr Kelly the truth did not require that he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
although Assistant Chief Constable Jackson was at hand, Mr Duckenfield did not disclose the truth to him
until much later.
  284. The likeliest explanation of Mr Duckenfield’s conduct is that he simply could not face the enormity of
the decision to open the gates and all that flowed therefrom. That would explain what he said to Mr Kelly, what
he did not say to Mr Jackson, his aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective control of the
disaster situation. He froze.
The Police Case at the Inquiry
  285. It is a matter of regret that at the hearing, and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what occurred. Mr Duckenfield, under pressure of
cross-examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But, that apart, the police
case was to blame the fans for being late and drunk, and to blame the Club for failing to monitor the pens. It was
argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate C but was due to barrier 124a being
defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt. It would
have been more seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

                       THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE SAFETY CERTIFICATE
  286. The performance by the City Council ofits duties in regard to the Safety Certificate was inefficient and
dilatory. The failure to revise or amend the certificate over the period of three years preceding this disaster,
despite important changes in the layout of the ground, was a serious breach of duty. There were, as a result, no
fixed capacities for the pens. The certificate took no account of the 1981 and 1985 alterations to the ground.
  287. A number of breaches of Green Guide standards were permitted and persisted eg the spacing of the
crush barriers, the width of perimeter gates and the gradient in the tunnel (1 in 6 as against the Green Guide
maximum of 1 in 10).
  288. The Advisory Group lacked a proper structure; its procedure was casual and unbusinesslike. Its
accountability to the General Purposes Panel was ill-defined. Decisions were taken informally and too much
was left to Mr Bownes. In particular, the decision to remove barrier 144 was not referred to the Panel and ought
not to have been made.




                                                       51
                                                CHAPTER 20

                                     THE CLUB AND DR EASTWOOD
  289. It should be recorded that in general the Club has over the years adopted a responsible and
conscientious approach to its responsibilities. It retained the services of Dr Eastwood as consultant engineer
and abided by his advice. For his part, Dr Eastwood is skilled and experienced in this field, as already
indicated, and he sought I have no doubt to act efficiently and professionally in his advice and practical work.
The Club also retained Mr Lock who had acquired great experience and knowledge of Hillsborough during his
police service. A number of witnesses described Hillsborough as a very good ground, "one of the best in the
country". The police agreed that relations between them and the Club were good. Over the last four years, the
Club had spent some £1 ’A million on ground improvements.

  290. Nevertheless, there are a number of respects in which failure by the Club contributed to this disaster.
They were responsible as occupiers and invitors for the layout and structure of the ground. The Leppings Lane
end was unsatisfactory and ill-suited to admit the numbers invited, for reasons already spelt out. The Club was
aware of these problems and discussed solving them in various ways between 1981 and 1986. In the result,
there remained the same number of turnstiles, and the same problems outside and inside them. The plan for
this semi-final, involving as it did the loss of t 2 turnstiles for the north stand and large numbers to be fed in
from Leppings Lane, was one agreed between the Club and the police. The Club knew best what rate of
admission the turnstiles could manage and ought to have alerted the police to the risks of the turnstiles being
swamped.
   291. The alterations inside the turnstiles and on the terraces clearly affected capacity, but no specific
allowance was made for them. In that respect, both Dr Eastwood and the Club should have taken a more
positive approach. Either a scheme such as one of those Dr Eastwood put forward should have been adopted
giving more turnstiles and total separation of areas or at the very least the capacity of the new pens and of the
terraces as a whole should have been treated more cautiously. The police view in 1981 that 10,100 was too high
a figure was known to the Club (although Dr Eastwood says not to him). Yet, despite that and the sub-division
into pens, the figure remained.

  292. Although the police had assumed responsibility for monitoring the pens, the Club had a duty to its
visitors and the Club’s officials ought to have alerted the police to the grossly uneven distribution of fans on the
terraces. The Club operated and read the closed circuit television and the computer totaliser. Liaison between
Club and police on the day failed to alert the latter to the number of Liverpool supporters still to come. The
onus here was on the Club as well as on the police.
  293. The removal of barrier 144 was the responsibility of the Club although it clearly acted on the advice of
Dr Eastwood and the Advisory Group which in this instance was misguided.

  294. Likewise, the breaches of the Green Guide were matters which the Club should have appreciated and
remedied.

   295. Lastly, as already indicated, the poor signposting on the concourse tended to produce under-filling of
the wing pens and over-filling of pens 3 and 4. Poor signposting outside the turnstiles and the unhelpful format
of the tickets also led to confusion aggravating the build-up in the turnstile area.

                               FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY SERVICES
No Fault by the Emergency Services
   296. I say at the outset of this chapter that no valid criticism can be made of the response by the St John
Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS or by the fire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any
criticism of them. The only attack on SYMAS came from two Liverpool doctors. One claimed that ambulances
did not arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipment and that there was a lack of triage. He was proved to be
wrong in all three respects. Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April when he said more
lives could have been saved if staff and equipment had arrived earlier. Apart from being proved wrong in fact
as to the times of arrival of ambulances, he conceded in evidence that it was not possible to say whether lives
could have been saved. His comments on television were irresponsible. The other doctor complained of the
absence of defibrillators. I am satisfied on overwhelming evidence that to attempt to use a defibrillator on the
pitch with people milling about would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk of injury from the electric
charge.

  297. I find that all three of the emergency services named above responded promptly when alerted, that
they brought appropriate equipment and that their personnel operated efficiently.

  298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium, medical facilities capable of dealing with a
major disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
equipment and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

  299. What is required is a basic level of provision for first aid, for professional medical attention and for
ambulance attendance, together with a system of co-ordination with the emergency services which will bring
them to the scene swiftly in whatever numbers are required. What will amount to an appropriate basic
provision for the future eg the equipment in a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and advice.

  300. On the day, there was no clear understanding between the Club and Dr Purcell as to his role. He
believed he was primarily there to attend to the players. The Club regarded him also as the "physician available
to attend at the first aid room if required", as laid down in the Safety Certificate.
  301. There was insufficiently close co-operation between the police and the emergency services. It is clear
that SYMAS and the fire brigade should have been called earlier than they were. However, in view of the nature
and extent of the crushing, the time when police rescue began and the pathetically short period for which those
unable to breathe could survive, it is improbable that quicker recourse to the emergency services would have
saved more lives.
  302. Finally, there was evidence that an advertising board had to be knocked down at the north-east corner
of the ground to allow an ambulance onto the pitch and that at the top of the ramp leading to the pitch the
access for ambulances was inadequate. There was also evidence that the pre-match arrangement for
ambulances to use the two gates from Penistone Road at the north-east end of the ground as in and out routes
was frustrated by the presence of vehicles just inside the ground. In the event, none of these matters affected
operations. The hoarding was quickly knocked down. The difficult access to the ramp was negotiated and
ambulances used one entrance satisfactorily by backing out when loaded.

                                         COMMUNICATIONS
   303. One problem which impeded police control and the gathering of intelligence was the intermittent
failure of communication by radio. There was the period of two or three minutes when the control room was
out of radio contact. Even when that was remedied, it was only by using a hand set in the control room. This
meant that control could not override any other messages. No effective radio communication seems to have
reached control from the perimeter track at the relevant time. Mr Greenwood’s request for the match to be
stopped and various messages from Constables reporting the distress in the pens did not register. Likewise,
communication from Leppings Lane to control was unreliable. Undoubtedly these breakdowns made it more
difficult for those in command to make proper assessments and exercise effective command.

                       PART IV - INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS
                                    CHAPTER 23 - INTRODUCTION
Limited Objectives
  304. It is important to stress the limited objectives of the interim recommendations I can make in this
Report. My purpose is to propose instant measures capable of being implemented forthwith and where
possible before the commencement of the 1989/1990 season. They are designed to prevent overcrowding and
crushing on terraces in the short term and to improve safety procedures. They do not and cannot meet all the
problems or address all the issues of post-Hillsborough football. Wider issues such as membership schemes,
identity cards, all-seater stadia, super-stadia and long term recommendations fall to be considered in my Final
Report. So do a number of other specific matters such as a comprehensive review of the Green Guide, the
problem of excessive pre-match drinking, fans ~vithout tickets and ticket touts. I mention these matters lest it
be thought I have decided no recommendations need be made concerning them. I have not. But before
deciding what if any recommendations to make about these and other matters, more evidence and study is
required.

  305. Accordingly, the main thrust of these interim recommendations, as a holding exercise, is to reduce
numbers on the terraces, to increase vigilance and to achieve a proper balance in crowd control between
prevention of disorder and maintenance of safety.


Perimeter Fences
   306. It would be impractical and unwise to recommend works of construction or radical structural changes
now, before completing the extensive study and consultation which will form stage two of this Inquiry. Hasty
interim recommendations of that kind might well prove to be ill-judged after further study and require to be
changed in a matter of months.

   307. In particular, I do not at this stage make any recommendation as to removing perimeter fences or
replacing them with structures of different design. Understandably, there was a wave of popular feeling against
such fences in the immediate aftermath of Hillsborough. The horrifying spectacle of people being crushed
against the fencing focussed blame for the disaster on the fences themselves. There were pleas to dismantle
them and emotive references to the fans being treated like "caged animals". Some clubs removed their fencing
straightaway. It was therefore very tempting to consider at an early stage making a recommendation that the
fences should be removed. I confess to being so tempted.

  308. Regrettably, only a month after Hillsborough, there were incidents which showed that violence and
hooliganism are still liable to erupt at football grounds. On 13 May at Selhurst Park, Birmingham City
supporters invaded the pitch and fought with supporters of the home club, Crystal Palace. Five police officers
and 16 supporters were injured and required treatment at a local hospital. On the same day at a match between
Bristol City and Sheffield United, spectators spilt onto the pitch and there was fighting on the terraces. At the
Cup Final between Liverpool and Everton on 20 May, there was a pitch invasion, albeit a comparatively
benign one.

  309. Even the Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) felt it necessary to say in their final submission,
       "With some reservations, the FSA accept that perimeter fences are necessary for crowd control."

  310. Bearing in mind those matters, and the need to consider further expert evidence, I have decided that it
would be unwise and premature for me to make any recommendations now either to remove or to preserve or
to alter the structure of perimeter fences. I shall make recommendations about them in my Final Report.
   311. For the present, I would emphasise that, although the fencing prevented escape, the real cause of the
Hillsborough disaster was overcrowding and it is against that danger that my interim recommendations are
primarily directed. Whilst declining to recommend the removal of the fences, I do consider that the gates to the
pitch should be kept open whilst the terraces are occupied. This will have, I hope, three beneficial effects.
Obviously, an open gate is a more ready escape route than one which has to be locked. Secondly, the sight of
open gates will be reassuring to spectators on the terraces. Thirdly, the existence of gaps in the fencing by
reason of the open gates will concentrate the minds of police officers or stewards on the track to the need for
careful monitoring of those on the terraces.


                                                      55
  312. It will ofcourse be necessary to have a police presence sufficient to prevent pitch invasion for improper
reasons through the open gates. However, I am encouraged to think that this is not an insuperable problem by
the fact that, for example at Anfield, Liverpool’s ground, there were no gates in the perimeter fencing before it
was taken down. There were instead gaps or "access points" as they are called in the Green Guide (paragraph
215). Their existence did not, so far as I am aware, prevent the authorities from maintaining order. Also, the
gates were open throughout the replay of this ill-fated semi-final at Old Trafford on 7 May 1989.

Reduced Numbers
   313. In the assessment of figures for capacity, the criteria in Chapter 16 of the Green Guide were not at
Hillsborough, and may not elsewhere, have been applied with sufficient rigour. Therefore, in addition to
reminding and enjoining local authorities and clubs to make all necessary deductions when assessing the
figure for maximum capacity in accordance with the Green Guide, I recommend reducing that figure by a
further 15% as an interim measure.

Safety Certificate
  314. The Safety Certificate procedure should, if it is properly administered and enforced, go far towards
achieving crowd safety. Whether it succeeds depends upon the vigilance and commitment of the local
authority issuing the Certificate. I do not know whether the poor performance of the local authority at
Hillsborough was typical. Arguments have been put to me suggesting the need for some national oversight or
inspection of local authority certification procedures. This raises complex issues which I shall want to consider
further at stage two of the Inquiry. For the present, I make recommendations as to the content of Safety
Certificates and arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing, amending and renewing them.




                                                       56
                                   CHAPTER 24 - THE RECOMMENDATIONS
      315. The recommendations which follow are the minimum necessary to ensure that existing football
    grounds can for the present be safely used, based upon the evidence which I have heard at Sheffield and other
    information I have received. They complement the recommendations which Mr Justice Popplewell set out
    after his inquiry at Bradford.

       316. Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the 1989/90 season starts. The rest should be
    started forthwith and completed as soon as possible.

    Maximum Capacities for Terraces
    *      1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
         should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

         A pen or area is to be deemed "self-contained" notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
         another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.
    *     2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
         Guide ("the Green Guide figure") subject to the following qualifications:-

         (a) in arriving at "the Green Guide figure", proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
              which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
              in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

         (b) after assessing "the Green Guide figure", a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
             margin.

           3. Arrangements should be made:-

         (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
              figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
              ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and
         (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


    Filling and Monitoring Terraces
    ~t 4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
         responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
         other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
        variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

    ~t     5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
         area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
         sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
         period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
         or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
         below, and by radio to the control room.

i
    Fences and Gates
          6. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
       duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
       crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
       demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
       different crowd densities.
            7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
         different colour from the rest of the fence and marked "Emergency Exit".


                                                             57
      8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
    when spectators are on the terrace.
       9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
    The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
    stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be able to make radio contact with the control room
    either himself or via an officer close at hand.

       10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
    are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
    brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of a
    nominated senior police officer at the ground.

Crusb~Barriers
,     11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
   to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.
      12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
    complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessment of the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
    reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
      13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.
      14. Any local anthority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
     Certificate should require to be renewed annually. .....

        16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
     amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
     accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
     effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
     with the local authority’s rules.

        17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
     of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
     the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters’ club. The Advisory Group’s terms of
     reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
     ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
     and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
     written reports for consideration by the local authority.

Duties of each Football Club
*     18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
   inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
   anticipated.


                                                         58
~r     19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
     as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
     turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
     accordingly.
~r     20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
     reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
     operators for this purpose.

       21. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
     concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

~r     22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
     reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
     and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
     area.

~r     23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
     the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
     should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

~r     24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
     by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
     admitting spectators to the ground.
       25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
     entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.

Police Planning
*     26. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
    should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
    concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

*       27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
     officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
     is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

*      28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
     any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
     sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

*      29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
     Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

        30. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
     monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
     at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
     in the interpretation and use of these data.


Communications
    31. There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
  received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
  priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be
  used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
  sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.




                                                        59
      32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
    with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.
      33. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
    areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
    announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
    noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
    match.

       34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
    Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
    the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.

Co-ordination of Emergency Services
*     35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
   liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.
      36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
    ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
    spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
    concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
    rooms of each of the emergency services.
*     37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
    services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
    within the ground itself.

*      38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
    the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
    they are required.

First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
*      39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
    club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.
      40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
    equipment to be maintained, within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
    medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.
      41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
    any medical exigency at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be
    present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
    match. His whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
    contactable.
*      42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
    attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

      43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
    be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
    requirement of the Safety Certificate.

                                                SPECIFIC INCIDENTS

    Mr Hicks’ Evidence
       1. Mr and Mrs Hicks’ two daughters died in the disaster. They had arrived early en famille but had tickets
    for different sections. The two daughters had standing tickets; they went into pen 3. Mrs Hicks had a seat in the
    north stand. Mr Hicks took up a standing position in pen 1 just below and to the west of the police box at about
    2.15 pm From there, he had a view of the centre pens. He kept an eye on them as they filled up since he knew his
    daughters to be there.
      2. His evidence was that by 2.50 pm he could see people were in distress. At about 2.55 pm he and others
    called to a senior police officer at the top of the steps to the control box to draw his attention to the crushing. Mr
    Hicks was only about 10 feet from the officer. He described him as wearing a fiat cap with gold or silver braid
    and a light coloured anorak. Mr Hicks believed he was the officer who stopped the match. Mr Greenwood, who
    did stop the match, was certainly not wearing a light coloured anorak, as can clearly be seen on the video.
       3. Mr Hicks says that he and others shouted several times to this officer in attempts to alert him to the
    distress in the pens. There was no reaction although Mr Hicks believes the officer must have been in earshot.
       4. That officer descended from the steps and two cameramen whom Mr Hicks believed were from
    television came and appeared to direct their cameras towards the pens. Another senior officer appeared two
    steps down from the platform. He was a stocky figure; he also wore a flat cap but with black braid. Mr Hicks
    says that he and two or three others tried several times to capture this officer’s attention without success. Then
    Mr Hicks says he shouted "For Christ’s sake! Can’t you see what’s going on? We can, and you have cameras". The
    officer is said to have replied dismissively "Shut your fucking prattle".

      5. When the disaster occurred the two Hicks girls were crushed. Victoria was put in an ambulance and Mr
    Hicks accompanied her to hospital where she was found to be dead. Sarah died at the ground.
      6. Mr Hicks was an impressive witness and, despite his grievous loss, remarkably stoical. He gave his
    evidence clearly and without rancour. He was certainly mistaken about Mr Greenwood being one of those on
    the steps and it has not been possible to identify either officer from Mr Hicks’ descriptions. He may well also
    have been imprecise as to timings. Nevertheless, I see no reason to doubt that what he described did occur in
    relation to two officers. As Mr Hicks generously said himself, the dismissive abuse from the second officer
    (although reprehensible) may have been due to his being preoccupied with trying to see what was happening at
    pens 3 and 4 around kick-off time.
    The Goalkeeper and Gate 4
       7. Mr Barnbrock, a Liverpool supporter, said he went through the tunnel. He would have liked to have
    turned back when he saw how crowded the pens were. He went with his father and 13 year old brother Stephen
    towards the front of pen 4. He saw the teams come onto the pitch. Conditions at the front were, he said, alright
    until about 2 minutes to 3. Then the pressure in the pen increased and he and his father became separated. His
    feet came offthe ground. He shouted to police officers through the fence to get them out and help them. The
    police did not react. The Liverpool goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar, spoke to a policeman on the track. The gate
    was then opened by a blonde policewoman and about 25 to 30 people went through it. They included the
    witness’s father and his brother Stephen who had a broken arm. A police Constable shut the gate. It was then
[   reopened by the same policewoman, the witness thought, and he got out.
F
       8. Mr Eccleston, a male nurse and an impressive witness, was sitting in the north stand. He noticed pens 3
     and 4 were full and realised something was wrong when fans started coming over the perimeter fence but did
     not invade the pitch. He said the Liverpool goalkeeper appeared to notice this too.
      9. Mr Grobbelaar was out of the country during the Inquiry and was therefore not called. However, he
     made a statement which was put in as his evidence. In the course of it he said:-
       "Kick-offhappened and we got into our stride pretty quickly- we forced a corner pretty early on and the ball
       came down to my end - I rolled it out to the full back once and play went on until Peter Beardsley hit the
       crossbar of the Nottingham Forest goal from a corner and came back into play. I remember just after that
       there were shouts and screams from the crowd just behind me, it was different; not the ordinary crowd noise
       and I turned around to look. What amazed me first was the concentration and squash of fans in the centre


                                                              63
section, the end areas still had plenty of space. It was only then I became conscious that the crowd was
squashing forward and wasn’t able to go sideways and that’s when I noticed the fencing alongside them
holding them in. I saw fans being pulled up into the stand above the terraces, I saw fans climbing over into the
empty areas at the side and I saw fans climbing out over the front onto the pitch which was particularly
difficult because of the spikes on the top of the fencing but they were getting out.
   "Play was still going on and I was in a terrible position trying to concentrate on play and having my
attention taken by what was happening behind me. The ball came down to our end and Nottingham Forest
won a corner, it was taken and we cleared oui" box area and as play was going forward over the centre line I
heard a shout, ’Bruce - please help’ - a desperate shout from a fan squashed up against the fencing to the
right of my goal as I looked at Leppings Lane terraces. He screamed, ’Please get the fucking gate open - Help,
help’. All the people who could speak were pleading for help. There were two policemen near the gate right
alongside the fan who had shouted to me and so I shouted to them, ’Get the gate open’. I was still trying to
concentrate on play and was still having my attention taken by what was happening behind me - there were
lots of fans on the pitch behind the goal area by them too. I called again to the policemen, ’Open the fucking
gate’ and one just turned away from me and looked back at the crowd but the other went to the gate and
opened it and it was like taking the top off a shaken coke bottle - people were everywhere on the play area
around my goal. Play was still going on and it came down towards me again for the left hand comer. It was
a Nottingham Forest throw-in, away to my left, the ball was out of play and a fan came up to me on the
pitch and said, ’Bruce, they’re killing us’. I said ’Who’s killing you?’, and he said ’They’re crushing us-our
fans’. I said ’Go and get some help’, and then a policeman came on and spoke to this fan. I don’t know
who the fan was, and then he led him off. It was about this time I saw a policeman running onto the pitch
from my right across my box and to the referee who blew up, recovered the ball and told all players to clear
the pitch."
   10. It is clear from the video that Mr Grobbelaar’s recollection of the sequence of events, even with regard
to the game, is inaccurate in a number of respects. For example, the two Nottingham Forest corner kicks
occurred minutes before Beardsley struck the bar. Further, it seems highly probable from other evidence that
gates 3 and 4 were open continuously well before Mr Grobbelaar says the fan asked him to get the gate open. It
seems surprising too that with all the noise Mr Grobbelaar would hear the precise words of an individual fan,
let alone respond twice to them, whilst the game was in progress.
   11. As to Mr Barnbrock’s account, the evidence of PC Fiona Richardson was that she was the only
policewoman on the track in the early stages although others came from the seated area as the incident
developed. PC Richardson began at gate 1 and, although she did go and help people out through gate 3, she
did not go to gate 4, and did not open it twice or even once. The two officers who spoke of opening gate 4 were
both male.
   12. I think Mr Grobbelaar did become conscious of distress in the crowd behind him and did speak to a
police officer at some stage, probably earlier than he now thinks. Not to reach that broad conclusion would
involve attributing his whole account to invention or fantasy and I see no grounds for doing so. However, his
detailed account was not tested in cross-examination and its inconsistencies and errors when compared with
other incontrovertible evidence would make it unsafe to derive more than the broad conclusion stated above.
The incident shows how honest witnesses can become confused and their evidence flawed when recollecting
events experienced under tension or emotion.
   13. As to the opening of gate 4 there was an apparent conflict of evidence. PC Illingworth said that about
five minutes to 3 he opened it and guided fans emerging through it to gate 5. PC Hooson said that it was he
who opened gate 4 just before kick-off. I am satisfied from the evidence of a number of fans that, like gate 3,
gate 4 was opened more than once. The probability is, therefore, that whilst PC Illingworth was shepherding
fans to gate 5, gate 4 had been closed again until it was re-opened by PC Hooson two or three minutes later.
Oxygen
   14. It was alleged by a doctor that an oxygen cylinder provided to him on the pitch was empty. Dr Phillips, a
Liverpool supporter, had been in pen 3 with his brother and others. He came under pressure and climbed into
pen 2. When the disaster occurred and gate 2 was opened, he went through it, injuring his head as he did so. He
came onto the pitch sometime after 3.10 pm and started resuscitation procedures. He was given an oxygen
cylinder. He believes this was from St John Ambulance. It was, he thought, too early to be the fire service. The
cylinder was switched on but Dr Phillips says it gave no oxygen since it was empty. There was one oxygen
cylinder on the St John’s ambulance which came to the scene. Mr Wells, the Divisional Superintendent of St
John, took that cylinder onto the pitch. He said it was effective. In particular, he recalls going to a patient being
treated by Dr Phillips and says that oxygen was flowing into that patient. Moreover, Mr Wells tested the
cylinder afterwards and found it was still half full. It has a capacity that will last for 5 hours 40 minutes on a
high setting.

                                                        64
   15. There was evidence from Assistant Chief Fire Officer Hornsby that a Maxaman resuscitator had failed
to work properly. It was delivering an oxygen flow appropriate to a "child" setting rather than a full "adult"
flow. On examination, it was found that a retaining nut in the control knob had worked loose, possibly due to
vibration in transit, and this had affected the flow of oxygen. The device had last been tested on 10 April 1989.
  16. I accept the evidence of Mr Wells that the St John Ambulance cylinder was charged with oxygen and
working properly. In my view, Dr Phillips may have been mistaken as to the cylinder of which he complains
being empty. He agreed he was under great pressure, in an awkward situation; his head was injured and he
became very angry at what he regarded then as wholly the fault of the police. He conceded that if the cylinder
was not empty there was a possible alternative - that the master tank top valve was shut. It seems unlikely that
he could have been referring to the fire service resuscitator as he was clear that the bottle he received was a
simple piece of equipment not designed to breathe for the patient but merely to supply oxygen.
  17. I conclude that on a balance of probabilities the evidence does not justify a finding that an empty
cylinder was brought to the scene.
Calling the Fire Service
   18. PC Bichard’s call to police Headquarters at 3.13 pm for the fire service to bring hydraulic cutting
equipment to cut metal fences (see paragraph 101 supra) was heard by Chief Inspector Edmundson. He went
into the adjacent operations room to give instructions for the message to be passed to the fire service. There, a
temporary control room assistant was already speaking to the fire service about a house fire. Mr Edmundson
interrupted the call and asked the assistant to tell the fire service that cutting equipment was wanted at
Hillsborough. There followed a conversation between the assistant and Miss Davies at the fire service in the
following terms:-
  Police       Can we have cutting gear for Hillsborough, please - straight away?
  Fire Control Just a minute. Right- what’s the address?
  Police       Cutting equipment for Hillsborough football ground - straight away.
  Fire Control Hillsborough football ground?
  Police       Yes, Hillsborough football ground.
  Fire Control What road is that on? Do you know?
  Police       There has been a major accident, all the ambulances are up there.
  Fire Control What road is it on?
  Police       I have no idea; Hillsborough football ground.
  Fire Control What road is it on? Do you know?
  Police       "Hillsborough football ground - what road is it on?" (this was said to someone in Police
               Force Control) - "Penistone Road" (to Fire Control).
  Fire Control Penistone Road.
  Police       Penistone Road, OK.
  Fire Control Penistone Road, just a minute - what’s exactly involved?
  Police       It’s football, a big match, Liverpool v Notts Forest.
  Fire Control Yes, but why do you want us; you said it was an RTA [Road Traffic Accident].
  Police       No, no, no; major incident inside the ground.
  Fire Control Major incident inside - do you know exactly what it is?
  Police        No, I don’t; they want all the cutting gear.
  Fire Control For what - do you know?
  Police        Hang on a sec.
  At that point Chief Inspector Edmundson intervened and spoke for the police. The conversation
concluded:-
   Police         (Male voice) - Hello!


                                                      65
  Fire Control Hello! Now you wnt some cutting gear- what exactly is it for?

  Police         There has been a major accident at Hillsborough football ground where the semi-final is;
                 the crowds have forced their way in, they have broken fences and gates down. I don’t know
                 exactly what it is but there are people trapped.
  Fire Control Right! OK- leave it with us.
   That conversation took 1 minute 13 seconds. It was published in a number of newspapers with strong
critical comment mostly against the fire service. The thrust of the criticism was that valuable time was wasted
by the fire service asking unnecessary questions as to where and why cutting equipment was required.

   19. There was a meeting of the emergency services in August 1988 to discuss procedure in the event of a
major disaster at Sheffield Wednesday’s ground. It was pointed out and minuted that "It was imperative that
the Police Control give the exact location of any fire or incident and as much detail as possible. No senior fire
officer is on duty at the match... Fire service will attend via Penistone Road or Leppings Lane as directed by
the police."
  20. The message from PC Bichard contained all the necessary information - Leppings Lane end, hydraulic
cutting equipment, to cut metal fences. Regrettably, it was not passed on by Headquarters in those terms. Miss
Davies had rightly been trained to require a precise location and needed to know the problem which would face
the fire service so that the appropriate response could be made. In fact, there are several football grounds in the
Hillsborough district although clearly Sheffield Wednesday’s ground is the principal one. In the result,
although Chief Inspector Edmundson clarified, to an extent, the nature of the problem, the locus which
emerged in the course of the conversation (Penistone Road) was not that contained in the original message
from ground control (ie"Leppings Lane end.") Whilst on the face of the conversation the fire service may seem
to have been slow in the uptake or perhaps pedantic, in my view the police ought to have been more specific.
They had the necessary information to be so.
  21. I am satisfied, however, that the delay of 1 minute 13 seconds over the call, and even the delay
occasioned by the cutting equipment going to Penistone Road rather than Leppings Lane, did not affect the
outcome. Even had those with cutting equipment gone directly after a briefer ’phone call they would not have
arrived at a stage early enough to make cutting the fencing a helpful exercise.
Mr Kenny Dalglish
  22. When the Liverpool manager went to the control room and agreed to make the announcement
broadcast at 3.56 pm, he says in a statement that he could not get the Tannoy to work. Spectators could see
him trying to address them and indicated to him manually that nothing could be heard. An officer pressed
buttons on the machine and Mr Dalglish says he tried again with similar lack of success. He was then taken
under the police box to the room used by the disc jockey to broadcast pre-match music. There, the microphone
worked and he broadcast his message.
   23. Mr Dalglish was not called. There was no other evidence about this incident. I accept it occurred as he
described. Why the Tannoy could not at that time be successfully operated from the police box is, however,
strange and unexplained. Unlike the radio, it had operated satisfactorily from the police box at the critical
times save that its messages may not always have been heard above the prevailing noise. It had worked at about
3.30 pm when it called for medical staff. I can see no grounds for criticising the police in regard to this incident
and certain it is that the brief delay in relaying Mr Dalglish’s message can have had no significant effect.

                      THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
                                 15 APRIL 1989

                                      FINAL REPORT OF INQUIRY

                                             INTRODUCTION

   1. On 17 April 1989 1 was appointed by your predecessor, the Rt Hon Douglas Hurd CBE, MP to carry out
an Inquiry with the following terms of reference:
  "To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
  recommendations about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events."
  2. Two Assessors were appointed to assist me: Mr Brian Johnson CBE, QPM, DL, Chief Constable of
Lancashire, and Professor Leonard Maunder OBE, BSc, PhD, ScD, FEng, FI Mech E, Professor of Mechanical
Engineering at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.
  3. The first stage of the Inquiry was primarily concerned with the investigation of events at Hillsborough
Stadium on 15 April 1989 when 95 people were crushed to death at a Cup semi-final match between Liverpool
and Nottingham Forest.
  4. Over 31 days between 15 May and 29 June, I heard oral evidence from 174 witnesses at a public hearing
in Sheffield. I also received much written evidence by way of submissions and letters.
  5. On 1 August 1989 1 presented an Interim Report setting out my findings as to how and why the disaster
occurred. Also, in accordance with your predecessor’s wishes, I made interim recommendations aimed at
preventing any further disaster and improving safety in the short term.
   6. The Interim Report and its recommendations had ofnecessity to be made quickly so that action could be
taken before the start of the new football season due to open in mid August. Despite all the speed I could
muster, the recommendations left very little time for pre-season action, especially in Scotland where the
fixture list started earlier than in England and Wales. I must pay tribute to the clubs, local authorities, police
and other services for responding so promptly and for implementing the recommendationsso wholeheartedly.
  7. In my Interim Report I indicated that it would be necessary to conduct wider and deeper investigations
before delivering a Final Report on the needs of crowd control and safety for the future. Accordingly, I invited
and have considered a large number of written submissions describing present practices and problems and
suggesting future changes. Those who have contributed are listed at Appendix 1. I am extremely grateful to all
of them for their time and their views. I expect there are a number of contributors and correspondents who
may look in vain for comment on each and every point they have raised. I hope they will understand that time
and space make it necessary to be selective and to have regard to the main issues.
  8. I have also had numerous informal meetings with those representing relevant public bodies, clubs and
spectator interests. These have been conducted as private discussion sessions rather than hearings of oral
evidence thereby enabling controversial issues to be explored and theories tested.
  9. In all of this I have continued to be assisted by the two Assessors. Each holds a professional appointment
carrying heavy responsibility and I am deeply grateful to both for devoting so much time to assisting me. Their
contributions have been of the highest value. While the sole responsibility for this report is mine, I am
comforted in the knowledge that both Assessors agree with it.
   10. At my request, Professor Maunder chaired a Technical Working Party to review the technical aspects of
the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds ( 1986 edition), "The Green Guide". Each member of his
team has much relevant experience and the team was well qualified for its task. I am most grateful for the
co-operation and efforts of each member. The Report of the Technical Working Party is at Appendix 3.
    11. In the course of the Inquiry, the two Assessors and I have between us visited 31 sports grounds. They are
 listed at Appendix 2. Of those, 24 were soccer grounds, but we also attended at grounds featuring Rugby
 Union, Rugby League, cricket, tennis and golf. I wish to record our thanks to the club officials who so readily
and hospitably facilitated our visits; also to the officers of local government, the police and the emergency
services who together with club officials conducted us round the grounds, explained their operations and
answered our questions fully and frankly. Seeing crowd control and behaviour before, during and after a match
from various sections of the viewing areas was an essential source of first hand knowledge. It brought alive the
written and oral reports we received.
   12. I should like to express my thanks to the Home Office team who have staffed this Inquiry so well. Mr
Robert Whalley was appointed as its Secretary. He has handled all the administrative arrangements
impeccably and has given much invaluable advice and assistance on every aspect of the Inquiry. He was ably
and diligently assisted by Mr Jonathan Sweet, Mrs Margaret Wither, Mr Tony Moore, Mrs Kate Humphries
from the Home Office and my own Clerk Mr Ernest Pott. I also renew my thanks to the West Midlands Police,
and, in particular, to Mr Geoffrey Dear QPM, DL, LLB, the Chief Constable, and Mr Mervyn Jones MSc,
Assistant Chief Constable in full-time charge of the investigation, who have continued to provide me with
helpful information at this second stage of the Inquiry.
   13. Having made my findings as to the events at Hillsborough, I do not in this report say any more about
them save by way of illustration. I am aware that inquests are still to be held, civil proceedings are in motion
and the possibility of criminal charges is under consideration. However, those are not matters for me. I
therefore turn now to broader issues as promised in paragraph 304 of my Interim Report.
   14. My terms of reference are extremely wide. They embrace crowd control and safety at sports events of all
kinds. However, crowd problems are directly related to the nature of the event and the numbers attending it.
Realistically, this means that attention needs to be concentrated on events within the scope of the Safety of
Sports Ground Act 1975 and the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987. Even more specifically, the
emphasis in this Report is especially upon football. The Hillsborough disaster and indeed other disasters
before it occurred in crowded football stadia. The numbers and the atmosphere at a football match have
created special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour not, so far, to be found to a like degree
elsewhere.
   15. That football is a special case has been expressly recognised by the Government in promoting the
Football Spectators Act 1989. The Bill received the Royal Assent on 16 November 1989. It had commenced its
course through Parliament before the Hillsborough disaster. Expressly because of that disaster and the setting
up of this Inquiry it reached the statute book under unusual conditions. It was always to be an enabling Act
whose implementation would require a Statutory Instrument. In order to have the provisions of the Act in
place as soon as possible, the Government decided to proceed with it forthwith, notwithstanding Hillsborough
and this Inquiry. That decision was subject to an undertaking to bring the matter back before Parliament on
two separate occasions. First, before the appointment of the Football Membership Authority under the Act;
secondly, to debate the scheme which the Act provides should be drawn up by that Authority.
  ! 6. I was expressly told by your predecessor upon my appointment that my terms of reference included
consideration of the national membership scheme provided for in the Bill. That was confirmed on numerous
occasions by Ministers in the course of the Bill’s passage through Parliament. It was made clear that although
the Act would be on the statute book before my Final Report, Parliament would have the opportunity to
consider any observations I might make, including any about the national membership scheme. Thus, to take
only two examples, Mr Nicholas Ridley, then Secretary of State for the Environment, said on the Second
Reading of the Bill on 27 June 1989:
  "I began by referring to Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry. I will emphasise again now what I said at the
  beginning. Parliament will have not one but two opportunities to debate and vote on the national
  membership scheme after we have received the report and in the light of any comments that Justice Taylor
  may make on the scheme. By proceeding with the Bill now, we can put the framework for the scheme in place
  and make it possible to move on rapidly with the scheme, if Parliament agrees that we should do so when it
  has seen what Lord Justice Taylo; has to say."
  (Official Report, column 850).
Secondly, at the Committee stage on 6 July 1989, Mr Colin Moynihan, the Minister for Sport, said:
  "I am certain that Lord Justice Taylor will feel in no way inhibited by consideration of the Bill in our
  suggested format, because we specifically amended the Bill to provide for the Secretary of State’s approval of
  the scheme after the final report ..... the Bill is amended to enable the House to consider in detail the
  recommendations before we establish the Football Membership Authority to draw up the scheme ..... To
  hypothesise on whether Lord Justice Taylor is in favour of a national membership scheme or whether he
  may not even comment on it, is totally irrelevant because the Bill provides for the House of Commons and
  House of Lords to consider the report before setting up a Football Membership Authority."
  (Official Report, column 56).
   17. It must be a rare if not unique situation for a judge, appointed to conduct an Inquiry, to have within his
remit consideration of the merits and provisions of an Act of Parliament already i,, place. It cannot be for a
judge to opine upon the wisdom or terms of an Act expressing the established will of Parliament. But, where
Parliament has passed an Act in such terms and upon such undertakings as expressly to provide that the
Inquiry judge be uninhibited in commenting upon it and that Parliament should have the opportunity to
consider his comments in further debate, then I conceive it to be his duty to express his views. My doing so
should not be interpreted as showing any lack of the respect and deference due to Parliament. Not to do so,
against the background I have described, would surely be thought surprising if not pusillanimous.
   18. In Part I of this Report I state some lessons to be learnt from Hillsborough, examine the state of football
today and propose a range of measures to give it a better future. In Part III consider, in detail, measures to
improve safety at sports grounds. Part III is concerned with crowd control at sports grounds and various
strategies for dealing with hooligans. In Part IV I consider the provisions of the 1989 Act regarding the national
membership scheme. Finally, at the end of the text, I set out my Recommendations. So as to avoid confusion, I
have not set out my Interim Recommendations for the purpose of comparison. Hardly any excisions have been
made. Where I have decided to repeat or amend the Interim Recommendations, they are included in the single
list of Final Recommendations. I hope this Report and the Final Recommendations may be instrumental in
promoting better and safer conditions at sports grounds in the future.




18 January 1990                                                                               PETER TAYLOR
                      PART I - FOOTBALL: PRESENT AND FUTURE

                                                CHAPTER 1

                        THREE SOMBRE LESSONS AFTER HILLSBOROUGH
i. Previous Reports Unheeded
    19. It is a depressing and chastening fact that mine is the ninth official report covering crowd safety and
control at football grounds. After eight previous reports and three editions of the Green Guide, it seems
astounding that 95 people could die from overcrowding before the very eyes of those controlling the event. In
January 1986, Mr Justice Popplewell, whose report following the Bradford Disaster was the eighth in the
series, summarised those of his seven predecessors. The Shortt Report of 1924 followed disorder at the Cup
Final of 1923. The Moelwyn Hughes Report of 1946 followed the disaster at Bolton Wanderers ground when
overcrowding caused 33 deaths. In 1966 the Government commissioned the Chester Report on "The State of
Association Football". The Harrington Report of 1968 drew attention to problems of crowd behaviour and led
to the Lang Report of 1969 on the same subject. In 1972, Lord Wheatley’s Report on Crowd Safety at Sports
Grounds followed the disaster at Ibrox Park where 66 spectators died. The McElhone Report of 1977 on
Football Crowd Behaviour of Scottish supporters was commissioned by the Secretary of State for Scotland. In
1984 an Official Working Group on Football Spectator Violence set up by the Department of Environment
presented a further report.
  20. As a result of the Wheatley Report, the first edition of the Green Guide was issued in 1973, and
Parliament passed the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. A second edition of the Green Guide was issued in
1976 and a third edition in 1986 incorporated recommendations made by Mr Justice Popplewell.
  21. Introducing his excellent and concise summary ofthe previous reports, Mr Justice Popplewell said:
  "almost all the matters into which I have been asked to inquire and almost all the solutions I have proposed,
  have been previously considered in detail by many distinguished Inquiries over a period of 60 years".
 Because his citations from those earlier reports are still highly relevant, I append his summary of them at
Appendix 4.

  22. In my Interim Report I set out what happened at Hillsborough and why. That it was allowed to happen,
despite all the accumulated wisdom of so many previous reports and guidelines must indicate that the lessons
of past disasters and the recommendations following them had not been taken sufficiently to heart. I
appreciate how easy it is to criticise with hindsight and that a new situation can always arise in human affairs
which has not previously been envisaged. But many of the deficiencies at Hillsborough hadbeen envisaged.
  23. The Moelwyn Hughes Report in 1924 had stressed the need to start controlling the crowd well back
from the entrance to the ground. The Green Guide required that "Turnstiles should be of such numbers as to
admit spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are kept waiting for admission" (paragraph 44).
Chapter 8 of the Guide required "Arrangements should be made ... to contain pressures before they reach
dangerous proportions". Chapter 16 laid down maximum capacity which was grossly exceeded in the fatal
pens at Hillsborough. Both the Green Guide (Chapter 15) and Mr Justice Popplewell had stated the need for
gates in the perimeter fencing to be adequate to permit escape on to the pitch in an emergency. Why were these
recommendations and others not followed? I suggest two main reasons. First, insufficient concern and
vigilance for the safety and well-being of spectators. This was compounded by a preoccupation with measures
to control hooliganism. Secondly, complacency which led all parties to think that since disaster had not
occurred on previous occasions it would not happen this time. But there is no point in holding inquiries or
publishing guidance unless the recommendations are followed diligently. That must be the first lesson.
ii. "It Couldn’t Happen Here"
    24. Amazingly, complacency was still to be found even after Hillsborough. It was chilling to hear the same
refrain from directors at several clubs I visited:-
      "Hillsborough was horrible - but, of course, it couldn’t have happened here."
  Couldn’t it? The Hillsborough ground was regarded by many as one of the best in the country. It was selected
by the FA for the Cup semi-final and thought by them to be entirely suitable. The identical fixture had passed
off uneventfully the previous year. I have little doubt that if the disaster scenario had been described to the
management at Hillsborough prior to 15 April, they too would have said "Of course, it couldn’t happen here".
Yet something like it had happened at Hillsborough in 1981, albeit with less dire results. Moreover, I am
satisfied from eyewitness accounts I have received that there have been many other occasions when
overcrowding has led, at various grounds round the country, to a genuine apprehension of impending disaster
through crushing, averted only by good fortune. I have heard from Police Commanders at a number of the
grounds I have visited how relieved they are that capacities have been reduced in the interests of safety.
  25. So, although the operational errors on 15 April were special to one ground and one day, the lack of
precautions against overcrowding was not unique. I do not believe that sufficient safety measures were being
applied at all other grounds. The lesson here is that Hillsborough should not be regarded as a freak occurrence,
incapable of happening elsewhere. All those responsible for certifying, using and supervising sports grounds
should take a hard look at their arrangements and keep doing so. Complacency is the enemy of safety.
iii. A Blight on Football
    26. Football is our national game. We gave it to the world. But its image in our country has been much
tarnished. In my Interim Report I concentrated on overcrowding because it was the cause of the Hillsborough
disaster. But wider and deeper inquiry shows that overcrowding is only one feature amongst a number causing
danger or marring football as a spectator sport. The picture revealed is of a general malaise or blight over the
game due to a number of factors. Principally these are: old grounds, poor facilities, hooliganism, excessive
drinking and poor leadership. Crowd safety and crowd behaviour with which I am concerned are closely
related to the quality of the accommodation and facilities offered and to the standards which are encouraged
and enforced. So I think it necessary to consider all these aspects.

Old Grounds
   27. Because we were first into the field, most of our football grounds are now elderly. Between 1889 and
 1910, 58 of the clubs belonging to the current League moved into the grounds they now occupy.* Many of
them are ill-placed on cramped sites boxed into residential areas. When they were built, they were not intended
to cater for the stream of coaches, vans and cars which now arrive and require parking space. Inside the
grounds decay and dilapidation are often extensive. The terrace accommodation, in particular, is often
uncovered and little has been done to improve the layout in accordance with modern expectations. This is
chiefly because the safety and comfort of those on the terraces has not been regarded as a priority. In fairness,
limitations of space at some grounds make it very difficult to achieve a layout appropriate to present day
needs. By contrast, clubs in Europe and South America have the advantage of grounds built more recently on
more spacious sites and planned to meet modern conditions. Where improvements have been made to
our grounds they have often been patchy and piecemeal. This approach is itself a threat to safety. To build a
seated stand over a standing area, to enlarge or divide a terrace, to rearrange exits and entrances or to modify
turnstile areas - any of these measures is fraught with safety implications. Yet often such changes have been
made to achieve one purpose without sufficient thought about the adverse side-effects which could result.
  28. This was exemplified by the sequence of alterations at the Leppings Lane end at Hillsborough. Radial
fences were installed to divide up the terraces; this led to a reduction in the system of crush barriers. The area
inside the turnstiles was altered for purposes of segregation. Old signs were not removed; new signs were
inadequate. The result was a bewildering complex which contributed to the delivery of excessive numbers
down the tunnel into pens 3 and 4.
Poor Facilities
   29. Football spectators are invited by the clubs for entertainment and enjoyment. Often, however, the
facilities provided for them have been lamentable. Apart from the discomfort of standing on a terrace exposed
to the elements, the ordinary provisions to be expected at a place of entertainment are sometimes not merely
basic but squalid. At some grounds the lavatories are primitive in design, poorly maintained and inadequate in
number. This not only denies the spectator an essential facility he is entitled to expect. It directly lowers
standards of conduct. The practice of urinating against walls or even on the terraces has become endemic and
is followed by men who would not behave that way elsewhere. The police, who would charge a man for
urinating in the street, either tolerate it in football grounds or do no more than give a verbal rebuke. Thus
crowd conduct becomes degraded and other misbehaviour seems less out of place.

  30. The refreshments available to supporters are often limited and of indifferent quality. They are sold in
*Inglis" Football Grounds of Great Britain p 10
surrounding streets from mobile carts and inside many grounds from other carts or from shoddy sheds. Fans
eat their hamburgers or chips standing outside in all weathers. There is a prevailing stench of stewed onions.
Adequate numbers of bins for rubbish are often not available; so wrappings, containers and detritus are simply
dropped. This inhospitable scene tends to breed bad manners and poor behaviour. The atmosphere does not
encourage pride in the ground or consideration for others. I accept that many fans are quite content to eat on
the hoof when visiting a match, but there is no reason why the fare available should not be wholesome, varied
and decently served from clean and attractive outlets. Fast food establishments meeting these requirements
are readily to be found at railway stations and on high streets; why not at football grounds?
   31. At most grounds little attempt has been made to provide pre-match entertainment. To do so could have
a double advantage. It would give the spectators more value for their money. It could also bring them in earlier
thereby avoiding congestion at the turnstiles in the last few minutes before kick-off. Such entertainment as has
been tried has mostly failed to appeal to the spectators. They do not seem drawn by the musical offerings of the
disc jockey or by marching bands. The football supporters’ organisations complain that supporters have not
hitherto been much consulted about this or about anything else affecting their well-being and enjoyment.
  32. In giving this dismal account of the football scene, I have taken care to use the words "often", "at most
grounds" or "at many grounds". I acknowledge that there are notable exceptions where great improvements
have been effected and I do not suggest that every disagreeable feature I have described is to be found at every
ground. Nevertheless, the overall picture of conditions and facilities to be expected by a standing spectator is
depressing. It is in stark contrast to the different world, only yards away, in the Board Room and the lucrative
executive boxes. I appreciate that they cater for an affluent clientele and bring in much-needed revenue. No
one would expect or indeed want their plush carpeting or haute cuisine when visiting the terraces; but
accommodation and facilities have often been below the basic decent standard necessary to give spectators
dignity let alone comfort.
  33. It is small wonder that attendances at matches gradually fell offfrom a peak of 77 million in the season
 1949/50 to about 20 million in the late 1980s. No doubt other reasons played their part; for example, the
emergence of other spectator sports and television. Until the 1960s most men worked on a Saturday morning
and many went straight to the match in the afternoon. But the 5 day week together with increased car
ownership made Saturday outings for the family a popular activity. On top of these factors, however, the
prospect of attending football in the conditions I have described clearly became unattractive to many erstwhile
supporters. Added to this was the fear of disorder. So far, I have not mentioned the further indignities endured
by supporters as a result of hooliganism and the measures taken to contain it.
Hooliganism
  34. During the 1970s, hooligan behaviour became a scourge at and around football grounds. Rival fans
abused and fought with each other on the terraces. The pitch was invaded, sometimes to facilitate the fighting,
sometimes in an attempt to abort a match by those whose team was losing and on occasions to display anger
and seek to assault a referee or a player who had incurred displeasure. Throwing missiles, either at a player or a
policeman or at rival fans, became another violent feature. When the police responded by searching fans for
missiles on entry, the practice grew of throwing coins (which could not be confiscated). Sometimes the coins
were sharpened in advance to make them more damaging.
  35. Mass singing of traditional songs, some of nation-wide appeal, some local to the area or the club, had
become a part of the terrace culture. But the repertoire became augmented and degraded by abusive and
obscene chants aimed at the referee or the opposing fans. A further nasty addition was racist chanting aimed at
any black player of either team.
   36. Hooliganism outside the ground also became rife. Supporters of rival teams abused and attacked each
other. Hooligan gangs caused damage to trains, to buses, and to property on their route. Some deliberately
went out of their way to rampage through local shops, stealing, wrecking and intimidating as they went - an
activity known as "steaming". After a match, rival supporters would attack each other on the way home in the
street, in public transport or in public houses.
Segregation
  37. To contain and control these manifold forms of anti-social and criminal behaviour there is now an
elaborate complex of measures. The policy of segregation was born in the 1970s. Gradually, it has called for
more and more extreme and expensive strategies by the clubs and the police. As each measure taken has been
circumvented by determined hooligans, further measures have had to be grafted on to the system. Witnessing
the full florid exercise taking place every Saturday afternoon nowadays makes one wonder how anyone could
have contemplated going to such lengths to facilitate the watching of football. But nobody did; it just grew.
   38. Clubs have sub-divided their grounds to keep rival fans apart by putting fencing and sterile areas
between them, by screening them from inciting each other, by separate entrances and exits and by perimeter
fences round the pitch. Many of the fences are very high and are crowned with elaborate spikes and barbed
wire, the top sections being inclined inwards to prevent their being scaled. At some grounds a telescopic tunnel
is extended on to the pitch to protect the teams from missiles as they come on orgo off.

   39. The police start and finish their segregation exercise well away from the ground. Typically, special trains
or coaches carrying the away supporters are monitored en route. The police meet them and escort the fans with
mounted officers, dog handlers and foot officers, ensuring they go only to their allotted section of the ground.
They are searched at the entrance for drink or weapons (as are the home fans). They are then confined in an
area caged by fencing for the duration of the match. When it ends, the away supporters are often held back for a
quarter to half an hour whilst the home supporters are dispersed. They are then escorted away in the same
manner as they arrived and put back on to their trains or buses. Although the main body of away supporters
can thus be policed as a group, those who arrive independently in cars or vans have freedom of manoeuvre.
Occasionally trouble makers get into the wrong area and a violent episode occurs. Again, the further away from
the ground the spectators spread, the less the police can do to prevent sporadic confrontations. By and large
however, the police measures have worked to prevent violent outbursts in and around the ground.
  40. But at what a price! In addition to the poor facilities I described earlier (which are often worse for away
than for home fans) the ordinary law-abiding football supporter travelling away is caught up in a police
operation reminiscent of a column of prisoners of war being marched and detained under guard. I watched the
escort of Arsenal fans after a match at Stamford Bridge. They were held in the ground for thirty-five minutes
while the Chelsea supporters left. They were then escorted by a substantial body of police to Fulham Broadway
underground station. There, to avoid overcrowding on the platform, they were admitted to the station only in
measured groups. Special trains were run to take them non-stop into the centre of the city to avoid clashes at
nearby stations.
   41. Clearly, the police with their great experience of controlling crowds at the ground considered this
strategy was necessary in the present climate. Their views were confirmed in that despite their efficient and
good humoured management of the match and its aftermath, scuffles took place when some fans got into the
wrong section of the ground. Moreover such police practice is not unique to our country. There are similar
hooligan problems for example in Holland. I witnessed a very similar operation carried out by the Dutch
police at Utrecht to control a train load of supporters from Eindhoven.

  42. Necessary though such operations may presently be, they do nothing to enhance the image offootball as
a spectator sport followed for entertainment and pleasure. I know of no other sport or entertainment in a
civilised country in which it is necessary to keep those attending from attacking each other.
  43. Apart from their impact on the spectator, operations to control football crowds have other serious
repercussions. The cost in money, manpower and disruption is enormous. Last year, the cost of policing
football in London was some £10 million of which only £1 million could be recovered from the clubs.
According to the Football Trust, who meet one third of the costs of police charges incurred by clubs at matches
for the Football League, Scottish Football League and GM Vauxhall Conference, the cost to clubs during
1988/89 was £4.79 million. Since this relates only to costs inside grounds which can be recovered by the police,
the total cost to the police service is substantially more. Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary for
England and Wales said, in his annual report for 1988, that:-

  "Football continues to be a focus for hooliganism ... demands on the police service continued at a high level.
  Typically, 5000 officers may be engaged on football duties on Saturdays during the football season."
  The Home Office estimate that the total cost of deploying these officers is perhaps £200,000 to £300,000
each football Saturday. At many League matches, policing requires some 300 officers in the ground with many
more outside and others performing related traffic duties. At high risk matches, Cup semi-finals and the like,
even greater numbers are deployed. At Hillsborough there were 800 officers in and around the ground.
Obviously officers deployed to football cannot be performing police duties elsewhere. Although many are
brought in on an overtime basis (at a consequently heavier cost) police commitments to the community
elsewhere must be affected by the concentration of such numbers in one place.

  44. When upwards of 40,000 converge on a ground in a residential area the effect on the local community is
very disagreeable. Large numbers of fans chant in the streets, often offensively. They invade gardens to urinate.
Empty cans and other garbage are dropped in gardens, yards and in the street. Shops may be pillaged. Traffic is
congested or diverted. Streets are filled with parked coaches and cars. Side-streets are cordoned offby police to
protect residents. Recently, a police cordon was thought necessary at a half mile radius round Highbury when
Liverpool visited Arsenal. Residents had to establish their identity. The operation was successful in preventing
disorder but the need to conduct such operations and the resultant disruption contributes to the poor image of
football in the community at large.

What does Segregation Achieve?
  45. Segregation, which is the main feature of present crowd control policy, aims only to contain and control
bad behaviour, not to eliminate it. Indeed, the very fact that rival fans are separated tends to increase and
polarise their hostility to each other. Segregation breeds an "us and them" attitude. The opposing supporters
can be seen as a physically distinct group upon whom animosity can be focussed. Again, the knowledge that the
"enemy" is physically restrained from violent riposte may encourage baiting and abuse which caution would
otherwise deter. There is force too in the view that if people are herded and confined as potential offenders,
that concept may in some cases become self-fulfilling. So, although segregation may have appeared the only
way to maintain the excitement of the adversarial atmosphere at football grounds whilst keeping the peace, it
merely controlled the symptoms of hooliganism. The disease remained and may even have been intensified by
the segregation. Other games have not resorted to it. For example, there is no segregation at rugby league
matches although the catchment sections of population, from which support is drawn both to football and
rugby league, seem similar.
Who are the Hooligans?
   46. In chapter 5 of his Final Report, Mr Justice Popplewell exploded three popular fallacies about
hooliganism. First that it is something new; secondly, that it is only found at soccer matches and thirdly, that it
is a specifically English disease. He went on to consider the nature of football hooliganism, the characteristics
of the hooligan, possible causes of hooligan behaviour and experience in other countries. I do not propose to
repeat his analysis. Nothing has thrown any doubt on it in the four years since he reported although much has
been written by journalists, academics and others. I agree with him that there is no simple explanation for all
the misbehaviour attached to football and there is no single remedy. It is important, however, to recognise the
clear distinction between quite different groups of hooligans.
  47. There are those who misbehave spontaneously in or around the ground in response to some perceived
grievance - a goal against their team, a doubtful decision of a referee or taunting from others. But there are
other groups who go out bent on causing trouble for its own sake. The latter were described by Mr Justice
Popplewell as "the new hooligans". Often they hold down good jobs during the week, dress stylishly and detach
themselves from those fans with club scarves who travel on official coaches or trains. They plan their violence
as a recreation in itself to which the football is secondary or a mere background. Unfortunately, these groups
can foment trouble and galvanise support from fans who would not otherwise misbehave. Thus the effect of
the "new hooligans" can grow out of proportion to their numbers.

   48. Mr Justice Popplewell summarised his conclusions as to the nature and motivation of hooligan groups
at paragraph 5.90 of his Final Report as follows:-
      "I (a) That there has always been a group, albeit a small group who find violence attractive; who
         currently find the football ground a convenient theatre for their violence and the football match the
         occasion for the display of their aggressive tendencies which on other days and at other times they will
         be exhibiting in public houses, the city centre or elsewhere. Their main target at football grounds is
         opposing fans. They choose to exercise that violence at a football match for a number of simple
         reasons. The date and place of a match are fixed; the nature of the opposition is known; its presence is
         certain, so is that of the police. Their own support is known. Its presence too is certain. The battle lines
         can be drawn. Thus plans can be made well in advance for the particular acts of violence that they
         intend to create.
         (b) And while there is a good deal of academic support for the view that violence was at one time the
         prerogative of the so called "rough" working class that is no longer the complete picture today. A
         majority of today’s hooligans no doubt do fit into that category, but some do not. They come from a
         variety of backgrounds, many have reasonable jobs and earn a proper living.

          (c) Whether they are motivated by the same reasons as their predecessors can only be a matter of
          conjecture; there seems little reason however to believe otherwise.

      II (a) A second group imitates the first element I have identified. Thus those not particularly given to
         violence witness violence in others and see it being exercised, without let or hindrance. People expect
        the spectators on the terraces to behave in an aggressive way and to use foul language. It then
        becomes accepted as the norm and thus becomes a part of the pattern of life which would not be
        tolerated elsewhere. This knock-on effect can be seen in violence in the streets of our cities,
        unconnected with football.

        (b) The feeling of anonymity in the crowd gives rise to a loss of inhibition and self-discipline. The
        association with those of similar disposition, the enthusiasm and the partisan support for the team,
        which itself causes an atmosphere, all create a situation which can readily give rise to violence.

    III Then there is a third group (not always separate from the other two groups) who cause violence for a
        reason, either real or supposed. It may be an inability quickly to get into the ground; it may be the
        presence of rival spectators in a part of the ground to which the fans think they have a claim.

    IV Finally there are those, the vast majority of spectators, who abhor violence and wish only for an
       afternoon of pleasure at a football match."

  The oral and written evidence I have received, the studies and reports I have read on the subject and my
own observations lead me to agree entirely with that summary. I would add only one further element -
alcohol.

Alcohol
  49. There can be no doubt that an excited and volatile crowd is more difficult to control and more prone to
disorder if it includes numbers who have been drinking. Drink is not a major factor affecting Mr Justice
Popplewell’s group I. Their violence tends to be planned coldly and soberly. But group II is often rendered
disorderly and more readily imitates the violence of others because inhibitions are removed by drink.
Likewise, group III responds to a grievance, is readier to take offence and reacts more impulsively and
violently because of drink.

  50. Drinking before matches increased in parallel with the growth of hooliganism. Before the 5 day week,
those coming straight from work to the football ground on a Saturday had little time to drink excessively.
During the 1960s and 1970s young men in their twenties acquired a new affluence and spending on drink
increased. The advent of the supermarket with an off-licence provided numerous outlets for the sale of
canned beer; so it became easy to have alcohol at the match and on the way to it, whether the local pubs were
open or not. Finally, apart from time and liquor being available, there has developed an attitude to drinking
in the UK not found to the same extent elsewhere - a cult of drinking to excess. The spectacle of young fans,
tanked up with beer, whether near our own football grounds or (more damagingly to our reputation abroad)
at foreign football stadia is all too familiar. Yet, for example in Italy, the largest wine producing country in
Europe, football fans and indeed people generally do not drink to get drunk. Although they have their own
brand of hooliganism (from the "Ultras" as they are known) alcohol is not a major factor. Here it certainly is
and it remains so despite legislation banning sales or possession of alcohol in football grounds and the
carrying of alcohol on public service and hired vehicles bound for such grounds.

Poor Leadership
  51. The hierarchy inside football has a number of levels over and above the spectators. At the top is the
national management of the game. In England the Football Association is responsible for the administration
and welfare of all football down to the lowliest amateur club and football in schools. The Football League is a
separate body with responsibility for the 92 professional League clubs. In Scotland and Wales there are
equivalent bodies. Below that top management, each of the League clubs has its own Board of Directors.
Then there are the referees, the managers and the players. Finally there are organisations representing the
supporters - the Football Supporters’ Association and the National Federation of Football Supporters’ Clubs.
One would have hoped that the upper echelons in this hierarchy would have taken a lead in securing
reasonable safety and comfort for the spectators and in enforcing good behaviour by precept and example.
Unfortunately, these hopes have not generally been realised and indeed at times poor examples have been set.

  52. The FA and the FL have not seen it as their duty to offer guidance to clubs on safety matters. In their
written submission they said:-

  "Of course, both The FA and The Football League are concerned to ensure that crowd safety standards are
  the highest reasonably practicable. It is felt, however, that neither of these authorities should be charged
  with the responsibility of setting detailed safety standards or enforcing them."
They have been much concerned to avoid pitch invasions because they interfere with the smooth progress
of the fixture list and incur criticism and penalties from the European football authorities. But advice, for
example, as to turnstile lay outs, the division of viewing areas and, until recently, on ratios of seating to
standing areas has not been forthcoming. As another specific example, in selecting Hillsborough as the venue
for the Cup semi-final, the FA did not consider in any depth whether it was suitable for a high risk match with
an attendance of 54,000 requiring to be segregated, all of whom were, in effect, away supporters lacking week
in week out knowledge of the ground. No special inspection was made; no consultation with Sheffield
Wednesday or the local authority took place.
   53. As for the clubs, in some instances it is legitimate to wonder whether the directors are genuinely
interested in the welfare of their grass-roots supporters. Boardroom struggles for power, wheeler-dealing in
the buying and selling of shares and indeed of whole clubs sometimes suggest that those involved are more
interested in the personal financial benefits or social status of being a director than of directing the club in the
interests of its supporter customers. In most commercial enterprises, including the entertainment industry,
knowledge of the customer’s needs, his tastes and his dislikes is essential information in deciding policy and
planning. But, until recently, very few clubs consulted to any significant extent with the supporters or their
organisations.

  54. Encouragement and indeed requirement of good behaviour by the fans should be a prime aim of club
management. Here again positive leadership has often been lacking and on occasions counter-productive. It
cannot help to promote good behaviour ifa club chairman has his photograph in the programme presenting a
cheque for £750 by way of recoupment to a club player fined that sum by the FA for misbehaviour on the
pitch. The same applies to another chairman who extended a VIP welcome to home coming "supporters"
convicted of misbehaviour whilst attending a match in Greece, even if he was sceptical as to the fairness of
the criminal process.

   55. Then there is what happens on the pitch itself. Long departed are Corinthian Casual standards;
accepting decisions of the referee without demur; affecting a modest diffidence on scoring a sensational goal.
For many years now referees’ decisions have been regularly challenged by spread arms and entreaties; even an
unsensational goal has caused the scorer to be hugged and embraced all the way back to the centre spot. The
cool self-control of Corinthian Casuals will never return. Perhaps we should not lament its departure since
there is no harm in a reasonable show of joy in success. But, more recently, things have gone further. On
scoring a goal a player nowadays often rushes straight towards the perimeter fencing and either affects to
climb it or, with fists raised and shaking, goes on his knees to excite response from supporters. Little has been
done to stop such demonstrations which are calculated to hype up the fans into hysteria.

   56. At the other extreme from demonstrations of joy and triumph, violence on the field of play by tackles
aimed at opponents’ legs, stamping, elbowing and holding is commonly to be seen. Until lately, the FA’s
response to such violence amongst players has been weak. Negligible fines on offenders, without penalty to
the clubs either in fines or loss of points, have tended to discredit the FA’s discharge of its disciplinary role. In
the last couple of months, prompted by a series of much publicised incidents and by media criticism, a firmer
line has at last been adopted. These incidents have involved violent conduct by players offthe ball. At the end
of the match between Norwich City and Arsenal on 4 November 1989, a number of players on both sides
were involved in an incident when punches were exchanged. The referee said he was not going to make any
report on the matter. The FA initially announced that if there was no report from the referee there was
nothing they could do. However, wiser counsels prevailed; officials of the FA saw the incident on video and
decided to take action. In the result Norwich City were fined £50,000 and Arsenal £20,000. Other incidents
occurred within days at three other grounds involving violence on the field between players and, in one
instance, managers.

   57. To complete this survey of the present football malaise, it is necessary to mention the media. Football
is highly newsworthy. For the World Cup, provision is being made at the San Siro stadium, Milan for no fewer
than 5,000 journalists. In the domestic UK scene, the long haul throughout the season to become League
champions or Cup winners is followed not only by the millions who actually attend matches but by many
millions more via the media. They watch games and listen to the pundits endlessly discussing them on
television; they read about them in the newspapers and they fill in the football pool coupons. So players and
spectators are exposed to constant scrutiny. When scuffles or fights occur, whether on the field or on the
terraces, they are inevitably witnessed by millions and such incidents of bad behaviour are aggregated into a
reputation tarnishing the national game as a whole. When our supporters go to Europe, they are preceded by
this reputation. It is expected they will behave badly, so whether they do so initially or not they are likely to
meet a hostile reception from their counterparts. Thus incidents are provoked and the syndrome continues.

                                                        10
   58. I have sought in the broadest terms to identify those features which disfigure football today. But
despite them, and despite the decline in attendances from the peak years, the game still commands massive
public support and interest. Indeed, in the last couple of years there has been some increase in attendances
for reasons to be explored later. After the horror of Hillsborough and the analysis of football’s troubles which
it has prompted, the lesson is surely that now is the moment for the fullest reassessment of policy for the
game. Accordingly, before considering detailed recommendations for securing a basic level of safety and for
improving crowd control, I think it appropriate to consider how the low standards described in this chapter
could be raised.




                                                      11
                                                  CHAPTER 2
                                   A BETTER FUTURE FOR FOOTBALL
  59. It is not enough to aim only at the minimum measures necessary for safety. That has been, at best, the
approach in the past and too often not even that standard has been achieved. What is required is the vision
and imagination to achieve a new ethos for football. Grounds should be upgraded. Attitudes should be more
welcoming. The aim should be to provide more modern and comfortable accommodation, better and more
varied facilities, more consultation with the supporters and more positive leadership. If such a policy is
implemented it will not only improve safety. There will also be an improvement in behaviour, making crowd
control easier.

   60. At some clubs changes have already been made towards realising this new concept of how football
should be. For example, at Ibrox Park, scene of the appalling disaster in 1971, there has been a total
transformation. The old main stand remains and still has some standing areas in front of it. But three new
stands have been built round the rest of the ground. They are colourful, convenient and are all-seating. They
are constructed so as to provide a covered concourse at first floor level running the length of the stand. At the
rear of that concourse throughout its length are modern lavatories for both sexes. At the front are attractive
fast food service points offering a good range of food and drinks (but no alcohol). The walls are clean; the
flooring is of studded rubber. Mounted overhead, at regular intervals of a few yards along the whole
concourse, are television sets tuned to a sports programme giving information on the day’s fixtures, excerpts
from previous matches and general sports coverage. These arrangements encourage fans to arrive in good
time, to have wholesome refreshments in a clean and pleasant setting, to enjoy on the television the kind of
pre-match entertainment which genuinely interests them, to visit a decent toilet, and then to walk up a few
steps to take their seats for the match. All of this is under cover and it is enjoyed not just by the affluent but by
the ordinary supporter. Significantly, the facilities are not abused. Occasional graffiti do appear but are
wiped away promptly and the overall impression is that if spectators are offered civilised conditions they
come to respect them.

All-Seating
  61. There is no panacea which will achieve total safety and cure all problems of behaviour and crowd
control. But I am satisfied that seating does more to achieve those objectives than any other single measure.

  62. It is obvious that sitting for the duration of the match is more comfortable than standing. It is also
safer. When a spectator is seated he has his own small piece of territory in which he can feel reasonably
secure. He will not be in close physical contact with those around him. He will not be jostled or moved about
by swaying or surging. Small or infirm or elderly men and women as well as young children are not buffeted,
smothered or unsighted by larger and more robust people as on the terraces. The seated spectator is not
subject to pressure of numbers behind or around him during the match. He will not be painfully bent double
over a crush barrier. Those monitoring numbers will know exactly how many are there without having to
count them in or assess the density by visual impression. There will still, of course, be scope for crowd
pressure on stairways whilst entering and especially when leaving, but involuntary and uncontrolled crowd
movements occasioned by incidents in the game are effectively eliminated.

  63. It is true that at moments of excitement seated spectators do, and may be expected to, rise from their
seats. But the moment passes and they sit down again. I also recognise that seating is only regarded as more
comfortable than standing if cover is provided. The consensus is that, although standing on an exposed
terrace on a wet day is disagreeable, sitting in the rain is worse. So, increased seating does require that cover
be provided.

  64. Apart from comfort and safety, seating has distinct advantages in achieving crowd control. It is
possible to have disturbances in a seated area and they have occurred, but with the assistance of CCTV the
police can immediately zoom in with a camera and pinpoint the seats occupied by the trouble-makers as well
as the trouble-makers themselves. Moreover, if numbered tickets are issued to named purchasers, the police
have a further aid to identifying miscreants.

  65. Numbered tickets matching numbered seats also help to identify forgeries. Forged tickets for standing
areas may not be discovered. In the past, they simply led to inflated numbers on the terraces at all-ticket
matches. But there can only be one valid ticket for each numbered seat and the existence of a forgery is
immediately exposed.

                                                        12
  66. The evidence I have received has been overwhelmingly in favour of more seating accommodation. At
present, the ratio throughout the 92 League clubs in England and Wales is about two thirds standing to one
third seated. But whilst most are in favour of reversing that ratio, there are those who wish to retain a
proportion of standing room. Amongst them are the FA and the football supporters’ organisations.
Essentially they deploy three arguments.

  67. The first is an emotional one based on a desire to retain the traditional culture derived from the close
contact of the terraces. "My grandfather stood here; my father stood here with me; why shouldn’t I stand here
with my son?" is a commonly expressed view. Moreover, to many young men the camaraderie of singing
together, jumping up and down, responding in unison to the naming of the players, their emergence on to the
pitch, the scoring of a goal, an unpopular decision - all of these are an integral part of enjoying the match.
They like being part of an amorphous seething crowd and do not wish to have each his own place in a seat.
   68. The second argument is that conversion to all-seating will reduce the numbers of fans who can be
admitted to the ground; so, many would-be spectators will be disappointed. This assumes a significantly
greater density being permitted for standing places than for seating. It also assumes that the size of present
crowds regularly exceeds projected all-seated capacity. But the FA’s own evidence showed that during the
1988/89 season the number of occasions when attendances at League clubs exceeded projected all-seater
capacity ranged from nil to 16. The 16 attendances were at Liverpool, who have accepted the need for
all-seating. For only three clubs in the first and second divisions did the attendance exceed the projected
all-seated capacity on more than 10 occasions, and for 21 out of 44 clubs in these two divisions the
attendance never exceeded the projected all-seated capacity. In only one case (Liverpool) was the average
attendance during the season in excess of the projected all-seated capacity.
  69. Finally, cost. Spectators do not want to pay and, it is argued, many could not pay the substantially
higher price of a seat as against the cost of standing.

  70. I am not convinced that the cherished culture of the terraces-is wholly lost when fans are seated.
Watching the more boisterous and demonstrative sections at all-seater grounds, I have noted no absence of
concerted singing, chanting, clapping or gesticulating in unison. The communal spirit is still there and finds
ready expression. To such extent as the seating limits togetherness or prevents movement, that price is surely
worth paying for the benefits in safety and control.
   71. Moreover, the maximum density which experience now shows to be acceptable in standing areas tends
to take the force out of the first two arguments. If standing density is little more than seating density, the
melded mass previously found on terraces becomes more diffuse and the intensity of the togetherness
becomes little greater standing than sitting. Likewise, at such a density, the difference between the admissible
numbers standing and sitting become marginal. It can be made up by having two or more tiers of seating
where previously there was only one tier of standing.
  72. As to cost, clubs may well wish to charge somewhat more for seats than for standing but it should be
possible to plan a price structure which suits the cheapest seats to the pockets of those presently paying to
stand. At Ibrox, for example, seating is £6, standing £4 - not a prohibitive price or differential.

The Trend in the UK
  73. The superior safety of seating has already persuaded a number of clubs in the UK to convert their
terraces to seating either totally or predominantly. Following Hillsborough, Liverpool have announced their
intention to adapt their famous Kop to seating. In Scotland, Aberdeen’s ground at Pittodrie became all-seater
in 1978; Clydebank followed suit; St Johnstone’s new ground at Perth is all-seated. Wembley stadium will
early in 1990 accommodate 80,000 spectators, all-seated.
  74. Those opposed to all-seating point out that previous attempts to introduce it have met with spectator
resistance. Coventry City was the first English club to install seating throughout its ground in 1981. In 1983
the club reverted to allowing 2,000 to stand. In 1985, after visiting fans of Manchester City tore up seats and
used them as missiles, the ground reverted to standing. Queen’s Park Rangers also moved towards all-seated
accommodation but removed some seats under pressure from supporters.
  75. Since then, however, Hillsborough has happened; thinking has changed; responsible comment by
government, football authorities and media has prepared the way for change. Moreover, there are now seats
available which cannot be manually torn and used as missiles. Those at Utrecht, for example, have
survived intact for seven years despite usage and deliberate experimental tests of their strength.

                                                      13
   76. It is possible that in the early stages of conversion there may be instances of fans standing on the seats
or in front of them because they are used to standing or in order to register a protest, but I am satisfied that in
England and Wales as in Scotland and abroad spectators will become accustomed and educated to sitting.
The evidence I have received shows that more recently, where seating has been installed, the fans have come
to accept and like it. At Ibrox Park, for example, the seated areas are the most popular and tickets for them
sell in preference to those for standing. Significantly, trouble from misbehaviour and physical injuries have
been reduced since most of the crowd became seated. Such trouble and accidental injuries as still occur are
primarily in the remaining standing areas. It is planned to convert them to seating in the near future.

Sir Norman Chester Centre Research
   77. The Sir Norman Chester Centre for Football Research, attached to the University of Leicester, is
funded by the Football Trust. In November 1989 the Centre undertook a survey of registered members of the
Football Supporters’ Association to discover the views of committed football fans on a number of the issues
after Hillsborough which are covered in my Report. The extension of seating was one such issue. Numerous
questions were asked on a number of different hypotheses. The Report states that substantial majorities in
the sample were in favour of maintaining the status quo on the seats/terraces balance at their own clubs.
However, the Report continues:
  "53.6% claimed they would actually support the drive for more seating (sic) if they were reasonably priced
  and covered. The addition of these last two points - concessions on price and cover - also seemed to have
  dramatic effects in reducing levels of opposition to the prospects of all-seated facilities as we shall see
  later".
When all-seating was put to the sample there was a majority against it, but the Report goes on:
  "Finally, and perhaps significantly, opposition in our sample to the introduction of all-seated facilities
  diminishes considerably when one introduces provisos on price and protection from the elements. When
  this is done, more people in our sample support all-seaters than oppose them?’
Europe
  78. The trend towards seating is even stronger in Europe and is now being driven by decrees of both
national and European football authorities.
   79. In Italy the imminence of the 1990 World Cup competition has forced the pace of progress. The Italian
Ministry of the Interior decreed on 25 August 1989 that for open air facilities with a capacity of more than
 10,000 spectators at football games and for covered ones with a capacity of more than 4,000 spectators no
standing will be allowed after 30 April 1990. Those facilities must have only numbered seats each not less
than 0.45 metres wide. The San Siro stadium in Milan will by then seat 85,000 spectators; the Olimpico
stadium in Rome will seat 87,000.
  80. In Holland, Utrecht’s ground built in 1982 has seating for 12,000 and standing room for 8,000. The
club already intended to convert the latter to seating. However, on 6 December 1989 the Dutch equivalent of
the FA (the KNVB) agreed with the Dutch clubs to cut the standing capacity of football grounds by 10% each
year over the next decade so as to render football stadia in the Netherlands in effect all-seater at the end of the
1990s.
  81. In following this phasing Holland’s policy is in accord with a resolution presently under consideration
by UEFA (Union des Associations Europ6ennes de Football). The resolution proposes that for the 1990/91
season only 80% of the standing tickets may be sold, that figure to be reduced every season by 10% until 1999.
   82. FIFA (F6d6ration Internationale de Football Association) passed a resolution on 26 July 1989
providing that as from the preliminary competition for the 1994 World Cup (starting in autumn 1992)
"matches may in principle only be played in all-seater stadia". The resolution went on "as from 1993 it will
be the duty of the Confederations and National Associations to hold high-risk matches in their zones only in
all-seater stadia." High-risk matches are defined under UEFA Regulations as follows:
     "I All UEFA final and semi-final ties of the UEFA club competitions as well as final tournament
        matches of the European Football Championship.
     II When ~aeclared as such by UEFA on the basis of previous incidents of supporters of one or both
        teams or of other exceptional considerations.

                                                       14
    III When it is expected that visiting team supporters will exceed 10% of stadium capacity or will exceed
        3,000 persons.

    IV When full capacity stadium is expected or more than 50,000 spectators present.

    V When the match is likely to attract a large number of emigrants/foreign workers originating from the
      country of the visiting team, who live either in the country where the match is being played or in
      neighbouring countries."

   Thus world and European football authorities are clearly determined to enforce the conversion of stadia to
all-seating, so far as international matches and other matches under their control are concerned. It is true that
their resolutions will not be binding in regard to League or domestic football matches. But they are a pointer
in the direction of safety and control and as such have been emulated by Italy and Holland domestically.

  83. Furthermore, I am told by the FA that they regard themselves as duty bound to follow, in the domestic
football scene, any Resolution passed by FIFA although strictly such Resolution is binding only in
international matches or matches between UK clubs and clubs from abroad. Thus, the FA regard the
Resolution of 26 July 1989 as effective in relation to the League, Cup and other domestic fixtures from 1993
onwards. The Resolution does not force clubs to install all-seating as a condition of staging high-risk matches.
There is still the option to use only those parts of the ground which have seating. Clearly, unless these are
substantial, attendance will be much reduced. One would therefore expect the major clubs to adapt their
grounds to accommodate the maximum seating they can manage by the time the Resolution takes effect.
Smaller and more impecunious clubs may prefer to postpone conversion. However, ifa small club with little
seating accommodation draws a large first division club at home in the Cup in 1993 (a high-risk match) it will
be able only to use its limited seating accommodation or the game will have to be played at a better equipped
ground elsewhere.

The Football Spectators Act 1989
   84. The intention to follow this same trend was stated by your predecessor, Mr Douglas Hurd, in a
statement to the House of Commons two days after Hillsborough. He added:-

  "This would involve the disappearance of terraces at (major) grounds. It might also involve amendments
  to strengthen the Football Spectators Bill so that its provisions for the licensing of grounds matched this
  concept".

  In the event, machinery for implementing increased seating is to be found in section 11 of the 1989 Act.
There, provision is made for the Football Licensing Authority (set up under section 8) to be directed by the
Secretary of State to include in any licence to admit spectators a condition imposing requirements as respects
the seating of spectators at designated football matches at the premises; "and it shall be the duty of the
authority to comply with the direction".

Association Football only or Designated Grounds?
   85. In considering seating and standing, I have concentrated so far on association football because it
attracts the largest and most volatile crowds and has been troubled with misbehaviour. But should
recommendations about seating be confined to association football or should they go further? Wherever a
line is drawn complaint may be made that it is illogical, but two possibilities seem more logical than most;
either to confine recommendations to the 92 clubs in the Football League or to apply them to grounds
designated under the 1975 Act as amended. The latter course would include a number of Rugby League,
Rugby Union and cricket grounds. I acknowledge that so far, happily, misbehaviour at those grounds has
been minimal. However, even leaving aside possible misbehaviour, where there are large numbers there is a
risk of overcrowding. A well attended Rugby match of either code may attract numbers in excess of those
attending many Football League matches. There would seem little reason for requiring a fourth division
League club to convert to seating whilst permitting major Rugby clubs to keep their terraces indefinitely.

   86. On the other hand, proposals for all-seating would clearly be inappropriate in relation to sports events
at which spectators are accustomed, and should be entitled, to move about. For example, at horserace
meetings, spectators may wish to view horses in the paddock, place bets, view races from different vantage
points and enjoy the other facilities of what is a social occasion as well as a sports event. Other examples of
events at which spectators move about and should be free to do so are greyhound racing and golf
tournaments.

                                                       15
  87. The criteria for designating a sports ground under the 1975 Act as amended are laid down in section
1(1);

  "The Secretary of State may by order designate as a sports ground requiring a certificate under this Act (in
  this Act referred to as a "safety certificate") any sports ground which in his opinion has accommodation for
  more than 10,000 spectators."

  Section 1 (1)(A) permits the Secretary of State to substitute such other number as he considers appropriate
for the number 10,000.
   88. Clearly the purpose of such designation is to bring safety of grounds with capacity for substantial
numbers under the control of the local authority. Whilst some grounds with a capacity of more than 10,000
may currently have an average attendance of only say 3,000, there is always the prospect of a visit from a large
club, an attractive Cup draw, or an upturn in fortunes bringing in larger crowds. Safety provisions must be
capable of coping with such events. Indeed, danger is more likely to result if there is an occasional match with
a large attendance than if such matches were regular since those controlling it and those attending it will be
inexperienced.
   89. For these reasons, I think recommendations to increase seating should be applied to all designated
grounds. I appreciate that the machinery provided in section 11 of the Football Spectators Act 1989 can be
used only to regulate the extension of seating at association football grounds. However, the Secretary of State
has power under section 6(2) of the 1975 Act, as amended, to provide for securing safety by regulations and
may prescribe terms and conditions to be inserted in Safety Certificates under section 15A as indicated in the
next chapter. These powers could be used, even without the provision in section 11 of the 1989 Act, to
prescribe mandatory rules about seating. So, by a combination of his 1989 Act powers and his 1975 Act
powers or solely by exercising the latter, the Secretary of State can require the progressive extension of seating
at designated grounds.
  90. I therefore conclude and recommend that designated grounds under the 1975 Act should be required in
due Course to be converted to all-seating. I do so for the compelling reasons of safety and control already set
out, also, so far as association football is concerned, because the present trend at home and abroad and the
rules of the world and European football authorities make the move to all-seating irresistible.

Phasing
  91. Unless some time factors are specified, progress towards all-seating may well be protracted. This is
recognised in the phasing proposed in the UEFA Resolution quoted above and in the machinery set up in
section 11 of the Football Spectators Act 1989.
  92. For high-risk association football matches I welcome and endorse the adoption by the FA of the FIFA
Resolution requiring no standing tickets to be sold after 1993 and its application to domestic fixtures.
   93. As to other matches, I consider that without the impetus locally of the World Cup, which is the spur
for speedy change in Italy, and having regard to the present state of our grounds, it would be asking too much
to require conversion in the UK in the next two or three years. For all grounds designated under the 1975 Act
except for first division and second division League grounds, and national stadia, I think a timing along the
lines suggested in the Resolution under consideration by UEFA (and now adopted in Holland) is reasonable ie
that standing tickets should be reduced by 10% per year starting with a 10% deduction effective from August
1990 and so be phased out by August 1999.
  94. However, I recommend that grounds in the first and second divisions of the League and national stadia
should be all-seated by the start of the 1994/1995 season. It is at those grounds that the larger crowds attend
and, in the interests of both safety and crowd control, I consider they should have seating for all spectators in
five years rather than ten years. The reduction in standing tickets should therefore be at 20% per annum from
August 1990 and be complete by August 1994. Any club promoted to the second division of the League should be
given a reasonable period in which to comply. A similar approach should be adopted in Scotland.
Planning Ground Improvements
   95. Increased seating and other ground improvements will require expert planning and much finance. As
to planning, it is crucial that before clubs embark upon major work, they should have the best information
and advice on modern ground design. Conversion to seating cannot necessarily be achieved merely by fixing
seating onto existing terraces. For example, sight-lines, access to seats, gangways, roof cover and other factors


                                                       16
may require more extensive changes to the layout. Some clubs may be able wholly to redevelop their existing
grounds; others may be limited by space, finance or crowd needs to more modest alterations. In some
instances, the best course would be to move to a new site either alone or in conjunction with another club.
Ultimate decisions on these options must be for the club management. No doubt, some of the bigger clubs
will be able to engage the foremost contractors in this field to advise them and carry out the work. But even
for them, and certainly for the lesser clubs, it would be of great value to have a body fully apprised of the latest
developments in ground design, capable of giving expert advice on possible schemes and on ways and means
of achieving them.
An Advisory Design Council
  96. I therefore support the suggestion of Professor Maunder’s Technical Working Party that there should be
established an Advisory Design Council to fulfil this role. It should, in my view, be set up by the FA and the FL
whose functions should include offering a service of this kind to the clubs. By way of analogy, in Italy this
function is exercised by the Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano (CONI). After studying many grounds,
including those in Madrid, Vienna and Athens, CONI produced an excellent pamphlet on "Design Criteria
for Safe Comfortable and Large Sports Facilities" supported by detailed studies showing how they can be
achieved. These, together with models which may be inspected at CONI’s headquarters in Rome, show how a
modern stadium can be designed from car park to pitch so as to secure safety and crowd control.

Research
  97. It has come to my attention only recently that the Sports Council published in 1981 a "Handbook of
Sport and Recreational Building Design", and in 1989, a work entitled "Arenas, a Planning, Design and
Management Guide". The 1981 work included, in volume three, studies on outdoor sports stadia. The 1989
work concentrated on indoor stadia. It seems that neither of these works was sent to the FA or the FL, nor
have they acquired them. Again, in July 1986, the Institution of Structural Engineers formed an ad hoc
committee "to bring together all current technical knowledge relevant to the appraisal of sports grounds and
their individual elements. The committee’s task was to establish a fully referenced body of knowledge within
three years which would be complementary to the ’Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds’." The ad hoc
committee has prepared a fifth draft of its report which will be finalised after the recommendations in my
Report have been considered.

  98. It is highly desirable that such worthwhile research as I have mentioned should all be brought together
to achieve maximum benefit. With a formidable building and conversion programme for football grounds
ahead, an Advisory Design Council set up by the FA and FL could make the best use of all available research
here and abroad to assist and advise clubs.

Finance
   99. The scale of the changes I recommend will necessarily require heavy expenditure, albeit over an
extended period. It is not my function to make detailed proposals for financing the work. That is for football
management and essentially for the clubs. However, lest it be thought that I have made proposals regardless
of feasible funding, I ought to indicate sources and methods of finance which should make the improvements
practicable, and some of the fiscal arguments which have been addressed to me.

The Football Trust (FT) and the Football Grounds Improvement Trust (FGIT)
   100. Assistance in financing safety measures is presently available from the FT and the FGIT. The former
is funded by the three major pools companies (Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters) from the "Spot the Ball"
Competition, at the rate of 21% of turnover, yielding over £9 million a year. The total given to British football
since 1958 now approaches £120 million. The Trustees are empowered to use their funds to promote
measures for the control or suppression of unruly behaviour in relation to football; to assist clubs to meet the
obligations of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975; to improve grounds and facilities for those who play
and watch the game and for any other purpose they consider to be a benefit to the game of football in Great
Britain and Northern Ireland. The FT allocates just over half its income (ie over £4.5 million) to assisting
expenditure by League clubs on ground safety and improvements. This is done through the FGIT, a second
independent trust. The FGIT was established in 1975, the arrangements being modified later in 1979 when
the FT was brought into being.
   101. Although it helps to fund many other works, from those at international grounds down to those at the
lowliest clubs, the Trust continues to give first priority to assisting expenditure essential to the grant of a
Safety Certificate for a designated ground. Under its trust deed, the FGIT is able to make grants of up to 75%
of the total cost available to clubs carrying out work as a necessary condition of their being given a Safety

                                                        17
Certificate under the 1975 Act. Accordingly, should my recommendation of mandatory increases in seating
be made a condition of the Safety Certificate, the work would be eligible for a grant from the FGIT.

   102. However, even at £4.5 million a year, the FGIT fund would be insufficient. Additional financial
requirements fell upon the League clubs on the implementation of the 1975 Act and still more after the fire at
Bradford City’s ground in May 1985. By February 1988 over £37 million had been paid out in grants.
Pressures on finance led to the suspension of improvement grants in June 1987. The FGIT was able to
reintroduce improvement grant aid on a limited basis during the closed season of 1988. However, the range
of works required to upgrade the League grounds inevitably means that resources of the FGIT would be
spread quite thinly. They will not be sufficient to finance the kind of improvements I have suggested, but the
Trust provides a structure for doing so. By way of example, Sheffield Wednesday received a grant of£595,000
for the improvement of the Kop end at Hillsborough. This was in addition to some £431,000 given to the club
for a total of 21 safety projects between September 1978 and October 1988. Even so, funds of this order will
be insufficient to build new all-seated stands. How then, can additional revenue be generated?

Fiscal Considerations
   103. Three arguments have been addressed to me by the football authorities suggesting alterations in tax
structure to make funds available for ground improvements. Fiscal policy is for government and ultimately
Parliament to decide, not for a judge. All I can usefully do is to set out the arguments.

   (a) VATon the Spot the Ball Competition
   104. The Football Trust have suggested that if VAT were abolished on receipts from this competition,
some £5 to £6 million would be available. This would amount to a direct subsidy from the Treasury. It would
be contrary as I understand it not only to present government thinking but to long established principles of
fiscal policy. If that is so, a different and perhaps more propitious approach would be for the FA to urge the
Pool Promoters Association (PPA) to increase their contribution as part of a strategy to ensure the healthy
development of the game from which the PPA makes its money.

  (b) Pool Betting Tax
  105. A second case made by the FA is for a reduction in Pool Betting Tax now standing at 42.5%. The
suggestion is a reduction to 40% which would yield some £16 million. This, it is said, could be passed on to
assist ground improvements in one of two ways: either the Government could continue to tax pool betting at
the current level but make a donation to football equivalent to 2.5% of the tax recovered, or it could reduce
the tax rate to 40% on the strict understanding that present proposals as to how any reduction of the 42.5%
might be used were amended to allow football to derive the entire benefit from the money thus saved by the
pool companies.

   106. The FA seek to support their argument by reference to the structure of tax on horse racing. They
claim the comparison shows football to be unfairly treated. In horse racing, the duty on off-course betting is
8%; on-course betting is not now taxed. There is a Horserace Betting Levy which goes to the improvement
and maintenance of race courses. However, the comparison between football pools and racing is not of like
with like. The relationship of stakes to winnings is different. The Football League presently receives £14
million a year from the PPA for the use of its fixture list. There is no payment similar to this in racing. Nor is
there an equivalent in racing to the Football Trust or the FGIT. The Horserace Betting Levy is essentially
based on voluntary agreement and is not regarded by the Treasury as a tax. There could be no basis for a levy
on football pools unless there were agreement between the PPA and the Football League.

   107, For these amongst other reasons, the racing analogy may not add weight to the FA’s argument on pool
betting tax. However, apart from that analogy, the FA submit there is a strong case for some reduction of the
42.5% tax. The Chester Report of 1968 recommended the establishment of a football levy. The Rothschild
Royal Commission on Gambling recommended in 1977 a reduction in the pool betting tax from the level at
that time of 40% to 37% to establish a levy board. The FA and the FL do not favour the creation of a football
levy board. They consider that the Football Trust and the FGIT are appropriate bodies to receive and
administer any money accruing to football were a reduction made in the pool betting tax. I can only say that
the case for a modest reduction in the pool betting tax which convinced the Rothschild Commission in 1977
is arguably stronger now that the rate stands at 42.5%. It must in general be for commercial undertakings to
be self-financing. This applies throughout the entertainment industry of which football clubs are a part. The
football authorities appreciate and accept that they must find the necessary funding substantially from their
own resources. Nevertheless, if grounds all over the country are to be upgraded and in some instances
re-located so as to achieve safety for spectators, improvement in the quality of life for residents near grounds

                                                       18
and a reduction in the expensive police commitment to controlling matches, it can be argued there is a case
for financial assistance, if not by direct subsidy then by some tax reduction.

  108. Whether or not the FA’s argument for tax reduction finds favour, there may well be scope for
reassessing and possibly increasing the contribution made by pools to football. It would not matter whether
such contribution is to be by voluntary levy, by an increase in the present percentage rate on receipts from the
Spot the Ball Competition or by increasing the amount paid for the use of the fixture list.

  (c) Capital Allowances
  109. Complaint is made that no capital allowances can be claimed against tax in respect of ground
improvements.

   110. When asked why they seem ready and able to spend large sums, sometimes into millions of pounds,
for a single player in preference to spending money on improving their grounds, the clubs usually give two
reasons.

  111. First, the attendance and satisfaction of their supporters depends essentially on success; so buying a
brilliant player has priority over ground improvement.

Transfer Fees
   112. They say the popular perception of transfer fees as excessive and extravagant is mistaken. The
money, I was told again and again, simply circulates round the League clubs. It is calculated to bring on
budding players. The level of payments is high, but it is forced up by prices continental clubs with huge
financial backing (like Juventus from Fiat) are able to pay.

   113. The "circulation" argument runs like this. First division club A buys an ace player for £1 million
from club B. This enables club B to buy three players at, say, £250,000 each from three other clubs, C, D and
E. Clubs C, D and E each buy two up-and-coming but not yet arrived players from lesser clubs for perhaps
£100,000 each. So the process and the prices continue downwards eventually enabling the poorer clubs to
keep going by cashing in on players they have trained from scratch. Meanwhile, to finance their £1 million
purchase, club A may sell two or three players who are past their best to lower division clubs. This analysis
may well have some validity, but there are notable exceptions. For example, when a French club bought a
player from an English club for over £4 million the money had not been circulating round the League clubs.

ALevy on Transfer Fees?
   114. Even if the "circulation" argument has some validity, the fact remains that transfer fees have reached
a level which many regard as grotesque and certainly out of all proportion to the amounts spent on ground
improvement. There is a case for the football authorities imposing a levy on such fees, the proceeds going to
the FGIT to fund ground improvements. I suggest consideration be given to this.

Tax "Anomaly"
   115. Secondly (and this is the tax argument) football clubs have a strong fiscal inducement to spend on
players rather than ground improvements. Payments for players are allowable revenue expenditure.
Improvements to the ground are not. In Brown (Inspector of taxes) v Burnley Football and Athletic Company
Ltd 1983 AER 244, it was held that expenditure on a new stand to replace an old unsafe one did not qualify as
an allowable deduction whether as a repair or as provision of plant. It is arguable that a fiscal provision which
penalises the redevelopment of grounds whilst encouraging the payment of huge transfer fees is an anomaly,
that it sends the wrong signals to clubs, and that it encourages them to neglect questions of safety in favour of
promoting success on the field. To accede to this argument might fall foul of the maxim that hard cases make
bad law. But as a matter of policy, it is argued that the encouragement of expenditure on ground
improvements by a fiscal concession may well bear re-examination.

Club Financing
   116. Whatever may come from the Pool Promoters Association via the two Trusts, or from any tax
concession, in the end the bulk of the finances for ground improvement must be raised by the clubs
themselves. Here, clubs are at a disadvantage compared with their European counterparts. On the continent
most grounds are owned by local authorities which lease them to the clubs. They are regarded as providing a
communal facility and often the stadium is available for a variety of sports and other functions; sports
facilities and offices are built into the stadium complex.

                                                       19
   117. Nevertheless, there are ways of financing improvements if the club management is enterprising and
resourceful. Sponsorship is one. Presently it brings £17.5 million into football annually. Advertising on
electric score boards and on hoardings round the ground as well as on tickets, programmes and membership
cards is another. Associated companies marketing sports wear and other merchandise with the club’s logo,
the sale of television rights, the issue of debentures, and the sale of shares to the public are other methods
which can be and have been used. In particular, I would expect the football authorities to seek the highest
possible price for television rights. Under current contractual arrangements, the Football Association
receives some £6 million pa from the sale of television rights for domestic broadcasts, of which some £2.5
million is distributed to clubs. They also receive between £0.75 million and £1 million for the sale of
television rights overseas. Separate arrangements apply at Wembley. The Football League contracted some
two years ago to sell the television rights for League matches for £11 million, linked to the Retail Price Index.
The television companies know that football on the screen has a vast following. They should be expected to
pay a substantial price for the rights to relay popular matches. For their part, the football authorities should
ensure that this valuable source of revenue is directed towards improving stadia as a high priority.

   118. The cost of covered seating throughout the 92 clubs in the Football League has been investigated by
the FA. Whilst the assessment can only be a rough estimate and is subject to fluctuations due to inflation and
other factors, the consultants suggested that to install seating throughout all the grounds might cost about £30
million. To provide cover over all those areas could cost a further £100 million. It should be noted, however,
that no breakdown of that figure is given. Moreover, it assumes "all existing uncovered standing capacity
should become covered". Given current attendances, it would seem unnecessary that all that capacity should
be covered. In many instances, attendances are always well below the permitted capacity of the ground. In
those cases; a much smaller scale solution involving the rebuilding or redevelopment of only part of the
ground would be sufficient. There would be little point in providing covered seating accommodation
throughout a ground if there is no realistic possibility of more than half of it being used. Costs may therefore
be less daunting for the smaller clubs than the consultants’ estimates suggest.

Upgraded Stadia or New Stadia
  119. At major grounds where substantial resources can be generated, vast improvements can be made on
existing sites if there is sufficient space. I have seen a number of imaginative examples of ground
redevelopment. It has been achieved at Ibrox Park and is in the course of being achieved at Old Trafford,
White Hart Lane and Hampden Park, to give only four examples.

  120. However, I agree with the evidence from the Sports Council as to the need for space to facilitate car
parking, external and internal circulation and sufficient exits and entrances to the spectator areas. They
said:-

  "The location of many existing football grounds in central city or town sites precludes this provision (of
  space) which implies the adoption of a gradual but progressive policy of disposing of grounds in densely
  developed areas and replacing the facility on the urban periphery. The Council believes that opportunities
  exist for such developments on a self-funding basis in many instances. This would also provide the
  opportunity for more than one club to be based at newly developed stadia constructed to a high
  specification and built to meet new demands for safety and comfort".

StJohnstone
   121. I was impressed by the way this had been done at three particular grounds. At St Johnstone in
Scotland, the solution has been to involve private capital directly. The ASDA supermarket chain bought the
site of the old St Johnstone Football Club in the centre of Perth, redeveloped it as a supermarket, and built
the club a brand new all-seated stadium for 10,000 spectators on the outskirts of the town. The site was, in
effect, donated by a local farmer. It is close to a motorway exit and provides for extensive car parks. I accept
that this confluence of factors might not be easy to reproduce elsewhere. In particular, land prices in some
areas would be prohibitive and planning permission very difficult to obtain. A greenfield site is likely to be in
a conservation or green belt area and the choice of sites is limited by the need to make the ground accessible
to townsfolk albeit outside the town.

Utrecht
   122. I saw two examples abroad where these problems had been tackled resolutely. At Utrecht an old
stadium on the outskirts of the town was totally redeveloped on the same site ostensibly at nil cost. The
contracting company which rebuilt the stadium (Ballast Nedam) is now in consultation with 11 clubs in
England and Scotland with a view to building similar projects in partnership with the Football Association

                                                     20
and British Aerospace of which it is a subsidiary. Their concept involves the recognition that in the past, for
all but a handful of days in the year, a stadium complex has usually and wastefully lain deserted. At Utrecht
the stadium is owned by the municipality. The space underneath the stands and in the corners of the ground
has been developed to provide accommodation for commercial use. The rent provides the municipality with
sports accommodation which pays for itself. Some 6,000 square metres of commercial working areas and
24,000 square metres of commercial offices have been incorporated into the complex. The commercial uses
of this accommodation include office accommodation, snack bars, sports facilities, photocopying and office
equipment services, a driving school and a hairdresser. The large parking area is used except on match days
as a "park and ride" facility for those working in the more congested areas of the city. The advantages for
business are that shops and offices enjoy a prestigious high profile address with all necessary services and
facilities. For the community, the commercial stadium serves as an arena both for trade and recreation.
Appendix 5 is a photograph showing the stadium with the commercial infill in the corners and out into the
car park.
Nimes
   123. The stadium at Nimes in Southern France is also owned by the municipality. It was built recently on
the outskirts of the town with extensive parking and good access to road communications. The cost was some
£ 17 million of which £ 16 million came from the municipality itself. The justification for this expenditure of
public funds is the belief that the stadium is a communal asset. It provides not only a stadium for football or
rugby but an extensive range of other sports facilities built into the complex. These include a gymnastic hall
capable of hosting international matches, an "omnisport" hall for tennis, basket-ball and volley-ball, a judo
hall, facilities for fencing and billiards, and a large exhibition hall which, at the time of our visit, had just
been used for a car sales exhibition.
Local Authority Assistance
   124. All these three stadia are on a comparatively small scale. St Johnstone seats 10,000. Utrecht
accommodates 20,000 and Nimes about 28,000. I accept that in the current financial climate and with our
different approach to communal funding, local authorities are unlikely to be able to provide subsidies for
such stadia, although local authorities do subsidize, for example, swimming baths, theatres and other leisure
facilities which may serve fewer of their citizens. However, clubs which wish to move from centre town sites
to new sites on the outskirts of town may well be able to find a purchaser as St Johnstone did with ASDA.
Likewise, those who wish either to build a new stadium on the outskirts or to redevelop their stadium in town
may be able to do so in a way which incorporates space for commercial lettings.
   125. In such situations, although the local authority may be unable to assist with finance, it could play a
useful role in bringing parties together and as planning authority. It could take a favourable view, for
example, of a planning application which involved the provision not only of a communal sports stadium but
of further facilities, whether for sport or otherwise, benefitting the community as a whole. There has recently
been a number of attempts by clubs to find greenfield sites for new grounds only to be turned down at each
attempt on planning grounds. Clearly, an application for a football ground in a conservation area or green
belt poses planning problems. But, although the protection of such areas is an important principle, two other
considerations may also carry weight. First, that the quality of life of residents living adjacent to a football
ground in a town would be much improved by resiting it elsewhere. Secondly, that if we want safety and
improved standards at grounds there are some clubs which will need a new site at which to achieve them. To
this end, local authorities should surely give what assistance they properly can. One useful example of the
mutual assistance which a club and a local authority can give each other is an agreement made between
Millwall and the London Borough of Lewisham. The latter agreed to pay £70,000 a year to the club which for
its part agreed inter alia to make the ground available for various activities beneficial to the local community.
Ground Sharing
   126. Whether or not income-earning facilities are incorporated into a sports ground, it seems uneconomic
that the stadium itself should be used by only one club, in effect once a fortnight. The cost to each club both
of upgrading or building a stadium and of maintaining it could be halved if sensible sharing arrangements
could be made. But there is resistance to this. A number of cities have two clubs, each with its own ground.
Such is local rivalry that the idea of ground sharing seems anathema to many. Yet, faced with the expense of
seating and ground improvement, it would make financial sense. Opposition to sharing an entirely new
ground may be marginally less than to one club sharing another’s existing ground. Recently Mr Peter
Robinsonl Chief Executive of Liverpool FC, was quoted as saying:
   "If someone were to build a high-quality stadium on Merseyside, we and Everton would be quite happy to
   share it - even though the idea might not appeal to the fans at first".

                                                      21
  If two clubs could sell their inner city grounds with planning permission, the resultant capital would go a
long way to building a modern shared stadium on a more suitable site.
  127. It works abroad. AC Milan and Inter Milan share the San Siro stadium. In Turin, Juventus and
Torino also share. Genova and Sampdoria provide a third example.
 128. As long ago as 1981, in the Sports Council’s Handbook of Sports and Recreational Building Design,
Volume Three (Outdoor Sports), ground-sharing was considered in a technical study of stadia. The author,
Mr Faulkner Brown, wrote at page 24:-
 "Several courses would appear to be open to football clubs. One is that they might rationalise their position
 and, wherever possible, jointly use a single stadium. This could happen at Sheffield, Nottingham and
 Bristol. Fulham could move in with Chelsea and Brentford with Queen’s Park Rangers. Inter-Milan and
 AC Milan, for all their deep rivalry, do live happily enough together in the giant San Siro stadium. The
 British clubs could all retain their identity, halve their overheads and realise handsomely the value of their
 freehold properties, if they could cope with their fiercely held views of club individuality and club pride.
    Another alternative would be, where possible, for clubs to offer unused land adjacent to the stadium for
  development and, in realising the assets from the land, to plough them back into the cost of stadium
  reconstruction. This, of course, has happened at Lord’s and is having some noticeable effects at the Oval
  and in other county cricket grounds.
    A further alternative is to build additional sports facilities alongside the stadium, not necessarily in
  emulation of the ancient Greek example (but nevertheless there is a parallel), so that a large number of
  sports clubs could use all the facilities. This scheme has been developed to some extent both in the United
  States and on the continent."
Super-Stadia
  129. So far, I have referred only to club grounds. But there is a case for having a small number of
super-stadia capable of accommodating very large crowds for international matches or major Cup ties. At
present, the only such stadium in the UK is Wembley which will accommodate 80,000 all-seated. Like
Wembley, any other stadia of large capacity could be available not only for football but for other sports, for
pop concerts and other large events.
   130. A consortium comprising British Aerospace, the FA and Ballast Nedam (who built the Utrecht
stadium) is presently considering the building of a new national stadium at Birmingham to accommodate
100,000. There is a suggestion that this project, if carried through, would provide a replacement for
Wembley. However, it may well be that there is room for both. This would give a venue in London and a
venue in the Midlands for major events. Hampden Park has served as Scotland’s international football
ground for many years and when planned improvements are complete it should continue to do so. It is
arguable that one more large stadium may be required in the north of England but the upgrading of a ground
such as Old Trafford might well suffice to achieve this purpose.
Leadership and Example
   131. I turn from stadia and money to one aspect of football which gives wide scope for improvement at
very little cost. Much is written about the misbehaviour of spectators; but misbehaviour is often imitative.
Hooligans in the crowd find others who will copy them. Similarly, incitement from the pitch or bad
behaviour by players has a malign influence on the crowd. For many fervent followers, the men on the pitch
are heroes to be revered and emulated. After a goal, when the scorer demonstrates to the fans behind the
fencing, the resultant surge forward and hysteria is bad for safety and bad for crowd control. It should not
occur. Worse still, when players fight, the fans follow suit. Lest anyone doubt this, the recent examples of
fighting between players bear it out. In two of the four incidents in November 1989, crowd misbehaviour
resulted directly from fighting between players. At Highbury, fans came out on to the pitch to join in. At
Upton Park, scuffles between Wimbledon and West Ham players provoked surging, fighting and coin
throwing on the terraces.
   132. It is in the first instance up to the players themselves, then the referees, the managers and the club
directors to stop both incitement and violence by players whether on or off the ball. The referees, managers
and directors have power to do this. If and when they fail to use it, the FA must take a firm disciplinary line
using their very full powers to fine those involved including the clubs and to penalise the clubs in points. If all
else fails, there is no reason why violence on the pitch should have any immunity from the law of the land or
from police action.

                                                      22
         133. On the positive side, management could do much to create a better atmosphere in the grounds by
     what they say and what they write in programmes and magazines. By consulting with supporters they could
     enlist the goodwill and help of the decent majority to isolate and rebuff misbehaviour from the minority
     rather than imitate it. A campaign for better behaviour could be launched by the clubs through their
     literature and backed by managers and players using their popular hero appeal.

        134. I should add that violence on the pitch is not confined to soccer. There has been a growing incidence
     of stampings and punchings in Rugby Union games even at the highest level. Reaction from referees, clubs
     and even international selectors has tended to play such incidents down. Although spectator behaviour has
     not, as yet, been adversely affected by such incidents, the authorities ought to deal firmly with them before
     that happens and in any event, simply because violence should be put down.
     Family and Membership Areas
        135. Much progress has been made at a number of clubs recently in bringing women and children back to
     watching football by creating separate family areas. Similarly, partial membership schemes have enabled
     clubs to reserve parts of the ground exclusively to members. This has had the dual advantage of creating areas
     of reliable good behaviour and offering discounts, favourable travel facilities and other benefits to members.
     The good behaviour depends on those who pay for membership being more likely to be responsible and upon
     their risking loss of membership if they transgress.
        136. At a number of grounds, family areas have been de-segregated in the sense that families drawn from
     away supporters have been permitted to share family areas with home supporters. I have already indicated
     how segregation has tended to worsen hostility between rival fans. It is difficult once segregation has been
     practised to dispense with it, certainly at a stroke. These joint family areas may prove to be the first step in a
     retreat from segregation. If the process can be extended gradually to allowing members of the visiting club to
     share the membership area of the home club, useful progress will have been made. It will be made easier if
     there is seating rather than standing.

     The Disabled
        137. I received evidence from the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (RADAR) and the
     Access Committee for England drawing attention to the opportunity which redevelopment of grounds
     presents to make better provision for disabled people. Many clubs already make provision for the disabled
     but this is by no means universal. Particular attention is needed to the provision of safe and adequately
     spacious viewing areas for wheelchair users, with a seat alongside for a companion, protected from the
     weather, accessible to toilet facilities designed specifically for the disabled, and easily reached from a car park
     (with reserved car spaces for Orange Badge holders) by means of ramps. The needs of other disabled people -
     those who have difficulty walking, the partially sighted, and those with impaired hearing - require special
     attention, for example by the provision of handrails, clear signposts, steps painted in bright colours, and the
     use of electronic scoreboards to supplement loudspeaker announcements, if these people are to be able to
     attend sporting events enjoyably and safely. I endorse the importance attached to these suggestions and I
     hope that the comprehensive improvements which I am proposing will include careful attention to them.
     Clubs should regard them as integral to their planning, not as an optional extra.

     Conclusion
       138. I hope in these two chapters I have made it clear that the years of patching up grounds, of having
     periodic disasters and narrowly avoiding many others by muddling through on a wing and a prayer must be
     over. A totally new approach across the whole field of football requires higher standards both in bricks and
     mortar and in human relationships.

                         PART II - SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS
                                                 CHAPTER 3

                                            THE FRAMEWORK
Minimum Standards of Safety
   139. It is a truism that safety and crowd control are inter-dependent. If a crowd gets out of control safety
will be in jeopardy. Measures to control the crowd, such as fencing, almost always have an impact on safety.
Nevertheless, I shall seek to treat each separately. In this Part I shall deal with management and features of
the ground affecting safety.
   140. I have already stressed the need for football management to give higher priority to the safety and
well-being of spectators. Clearly, the cost of safety measures and improvements can more easily be borne or
raised by the successful clubs than by those struggling to keep going. But the safety of spectators invited to a
ground cannot be left to depend upon the affluence of the club. There must be prescribed minimum
requirements which have to be fulfilled at any ground if spectators are to be admitted there. The evidence of
practice pre-Hillsborough and indeed post-Hillsborough, right up to December 1989, convinces me that the
provisions presently in place, statutory and otherwise, have not been strong enough to enforce that basic level
of safety.
Legislation for Safety
  141. The principal instruments aimed at achieving a framework for safety are the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975 as amended by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 and the Home Office
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Green Guide).
   142. The 1975 Act, as amended, requires a Safety Certificate to be issued by the local authority in respect
of designated sports grounds. It is an offence (Section 12(1)(d)) to contravene any term or condition of the
Certificate. Thus the requirements of the Certificate are mandatory but what those requirements should be is
in the discretion of the local authority.
  143. Section 2(1) of the 1975 Act provides:-
  "A safety certificate shall contain such terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or
  expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in use for the specified activity or activities,
  and the terms and conditions may be such as to involve alterations or additions to the stadium."
  144. Originally, certain obligatory terms had to be inserted in Safety Certificates. Section 2(2) provided:-

  "Without prejudice to subsection (1) above, a safety certificate -
    (a) shall specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium;
    (b) may specify the maximum number to be admitted to different parts of it; and
    (c) shallinclude terms and conditions:-
        (i) as to the number, size and situation of entrances to and exits from the stadium or any part of it
        (including means of escape in case of fire or other emergency) and the means of access to any such
        entrances or exits;
        (ii) requiring those entrances, exits and means of access to be properly maintained and kept free
        from obstruction; and
        (iii) as to the number, strength and situation of any crush barriers."

  However, when the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 extended the application of the 1975
Act from sports stadia to all sports grounds, there was substituted for section 2(2), by section 19 of the 1987
Act, a new section 2(2) and a new section 15A giving power to the Secretary of State by order to lay down what
terms and conditions a Safety Certificate shall include. No order has yet been made but guidance from the
Home Office has recommended local authorities to approach their function under section 2(1) in accordance
with the criteria in the superseded section 2(2). (See Home Office Circular 71/1987 dated 25 November
1987, Annex A, paragraph 6.)

                                                       24
   145. So, presently, local authorities are not bound to include terms or conditions on any particular aspect
of safety in the Certificate. In practice, they no doubt follow the Home Office guidance. They also take
account of the Green Guide.
Green Guide
  146. The latter, however, is by way of guidance only. It provides as follows:-
  "6. Deviations from individual guidelines are possible without necessarily detracting from the overall
  safety of the ground. The variety of type, function and layout of sports grounds and the inter-relationship
  of the different parts of them means that a flexible approach should be maintained to take account of the
  particular circumstances at individual grounds".

  Such flexibility is obviously highly desirable in relation to some aspects of the guidance. But flexibility can
become degraded. Where a local authority has chosen to incorporate the criteria of the Green Guide into a
Safety Certificate there has been scope for considerable deviation from provisions which ought to command
standard adherence. Thus, for example, at Hillsborough where the Safety Certificate required compliance
with certain Green Guide recommendations and a departure was shown to have occurred, the defence was
that the Guide expressly provided for flexibility so that a deviation from its provisions was a matter of
legitimate discretion.

   147. In view of this and evidence I have received suggesting that the Green Guide may not be followed as
closely as is desirable, I consider that when it is revised it needs to be given more effect. At present there is a
risk of slackness developing in the absence of any mandatory provisions. There would appear to be two
alternative courses open. It would be possible to make the terms of the Green Guide mandatory throughout.
However, I think that this could be too rigid and in relation to some peripheral matters impractical. The other
course is to make some of its provisions obligatory inclusions in the Safety Certificate. I prefer this.
   148. There are some requirements of such crucial importance to safety that it should be mandatory for
Safety Certificates to specify them. I consider those specified in the original section 2(2) of the 1975 Act fall
into this category. Moreover, so far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned "shall" should be substituted
for "may". This is critical to ensuring that no discrete area becomes overcrowded.
   149. Accordingly, I recommend that the Secretary of State exercise his specific powers under section 15A
or his general powers under section 6(2) by order or regulation to achieve this. In specifying the requirements
in the Certificate, for a particular ground, the local authority should follow the Green Guide criteria; but
once that is done and the appropriate figures and terms for that ground have been decided no room should be
left for flexibility. By the stage when the local authority has specified the requirements in the Certificate,
flexibility has been exhausted.
   150. Where a local authority incorporates any other provision of the Green Guide into the Safety
Certificate it should make it clear whether that provision is to be complied with absolutely or with
discretionary flexibility. For example, paragraph 88 of the Green Guide provides that a ramp subject to
heavy crowd flow should preferably not exceed a gradient of 1 in 10. Should a local authority require in a
Safety Certificate that a club comply with a Green Guide recommendation as to gradients it should make
clear whether it restricts gradients to a maximum of 1 in 10 or whether it leaves flexibility to the discretion of
the club.
   151. In putting the responsibility for the Safety Certificate upon the local authority, Parliament no doubt
 had two sound reasons; first, since all sports grounds differ in their layout and environs, local knowledge
 ought sensibly to be utilised in laying down and monitoring terms and conditions; secondly, a local body can
 respond quickly to any problem which may arise. Nevertheless, there are two aspects of such local
 administration which can cause problems.
    (i) The Advisory Group
    152. The issue, review and enforcement of Safety Certificates should be based upon efficient professional
 inspection and opinion and should be conducted in a businesslike manner. In Sheffield, the Safety
 Certificate procedure both for Hillsborough and for Sheffield United’s ground at Bramall Lane was
 unsatisfactory as I indicated in paragraphs 150 to 158 of my Interim Report. I hope that this was exceptional.
 It is important that there should be a safety team consisting of appropriate members of the local authority’s own
 staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services and of the building authority. What name
 is given to this group does not in the end matter. At Sheffield it began by being called the Officer Working Party.

                                                          25
When Sheffield City Council took over from South Yorkshire County Council, the name was changed to the
"Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group", or the Advisory Group for short. In my interim
recommendations (Number 17) I said an Advisory Group should be set up. I had in mind the type of safety
team already referred to. Apparently, in some quarters, it was thought that I was suggesting a second body
called an Advisory Group to advise the safety team. This was not so. Also, in that recommendation, I
suggested that representatives of the club and of a recognised supporters’ club should be members of the
Advisory Group. I have reconsidered this in the light of evidence and advice received. The responsibility for
the Safety Certificate is exclusively that of the local authority. I therefore think that the correct course is that
representatives of the club and of a recognised supporters’ organisation should be consulted, since they may
have relevant suggestions or criticisms to make, but they should not be full members of the team.
  153. I repeat my recommendation that the Advisory Group’s terms of reference should encompass all
matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and attendance at matches.
There should be a chairman from the local authority, and an effective procedure. Resolutions should be recorded
and regular written reports should be required for consideration by the local authority.
   (ii) A Review Body
   154. The other disadvantage of Safety Certificates being issued locally is that different standards may be
applied by different authorities even in practically identical situations. A safety team, or some very
influential member of it, may be much stricter in one place than the comparable authority elsewhere. I have
had complaints that since Hillsborough measures appropriate to a larger ground have been rigidly and
inappropriately enforced at grounds with negligible attendance. Conversely, it is possible that too indulgent
or lax an approach may be adopted or develop in a particular locality. Again, simply left to solve their own
problems, there would be little opportunity for local authorities to learn from comparison with solutions
adopted elsewhere. In these circumstances, it has been suggested that there should be a National Forum in
which local authority teams could meet periodically to discuss and compare their procedures, and that there
should be a national overseeing and inspecting body to monitor and review the consistent discharge by local
authorities of their certificating duties. Having discussed this with local authority representatives both in
England and in Scotland I am satisfied that two approaches are not necessary. The better course is to have a
National Inspectorate and Review Body. This is now provided for in the Football Spectators Act 1989 by section
13. It is there laid down that the Football Licensing Authority shall have the function of keeping under review
the discharge by local authorities of their functions under the 1975 Act. The FLA may, having consulted the
local authority and certain local officers, require terms and conditions to be included in any Safety
Certificate. The section empowers any inspector appointed by the FLA to make inspections and inquiry as
necessary. The local authority may by notice be required to furnish the FLA with information regarding its
discharge of its 1975 Act functions.
   155. I warmly welcome the appointment of a national body to conduct these inspecting and reviewing
functions. Assuming it successfully discharges those functions, the effect should be to improve the efficiency
and consistency of practice with regard to the issue and review of Safety Certificates. This would be enhanced
if the review body were to circulate, to all local authorities from time to time, advice based upon their
experience of problems and solutions at various grounds. (See also Recommendation 16 of the report of the
Technical Working Party at Appendix 3).
   156. Because the Football Spectators Act 1989 applies only to association football, the inspecting and
reviewing role of the FLA would be exercisable only in relation to Safety Certificates at football grounds.
Nevertheless, this remit of the FLA should be extended to cover all grounds designated under the 1975 Act and
indeed all grounds requiring Safety Certificates or licences under Parts III and IV of the 1987 Act. Should Part
I of the 1989 Act either not be implemented or be substantially delayed, the same functions should be given to
another suitably constituted body to cover all sports grounds.
   157. It has been suggested that the Health and Safety Executive could fulfil this function if necessary or
indeed that it could monitor spectator safety under the provisions of the Health and Safety at Work Etc Act
 1974. However, its resources would need to be increased. Moreover, until now the Health and Safety
Executive, being primarily concerned with the safety of employees pursuant to the 1974 Act, has not
extended its surveillance to include spectators at football grounds. The Home Office evidence on this point is
as follows:
  "The Health and Safety at Work Act could also be used to enforce general spectator safety at sports grounds.
  Section 3 of the Act is wide ranging in that it places a duty on an employer to conduct his undertaking in
  such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment who may be
  affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their health or safety. A sports or other entertainment

                                                        26
"undertaking" would fall within this category. However, it is the stated policy of the Health and Safety
Commission that, as a general principle, they and the Executive wish to avoid duplication of enforcement
with other authorities. The HSE would not therefore generally attempt to enforce the requirements of
Section 3 of the 1974 Act when they overlap with duties imposed by other more specific legislation where
other authorities have responsibility for policy and enforcement. The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
represents more specific legislation and the Health and Safety Executive does not enforce Section 3 of the
1974 Act to secure the safety of spectators at sports grounds. This arrangement is agreed between the
Health and Safety Executive and the Home Office."

                                                 CHAPTER 4

                                       SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS
  158. Having considered the framework for safety provided by the statutory provisions and the Green
Guide, I must now deal with certain key substantive provisions.
Capacity
   159. I accept the Technical Working Party’s statement that "the safe allowable capacity of any viewing
area whether seated or standing is the least of (i) its holding capacity, (ii) the number of persons who can leave
through a normal exit system within a prescribed time at the end of an event, (iii) the number of persons who
can leave through an emergency exit system within a prescribed time and (iv) the number of persons who can
be admitted through the turnstiles serving that area within one hour." The "prescribed time" for normal exit
is said in paragraph 230 of the Guide to be 8 minutes. The "prescribed time" for emergency exit is not
definitively fixed in the Guide as it will vary from area to area. It will need to be determined by the local
authority on advice from the Advisory Group and especially the fire service.
  160. Subject to factors (ii), (iii) and (iv), where there is a properly designed seating area, capacity is simply
determined by the number of seats. Increasingly, therefore, problems of maximum capacity will fade out as
seating is phased in. But, as long as we have standing areas, grounds will be vulnerable to overcrowding and
maximum limits must be set and achieved.
  161. The Green Guide provides in paragraphs 221 and 222 for a maximum density of 54 persons per 10 sq
metres assuming a terrace or viewing slope in good condition. For some reason, not easy to understand, the
Guide also provides the lower figure of 27 persons per 10 sq metres when the slope or terrace "materially
deviates from the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
packed". This might be taken to imply that whatever the hazards there is no need to reduce capacity below
27. In the heading to Chapter 16, the Green Guide emphasises that "account should be taken of the features
of the individual ground, its configuration, general condition, use and any deviations from the Guide’s
provisions."
   162. It became clear from evidence before me at both stages of this Inquiry that not only was the
maximum of 54 per 10 sq metres grossly exceeded at Hillsborough; insufficient was being done generally to
ensure either by counting or by informed assessment that the Green Guide criteria were observed.
Accordingly, I reaffirmed the advice in the Guide and recommended that a reduction of 15% be made as an
interim measure to improve the safety margin. The question now is what should be the final recommendation
on this difficult subject.

    163. I entirely agree with the Technical Working Party that there is no benefit to be gained from retaining
the lower figure of 27 or any other minimum figure. Indeed, it could be a dangerous suggestion. The scale of
permissible density should be from 0 up to the maximum figure applicable only in good conditions. I note
the Technical Working Party’s view that "a uniformly distributed density of 5.4/m2 should be safe in static
conditions in full compliance with the Green Guide". However, the words in italics are crucial to their view.
It is one thing to place 54 docile people evenly in an area of 10 sq metres on a terrace and say they should be
safe. It is quite another if they are excited, if they sway or surge to and fro, if one end of the area is a better
viewing point than the other and if account is taken of possible incidents in the crowd eg a scuffle or a
firework. Any of those factors can cause bunching; bunching can quickly become crushing.
  164. Most clubs have responsibly applied the recommended 15% reduction. Some have jibbed at it;
understandably, in view of its impact on revenue. On the other hand, as I have already observed, some Police
Commanders expressed relief that numbers have been reduced. I must also point out that, even whilst the
reduction has been in force, events have shown how easy it is for crushing to occur.
   165. At the start of the 1989/90 season, on 19 August, Coventry were at home to Everton. There were
complaints afterwards of congestion and crushing before the match outside the turnstiles and after the match
as spectators pressed to get out.
  166. Even more worrying was an incident on 9 December at Ayresome Park when Middlesbrough were at
home to Leeds. I have not conducted a full inquiry into the incident having no remit to do so. But I have
received a full report from the police. I have also viewed more than once a video film of what happened. It
was horribly reminiscent of Hillsborough.

                                                       28
   167. The following facts are clear. Leeds supporters had been allocated, as a standing area, a wedge-shaped
pen "D" at the south east corner of the ground. It was flanked by a narrow sterile area on each side. There was
a broad gangway running from top to bottom of pen "D". The perimeter fencing at the front of the pen was
topped with spikes. There was not a single gate to the pitch. The only way out for those at the front was by a
gate at each side into the sterile area and thence through another gate to the pitch. Those gates were closed
during the match. The capacity of the pen in accordance with my interim recommendation was 2108. Leeds
supporters were admitted to the pen, families with very young children being put at the front. The gangway
was not kept clear. Some Leeds supporters managed to get tickets for the opposite home end of the ground
causing apprehension of trouble. A number of them were taken out and moved into pen "D" from the pitch
side. Other Leeds fans with tickets for the wrong end were also allowed into pen "D" from the back. Shortly
after the match started, there was distress among those at the front of the pen. After two surges down part of
the pen where there were no barriers from front to back, the police had to assist in getting spectators,
especially children, out of the pen. This was done principally over the fencing although the side gates were
opened and shut a number of times. In the event, 14 people had to be treated for minor injuries in the
ambulance room. Five spectators, three of them children aged 10, 11 and 12, were taken to hospital with
chest injuries, lacerations and bruising.
   168. The local authority, the police and the club were clearly shocked by this incident and have taken
prompt remedial action. Additional crush barriers are to be installed, additional gates are to be provided
including one for pen D, the capacity of that pen is to be halved. Admission to all parts of the ground, save the
visitors’ section (pen D), is to be for members only to prevent away supporters buying tickets for the home
end. Finally, there is to be a phased programme which will extend seating to all spectators by 1991 / 1992.
  169. This incident and its aftermath prompt the query: does there have to be a disaster or near-disaster at
each ground to trigger radical action? I hope not.
   170. The permitted capacity of the pen was exceeded, although it is not clear to what extent. The police
view is that it was only by about 60 persons. In a sense, the smaller the excess the more the point is made that
danger can occur very quickly on a standing terrace even with moderate numbers. Some argue that reducing
numbers and giving spectators more room simply enables a surge to gather greater momentum; that the
tighter people are packed together the less the scope for surging or misbehaviour. This was the philosophy
which allowed excessive numbers to be packed into pens prior to Hillsborough. The only sensible conclusion
is that unless both numbers and terrace layouts are strictly controlled, there will always be a risk of crushing
on a standing terrace. The combination of numbers, excitement and partisanship, even leaving aside
misbehaviour, has a potential for danger.
   171. Comparison with criteria adopted abroad is instructive. France and Belgium adopt the Green Guide
figure of 5.4/m2. But in Holland, the maximum standing capacity is 4/m2. In Italy, the rule varies between
municipalities. In Milan the figure is 2/m2. In Rome it is 4/m2. But in Italy little difference is recognised in
principle between the figures permissible for standing and those for sitting.
    172. Weighing all these factors I do not think it would be right to recommend a substantial departure from
the effect of the 15% interim reduction. Now, rather than take a figure and deduct a percentage from it, what
is required is a specific figure for maximum standing density when terrace conditions are good by Green Guide
criteria. I recommend that that figure should be 47 per 10 sq metres and I would substitute 47 for the figure of
54 in the Green Guide. The effect is approximately a 13% rather than a 15% reduction from the former figure
of 54. I wish to stress as forcefully as I can, however, that this figure is a maximum and it is for the local
authority acting on the recommendation of its Advisory Group to make necessary and realistic reductions from
that figure in respect of any feature of the terrace which deviates significantly from Green Guide criteria or has
any other significant shortcoming.
Counting Them In
   173. It is no use fixing a maximum capacity for a pen or enclosure unless there are reliable means of
ensuring it is not exceeded. I therefore repeat my recommendation that the number of spectators entering each
self-contained pen or other standing area must be limited electronically, mechanically, by a ticketing
arrangement, by counting or otherwise. The best arrangement is one which makes all facilities for a single
viewing area self-contained; access should be through turnstiles solely serving that area via a concourse doing
likewise with its own toilets and refreshment points. This point has already been clearly made in paragraphs
101 and 206 of the Green Guide:-
  "Each section should ideally be self-contained and should be serviced by its own entrance/exits,
  refreshment facilities and toilets..."

                                                         29
   That way the numbers can be accurately recorded at the turnstiles on entry and no extra spectators can get
into the area from elsewhere at half-time or after visiting common toilets or snack-bars.
  174. Arrangements must be made to close off further access to each pen or area when maximum capacity is
about to be reached and to close the turnstiles leading to the relevant area.
Gangways
  175. The Green Guide, in paragraphs 97 to 99, makes recommendations as to gangways as follows:-

  "Spectators should be discouraged from standing in lateral gangways because this disrupts free movement
  about the ground (or within sections of it). Also, spectators on the terrace steps behind the gangway may
  have their view obstructed, which will cause them to stretch and strain, and so generate dangerous
  pressures within the crowd. Spectators would be discouraged from standing in these gangways if they were
  sunk from 100mm to 200mm and if crush barriers were provided behind but not immediately in front of
  them.

    Similarly, spectators should be discouraged from standing in radial gangways. These are relatively long
  and uncontrolled downward paths through terraces, and are difficult to keep clear, especially when sited in
  popular viewing areas, eg behind the goal area at a football ground. It is helpful to sink them 150mm to
  200mm and to interrupt an otherwise continuously descending gangway by turns along, say, lateral
  gangways.

    Where sinking gangways, lateral or radial, is not thought to be practical, their boundaries should be
  highlighted with paint and spectators advised by signs not to stand there. Stewards may be needed to
  enforce this instruction."

   176. In my view these provisions need to be much tougher. I agree with the Technical Working Party that
gangways should be kept clear. There is no point in having them, in calling them gangways and in excluding
them from the area used to calculate capacity under paragraph 221 if spectators are allowed to stand in them.
The whole point of crush barriers on terraces is to prevent unrestrained movement of large masses of fans
from back to front down the terrace. It they are allowed to stand in the gangways where there are no barriers,
such movement can occur without inhibition. The incident at Ayresome Park on 9 December 1989 involved
just that. Two surges causing crushing against the fence came down the terrace unrestrained by barriers.

   177. Whilst paragraph 98 of the Guide notes the difficulty of keeping radial gangways clear, it can be done.
One way is to fix a radial rail on each side of the gangway and parallel to it, inhibiting lateral movement into
the gangway from the standing areas. Another surprisingly effective method which I saw used successfully by
Millwall is to put red and white tapes in the same position to indicate the gangway as a no-go area for
standing.
  178. Gangways should be painted in a conspicuous colour (yellow is used most commonly) whether they are
sunk or not. The Safety Certificate should require that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they be
                                                                                                                    )
painted.

Fencing
   179. Perhaps the most emotive and disputed topic in this field is what should be done about perimeter
fences. They were installed at many grounds to prevent pitch invasions during the 1970s. After Hillsborough
there was a strong clamour to take them down. Some clubs did. Within weeks of Hillsborough, however, there
were unruly incidents involving pitch invasions at more than one ground, as I noted in paragraph 308 of my
Interim Report. I deferred making any interim recommendation involving structural alterations at the
interim stage, confining myself to saying that gates to the pitch ought to be kept fully open.

   180. Since then, whilst visiting grounds, I have seen a full range of practices from one extreme to the other.
There is no consensus, At some grounds eg Highbury, there have never been perimeter fences. At others, like
Anfield and White Hart Lane, there were fences but they have been taken down. At other grounds the fences
vary in height and design. Some are fearsome high structures with florid arrangements of spikes, redolent of
medieval weaponry. They look more suited to a prison than a sports ground. Coming down the scale, there
are high fences with only vertical spikes and lower fences without spikes; fences of wire mesh and fences of
strong metal; fences with a good provision of gates directly to the pitch, fences with only one gate per large
pen (like Hillsborough), and some with no gate at all (as in pen D at Ayresome Park). Again, some clubs have
left their gates to the pitch fully open as I recommended. Some have taken the gates out and left blank spaces;


                                                     30
some have opened the gates but put red and white tape across the gap; others have kept the gates open during
the match, but closed them towards its conclusion to stop pitch invasions at the final whistle. Others again
have kept the gates closed and bolted but manned individually. At Millwall’s ground, an effective procedure
is followed before each match whereby it is announced over the public address system that stewards will
demonstrate the gates affording escape to the pitch. The stewards then do so in the manner of an air
stewardess demonstrating emergency procedures. The gates are then closed to, but not locked.

   181. This wide variety of practices is surprising. If a club were concerned only with its own supporters,
divergence of practice would be readily understandable. Club A might say: "Our supporters can be trusted
not to invade the pitch; so no fencing". Club B might say: "Some of our supporters have shown that given the
chance they will invade the pitch, so we must have high fences to stop them". But all the clubs in any division,
including clubs of type A and B, visit each other; so one has fans of club B, used to being caged in at home,
being given the chance when visiting club A to invade the pitch. They do not seem to make a point of doing so
with any frequency. However instances do occur, as I have mentioned; they are unpredictable and may
happen at any time depending probably upon the occurrence of some incident thought to be provocative.
When they occur, they can cause serious danger. There is risk of injury to players, to the referee and to the
police, quite apart from the risk of injury through fighting between fans. It is true, as is often said, that so far
no fatality has resulted from a pitch invasion, whereas 95 people died against a fence installed to prevent such
invasion. But if fighting between fans starts on the pitch area, it is difficult to stop and injuries can be caused.
At Selhurst Park on 13 May 1989, five police officers and 16 supporters required hospital treatment.

   182. Since each club in a League division has to cope during the season with at least some of the
supporters of all the other clubs in the division, the widely differing solutions to the fencing problem must be
due to different attitudes rather than objectively different needs. The different attitudes taken by clubs or
local authorities stem from the difficulty in balancing or deciding the priority of three crucial considerations:

    i.   Fences, especially high, spiked fences, are intimidating, ugly and demoralising.

    ii. Adequate measures must be taken to prevent pitch invasions for the reasons already given.

    iii. Whatever the measures taken to prevent pitch invasions, there must be adequate provision for
         escape in emergencies.

   183. At some grounds, point ii. has been regarded as paramount so that i. has had to give way. At others,
either point i. or, especially after Hillsborough, point iii. have carried greatest weight so as to remove or
greatly reduce the fencing.

  184. Is there any way of achieving a satisfactory balance of all three considerations? I believe so: that it is
possible to have sufficient obstacles to pitch invasion without prison-type fences and also to provide for
escape in emergency. I deal with the three considerations in turn.

  i. High Spiked Fences
   185. I agree with the view that high, prison-type fences with spikes and overhanging sections should go. The
spectacle of these huge cage-like fences is inconsistent with a sports ground being for pleasure and recreation.
Moreover, I believe such intimidatory fences have an adverse affect on both the morale and the behaviour of
fans. They feel badly treated. Having to stand in a cage for your Saturday afternoon recreation inevitably
causes resentment. Resentment often results in hostility to those controlling the match. A sour relationship
develops and continues between the fans and those in authority, making the job of police and stewards much
more difficult. Being inside the cage provokes some to hurl abuse or missiles at those outside, rival fans,
players or police. The security of the fencing (in that the rival fans cannot penetrate it) encourages bravado to
indulge in such activity. The spiked fences imply an expectation that trouble will or may occur. They also
hamper a clear view of the game. To remove them would signal the advent of a new future for football and
especially a new attitude from the authorities to the spectators. Accordingly, I consider that when perimeter
fencing is used it should not exceed a prescribed maximum height and all spike arrangements and top
sections angled inwards should go. This view is in accord with the recommendation of the Technical Working
Party (Appendix 3 paragraph 20). But what should be the prescribed maximum height? That leads to
consideration ii.




                                                        31
  ii. Adequate Measures to Prevent Pitch Invasions
   186. UEFA regulation B6 of 1988 requires as follows:-
  "Protection of the playing field by means of
  (a) a fence of at least 2.2 metres in height or a moat or else

  (b) a barrier with adequate policing so as to make it impossible for spectators to enter the field of play.
  Fences must have sufficient security gates opening towards the playing field and in the case of moats or a
combination of moats and fences adequate other security passages should be provided".
   187. Inquiries show that the figure of 2.2 metres was chosen simply by reference to the height of existing
fencing at various grounds especially in West Germany and the need to choose a height offence which would
amount to "a real obstruction" to pitch invasion. As to the word "impossible" similar inquiries suggest that
the intention was to leave it to the police commander to decide what resources he might need. Should a pitch
invasion occur, UEFA would consider all the circumstances before deciding what if any action to take.
   188. In my view a fence should be of sufficient height to be a serious obstacle to pitch invasion. It should
provide sufficient obstruction to enable the police to take timely action should pitch invasion be attempted
without being so high as seriously to interfere with vision or to give a feeling of imprisonment. Although I
appreciate the UEFA regulation says "at least 2.2 metres", these criteria lead me to recommend that
perimeter fencing should be no higher than 2.2 metres. That measurement I take from ground level at the
front of the terrace to the top of the fencing ie the 2.2 metres may consist entirely of fencing or partly of wall
and partly of fencing mounted on the wall. For example, at Ibrox Park the fencing is about 1.45 metres high
but it is mounted on a wall and the total height of wall and fence is 2.2 metres.
  189. In making this recommendation I am merely indicating a maximum height should perimeter fencing
be used. I do not suggest there must be such fencing or indeed any fencing. Those clubs which presently have
no perimeter fencing may well think it safe to continue that way. Others may emulate them. Still more may
consider that they can dispense with fencing or bring it to a lower level than 2.2 metres in front of their family
areas or their seated areas. As the seating areas increase it should progressively be found possible to achieve a
corresponding reduction in fencing. These options, subject to the maximum height of 2.2 metres which I
have indicated, should be left to the discretion of local authorities acting on the advice of their Advisory
Group which will have consulted the club and supporters.
   190. I should make clear that I have thus far referred only to perimeter fencing at the pitch side of viewing
areas. Different considerations may well apply to the height of radial fencing used to segregate rival fans. The
maximum height of such fences should be a matter for local decision and may depend for example on
whether there are sterile areas between pens of rival fans; but I still recommend that no spikes be used.
   191. Some may feel I am being naive or over-optimistic in recommending that fencing be brought down to
a lower level. Hooligans may take advantage of this relaxation to have, literally, a field day. However, I draw
attention to those grounds where fences have already been brought down to or below the level I recommend
and others where there are none at all. If we wish to make progress, some initiative must surely be taken to
stop the cycle of bad behaviour met with repression inducing worse behaviour.
   192. Besides, there are other ways of deterring pitch invasions than by dauntingly fortified fences. One is
to balance the lowering of the fences with a prohibition against going on to the pitch without reasonable
excuse. I shall deal with that in the next chapter. The other is by alternative physical means.
Safety Corridors
   193. One method has been adopted, so far successfully, at Anfield, Goodison Park and White Hart Lane.
It involves reserving a safety corridor or dry moat between the front row of standing spectators and a
perimeter fence or wall of moderate proportions. The two photographs Appendix 6 illustrate the Liverpool
and Everton versions of it. The front few steps of the terrace are sacrificed as a viewing area and left as a
sterile strip. Behind that area, the front row of crush barriers is filled in and made continuous with no gaps.
The Everton version has no fence above the perimeter wall. At Anfield there is a low red rail fence. That
arrangement does not absolutely prevent pitch invasion, but it inhibits it. Moreover, anyone or any group
minded to get to the pitch has first to get over the front crush barrier, then cross the corridor, then get up the
steps or over the wall onto the perimeter track. At White Hart Lane there is finally a line of advertising
hoardings to be scaled. By that time the police should be able to intervene. At high-risk matches no doubt
police could patrol the sterile area.

                                                      32
Moats
   194. The safety corridor at these three grounds is not truly a dry moat. But I have seen examples both in
Holland and Italy of a concrete dry moat providing a total obstacle to pitch invasion. At Utrecht, there is a
deep broad moat; provision is made to enable spectators to descend into the moat and use it as a passageway
for entrance and exit. A photograph is at Appendix 7. At the San Siro stadium in Milan, there is a similar
moat at one side of the ground which will be extended all round. At present there is no provision for access to
it or across it to the pitch but I was told in Rome that access to the pitch by bridges will have to be provided to
accord with the Italian regulations.
   195. To interpose a full scale moat of the Utrecht or Milan type between the spectators and the pitch
requires considerable space. It is easier to provide it as an integral part of the design of a new stadium than to
introduce it as a modification of an old one. At most UK grounds the space between pitch and spectators is
very limited and to introduce a moat would involve a large loss of viewing area. Nevertheless, it is a solution
worthy of consideration and especially so for a new stadium. Its advantage is that it effectively prevents pitch
invasion without impeding vision or importing a prison atmosphere. A few rows back from it, you are not
even aware of its existence. Its disadvantage, apart from the space it requires, is the difficulty of combining it
with access to the pitch in emergencies.
  iii Emergency Escape
   196. Hillsborough showed conclusively that, if there are to be perimeter fences, there must be sufficient
gates to permit escape to the pitch and they must be immediately available in an emergency. That lesson was
reaffirmed by the recent incident at Ayresome Park. I know there is a school of thought opposed to access to
the pitch in any circumstances, preferring that alternative evacuation routes should all be away from the
pitch. Thus, at some grounds (Hillsborough was one) emergency plans did not require gates to the pitch or
take any such existing gates into account in calculating the time required for alternative routes of evacuation.
At Hillsborough, evacuation was to be via the central tunnel, or alternatively through the radial gates at the
back of the terrace and round the ends of the west stand. But, if the emergency arises at the front of the
terraces (as it did) those alternative routes cannot and did not afford timely relief. Presently, although
emergency access to the pitch could readily be gained at both Anfield and Goodison Park, the plans do not
rely on emergency evacuation in that direction. The tragic Bradford City disaster, in which fire swiftly
engulfed a stand, would have caused much greater loss of life had there not been ready access to the pitch. It
can no doubt be argued that inflammable stands with neglected underspaces should not recur, that with
modern stands constructed of non-inflammable materials there should be no risk of another Bradford, and
that if capacities and safety measures are observed no Hillsborough situation should recur. The solemn fact is
that those two disasters did occur. One cannot predict what emergency may arise to make evacuation away
from the pitch either wholly impractical or too slow.
  197. The UEFA regulation cited above recognises that where there are fences access to the pitch should be
preserved. I agree with that view and recommend that emergency access to the pitch should be provided.
   198. How should this be done? There is no significant problem where there are either no fences or none
higher than crush barrier level. At Anfield or Goodison Park, for example, it would not be difficult to get over
the front crush barrier into the "dry moat" and thence to the pitch. That arrangement could be modified to
include radial gangways at intervals running straight down to the "dry moat" through gaps in the front
barrier. This would give even readier access. It must be for local judgement to balance the need for ready
access to the pitch in emergencies with the need to deter such access otherwise.
   199. The more difficult problem arises at grounds where fences of up to 2.2 metres are deemed necessary.
In such fences there must, in my view, be sufficient gates not less than 1.1 metre in width as approved by the
Green Guide. It is no use seeking to specify how many gates will be required by reference to the length of
fencing at the front of a given pen or other enclosure. The length of the frontage is only one factor. Much will
depend on the depth of the terrace and the numbers it is permitted to hold. I prefer, in concurrence with the
Technical Working Party (Appendix 3 paragraph 22) to say that the gates should be sufficient in number to
enable the pen or other enclosure to be evacuated in the time required for any other emergency evacuation route.
Such gates should be evenly spaced along the frontage of the pen to avoid congestion on exit.
The Gates at Nimes
   200. One solution to this problem is the system installed in the new stadium at Nimes which I visited
together with the Assessors. There, the fence consists of a number of electrically operated panels which open
as gates to the pitch, as shown in Appendix 8. There are six sections of the ground. The fencing in each section
is governed by a trigger gate which may be operated electrically or manually. The post upon which it is

                                                       33
mounted has an electro-magnet which holds the mechanism inside the post in a position keeping the gate
shut. When a button is pressed, the magnet is de-activated, the gate descends in its mounting and is free to
swing towards the pitch. As it does so, it releases the next gate which is also mounted on a swivelling device
within its post, operating by gravity to open the gate. This domino effect continues throughout the section. It
can be arrested by someone leaning against one of the gates from the pitch side but how far anyone there
could withstand substantial crowd pressure is doubtful. The trigger gate can be operated manually but this
seemed to require considerable force. To shut the gate again seemed to require considerable force and a lifting
motion. The gates are about nine inches higher than the front floor of the terrace, but there is no sump such as
often exists in grounds in the UK. The system could be adapted to UK grounds but there are a number of
factors upon which greater reassurance might be required. If the gates were fixed on top of a low wall such as
that at Leppings Lane, there would be a danger of crushing in the sump or at least of broken limbs as people
tried to get out. The system has been in operation at Nimes for only a few months and has not been severely
tested to show that it would be effective under crowd pressure. Although a firm is licensed to market the
system in 34 countries worldwide, our information is that so far they have been fitted only at Nimes and
Toulon although one or two other French clubs are interested. In these circumstances the robustness of the
fencing and the effects of English weather upon it are as yet unproved. At Nimes the system operates with a
level walkway on the spectators’ side of the fencing. Apart from a very small step, the pitch is at the same
level. To achieve this arrangement would require considerable alteration to the layout of many UK grounds
involving in particular raising the lower part of terraces to make them level with the pitch and with the
bottom of the fencing.

Gates Unlocked
   201. I made an interim recommendation to leave gates fully open when the pen or enclosure was
occupied. This was for three stated reasons; first, to afford instant access to the pitch; secondly, to provide
visual reassurance to fans after Hillsborough that there was an escape route and thirdly, to keep police and
stewards alert to conditions inside the gateway. I also had in mind that the numbers and size of gates might at
some grounds be inadequate and I was not making any recommendation for structural change at that stage.
Along with reduced capacities, provision of sufficient gates and lower fences, I must now consider whether to
keep or modify my recommendation to leave gates fully open. I know that some Police Commanders have
been anxious that to do so is an invitation to pitch invasion; hence the practice at some grounds of closing the
gates near the end of the game or keeping them shut but not locked. I would still hope that gates would be left
fully open wherever those in command feel this can safely be done. However, I recommend that whether they be
fully open, partially open or closed they be kept unlocked throughout the period when the pen or enclosure is
occupied. They should thus be easily available for emergency exits and spectators should be confident of this.
   202. I repeat my interim recommendation that all gates in radial and perimeter fences of pens or other
self-contained areas should be painted in a different colour from the rest of the fences and marked "Emergency
Exit".

Authorising Access to the Pitch
  203. Interim recommendation number 9 provided as follows:-

  " * 9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close
  together) a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve
  overcrowding..."
   Despite the much greater alertness to the possibility of an emergency which now exists, following
Hillsborough, I still believe it necessary to make a recommendation to ensure that proper provision is made
for swift action to authorise the opening of gates in the event of an emergency. However, it has been drawn to
my attention that strict observance of this interim recommendation verges on the absurd where a pen
contains only a handful of spectators. Moreover, to be bound to provide a police officer at each gate or group
of gates in all circumstances involves a heavy commitment of police manpower which would be even heavier
with an increase in the number of gates. Accordingly, I have decided to recommend that although each gate
should be manned when the enclosure is occupied, whether such manning should be by a police officer or by a
steward is for the Police Commander to decide. In either event plans should ensure that the police can authorise
access through gates to the pitch immediately in the event of an emergency.

Monitoring Crowd Density
  204. It is convenient to mention a modification I think sensible regarding interim recommendation 5.
That provided:-


                                                       34
 " * 5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
 area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
 sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
 period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other
 steward or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer authorised under
 Recommendation 9 below, and by radio to the control room."
  I repeat that recommendation (with a slight change of wording to achieve clarity) but qualify it to avoid
absurdity when numbers are small. The recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other
standing area where the spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not
exceed one third of the area’s maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, whichever is the lower.
Cutting Equipment
  205. In the immediate aftermath of Hillsborough, I recommended that suitable and sufficient cutting
equipment should be provided to enable spectators to be released from behind perimeter fencing. Assuming
the recommended maximum capacities are observed, that fences are lowered, that sufficient gates are
provided and left unlocked, cutting equipment should not be necessary. Something in these provisions would
have to go badly wrong for such equipment to be required. Nevertheless, I recommend that the equipment
should be maintained in case of some unforeseen emergency.

Functions of Police and Stewards
   206. Which functions should be discharged by the police and which by the club’s stewards is one of the
most vexed questions. To describe the background to the argument I can do no better than repeat what I said
in my Interim Report at pages 28 and 29.
  "Who should Monitor the Terraces?
    161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be both? Or should it be by arrangement,
  depending upon the ground or section of the ground in question?
    162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a match on its premises for reward 1s
  responsible for securing safety at that event. The Green Guide (1986) provides:

    "23. The safety of the public inside the ground is the responsibility of those who stage the event and
    administer the ground in which it is held, ie the "management". This responsibility applies in both
    normal and emergency situations...
    195 .... there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:
         (a) controlling or directing members of the public who are entering or leaving the ground, to help
         achieve an even flow of people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal of spectators on the terraces or
         viewing slopes;

         (b) patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarms or extinguishing fires;
         (c) manning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which are
         continuously open whilst the ground is in use;
         (d) assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control; and
         (e) undertaking specific duties in an emergency."
  The Interim Popplewell Report
     163. There was considerable controversy in the course of the public inquiry held by Mr Justice
  Popplewell in 1985 as to the responsibility of the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 of his interim report,
  Mr Justice Popplewell quoted from a report produced for the Minister of Housing and Local Government
  in 1969 as follows:-
    "The responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police and the club operating
  the ground. The broad line of division being that police are responsible for movement of spectators in
  public thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the
  control of spectators once they are on the club’s premises..."


                                                      35
  Mr Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observe that in practice the
  police have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph
  3.8):

    "It follows, therefore, that as a matter of practice, while the physical safety of the building and the
    maintenance and good housekeeping of the ground must always be the responsibility of the club, the
    police have to take the de facto responsibility of organising the crowd, with all that entails, during the
    game..."

  Mr Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation of the ground as a procedure in which only the police
  could bear the responsibility of supervising the organisation of the crowd.

  The Final Popplewell Report
     164. He harked back to this subject in chapter 4 of his Final Report. There, he came down more firmly
  in favour of holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said "Because, as a matter
  of practice, police officers have regularly attended in large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow
  been assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for control of what goes on inside the ground has passed
  from them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcement of law and order. Those
  responsible for organising a private function, however, have the primary and continuing obligation and
  responsibility to ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises." Mr Justice
  Popplewell ended that section as follows: "It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club, or
  the occupier of the ground who is putting on the function, that the primary and continuing obligation
  rests."
     165. There remains, however, the question whether there are some grounds or parts of grounds where
  the club may need to rely upon the police (whom they pay to attend) to control filling of pens and
  monitoring them for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the
  club, they may need, and by agreement be entitled, to employ the police to act as their agents in certain
  circumstances. This very difficult and grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed
  in greater depth at stage two of this Inquiry."

  Since Hillsborough was concerned with a disaster on the terraces, I headed that passage "Who should
monitor the terraces?". But the wider question is: who should control the entry of spectators, their placing
and movement whilst in the ground and their exit from it? It is undisputed that the club, as a matter of law,
has a duty to take reasonable care for the safety of the spectators invited to its premises. There have, however,
been two practical difficulties about the club, rather than the police, being de facto in charge.

  207. First, the club discharges its duty through stewards. They are part-time employees or assistants whose
duties are confined to match days. Many of them are seasoned supporters of the club and some tend to be
elderly: others are keen young supporters. Due either to age or youth, many therefore lack the physique to
cope with awkward customers. They are usually not well paid, part of their "remuneration" (indeed all of it at
some clubs) consisting of the opportunity to see the game. As the submission from the Association of Chief
Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland (ACPO) puts it"

  "(Stewards) are at best casual workers (usually working one day in two weeks), they are probably not people
  who have a supervisory role in ordinary life and are not always equipped or used to giving directions or
  facing obstruction. Many are retired people and pay is not so attractive as to guarantee commitment."

  Whilst there are exceptions, I have frequently been told that the stewards presently employed at many
clubs are of limited capacity and reliability.

  208. Secondly, there has to be a police presence at a match to maintain law and order. Police are trained to
give and enforce instructions. This, together with the uniform they wear and the respect for and fear of the
law which the majority of spectators have, gives the police far more authority than stewards. Moreover, if
trouble arises, whether from misbehaviour or from any other cause, the police will inevitably be drawn into
assuming control. They have all the means to do so at their disposal - the control room, the CCTV, the
planned deployment of serials of officers round the ground, a communications system to co-ordinate them
and reserves on call. The submission from ACPO suggests that in these circumstances, and to avoid
confusion, the police ought to accept prime responsibility for controlling the crowd. I quote two passages
from their argument:

                                                      36
 "It may be that the ambiguous position of the police is part of the problem - that is acknowledging the
 club’s responsibility for safety on the one hand, whilst routinely assuming all those tasks of stewarding
 which the stewards cannot do, either because of the truculence of supporters or the limited talents of the
 stewards themselves, on the other. It has to be said that the present lack of clarity in these arrangements can
 lead to something of a ’dog’s dinner’. In some clubs the police actively control the stewards, in others the
 stewards are quite independent and, despite some improvements, standards of stewarding vary
 considerably with many being too old or simply unreliable...
    ... It may be better to acknowledge that if trouble is anticipated or if crowd control is going to test the
 ground capacities then, in the interests of public safety, police should take control over the stewards
 through their supervisory chain".
   "As to the question of’responsibility’, the matter of civil liability should not cause us to resile from our
 decisions if they are necessary. Dual responsibility for safety is a recipe for confusion. The police are always
 going to seize the initiative in a crisis; crowd control is always going to be inextricably linked to criminal
 hooliganism: the police are never going to accept direction from stewards; stewarding will never (at least
 not in the foreseeable future) be able to cope without some law enforcement backup; and finally police do
 ’own’ most of the means of control. In these circumstances the police must accept a leading role and,
 despite the requirements and civil liabilities of football clubs, themselves take on supervision of the overall
 conduct of events wherever crowd safety is an issue."

  209. The question is one of balance. Carrying delegation to its ultimate, clubs could lean back and leave it
to the police to take over the management of spectators from street to terraces and back again, with stewards
performing a minimal role. This would involve a very heavy police commitment and indeed the
commitment at present is very substantial. As already indicated, some 5,000 officers or more are deployed
every Saturday at football matches.

Costs of Police and Stewards
   210. The temptation to the clubs to leave it all to the police is stronger if they are not required to make
realistic payment for police services. No charge is made for officers outside the ground since maintaining law
and order in the streets is a normal public function of the police. At the present time, the practice as to
recovering costs of policing inside the grounds from clubs varies greatly from place to place, different
formulae being used. In some areas, the charge made is the actual cost of the officers attending in the ground.
At others, it is made on a sliding scale dependent on whether the match is category A (high-risk) B or C. At
others it is dependent on the size of the crowd attending. At some, it appears to be entirely arbitrary and at
one ground it is said to be nil. In my view a more consistent and businesslike approach should be made to such
charges. If clubs were to find it more economical to recruit efficient stewards than to delegate duties to the
police, there could be a significant reduction in the number of police deployed at football grounds to the
benefit of the community at large. If this is to happen, stewards must be fit, active and robust. I would suggest
they should be between the ages of 18 and 55. They must also be fully trained. Some clubs presently have
efficient stewards whom they recruit individually and train fully with the assistance of the police. Others hire
security firms to bring in a well-trained team of stewards.

Division of Functions
  211. There are clearly many aspects of crowd control and management which are capable of being carried
out by efficient stewards. Manning gates, directing spectators to the correct areas and to their seats, keeping
gangways clear, monitoring the density of packing in pens or enclosures - indeed, the duties specified in
paragraph 195 of the Green Guide, as already quoted. At most grounds, and in most parts of each ground,
these duties ought to be capable of being performed by properly trained stewards. Where that is so, clubs
should require stewards to perform the duties and should not take the option of leaving all to the police.

  212. However, I accept that there may well be particular areas of a ground, perhaps on visitors’ terraces
and particularly at high-risk matches, which call for the greater authority and resilience of the police. What
the division of functions should be must be a matter for local decision and in the last resort for the Police
Commander to determine.

Written Statement of Intent
  213. I therefore repeat my recommendation that there should be a written document setting out the
respective functions of club and police for crowd safety and control "and in particular for the filling of each
self-contained pen or other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid


                                                      37
overcrowding." (Interim recommendation 4). The aim should be for the club through its stewards to perform
all those functions of controlling spectators of which they are capable having regard to the quality of the
stewards, the layout of the ground and the nature of the match. Where they are not able to discharge any such
function the police should perform it. As the proportion of seating at grounds increases, control by stewards
should become the norm.

  214. In making interim recommendation 4, I used the phrase "written agreement". This led to anxiety
that what was required was a binding legal contract which would deprive the police of any flexibility in
response to circumstances of the day. My intention was not to shackle either party by a binding contract; it
was simply to have a document setting out how functions were to be divided so that no misunderstanding
could arise whereby one party thought the other had undertaken some duty and vice versa. I am content that
the document be referred to simply as a "statement of intent", so that it can be subject to alteration without
breach of contract should circumstances so demand.

Police Commanders
  215. The ultimate control at any match must be that of the Police Commander. He has authority to decide
how many officers he needs and to deploy them in and outside the ground. He has, if necessary, to take such
decisions as to postpone kick-off, to stop the match, to evacuate the ground or any area of it. Police
Commanders tend to remain in post for lengthy periods. They thus acquire skill, experience and special
knowledge of the problems at their particular ground. However, there must come a time for change. It is then
essential for the new Commander to have adequate time and training to acquaint himself with his functions
and the problems of policing peculiar to the ground. Training for such functions should be the subject of a
specific course to be attended by senior officers presently acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do
so. Such a course would give induction training in the basic strategy of policing football matches and would also
give opportunity for the pooling of experience and the solution of common problems.

Rate of Admission
  216. An important causative factor at Hillsborough was the congestion which built up outside the
turnstiles in the last 20 minutes before kick-off. Twenty-three turnstiles were required to admit 24,256
spectators; only seven turnstiles were available to admit the 10,100 with tickets for the west terraces. Much
was made in evidence of the late arrival of the Liverpool fans. However, further evidence at stage two of the
Inquiry suggests that the late arrival of large numbers is a common feature at many grounds. Apart from
those wishing to drink as long as possible (whom I consider in chapter 6) there are many who do not care to
stand or even sit for a long period in addition to the 90 minutes of the match. Moreover, at all-ticket matches
or to those with tickets in seated areas, there seems little reason to arrive early since places are assured. The
absence of any attractive pre-match entertainment is a further disincentive to early arrival. Whilst measures
should be taken to encourage earlier entry to the ground, it is essential that turnstiles or other entrances can
cope safely and efficiently with spectators as and when they arrive. To do this requires sufficient turnstiles or
other entrances to admit, if necessary, a large late influx without dangerous congestion. That involves
assessing the rate of flow through turnstiles or gates and the time within which they should be capable of
admitting all the spectators they are intended to serve.

   217. I accept the view of the Technical Working Party that the Green Guide figure of 750 persons per hour
is too optimistic a turnstile flow-rate. It may be achieved or even bettered in ideal conditions. But as soon as
there is a build-up, the flow-rate will diminish. There are also delays caused by those with no tickets, those
with wrong tickets or other problems. I accept the recommendation that 660 should be the maximum notional
rate. The Green Guide should be amended accordingly.

  218. I repeat my interim recommendation that the turnstiles serving a discrete area should be capable of
admitting its holding capacity within one hour. Unless this can be done, there will be a risk of serious
congestion in the last half or quarter of an hour. If it cannot be done, the permitted capacity of the area must be
reduced accordingly. This recommendation relates to one of the crucial matters contained in the original section
2(2)(c)(i) of the 1975 Act and should therefore be a requirement of the Safety Certificate.

Communications
  219. The efficient deployment and co-ordination of police and stewards depend upon effective systems of
communication. Radio systems are susceptible to two problems; excessive air traffic on the channels in use
and the volume of noise from the crowd.

                                                         38
   220. If large numbers of officers are issued with radios and are all entitled to use the same channel,
confusion may result should a major incident occur. In such an event, many officers may wish to speak
simultaneously. Especially if the channel is used on "talk-through" (whereby all officers including those in
control give and receive messages without priority) the Commander in the police room may be unable
effectively to issue orders. Again, if the level of crowd noise is high, as it often is, an officer on the perimeter
track may have great difficulty in hearing messages. Although ear pieces are of some assistance, they are not
totally successful in excluding crowd noise and are not usually issued to every officer carrying a radio.

  221. Mr Justice Popplewell in his Interim Report recommended that "early attention should be given by
the Home Office Directorate of Telecommunications to consider the practicality of producing a more
suitable personal radio for the police". In his Final Report, he returned to the subject at paragraphs
4.102-104. By that time, he reported that "a detailed study is being commissioned by the Home Office
Directorate of Telecommunications into the problem of personal radios".
  222. The Directorate produced an upgraded specification. As a result, supplies of two new models have
been made available. They are the Philips PFX and the Motorola MT600E. These radios have greater range
and clarity than those previously used. They also give access to many more channels. To take advantage of
this, the police have been allocated eight additional UHF frequencies.
  223. Police Commanders have told me that, in addition to any other channel or channels in use, there
should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate with his senior
officers round the ground. This is of the first importance since it enables the Commander to use the
information coming to him in the control room to deploy his forces promptly and effectively at any part of
the ground without radio interruption. I recommend this should be done.

  224. As suggested by the Technical Working Party, I repeat the recommendations I made in my Interim
Report as to communications, with one exception. A sentence in one recommendation suggested that
"consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements." I am persuaded by evidence from the
police that the use of hand signals could create a risk of confusion and I do not therefore repeat that suggestion.

Other Topics in the Green Guide
  225. I have in this chapter considered specifically a number of key safety factors covered by the Green
Guide. I have suggested respects in which the Guide should be strengthened or amended. In addition to those
topics, the Technical Working Party considered a number of further aspects of safety - crush barriers, stands,
ingress and egress, stairways and ramps, inspections and testing, fire safety, emergency power and disabled
spectators. I accept and adopt the Technical Working Party’s Report and recommendations on those matters
(Appendix 3). Without repeating them in this text, I add only a few additional comments.
   226. As to crush barriers, paragraphs 25 to 28 of their report recommend a simpler and clearer test
procedure than that in the current Guide. In particular, the values to be achieved by way of percentage recovery
after the required loading test will depend upon the material from which the barrier is constructed eg concrete,
steel or wrought iron. When the Guide is revised, acceptable values for various materials should be specified.

   227. The Green Guide does, in paragraph 6 of Annex C, refer to the possibility of doubts arising as to the
safety of a barrier "for any reason (including such matters as cracking of the terracing or distortion of
connections)". It does not, however, presently make any special mention of the need to inspect crush barriers
for possible corrosion. The evidence from the Health and Safety Executive after their inspection of barriers
at Hillsborough suggests that corrosion is a serious threat to the safety of metal barriers. When the Green
Guide is revised, the need to inspect for possible corrosion should be specifically mentioned and emphasised.
Co-ordination of Emergency Services
   228. It is vital that adequate provision should be made for possible emergencies arising from fire or
accident and from illness or injuries however caused. I repeat the recommendations I made in my Interim
Report regarding co-ordination of the emergency services. In addition, although it is mentioned in paragraph
 176 of the Green Guide, I emphasise that "joint consultation between management, police, fire, ambulance
and other emergency services should take place in order to produce agreed plans of action for all foreseeable
types of emergency." Such plans should include, for example, contingency arrangements for admissions to
particular hospitals in the event of a number of casualties and consideration of possible casualty clearing
areas at the sports ground. Lines of communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from the police control
room to the local headquarters of all emergency services should be maintained at all times so that emergency
calls can be made instantly.


                                                        39
First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
   229. The scale of available medical facilities has been the subject of controversy. After Hillsborough, there
were complaints of insufficient basic equipment such as stretchers. I repeat what I said in my Interim Report
at paragraphs 298 and 299:-

  "298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium, medical facilities capable of dealing with
  a major disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
  equipment and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

   299. What is required is a basic level of provision for first aid, for professional medical attention and for
  ambulance attendance, together with a system of co-ordination with the emergency services which will
  bring them to the scene swiftly in whatever numbers are required. What will amount to an appropriate
  basic provision for the future eg the equipment in a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and advice".

  230. The Scottish ambulance service has developed a "major incident equipment vehicle" designed and
equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties. It is packed with 50 stretchers, blankets, and medical supplies and is
in effect a travelling storehouse for such equipment. A vehicle of that type is deployed in addition to other
ambulance attendance at matches with crowds over 25,000. This provision goes a long way towards meeting the
criticism raised after Hillsborough and I recommend that it be adopted elsewhere.

  231. I repeat the Interim Recommendations I made under this heading subject to two variations. First, it has
been sensibly urged that it is unreasonable to require a medical practitioner to be present throughout a match       .?
where attendance is very small. At such a match it is suggested that to have a medical practitioner on call
would be sufficient. I agree with this and recommend that the full-time presence of a doctor should not be
required where there is no reasonable expectation of more than 2,000 spectators attending.

  232. Secondly, some clubs have told me that they can secure private ambulance services more
economically than those from the appropriate ambulance authority. They accordingly wish to have freedom
to choose. I modify my Interim Recommendation in deference to this argument by requiring at least one fully
equipped ambulance from, or approved by, the appropriate ambulance authority should be in attendance at all
matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

Status of the Green Guide
   233. I have recommended that some safety factors covered by the Guide should be made mandatory
requirements in Safety Certificates. Those apart, I consider the Guide should remain a non-mandatory set of
guidelines. Sports grounds vary greatly in their layout and fixtures. It must be open to a local authority to
judge the propriety of deviating in some respect from the Green Guide recommendations at a particular
ground. However, I agree with the Technical Working Party that where there is a departure from a specific
 recommendation of the Guide, the local authority should be aware of it and should be satisfied that such
departure is justified for good reason.

Revision of the Green Guide
  234. Neither I nor the Technical Working Party have sought to revise or redrafi the specific wording of the
Guide. We have simply indicated where and to what effect it should be altered. Detailed consideration of the
revision must be for a suitably qualified body to be set up by the Home Office for the purpose. The Technical
Working Party, in addition to their report, have prepared detailed supplementary notes on some aspects of
the Guide which will be available and I am sure useful to those revising it. Accordingly, I recommend that the
Home Office set up a body to revise the Green Guide as a matter of urgency.

Sports Grounds Within Part III of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987
  235. This Part of the 1987 Act applies in relation to a sports ground which is not a designated sports
ground but which provides covered accommodation in stands for spectators. A Safety Certificate is required
where such a stand provides covered accommodation for 500 or more spectators. By section 27(1) the Safety
Certificate:-

  "shall contain such terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or expedient to secure
  reasonable safety in the stand when it is in use for viewing the specified activity or activities at the ground,
  and the terms and conditions may be such as to involve alterations or additions to the stand or any
  :installations in or serving the stand."


                                                        40
 236. These provisions apply to a variety of sports such as tennis, golf, horseracing, greyhound racing or
motor racing.

   237. I have received a number of complaints that local authorities, perhaps in response to Hillsborough,
have sought to apply the full rigour of my Interim Recommendations to sports grounds requiring a Safety
Certificate under these provisions, not being designated sports grounds under the 1975 Act. On occasion this
has been done without regard to the Green Guide or to Home Office guidance. Examples given are
requirements in relation to greyhound stadia regarding the presence of a medical practitioner, the size of a
first aid room, and capacity of parts of the stadium other than the covered stand itself.

  238. The Green Guide provides at paragraph 5 as follows:-

  "The Guide is intended to cover grounds where sporting events of all kinds are held and where the
  gathering of large crowds is likely to present a safety problem. However, much of the guidance has
  particular application to football stadia and this should be borne in mind when applying the Guide to
  grounds used for other sports and modifications may prove necessary, because the measures to meet
  problems of stadia used for association football may not always be necessary at other grounds used for
  other types of sports. For example, if a ground has no terraced or sloped viewing areas, crush barrier
  requirements are unlikely to be of concern".
  A similar approach is appropriate in relation to my Final Recommendations. They are essentially directed
towards designated sports grounds. Many are relevant to other sports grounds but will need to be applied
with due regard to the different circumstances at those other sports grounds.

  239. One appropriate function of the inspecting and reviewing body, which I propose should cover all
certificating and licensing of sports grounds, would be to ensure that recommendations in the Green Guide
and those made in this Report are applied sensibly across the varied range of sports grounds.
Sports Grounds Within Part IV of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987
   240. This Part of the 1987 Act relates to indoor sports licences. It introduced amendments to the
London Government Act 1963 and the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 requiring
a licence to be granted by the relevant local authority where premises are to be used for "any entertainment
which consists of any sporting event to which the public are invited as spectators" (a "sports
entertainment").
  241. Under this legislation, the relevant local authority:-

  "may grant to any applicant, and from time to time renew, a licence for the use of any premises specified
  in it for any sports entertainment on such terms and conditions and subject to such restrictions as may be
  so specified".

  242. I have received evidence from a number of bodies complaining that the procedure followed in
pursuance of these provisions often requires different applications to be made by different applicants for
different "sports entertainments" at the same premises. Apart from the expenditure of time and effort, such
multiple applications tend to be expensive to amateur sports organisations which are often impecunious. The
suggestion is made that a procedure should be available whereby a licence for a range of "sports
entertainments" at the same premises could be obtained by a single operator periodically. This matter
merits review by the appropriate authorities.

                 PART III - CROWD CONTROL AND HOOLIGANISM
                                                 CHAPTER 5
                                  POLICE PLANNING AND CONTROL

  243. The role of the police is crucial to crowd control. In my findings as to what happened at Hillsborough
and why, I criticised the police operation on the day and especially some senior officers. I did, however,
recognise that the South Yorkshire Police had a good record, that day apart, for handling difficult crowd
problems successfully. I also commended many junior officers for their efforts to rescue and assist those
crushed or trapped at Hillsborough.
  244. I should like here to pay tribute to police forces generally for their invaluable work in maintaining
order at sports events and especially in and outside football stadia, Saturday after Saturday. Without them,
sports events would be chaotic and indeed many could not be permitted to take place. Their service is often
thankless and not infrequently they are subjected to abuse and worse from those they are there to serve.
   245. They would be superhuman if on occasions they did not react, at any rate verbally, to the stress and
provocation they have to endure. This leads many fans to feel the police are against them. Moreover, it is
often difficult in the confusion of a crowded scene for firm police action against miscreants not to impinge ¯
also, or focus by mistake, on the innocent. The latter then feel aggrieved and others become aggrieved on
their behalf.
   246. It is therefore vital that police discipline and self-control be of the highest standard and that friendly
relations with supporters are cultivated. I know and have myself seen that this is achieved at many grounds.
But there are reports that, at some places, some police treat supporters, especially away supporters, with a
measure of contempt. When this happens it unfortunately sours the attitude of the supporters towards all
police,

  247. Accordingly, Police Commanders should in their briefings stress the need to balance firm control
with good humour and patience.

  248. As to the planning of police operations and the techniques to be considered, I repeat my interim
recommendations (numbers 6 and 26 to 30) which are now recommendations 16, 44 to 46, 49 and 51.

Police Control Room
   249. It is essential to efficient police operations that their control room inside the ground should be well
placed, of sufficient size and well equipped. A number I have seen have been very good. Some are too small,
however. There should be room for at least the Commander, his deputy and enough officers to man the radios,
telephones and CCTV screens. The room should leave space for others who may need from time to time to visit
the room eg other senior officers, club management or a member of the emergency services. The room should
command a good view of the whole pitch and of the spectator areas surrounding it. It should where necessary be
sound-proofed against excessive crowd noise. Failure to provide the police with a satisfactory control room is
misguided thrift.




                                                      42
                                               CHAPTER 6
                                                ALCOHOL

  250. There can be no doubt that excessive drinking by fans significantly aggravates problems of crowd
control. Because alcohol tends to remove inhibitions and self control, those who have drunk too much may
become aggressive and even violent especially when provoked. Short of this, however, alcohol can make fans
resistant to sensible and reasonable instructions, more impatient and less considerate of others. All of this
increases the problems for police and stewards in managing large numbers which is difficult enough even
with co-operation.

Legislation
   251, In Scotland, serious crowd misbehaviour, much of it drink-related, led to the appointment in 1976 of
the Working Group chaired by Mr Frank McElhone MP. The recommendations of his report were followed in
the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 which made it an offence to be in, or to attempt to enter, a
designated ground while in possession of alcohol or to be in, or to attempt to enter, the ground whilst drunk.
It also banned the possession of alcoholic liquor on public service vehicles carrying passengers to or from a
designated sporting event and by amendment this ban was extended to vehicles adapted to carry nine or
more passengers.

  252. I am in no doubt after discussions with senior Scottish police officers that this measure has greatly
reduced the problem of misbehaviour at Scottish football grounds. Sectarian violence still has to be
contained, especially at Rangers and Celtic matches. There is still trouble from the "new hooligan" groups,
known in Scotland as "casuals". But much of the misbehaviour of groups II and III in the Popplewell
classification has abated due to the firm enforcement of the 1980 Act by the Scottish police.

 253. In England and Wales this lead was followed in the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985
which made similar provisions.

  254. There is, however, an important difference between the Scottish provisions and those applying in
England and Wales. In Scotland, the ban on alcohol is absolute. No sales of alcoholic drink are permitted in
the ground. In England and Wales, section 3 of the 1985 Act permits Licensing Justices to grant exemption
from the ban on sales in the ground. This is subject to alcohol not being sold or consumed at any part of the
ground from which the sporting event may be directly viewed and to other conditions imposed by the
Justices. It is open to the Justices to revoke or vary an order and the police have power to shut down the sale
of alcohol at a particular event if they consider it would be detrimental to orderly conduct or safety.

Alcohol Sales in Grounds?
   255. It is against this background that I must consider the submission of the FA and others that sale of
alcoholic drink in football grounds should be generally permitted without need to obtain an exemption order.
The argument is that the ban on such sales does not prevent fans from drinking. It merely drives them to
drink in public houses until a short time before the match. They then arrive late, often inebriated and
truculent, thereby causing congestion and other problems at entrances. Far better, it is said, to make alcoholic
drink available at the ground so as to bring them in earlier. Since service of drink inside the ground is slow
and selling points are crowded it is argued that the visitor will be lucky to buy more than one round. He is
therefore unlikely to become drunk from drinking inside the ground.

  256. Ideally I accept that people attending a football match should be able to buy refreshments including
alcoholic drink just as they can at the theatre or other places of entertainment. I hope, in halcyon days ahead,
a better atmosphere at football grounds may justify bans being relaxed. I do not, however, think the present
time is ripe for such relaxation.

   257. I have mentioned the great improvement of crowd behaviour in Scotland where the ban is absolute
and has been in force now for nearly 10 years. No doubt other factors such as increased seating have played
their part in this. The improvement has been recognised by the Government, and is the main reason why the
Football Spectators Act 1989 has not been applied to Scotland. Thus Mr Moynihan, the Minister for Sport,
said on the Third Day of the Committee Stage (Official Report, column 83):


                                                     43
  "There has been a marked improvement in the behaviour of football crowds in Scotland, which is accepted
  by all parties and the Scottish Football Association. The Scottish Office is monitoring developments
  closely and.., it does not believe that it is necessary to legislate for a national membership scheme in
  Scotland. However, it will be able to take action in the future should the position deteriorate,.
   In England and Wales, the ban has had only four and a half years to operate and is watered down by the
availability of exemptions. Where it is thought appropriate, there is nothing to prevent clubs from applying
to their local justices for an exemption. There may regrettably be places where the local circumstances,
known to the justices, warrant refusal of an exemption. At many others, it will be granted as indeed it has
been already at a number of grounds.
  258. When such exemptions exist, there is no clear evidence to suggest that late arrivals are greatly
reduced. Indeed, the argument that no-one can get drunk in the ground because of the problems of getting
served or because only low alcohol beer is available, seems to me contradictory to the main argument. Those
who wish to drink full strength beer in quantity will not be much attracted by the service offered inside the
ground.

   259. In these circumstances I consider it would be a retrograde or at least premature step at this time to
restore a blanket licence to sell alcohol at designated sports events. I do not go so far as to suggest that the
total ban applicable in Scotland should be extended to England and Wales ie that no exemptions should be
available. But I do not believe it appropriate to relax the present restrictions.

  260. Are there other steps which could and should be taken to reduce problems from excessive drinking?

Arrests
  261. I have referred to the provision in Section 2 of the 1985 Act making it an offence to be in, or to
attempt to enter, a designated sports ground whilst drunk or in possession of intoxicating liquor. The impact
of these provisions clearly depends upon enforcement. Here again there is a contrast between Scotland and
England. In England, although arrests are made, there is a tendency to eject many offenders without arresting
them. In Scotland the police take a firm line. They do not eject offenders; they arrest them. The English
approach may partly be due to a commendable desire not to be seen as hostile to football spectators.
However, it is also a matter of expediency. Making an arrest requires the arresting officer to take the offender
to a police room and go through the prescribed procedure and paperwork. This takes the officer away from
his post for a minimum of a quarter of an hour. At some grounds (Hillsborough was one) evidence suggests a
much lengthier absence is common. Clearly, ifa serial of eight officers is posted to a bank of turnstiles, three
or four arrests may greatly reduce the team for a significant period. There is a tendency, therefore, to avoid
making arrests save in the worst cases. I do not wish to advocate repressive measures which would be counter
to all I have said about the need for a new attitude towards spectators. On the other hand, it cannot be a good
ground for declining to make an arrest that one cannot spare an officer to do it. I therefore recommend that
consideration be given to streamlining arrest procedures so as to divert an arresting officer from his post for
the minimum time. One method I have seen adopted is for the officer to give only basic details of the arrest
and be photographed with the offender before resuming his duties. He can then return after the match to
complete the documentation.

Closing Bars
  262. In some areas, bars in the vicinity of the ground are closed either throughout a match day or between
certain hours. This may be required by the Justices or it may be the result of agreement between police and
publicans. Such a measure may however have limited effect. To close the pubs in a radius of one or two miles
of the ground simply diverts drinkers to bars outside that range and may aggravate late arrival. Moreover,
beer from shops with off-licences probably accounts for as much pre-match drinking as that bought in bars.
This said, it may well be sensible to limit the availability of alcohol especially before a high-risk match. How
effective the measure can be depends on the locality. In London or other large cities it could have little
impact; in a more isolated town it could be very effective.

Early Kick-Offs
  263. Traditionally, kick-offat football matches has been at three o’clock. That may formerly have been to
accommodate those who worked on Saturday mornings. By another tradition, permitted hours in pubs led to
a recognised drinking period from mid-morning until three o’clock. The combination of these two traditions
often brings fans to a match with too much drink on board. There is therefore much to be said for an early
kick-off especially in a high-risk match. It gives less opportunity for prolonged drinking sessions immediately


                                                     44
before the game. A mid-day kick-offgives time for away supporters to reach the ground but less time for early
arrivals to kick their heels and lift their elbows in bars.
  264. It is true that an early kick-off will discharge the fans earlier at the end of the match. Some anxiety
has been expressed as to whether drunkenness avoided before and during the match may have more hours to
build up after the game causing problems for the police and the local community in the evening. This could
be so, but there are two moderating factors. First, drunken behaviour in the town, although a problem for the
police, is less likely to cause serious danger to many people than at a match where it may be compounded by
excitement, partisanship and incidents of the game and where large numbers are in a confined space.
Secondly, the segregation exercise often results in the bulk of away supporters being escorted back to their
road or rail transport as soon as the match is over rather than lingering in the town.
Sunday Matches
  265. Sunday matches ought also to be a considered option. On a Sunday, there is less traffic, especially
commercial traffic, to compete with those arriving for the match. Arrival, parking and departure are
therefore easier for them in private coaches and cars. It is true that public transport generally on a Sunday is
less plentiful but special arrangements are often made for major events. Again, bars and indeed many places
of entertainment being closed on Sundays, there is less incentive to have a night on the town after a Sunday
game.

                                                CHAPTER 7

                                          TICKETS AND TOUTS
Information on Tickets and Signs
   266. It is vital to good crowd control that those attending a sports event should have clear directions where
to go. It makes for confusion and hence added problems for stewards and police if spectators are milling
about looking for their appropriate entrances. The congestion at Hillsborough was aggravated by poor
information on the tickets and poor signposting outside and inside the turnstiles. I therefore repeat my
recommendations that tickets and signs should provide simple, clear and consistent information to
spectators.
  267. All available measures should be taken in the printing of tickets to prevent forgeries being produced.
Computer Record of Tickets
   268. It would greatly help to defeat forgery and theft of tickets as well as assisting in the apprehension of
those misbehaving in the ground, if clubs maintained a record on computer of ticket sales. This is done in
Italy where season tickets and tickets for all-ticket matches in seated areas are numbered and a record is
maintained of the names and addresses of purchasers. Such information is of great value to the police in
identifying forgeries and tracing offenders. Clearly, season tickets for seats could be made attractive if
favourable terms were offered (especially to young supporters). This would enable the authorities to know for
a whole season who was occupying a particular seat. As seating accommodation increases this would give
greater information and control.
Fans Without Tickets
   269. One problem which creates difficulties for the police is the arrival of would-be spectators without
tickets at an all-ticket match. Although I found there was not a large body of such fans at Hillsborough there
undoubtedly were some. At other matches the numbers have not only been large; they have been determined
to gain entrance by one means or another. If they could not acquire tickets at the ground they have created so
much trouble that the police have judged it best to let them in. Sometimes this has been for payment; on
occasions, even free. The rationale has been that it is better to have troublemakers inside the ground where
they can be monitored than roaming round the town at large. Obviously, the practice of admitting fans
without tickets has a bad knock-on effect. Bands of fans unable to get tickets believe that if they turn up and
create sufficient clamour the police will admit them.
Police Policy
  270. This must not be allowed to continue. It is intolerable that those with no tickets should be able to
blackmail their way into a ground. "If you don’t let us in we’ll force the gates or wreck your town", is not a
threat to which a police force should submit. The policy of admitting such people is also unfair to those who
have taken the trouble and spent money to buy tickets. It further involves, at a capacity match, letting in fans
for whom there may be insufficient space. It may also create problems of segregation. Above all, it is allowing
the mob to rule.
   271. True, I held that in the crisis which developed at the Leppings Lane turnstiles on 15 April 1989,
opening gate C was justified since life would otherwise have been at risk outside the ground. However, that
was a matter of life and death. It arose because of inadequate facilities and inadequate crowd control. I would
hope such a situation will never recur. If anything like it should recur, preservation of life must clearly be
paramount. But when the police have an option to let fans without tickets in or keep them out, their policy
must clearly be to exclude them. Unless that rule is firmly and universally applied and known the problem
will grow.
All-ticket Matches
   272. All the evidence I have received suggests that great caution should be exercised before making a
match all-ticket. To do so can assist in achieving segregation. In general, it should however be done only
where a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected. There should then be little difficulty in selling all the
tickets in advance. The point of making such a match all-ticket is to prevent the arrival of greater numbers
than the ground can accommodate. However, ifa less popular match is made all-ticket, it may turn out that
only a modest proportion of the tickets is sold in advance. If then fans arrive without tickets, they will be
aggrieved at being turned away when there is space available. Moreover, the club will be tempted to give in to
them and sell tickets on the day. This discredits the all-ticket policy and may cause breaches of the
segregation strategy. I therefore recommend that all-ticket matches should be confined to those at which a
capacity or near capacity crowd is expected and that, having so designated them, clubs maintain a firm policy of
not selling tickets at the match.

                                                      46
Touts
  273. The recommendations in the last two paragraphs are designed to deter those without tickets from
turning up at matches and so obviating any trouble they may be tempted to cause. However, many fans
without tickets turn up at the ground in the hope of buying them from touts.
   274. During my visits to sports grounds I have found universal condemnation of touts by all involved in
organising and managing large stadium events. Apart from the obstruction they themselves cause, touts
attract fans without tickets to attend at grounds in the hope of getting in. Moreover, they sell tickets to all
comers regardless of their allegiance. Thus tickets for the home area at a soccer match fall into the hands of
away supporters and vice versa. The result is to frustrate the efforts of clubs and police to achieve peaceful
segregation. Pockets of alien affiliation planted amongst home supporters form a focus for hostility and often
violence results. Apart from these objections, voiced by the FA, the FL, the police and the clubs, most
supporters also detest touts because they often corner the market for a popular match and offer tickets at
grossly excessive prices.
   275. From all these quarters the plea is to take positive action against ticket touts at football matches.
I am mindful of the need for caution before advocating a law limiting liberty to conduct oneself and one’s
business freely and according to established practice. I likewise accept that market forces should, in general,
operate freely in the commercial field. Nevertheless, I am satisfied from what I have read, heard and seen
that outside football grounds the presence and activities of touts have a grossly anti-social effect leading both
directly and indirectly to disorder. Directly, through obstruction and the attraction of numbers without
tickets. Indirectly, because of trouble from those so attracted who, in the end, cannot or do not buy tickets
and from those who buy their way into an opposition enclave.
   276. Touts operate, of course, at places other than football grounds. They are to be found, for example, at
national rugby stadia, at the All England Lawn Tennis Club at Wimbledon and at countless other sporting
events. Depending on how one defines "touting", the activity could include selling unwanted tickets for the
opera, the theatre or concert halls. Touting usually means, however, not just selling at face value a ticket you
cannot use, but selling numbers of tickets at an inflated price as a commercial venture. There is a clear
distinction between the impact of touting at football grounds and elsewhere. Football is the only sport at
which segregation is practised to prevent violence. This is because it is the sport where violence inside and
outside the ground is, at present, most prevalent. There are therefore strong grounds for regarding football as
a special case as the Government has recognised by promoting the Football Spectators Act.
  277. Whatever the policy merits of freedom to trade and market forces, they must surely yield to the
maintenance of safety and the prevention of disorder. Touts at football matches put both at risk. At other
sports and in other leisure fields the tout does not endanger safety or order to the same extent. Accordingly,
whatever view one takes of him, he can be left to ply his trade there. But so far as football is concerned, in my
view touting should be made unlawful. The fast buck should stop here.
  278. At present, police can deal with touts only by somewhat strained and stretched use of existing laws.
They arrest them for obstruction even if the physical obstruction caused is minimal. Alternatively, they make
an arrest on the grounds that they suspect the tout of carrying forged tickets, although the suspicion of forgery
may merely be convenient conjecture. After holding the tout during the match the police release him and the
now valueless but genuine tickets are returned to him. Growing wise to this, many touts now carry only two or
three tickets at a time, relying on a runner to bring up more from a "banker" standing off with perhaps
hundreds of tickets in his possession. If the salesman is arrested the merchandise is not all lost. Police should
not have to stretch the law to deal with a public mischief. There should be a specific prohibition which police
can then enforce.
   279. How to formulate a prohibition against touting at football grounds will require careful consideration
and drafting. It could be made an offence to sell tickets for and on the day of a football match without
authority from the home club to do so. Another way would be to prohibit such sales within a specified radius
of the ground on the day of the match. Yet another would be to prohibit sales of tickets for a football match at
more than face value. This third alternative would permit any genuine purchaser of a ticket who found he
could not use it to recoup his outlay by selling his ticket outside the match. Its disadvantage would be the
difficulty of proving a tout had sold at more than face value; ways would also be devised to evade the
prohibition. I tend to favour the first alternative which is simple and capable of easy proof. The genuine
ticket holder, finding himself unable on the day to use his ticket, and not permitted to sell it outside the
ground, should be permitted to return it to the club and recover his money. Clubs should be prepared to
accept such tickets in the interests of fairness and of having a law which defeats touts. If touting outside the
ground is banned, fans with no tickets for an all-ticket match could have no excuse for turning up outside
hoping to get in.

                             POLICE STRATEGIES AGAINST HOOLIGANS

Cautious Optimism
  280. I turn now to ways of curbing misbehaviour and dealing with hooligans. At the outset, I must record
that there are grounds for cautious optimism about misbehaviour inside football grounds although the same
cannot be said ofbehaviour outside and en route. Evidence I have received from various police forces, from
ACPO, from the football authorities and from the clubs suggests that measures taken in the last couple of
years have reduced incidents of violent misbehaviour inside grounds. Also, for the first time for decades,
there has been a small but steady increase in attendances at matches in each of the last three years. This has
occurred despite reductions in capacity. It is attributed by police and football authorities and by supporters’
organisations to greater confidence by the decent majority of spectators that violence in the ground is under
control.

  281. These welcome signs must be seen in perspective. Disorder in the ground has been, for the most part,
controlled not eliminated. There have stil! been occasional outbursts of violence in recent months. All that
can be said with confidence is that the police are now much better equipped and informed to deal with
hooligans than they were three years ago and their operations have been more successful in controlling
disorder.

CCTV
  282. In particular, the installation of CCTV has greatly improved police surveillance of the crowd both
inside the ground and at the turnstiles.

   283. In 1985, after the Bradford Disaster, the Football Trust made funds available to install CCTV at all
first and second division football grounds. Unfortunately, the systems initially installed, although the best
available at the time, proved to be of inadequate quality for identification purposes. Moreover, operators
initially lacked the training and expertise necessary to make effective use of the equipment.

  284. A number of clubs now have better equipment and most of the remainder of the 92 clubs in the
League have applied to the Football Trust for funding to enable them to do likewise. The Football Trust, not
unnaturally, wish to be sure the money will be well spent. They have therefore asked that an agreed
specification should be laid down as to the quality of the CCTV to be installed. ACPO hope to provide this as
soon as possible.

  285. In the two years ending June 1989, about 200 operators were trained in the use of CCTV at matches.
A training video is also available to all police forces.

  286. Already, CCTV has had a major impact on the hooligan problem inside football grounds as well as
proving extremely useful to monitor safety measures. If any trouble appears on the screen or is reported from
any quarter of the ground, the CCTV can zoom in on the incident. The police can then record what occurs on
colour video and on hard copy prints. Individuals can be picked out by facial appearance and the colour of
their clothing. The evidential effect of such a video recording has proved formidable. It has persuaded
hooligans, who would previously have sought to challenge oral evidence of identification, to plead guilty.
Hooligans know cameras are keeping a roving watch and their activities in the ground are inhibited by that
knowledge. Police evidence suggest that as a result of CCTV surveillance and the police strategies it
facilitates, the more committed hooligans now concentrate their activities outside the ground, attacking
opposing fans on their way to or from matches.

National Football Intelligence Unit
   287. ACPO have for some years encouraged the development of an intelligence network nationwide. A
national index of football liaison officers was set up to collect, record and pass on information about the
behaviour, past and anticipated, of club supporters, especially the hooligan element. Thus, before a match,
the police responsible for it can receive information from the football liaison officer in the visiting club’s area
as to the propensities of the visiting supporters and any known plans any element among them may have.
Although this scheme has proved useful, the need was recognised for a central unit equipped with a computer
to gather, record and disseminate intelligence. ACPO, in their written submission, say:-


                                                      48
       "Hooligan gangs operate across a wide area and may of course be involved in criminal escapades in any
       town between their point of departure and the venue of the fixture. Furthermore, in recent times there is
       good evidence that they will often plan criminal violence which has nothing whatever to do with football.
       There is a need to overview such events to identify patterns and recognise what is behind seemingly
       unconnected events."
        288. The National Football Intelligence Unit has now been set up. It is based in London; staffare in post;
     the Unit is being funded by the Home Office. It is hoped the computer will be installed shortly. The Unit will
     then be of great value in dealing not only with domestic football-related crime but also with hooligans
     travelling to matches abroad.

                                                   CHAPTER 9

                                       OFFENCES IN THE GROUND
   289. Although incidents of physical violence inside grounds are now much fewer, there remains an
undercurrent of unruly behaviour which can and occasionally does result in disorder. Three activities in
particular have this potential: (i) throwing coins and other missiles (ii) chanting obscene or racialist abuse
(iii) going onto the pitch without reasonable excuse.

    i.   There can be no possible excuse for hurling missiles at a sports ground. It is not only dangerous in
         itself. It may and often does incite others to do likewise; that may and often does provoke retaliation.
         Violence may then escalate.
    ii. No-one could expect that verbal exchanges on the terraces would be as polite as those at a vicarage
         tea party. But shouting or chanting gross obscenities or racialist abuse ought not to be permitted. If
         one starts, others join in, and to the majority of reasonable supporters, as well as to those abused, the
         sound of such chants from numbers in unison is offensive and provocative.
    iii. Running on the pitch often provokes and is the prelude to disorder. This is not just because it
         interrupts the game or because it invades the hallowed turf. It is often done with the intention of
         attacking someone. Even if the invasion is not with intent to attack the referee, a player or opposing
         fans, it tempts others to follow suit. If rival fans come onto the pitch violence will probably break
         out. Even if they do not, there may well be violent exchanges with police seeking to repel the
         invaders. A fan may run onto the pitch merely to congratulate a goal scorer. But his action could well
         provoke opposing fans (displeased by the goal anyway) to invade the pitch with less benign intent.
  290. Ought not these activities therefore to be made criminal offences? This has been raised before. Mr
Justice Popplewell considered the same three activities. After discussing whether they should be made
separate offences, he concluded, on analogy with the Scottish "breach of the peace", that a simple offence of
disorderly conduct at a sports ground would sweep up not only the three activities mentioned above but other
disorderly activities too. He concluded, at paragraph 4.74 of his Final Report, as follows:
  "4.74 Quite clearly a new offence in England and Wales of disorderly conduct or breach of the peace on
  the lines of the Scottish common law offence, would be of substantial assistance in dealing with
  hooliganism. It would avoid the problem of trying to define all the different types ofbehaviour which give
  rise to disorder at football matches and would undoubtedly enable the police to take action much earlier
  than they can under the present law. This offence should be confined to sports grounds where the
  disorderly conduct is likely to have such a devastating effect on crowd safety. Disorderly conduct would
  clearly include throwing a missile, running onto the pitch, seeking to climb over or to pull down a perimeter
  fence; shining a mirror towards a batsman, throwing bottles or cans onto the field of play, or interfering
  with a greyhound or horse race. I suggest that it should be triable summarily and there should be a power of
  arrest. I recommend, therefore, that consideration should be given to creating an offence of disorderly
  conduct at a sports ground."
  291. This recommendation was not taken up. At the time Mr Justice Popplewell reported, the Public Order
Act 1986 was in preparation. It created new offences relating to public order but none specifically related to
conduct inside sports grounds. Evidence from the Home Office gives two reasons for this. First, it was thought
wrong in principle to treat football or sports grounds as a special case. Secondly, it was apparently thought that
the provisions of the 1986 Act, especially section 5, sufficiently covered the field.
  292. As to the first reason, one must surely look at the nature of the mischief. The three specified activities
would, of course, be an anti-social nuisance anywhere. But at a designated sports ground they are fraught
with potential disorderly consequences. There is good reason therefore to treat as a special case the
prohibition of these activities at such grounds. By analogy, having alcohol in one’s blood over a fixed limit
has been made an offence only in relation to driving, because it is dangerous to the public in that special
context.
  293. The second reason requires an examination of sections 4(1) and 5(1) of the 1986 Act. So far as is
relevant, these provide as follows:-
  "4(1) A person is guilty of an offence if he -
     (a) uses towards another person threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour...

                                                       50
        with intent to cause that person to believe that immediate unlawful violence will be used against him
        or another by any person, or to provoke the immediate use of unlawful violence by that person or
        another, or whereby that person is likely to believe that such violence will be used or it is likely that
        such violence will be provoked...
  5(1 ) A person is guilty of an offence if he -
   (a) uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour...
        within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby".
  294. Throwing missiles could only be caught under section 5 as "disorderly behaviour" if the additional
element were proved that it was "within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm
or distress thereby". To adduce evidence of this last element may be very difficult indeed. It should surely be
sufficient to show that the accused threw a missile at a football match.
  295. As to obscene or racialist chanting similar difficulties arise¯ Although the chanting may be proved
abusive or insulting it would also have to be shown, under section 4, that it was used "towards another person
¯.. with intent to cause that person to believe that immediate unlawful violence will be used against him etc".
Proof of those elements may not be possible.
  296. Under section 5, whilst again the chanting may be proved to have contained "abusive or insulting
words", it may be difficult to show that this was done "within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be
caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby". The words may cause nothing other than disgust.
  297. Nor does section 18 of the Act help. Under the heading "Acts intended or likely to stir up racial
hatred", the section provides as follows so far as is relevant:-
  "18(1) A person who uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour.., is guilty of an offence
  if-
    (a) he intends thereby to stir up racial hatred, or
    (b) having regard to all the circumstances racial hatred is likely to be stirred up thereby".
  298. Racialist abuse of the kind chanted at football matches is probably not intended to stir up racial
hatred. Nor could it readily be proved that racial hatred was likely to be stirred up. The effect of such
chanting is to give cheap and ignoble amusement to those participating whilst causing offence and
embarrassment to those abused and to the decent majority of fans.
   299. For these reasons, I do not consider that the activities which Mr Justice Popplewell concluded should
be the subject of a criminal offence are covered by the 1986 Act. He set out the arguments for and against
legislation to prohibit them at paragraphs 4.42 to 4.74 ofhis Final Report. I do not rehearse those arguments.
I agree with his conclusion that on balance, despite the difficulties of drafting and enforcement, these
activities should be prohibited. Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that a "catch-all" offence of disorderly
conduct at a sports ground should be considered. I appreciate the force of his reasoning. However, I would
prefer to see separate offences in respect of each of the three activities I have mentioned. The object of the
legislation must be not merely to prosecute offences when they occur but to deter them. If there is a specific
offence of throwing missiles at a designated sports ground, a separate specific offence of chanting obscene or
racialist abuse there and a third specific offence of going on the pitch without reasonable excuse there and, if
full publicity is given to the legislation, hooligans will know precisely what is prohibited and that they do
those things at their peril.
  300. As to going on the pitch, I have a reason for recommending prohibition additional to those which
convinced Mr Justice Popplewell. I have recommended lowering the level offences and removing spikes and
overhanging sections. That relaxation is made in the interests of the decent majority of supporters who have
no yen to invade the pitch. To back up the lesser deterrent effect of lower fences I think it prudent to have a
criminal sanction against pitch invasion.
   301. I appreciate that at some sports grounds there is a tradition of running onto the pitch when the game
is over simply from joie de vivre or to pat players on the back. At Murrayfield, for example, schoolboys sit on
forms on the pitch side of the perimeter fencing and run on harmlessly at the end of the game. Again, going
onto the pitch to escape some hazard on the terraces in an emergency should, of course, be legitimate.
Accordingly, the offence should be aimed at prohibiting invasion of the pitch without good reason or
reasonable excuse. The police will in this as in many other situations have to exercise sensible discretion and
judgment.

                                               CHAPTER 10
                              CLUB STRATEGIES AGAINST HOOLIGANS
  302. Various club schemes to exclude hooligans have been undertaken or suggested.

Luton
  303. In March 1985, Millwall visited Luton with a large contingent of"supporters". Widespread disorder
broke out causing injuries to both fans and police. Serious damage was also done in and outside the ground as
well as to trains returning to London.

  304. Following this episode, Luton FC decided to adopt a Home Only Supporters Scheme excluding away
supporters and allowing only Luton members and their guests to attend matches. I am grateful to the
management of Luton FC and to the Bedfordshire police who explained to me the history, operation and
merits of this scheme.

   305. Applicants for membership normally reside within 25 miles of Luton. Those further away must
justify why they wish to join. A membership card entitles the member to buy a ticket for entry, either in
 advance or on the day, and to bring in with him up to three guests. The card has a bar-coding and must be
 presented to obtain a ticket in advance. To buy a ticket on the day, the card is "swiped" through a
computerised reader by the member at an outer set of turnstiles at the Kenilworth Road end of the ground.
 Payment for a ticket is then made at another inner set of turnstiles. Those members who misbehave are
 deprived of membership. A banned list is maintained on the computer. It consisted, at the time I received
 evidence, of only six names. If entry is attempted by using a banned card, a red light shows and the turnstile
 will not open. A steward then escorts the holder to an office outside the turnstiles where the problem is
 investigated.

  306. The scheme started in August 1986. The equipment installed initially proved unsatisfactory. Some of
the problems were: failure through condensation, delay whilst the reader checked the card’s validity, and the
fact that a Barclaycard could do the trick. After a number of attempts at rectification, this equipment was
abandoned and a different firm of suppliers was engaged. I should mention that equipment from the first
source was installed at Plymouth where it also failed after a number of attempts and the experiment was not
pursued further.

   307. The second system at Luton has proved effective after some teething troubles. It has been working
satisfactorily now for nearly two seasons.

Benefits of the Scheme
  308. Both the club and the police are happy with the effects of the scheme. The exclusion of away
supporters naturally excludes the hooligan element which they would have included. But it also removes the
focus for the aggression of any home hooligans. With no visitors to attack or bait, it is said that the hooligan
elements in Luton have faded away. They have not sought to join the scheme, nor do they seem to travel to
away games. The town has also benefitted. Shops which previously had to board up their windows now enjoy
a peaceful Saturday trade which has increased by 40%. Arrests at matches have dropped from over 100 per
season before the scheme to nil. Police costs have been greatly reduced. The club accepts that initially there
was a fall in attendances, but claims they are rising again. In 1985/6, average attendance was 11,100, in
1986/7 itwas 10,300, in 1987/8 itwas 8,038 andin 1988/9 itwas 10,039.

  309. The list of benefits is impressive and there can be no doubt that the scheme has been a success for
Luton. But would it be successful elsewhere?

  310. Luton is, in the football context, somewhat isolated geographically from other clubs, their fans and
their catchment areas. In this, its situation differs greatly from, for example, London clubs or those on
Merseyside, Greater Manchester or the Midlands. Hence the assumption that those within 25 miles of Luton
are likely to be natural Luton supporters. Luton also differs from clubs in the larger conurbations by size of
crowds, their average numbers being only about one-quarter of those at large clubs. The banned list is tiny. An
important feature of the Luton scheme is the use of outer and inner turnstiles for which the ground has ample
room. Many other grounds do not.


                                                      52
  311. At Luton, the card-holder himself "swipes" his card through. The club and the police acknowledge
that, if the card had to be passed to a turnstile operator to "swipe" it through, entry would be considerably
retarded. They also accept that the essential feature of Luton’s success has been the ban on away supporters
rather than the membership card scheme itself.

Ban All Away Supporters?
  312. If this is the touchstone of success in eliminating hooliganism, why not introduce it generally and
have no away supporters at any football matches nationwide? This has been considered before and rejected.
Mr Justice Popplewell in his Interim Report recommended that:

  "Urgent consideration should be given to introducing a membership system in England and Wales so as to
  exclude visiting fans".

  However, in his Final Report he modified this and recommended that:

  "Consideration should continue to be given to some form of membership scheme for Football League
  clubs in England and Wales".

  313. Clearly the Government has rejected the idea of a ban on all away supporters which forms no part of
the scheme of the Football Spectators Act 1989.

  314. To exclude all away support would be a draconian step. It would halve the number of matches fans
could attend. It would seriously diminish clubs’ revenue and deprive football grounds of a healthy
atmosphere of rivalry, which some say is a casualty of the Luton scheme. But perhaps the conclusive point is
that it would be impractical and possibly counter-productive in the campaign against hooliganism.

  315. To exclude away supporters from Luton is one thing. Those excluded can at least go at present to any
other match instead. But to exclude all away supporters from all matches and especially to exclude them from
"local derby" matches or matches in large cities could cause serious disorder. If Manchester City supporters
could not go to Old Trafford when their team plays there, or Chelsea supporters follow their team to
Highbury or to their neighbours Queen’s Park Rangers, trouble could result. There would be attempts and
devices to defeat the scheme and get into the ground in defiance of it. There could well be disorder outside
grounds. The more fanatical supporters and the hooligans would be unlikely to stay home and play patience.

Away Members Only
  316. There is a halfway house between freedom for all comers and a ban on all away supporters. This is to
make entry to sections of the ground for away supporters by ticket only; tickets to be allocated strictly to
members of the away team’s travel club and no tickets to be available on the day of the match. This scheme
builds on an existing practice adopted at some grounds for key matches, for example the Liverpool v Arsenal
match in May 1989 to decide the championship. It also builds upon existing club membership schemes.
Most clubs have a club membership scheme of some sort following an agreement between the football
authorities and the Government in February 1987, whereby all clubs were to introduce schemes covering at
least 50% of each ground’s capacity by the beginning of the 1987/8 season. Compliance was patchy and
varied from a membership of over 40,000 at Manchester United to one or two clubs which did nothing at all.

   317. The away members only solution encourages the promotion of membership schemes offering
discounts, favourable travel facilities and other benefits. It aims to limit away supporters to those, in effect,
vouched for by the away club. Misbehaviour would result in loss of membership and thus exclusion from
future away matches as well as loss of other membership privileges. The scheme has the unanimous approval
of the 48 third and fourth division clubs, given at their annual general meeting in June 1989.

    318. As with any proposed solution to the hooligan problem, this scheme cannot be watertight. It has to be
 recognised that any membership scheme is vulnerable to abuse arising from the loss or theft of cards and
 from the determined activities of those who, for whatever reason, do not possess them. The away members
 only scheme does at least hold out good prospects of improving behaviour in the away supporters’ enclosure
 since only those vetted by the away club will be allocated tickets there. That may deter others from travelling
 but there may still be some who are determined to travel and get in. On occasion, the FA has ordered that a
 club’s supporters having a bad record for causing disorder can be admitted at away matches only if they are
 accredited members of their own club. Leeds United is an example. This has, on the whole, proved beneficial.
 However, on occasions, Leeds non-member supporters - perhaps those living near the ground Leeds United


                                                      53
are due to visit - manage to get tickets intended for home supporters at or from the ground. They then get
into the wrong end and cause trouble. This seems to be what happened at Ayresome Park on 9 December
1989. Much therefore depends upon the care and scrutiny given to ticket allocation by the home club. Often
it is too easy for segregation plans to be thwarted by ready availability to all of tickets from the home club
whether at the box office or even by credit card over the telephone. I appreciate the difficulty of identifying
surely home and away supporters but clubs should review their procedures with a view to tightening them.

  319. Despite its imperfections, I consider the away members only solution has some merit both in
excluding undesirables from away supporters’ enclosures and in encouraging the growth of club membership
schemes conferring real benefits on members. It should be given further consideration.




                                                      54
                                               CHAPTER 11

                      OTHER POSSIBLE MEASURES AGAINST HOOLIGANS

Exclusion Orders
   320. At present, pursuant to Part IV of the Public Order Act 1986, a court, on convicting a person of an
offence connected with football has power, in addition to imposing a sentence, making a probation order or
discharging him, to make an exclusion order prohibiting him from entering premises to attend any football
match. The exclusion order must be for not less than three months. Ifa breach is proved, the offender is liable
to imprisonment for one month, to a fine or to both.

  321. This provision has not made much impact. It has not been greatly used by the courts. When orders
have been made they have tended to be for too short a period. On one occasion, absurdly, Justices imposed a
three month exclusion order on an offender appearing before them in May! A great weakness of a bare
exclusion order is the difficulty of discovering whether it is being obeyed or flouted.

  322. By section 27(5) of the Football Spectators Act 1989, the provisions of the Public Order Act 1986
relating to exclusion orders shall cease to have effect when the Secretary of State, by Statutory Instrument,
brings the 1989 Act into effect. So exclusion orders will go, to be replaced by expulsion from the national
membership scheme under Part I of the 1989 Act and restriction orders under Part II, as I shall explain in the
next Chapter.

Enforcing Exclusion by Attendance Centre Order
   323. Were exclusion orders to be retained and used more realistically there are two additional measures
which could be taken to enforce them. First, there could be provision for attaching to an exclusion order a
requirement to attend at an appointed centre on the occasions of designated football matches. Failure to
attend would immediately be detected and would render the absentee liable to further penalties including
imprisonment.

  324. Such a measure would have a number of merits. A mere ban on entering grounds may be flouted
without detection and in any event does not ban presence near the ground. An attendance centre order would
provide a means not merely to ban a hooligan from entry to a ground but to keep him physically from going
there. He would thus be prevented from causing trouble outside or near the ground as well as inside it. This
would be achieved without adding to the prison population, unless he defaulted, and without any elaborate
scheme impinging on spectators generally. The provision would be the logical counterpart in the domestic
scene to the provisions of Part II of the 1989 Act relating to foreign matches.

Is it Practicable?
   325. I appreciate that detaining convicted hooligans during designated matches in the domestic football
programme is a bigger undertaking and would impose a more restrictive penalty than requiring them merely
to report on the occasions of English matches abroad. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the present
structure of attendance centres, what extension of it might be necessary, the resource implications and the
fairness of such a measure.

Attendance Centres
  326. At present section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 empowers courts to make attendance centre
orders for young people under 21 who:

    (a) have been convicted of an imprisonable offence;

    (b) have defaulted on payment of their fines etc; or

    (c) have failed to comply with the requirements of a probation or supervision order.

  Attendance centre orders may not be used for those who have previously been given a custodial sentence
except in special (undefined) circumstances. The minimum length of an order is 12 hours, except for those
under 14. The maximum is 24 hours under 17, and 36 hours for those aged 17 to 20.


                                                     55
  327. At present there are 137 centres: 111 junior centres for those aged under 17, and 26 senior centres for
those aged 17 to 20 (males only). The senior centres are, for the most part, in the larger conurbations. The
Home Office has recently reviewed the use of the junior centres and some with low attendance figures are
being closed.

  328. Most centres are in school premises. They are normally open for 2 (junior) or 3 (senior) hours every
other Saturday, usually, but not invariably, in the afternoon. Each centre is staffed by an officer in charge,
normally an off-duty or retired police officer, assisted by other instructors. Regimes include physical
education and at least one other activity.

  329. Subject to these factors, attendance centre orders can be made at present against those convicted of
football related offences. They cannot however be imposed on anyone over 21, or anyone who has had a
custodial sentence.

  330. Effectively to exclude the offender from football grounds, it would be necessary to have the centre
open at least on every Saturday afternoon during the season. To try to include week-day evening matches
would create difficulties in making centres available and might be thought too oppressive on the offender. If
power to make orders were extended to cover those over 21 and those who have served a custodial sentence,
the centre would have to provide for a more challenging type of offender. It would probably be thought
inappropriate to mix 17 to 20 year old attenders with more hardened hooligans.

Resource Implications
  331. Such an extension would probably involve an increase in the number and calibre of staff. Presently,
as indicated earlier, staff include retired and off-duty police officers. More such personnel would be required.
However, such increases might be modest in comparison with the police resources likely to be required to
implement the national membership scheme (see paragraphs 420 to 423 infra).

Fairness
  332. I would not suggest that the imposition of an attendance order should be a mandatory
accompaniment to an exclusion order. It would be a discretionary power available to the courts to be used in
accordance with the same criteria as apply in Part II of the 1989 Act, ie no such order could be made unless
the court was satisfied that making it in relation to the accused would help to prevent violence or disorder at
or in connection with designated football matches (cfsection 15(2) of the 1989 Act). This would enable the
courts to keep the numbers of orders within manageable limits and to apply them only in serious cases where
the offender might otherwise be in danger of a custodial sentence.

  333. In such situations, if the offender were judged by the court to be a committed football hooligan, and
were required to attend for say two hours each Saturday in the football season, to a maximum of 36 hours (ie
nearly half a season) or even 72 hours, he could not surely have any just grievance. The order would be less
harsh than even the shortest prison sentence and, from the public’s point 0fview, much more effective.               j


  334. I recognise the practical difficulties in implementing extended attendance centre orders but, if those
difficulties can be overcome, the scheme would have considerable merits. I accordingly recommend that
consideration be given to implementing it.

Tagging
  335. A second possible measure to enforce exclusion from the ground and its environs is electronic
monitoring or tagging. This device is used successfully in the United States. Pilot schemes are presently being
run here by the Home Office. Accused persons on remand are kept under supervision using anklets with
small radio transmitters linked to a central computer. Despite reports of some difficulty with the pilot
schemes, Mr John Patten in an answer to a Parliamentary Question on 10 January 1989 stated:-

  "It is already clear that the technology can be put to practical use and that the procedures for fitting the
  equipment and monitoring defendants are practicable. It would now be desirable to test the use of
  electronic monitoring on a trial basis in an area in which substantial numbers are likely to be eligible for its
  application as a condition of bail."

Moreover, you are reported as having said to the Bow Group on 11 December 1989:-

                                                      56
  "There is a need for courts to have powers to make curfew orders, confining offenders to their homes at
 certain times. This should not be a 24 hour house arrest. They need to be able to go to work if they have a
 job, attend training courses or probation centres, or receive treatment for alcohol or drug misuse. But some
  types of crime - pub brawls, for example, or car thefts - could be reduced by curfew orders. I very much
  hope that our experiments with electronic monitoring will enable it to be extended from defendants on
  remand to sentenced offenders, so as to make a curfew order properly enforceable".

  336. If the experiments do enable the tagging to be extended to sentenced offenders, it would be a most
useful and effective way of ordering convicted hooligans, excluded from grounds, to remain at home during
designated matches. Their obedience to the orders could be monitored without excessive resource
requirements.

   337. I therefore recommend that consideration be given to using this technology in the sentencing of
offenders convicted of football-related offences.

   338. The principal object of the Football Spectators Act is to break the link between football and
hooliganism. It aims to do this by a national membership scheme requiring spectators to purchase and hold
membership cards without which they will not gain admission. Those who commit relevant offences or
otherwise misbehave in a football context will be deprived of membership and thus be excluded from
attending matches. It is hoped that by this strategy hooligan activity will be eliminated both inside and
outside football grounds. Thus, Mr Ridley, then Secretary of State for the Environment, said at the launch of
the Bill on 17 January 1989:-

  "For the first time, there will be an effective and comprehensive procedure to keep hooligans away from
  football matches. Of course there will be attempts to abuse the system but if the scheme is effective, those
  attempts will fail. We believe that it offers the real prospect of ending football hooliganism both inside and
  outside grounds. If hooligans know that they will not be allowed into football matches, they will have no
  incentive to travel to them. The link between football and hooliganism will be broken and football will
  cease to be a focus for violence."
Provisions of Part I
  339. The Statute is an enabling Act and permits the Secretary of State to make an order by Statutory
Instrument to bring it into operation (section 27(2)). I do not propose to set out all the provisions of the Act in
every detail. In the broadest terms, however, Part I of the Act is to the following effect.

  340. Section 1 (5) provides for a national membership scheme ("the scheme") to restrict "the generality of
spectators attending designated football matches to persons who are members of the scheme". Section 1 (2)
gives the Secretary of State power to designate football matches or an individual match.
  341. Two new bodies are to be appointed by the Secretary of State. The first is the Football Membership
Authority (FMA), a corporate body with articles of association. The FMA is to be responsible initially for
drafting the scheme (section 4(1)). The Secretary of State is empowered to approve the scheme, again by
Statutory Instrument (section 4(3)). The FMA is then to be responsible for the administration of the scheme
(section 3(1)). Section 7 disqualifies from becoming or continuing to be a member of the scheme anyone
subject to an exclusion order under section 30 of the Public Order Act 1986 (after conviction of an offence
connected with football) whilst he is so subject. Also, anyone convicted of a relevant offence, being one of
those listed in Schedule 1 to the new Act, is likewise disqualified. Anyone so convicted is disqualified for five
years if he receives an immediate prison sentence and for two years if not.

   342. The second body is a quango to be called the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) (section 8). The
FLA is to be responsible for the grant (section 10(1)) or refusal (section 10(3)) ofa licence to admit spectators
to any premises to watch any designated football match there. It has power to impose conditions on the
licence (section 10(4) to (7)), to make inspections and inquiries (section 10(8)) and to vary a licence (section
10(10)), suspend or revoke it (section 12). In making decisions under section 10, the FLA is to have regard to
whether the equipment, the premises and the responsible persons there are such as to secure compliance with
the scheme.
  343. The FLA also has ancillary functions, as noted earlier; first, to include in a licence, if the Secretary of
State so directs, a condition as to seating (section 11); secondly, to keep under review and oversee the
discharge by local authorities of their 1975 Act functions regarding football grounds and Safety Certificates
(section 13).

Contents of the Scheme
  344. Section 5(2) prescribes as follows:-

  "The scheme must include provision -

    (a) securing that the only spectators permitted to attend at designated football matches are authorised
        spectators;

                                                       58
   (b) providing for temporary membership of the scheme, including (in particular) the temporary
       membership of football club guests;

   (c) providing for the admission as spectators at designated football matches, without their being
       members of the scheme, of-
       (i) disabled persons, and

       (ii) accompanied children,

       in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as are specified in the scheme;

   (d) securing that persons who are disqualified under section 7 below are excluded from membership
       while so disqualified;

   (e) providing for the exclusion from membership, for an appropriate period not exceeding two years
        determined under the scheme, of persons who are, by reference to circumstances specified in the
        scheme, determined under the scheme to be unfit for membership and for notifying persons who are
        excluded from membership of the grounds for the exclusion;

   (f) imposing pecuniary penalties on any persons having functions under the scheme for failure to
       discharge those functions;

   (g) imposing requirements as respects the procedure to be followed in dealing with applications for
        membership of the scheme and requiring that in Wales any application form for membership of the
        scheme shall also be available in Welsh;
   (h) imposing requirements on responsible persons as respects the procedure to be followed and
        equipment to be used in relation to any designated football match to secure that, except in an
        emergency, the only spectators admitted to and permitted to remain on the premises are authorised
        spectators;

    (i) to such effect, in relation to the admission of spectators to the premises, as the Secretary of State may
        specify in writing;

    (j) establishing and maintaining a central register of members of the scheme;

    (k) regulating the form and contents of membership cards; and

    (1) establishing procedures for the making and consideration of representations against decisions made
         under the scheme refusing or withdrawing membership of it and for the independent review of the
         decisions in the light of the representations;
and in this subsection "accompanied children" means persons under the age of 10 years in the charge of an
authorised spectator."

  345. Section 5(3) prescribes, inter alia, that the scheme may make provision for the imposition of charges
for membership cards (section 5(3)(b) and by section 5(3)(c)):-

  "for the admission as spectators at designated football matches, without their being members of the
  scheme, of descriptions of person specified in the scheme in such circumstances and subject to such
  conditions as are so specified".

  346. My short summary of Part I omits a number of provisions eg the constitution of the FMA and of the
FLA, details of offences, defences to them and appeals, Data Protection Act 1984 implications etc.

Provisions of Part II
  347. Before proceeding to discuss the implications of Part I of the Act, which are highly controversial, I
should refer to the provisions of Part II which are not. Although I assume my remit is limited to sports events
within the jurisdiction to which Part I applies, the scheme of Part II is, I think, relevant.

                                                       59
 348. The aim of Part II is to prevent convicted hooligans from travelling to matches abroad including
matches in Scotland and there by misbehaviour causing trouble and damaging our national reputation.

   349. The scheme, again stated in broad terms, is to give courts power to make a restriction order after a
conviction for a relevant offence, in addition to any other sentence (section 15). Such an order is to be for five
years if it accompanies an immediate sentence of imprisonment; otherwise for two years (section 16(1 )). It
imposes a duty to report at a police station (unless exempted) on the occasion of designated football matches
abroad. Failure so to report is an offence punishable on summary conviction by up to one month’s
imprisonment, by a fine or by both (section 16(5)). There is provision in section 22 for making restriction
orders consequent upon convictions in countries other than England and Wales for "corresponding offences"
to those listed in Schedule 1.
   350. Even those implacably hostile to the provisions of Part I are mostly in favour of Part II. In my view it
is a sensible and practicable measure to take against a persistent mischief practised by a small minority but
with national repercussions. To adapt a famous dictum, never in the field of sport has so much odium been
brought upon so many by so few. The scheme is aimed directly and solely at the few whose misbehaviour
abroad brings such odium upon English football supporters generally. I welcome it.




                                                      60
                                                 CHAPTER 13

                               THE NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME

  351. Returning to Part I, it is crucial to a full evaluation of its likely impact to know the terms of the
scheme to be approved. At present there is no approved scheme, nor even a draft scheme, since the FMA has
not yet been appointed, although the FA and FL have been offered "first refusal" for appointment as such. I
do not know therefore how and in what terms such a scheme would comply with the requirements of section 5
set out above.

  352. The only guide presently available is the Invitation To Tender (ITT) and the Statement Of
Requirements (SOR) prepared by Ernst & Young, Management Consultants, in conjunction with the
Department of the Environment. This document is directed to companies which have shown interest in
tendering for the contract to supply the relevant technology. The ITT was dated 1 December 1989 and
required tenderers to respond by 19 January 1990. As I write this report that date is still ahead and so the
response is not known. Presently there are seven potential tenderers.

General Requirements of the ITT and SOR
  353. The successful tenderer will be required to set up, manage and operate a company, the "scheme
operating company" (SOC) to run the entire scheme. It will work under the overall policy, supervision and
control of the FMA. At the outset of the ITT, certain key objectives have been identified as follows:-

  "1. Minimise the turnstile process time and the queuing problems that might occur in large crowds close
   to kick-offand keep them within acceptable limits.

    2. Fund the scheme, taking account of its costs and also the possible disincentive effect to supporters of
    paying membership fees.

    3. Ensure the application process, card production and issue procedures meet the requirements within
    acceptable turnaround times to spectators.

    4. Deal with invalid card holders at entry points and ensure that offenders against the membership rules
    are dealt with fairly and that any punishment can be enforced.

    5. Keep within manageable limits the size of the referral file containing banned members to ensure that
    speed of access to it is acceptable and still have sufficient protection against the use of lost, stolen, forged
    cards and pass-backs on match days."

   354. The SOR provides as follows:-
   "Apart from ensuring financial integrity and acceptability of the marketing strategy, the FMA will be
    concernedP to ensure that:

     1. the number of supporters is maximised while recovering the cost of the scheme

    2.   the scheme does not add to problems outside grounds

    3. the scheme assists in reducing hooligan!sm."

   That the scheme must be self-funding is further stressed in the ITT as follows:-

   "The Football Membership Scheme will be self-funding, that is, the SOC will be responsible for all costs
    and expenses (including set-up costs) incurred in carrying out its obligations under the contract and
    shall reimburse the FMA for expenditure incurred by the FMA both on the SOC’s behalf relating to the
    scheme and in respect of the FMA fulfilling the requirements of the Act.

    The costs of running the FMA will also need to be recovered from the income generated by the SOC.

    The levels of membership fees including any variations over the period of the contract, will be subject to
    the prior approval of the FMA".

                                                         61
Ground Modifications
 355. As to the cost of ground modifications, the ITT notes:

  "It is anticipated that there could be a significant cost involved in accommodating the membership
  validation system at some grounds. Therefore any modifications to be made to the existing turnstile
  equipment and the inclusion of any new turnstiles should be entered against this item."

Applications for Membership
  356. Applications for membership of the scheme must be made in person, not by post, using a standard
application form. The form will include personal particulars and the type of application. This may be for
adult membership, renewal, replacement, change of details, temporary, junior or senior membership. The
form will state the membership period (normally two seasons), the applicant’s nominatedclub allegiance,
second club allegiance and national allegiance. It will include a box to allow exclusion from any mailing lists.
The Post Office and the clubs will act as collection points for handling applications and carrying out an initial
verification process. This will require the applicant to produce evidence to prove identity and one or more
passport standard photographs. The collecting agent will be responsible for checking the form, the
acceptability of the photographs and their general likeness to the applicant as well as the other evidence of
identification. He will also accept the fee.

  357. The SOR provides:-

  "Vetting of applications at the point of presentation in a collection agency must be consistent and methods
  to ensure that vetting procedures are followed must be employed. The integrity of the system as an
  anti-hooligan measure will depend on this vetting procedure."

  358. The SOR states that the major problem in handling the application will be to ensure that the attached
photographs are linked to the application details to enable the subsequent correct printing of membership
cards.

Validation Procedures
  359. I concentrate on applications for adult, junior or senior membership. In these cases, the SOR
provides two basic validation procedures which must be followed. The first is a "person check", explained as
follows:-

  "The purpose of this check is to stop supporters getting more than one membership card. The reason being
  that a ban on one membership registration would still leave the supporter in possession of another
  membership card. Therefore there will be both a name and an address check against the membership
  registration database (postcoding of all addresses will obviously make this procedure a lot faster and it may
  be necessary to insist upon postcodes from the start). Also it is not sufficient to undertake a straight name
  and address check due to different ways to spell names and addresses. The prime contractor should
  propose methods to ensure that adequate checking is undertaken against deliberate multiple applications."
  360. Secondly, there must be a "referral file check". The referral file will contain particulars of the
following:

  " - persons banned from membership (existing members)

    - persons who are considered to be undesirable due to their past record who have not yet applied for
      membership (this will include those with existing exclusion orders against them)

    - lost/stolen membership cards either by direct notification or due to an application for a replacement
      card
    - fraudulent copies."

Provision and Updating of Information to Clubs
  361. The national referral list will be communicated to all 92 League clubs. Moreover, the list will have to
be updated weekly during the football season to add fresh instances of any of the four categories of exclusion
mentioned in the last paragraph; also, to remove from the list those no longer excluded eg after a successful
appeal.


                                                      62
  362. Each club will also be given the names of those successful applicants who have claimed allegiance to
the club. From this information the club will be required to keep a register of its own members.

Exploitation of the System
   363. The ITT provides for the FMA by itself or a designated agent to be responsible for approving and
co-ordinating the SOC’s commercial exploitation of the National Membership File and extracts from that
file. This is said to be "in order to protect and promote the reputation of football to avoid any possible
conflict with existing and future commercial activities at a club and national level". The FMA may also
licence clubs to use data relating to members who express allegiance to that club on terms and conditions to
be agreed.
Membership Cards
  364. It is mandatory that the membership card must carry a photograph of the member, the member’s
name, full membership number, the expiry date, club allegiance if any and national allegiance. The
membership number must be in a "machine readable form on the card as it is the only method of rapidly
enough matching the card against the national referral file".
  365. The card will need to meet standards for size and durability; it will need to last for more than the
normal membership period (two years) as this may be increased later.
  366. The security level must ensure that:

  "- cards are not forgeable

    - photographs cannot be replaced
    - machine readable membership numbers cannot be changed

    - printed details on the cards cannot be changed

    - supplies of blank cards are held in a secure environment."
  All of this assumes that the membership cards "will be the ’plastic credit-card’ type".

Entry Checking Procedures
  367. I now come to requirements having a critical bearing on safety and crowd control. They concern the
checks and procedures at turnstiles. The following six provisions are mandatory:

    i    A spectator must present a valid current membership card to the turnstile operator.

    ii   "A spectator must be authorised to hold the membership card and be permitted to attend the
         designated match. (Note: it has been accepted that the turnstile operator will not be able to compare
         the photograph on the card with the person presenting the card as well as undertaking electronic
         checking)."

     iii The card must not be "present on the referral file" and
    iv   can only be used "once per designated match."

    v    "The turnstile operator must not let any person into the match without them (sic) producing a
         membership card and validating that card using the procedures and equipment provided."

     vi "The system should be capable of directing members into their permitted sections of the ground,
         using the primary and secondary club allegiance field (unless playing each other) in the membership
         number to determine through which entry points the member may pass."

Turnstile Alarm
   368. If a card fails any of the six basic checks summarised above, the system must alert the officials
(stewards and/or police). It must also be capable of alerting the turnstile operator but not alerting the
spectator while in the turnstile.

                                                       63
  369. Three types of failure are envisaged.

    (1) Referral file check shows the card is subject to a ban, card notified as lost or as stolen; alternatively,
        the card has been used previously at that match (pass-back).

    (2) Equipment/card malfunction, membership expired,temporary card not valid for match.
    (3) Card being presented at the "wrong" turnstile or no card at all.

Detection
  370. The procedure to be followed in relation to each of these three types of failure is mandatory and
important in the evaluation of the scheme for safety and crowd control.
  371. If the failure is of type ( 1 ):-

  "The suspect should be apprehended and taken to an investigation area either inside or outside the ground.
  These will be situated at convenient places around the ground. It is anticipated that there will need to be
  one investigation area on each side of the ground, although this is likely to depend on ground conditions".

  If the failure is of type (2):-
  "The card will be retained at the entry point and a receipt for the card given to the spectator. This receipt
  will contain either the membership number or some method to identify the retained card later. The
  spectator will be advised to contact the club after the match when the problem may have been resolved".

  If the failure is of type (3):-
  "The spectator is turned back from the entry point".

System Contingency
  372. Systems at turnstiles must be capable of operating "a degraded service" in the event of system
malfunction. This must include replacement of any malfunctioning unit within five minutes and alternative
power supplies if the system relies on external power. If cabling is used it must be tamper proof and more than
one route must be provided between "every turnstile installed unit" and the processing unit. Turnstile
systems must not depend on a single club computer system.

Performance and Environmental Conditions
  373. Finally, two mandatory provisions are laid down which are of great importance to safety and crowd
control.
  374. As to performance the SOR provides:-

  "It is critical that the conducting of the six basic checks and any follow-up procedures described in this and
  the next section must give rise to no significant delays to ground entry at turnstiles. The maximum
  additional time which will be considered will be no more than 1 second per entry to the normal ground
  entry rate for a particular turnstile and ground configuration at all times".
  375. As to environmental conditions, the provision is:-

  "Any systems installed at turnstile locations will have to operate reliably in the conditions experienced in
  an outdoor, all-weather, all-year environment. Power supplies to turnstiles will be unreliable."
Summary
  376. As with my analysis of the statutory provisions, this summary of the contents of the ITT and SOR is
not exhaustive. It seeks only to indicate how the scheme is intended to work and what is expected of it.




                                                       64
                                                CHAPTER 14

                        ARGUMENTS RAISED BY CRITICS OF THE SCHEME

  377. Having summarised the intended objects and benefits of the scheme and the means by which it is
required to achieve them, I turn now to the arguments against the scheme raised by its critics.
  (i) Disproportionate?
  First, it is said that the scheme with all its complex ramifications is out of proportion to the problem.
  Setting up the technology and maintaining it secure and in working order; adapting grounds to install it;
  dealing with millions of applications swiftly; issuing millions of cards, renewing them, coping with lost and
  stolen cards; setting up a referral list, distributing it and updating it; training staff; coping with banned
  cards and other failures at the turnstile; processing offenders; dealing fairly with appellants - these, and
  other ancillary measures, amount to an enormous undertaking. It is aimed principally at keeping hooligans
  out of the ground, but, so it is said, the problem inside grounds is less than it was and could be met by other
  less complex and less ambitious strategies.

  (ii) Unfair?
  In aiming to exclude a minority of hooligans from the football scene, it is complained that the huge
  majority of decent spectators are to be put by the scheme to trouble and expense. Each fan will have to go
  through the application procedures, presenting his form, proving his identity, purchasing and producing
  photographs. He will have to pay between £4 and £10 a year to join the scheme in addition to paying for
  match tickets. He will have to keep his card, remember it on match days, guard it from loss and theft, and
  renew it from time to time for further payments. Should he forget it, or lose it, should it be stolen or become
  damaged, he will be put to trouble to replace it and to gain entry to matches meanwhile. It is argued that
  measures against hooligans should target the hooligans only, not inconvenience millions of spectators in
  the hope of weeding out a few.

  (iii) Casual Spectators
  There is anxiety that the scheme will, in effect, exclude from football the spectator who attends only on a
  casual basis or for a rare match which takes his fancy. Such a spectator, it is argued, would not go to the
  expense or trouble (especially the latter) of buying a membership card simply to attend an occasional
  match. This category of spectator is thought possibly to account for some 20% of present attendances -
  sizeable numbers to be deprived of their present freedom to watch football.

  (iv) Diminished Club Revenue
  Taking these lost casual visitors together with former regular attenders who may also find the scheme a
  disincentive, the clubs fear their revenue will be severely reduced. For this reason, inter alia, they have been
  strongly opposed to the scheme.
  (v) Danger of Congestion and Disorder
  There is concern that the ambitious technology, which is yet to be produced and tested, may fail.
  Alternatively, that even if, by persistence and through trial and error, it could in the end be made to
  function reliably, there may be serious failures in the teething period. In either of these events the fear is
  that congestion at the turnstiles could cause serious danger or disorder.
  (vi) Will the Scheme Defeat Hooligans?
  Even if the technology works according to plan, will it (a) exclude determined hooligans from inside the
  ground and (b) also induce them to stay away from the environs of the ground? The criticism is that it
  may do neither of these things, especially not the latter.

  (vii) Police Resources
  There is concern, especially from the police themselves, as to the numbers of police to be deployed and the
  facilities they will need at the ground to cope with problems arising from the scheme at the turnstiles.
  These will involve banned cards, lost cards, stolen cards, unreadable cards and determined hooligans
  trying by various means to buck the system.

In short, critics say the scheme proposes a sledgehammer to crack a nut; a sledgehammer which may not
swing at all but, if it does, may not swing safely or even reach the nut.

                                                       65
Arguments Relevant to this Inquiry
   378. Of the seven arguments I have just briefly summarised, the first four do not bear directly upon safety
or crowd control. They may have considerable force and (ii) and (iii) do bear upon matters considered in Part
I of this Report (especially better treatment of spectators). However, they raise issues of policy which are
essentially for Parliament. Accordingly, I say no more as to those four points.

  379. On the other hand, arguments (v), (vi) and (vii) do bear very relevantly upon safety and crowd
control. They are therefore within my remit and I shall explore them in turn.




                                                     66
                                                CHAPTER 15

                              DANGER OF CONGESTION OR DISORDER

Present Risk of Congestion
   380. Congestion outside turnstiles and consequent injuries or disorder are already recognised risks. Those
risks are aggravated by the limited number of turnstiles available and the limited scope for increasing them at
many old grounds. They are also increased by the late arrival of a large proportion of the crowd, which is a
common occurrence.

   381. During the last busy 20 minutes before kick-off, queues, or sometimes a phalanx, of waiting
spectators, tend to build up. If the delivery through the turnstiles is delayed or slowed down, that build-up
grows and its pressure further retards the turnstile operation. The next stage is that those waiting become
restive, fearing they will not get in for the kick-off. Crowd noise from the ground, denoting that the teams are
out, increases impatience. There is then real danger of pressure towards the turnstiles causing injuries and
panic causing disorder. This is what happened at Hillsborough. It is said that it nearly happened again,
despite Hillsborough and the interim recommendations, at Coventry on the first day of the new season.

Additional Time to Check Cards
  382. These risks have existed even without a national membership scheme. Since the scheme requires
that all spectators passing through the turnstiles must produce their membership cards for checking, it is
inevitable that some additional time will be taken for each spectator.

  383. In realistic acknowledgement of the risk this might create, the ITT states as its first key objective:-

  "Minimise the turnstile process time and the queuing problems that might occur in large crowds close to
  kick-off and keep them within acceptable limits".

  The SOR likewise requires the FMA to ensure:-

  "The scheme does not add to problems outside grounds".

  More specifically, I repeat the mandatory provision of the SOR as follows:-

  "It is critical that the conducting of the six basic checks and any follow-up procedures.., must give rise to
  no significant delays to ground entry at turnstiles. The maximum additional time which will be considered
  will be no more than 1 second per entry to the normal ground entry rate for a particular turnstile and
  ground configuration at all times".

  384. Even if this is achieved, it would reduce the numbers per hour admissible through a turnstile from
the norm of 500 (mentioned in Appendix 3 at paragraph 33) to about 436.

  385. But can it be achieved? This depends upon two factors: (i) what has to be done at the turnstile; (ii)
whether the technology can achieve the required rate; not only in favourable conditions but in real life and
despite attempts to defeat it.

     (i) Procedures at the Turnstiles
   386. The six entry checks which have to be undertaken at the turnstile (see supra paragraph 367) require
the spectator to "present a valid current membership card to the turnstile operator". So, in the normal case,
there will be a passing of the card to the operator, a validation of it by him, and a return of the card to the
holder - all of this to be additional to buying a ticket or (at an all-ticket match) presenting a ticket and having
the stub returned.

  387. The system as prescribed in the ITT depends upon the operator getting possession of the card
because it has to be "retained" at the turnstile if there is a failure of type (2) eg malfunction or card expired.
This requirement is significant when one is dealing with a time factor not to exceed 1 second. The scheme is
unlike that at Luton, for example, which must be quicker since (a) there are two sets of turnstiles with an
operator only at the inner set and (b) the member swipes his own card through at the outer turnstile. If the
ITT were to be changed to follow the Luton example, however, what would happen at grounds where there is

                                                       67
insufficient space for two sets of turnstiles and how would the operator get possession of the card so as to
"retain" it if there were a malfunction?

  388. If the turnstile alarm alerts the operator to a failure of type (1) - a banned, lost or stolen card or
pass-back - the suspect is to be apprehended. The turnstile operator will therefore have no more to do with
him; but how long it will take to have the suspect apprehended inside or outside the turnstile will depend on
the police presence to which I shall turn later.

   389. If the failure is of type (2), apart from retaining the card, the operator is required to give the holder a
receipt for it which "will contain either the membership number or some other method to identify the
retained card later". Since the operator will be unable to anticipate the card numbers of those which fail for a
type (2) reason, he cannot have a receipt ready in advance. If he has to make one out, hand it to the entrant
and explain the procedure for redeeming the card later, the exercise would take considerably longer than 1
second - especially if, as would be likely, there is some backchat.

   390. It is true that the SOR requirement that the scheme must add no more than 1 second to the turnstile
time, although said to be mandatory and critical, could be changed. However, in my view the authors of the
SOR were right to choose 1 second as "the maximum additional time which will be considered". At 500 per
hour, each entrant has 7.2 seconds to go through the turnstile. Any additional time could cause difficulty; 1
second is an addition of nearly 14% to the existing 7.2 seconds and more than 1 second would, as the SOR
says, be unacceptable.

  391. If the failure is of type (3) - wrong turnstile: no card - the ITT requires that "the spectator is turned
back from the entry point". The evidence I heard at Sheffield from many police witnesses, and all I have seen
and read since, makes it clear that where there are queues, let alone a phalanx, trying to get someone who is
wedged in the narrows of a turnstile back through those waiting is at best a slow, laborious and unpopular
exercise. At Hillsborough, the crush made it impossible.

    (ii) The Technology
  392. It has yet to be shown that a computerised system can be produced which is capable, even in
favourable conditions, of achieving reliably the requirements of the ITT. So far as I am aware, nowhere has a
computerised system been installed to cope with the massive numbers of people, in the short period of time
and in the all-weather context which will be required by this scheme, quite apart from the added problems of
attempted disruption. The scheme therefore invites tenderers to break new ground. The fact that it has not
been done before does not, of course, show that it cannot be done. But it does require greater caution and a
more extensive testing procedure than if there were a successful precedent.

  393. The only comparable exercise which has been attempted was a Football Identity Card Scheme in
Holland. That failed in its early stages and has been shelved. However, I should stress that the Dutch scheme
was very different from that proposed under the 1989 Act. It involved only five clubs with a bad history of
hooliganism and it applied only to the away matches of those clubs. Only 25,000 cards were issued. Much
depended on careful control of ticket sales. The scheme was introduced at the start of the 1989/90 season.
Unfortunately, the opening matches of the season featured two of the five clubs hosting two of the others.
Ticket sales were not controlled effectively, the clubs were hostile to the scheme, away supporters were
admitted without tickets and supporters on both sides combined to defeat the experiment.

  394. In these circumstances, I do not think that the failure of the Dutch scheme can found a fair argument
against the totally different scheme proposed in the 1989 Act. What it does show is the need to make any such
scheme proof against wrecking tactics,

Demonstration
  395. One of the seven potential tenderers gave a demonstration to a Parliamentary group using a
laboratory prototype to show the technology they could deploy. That being so, a similar demonstration was
arranged for me and my Assessors. We were shown a "smart-card" and how it could be programmed and used
as a football membership card. Each "smart-card" contains its own mini-computer. Much information can
be stored inside it. The demonstration showed the holder passing the card over a reader and the possible
responses of red, amber or green light, depending on whether the card was valid, doubtful or invalid.
Advertising possibilities and other packages of benefits were also explained and illustrated.

                                                       68
  396. I was extremely impressed by what we were shown. However, this was a single card, at a single
simulated turnstile, in warm, dry, indoor conditions, without a large national referral file to be searched and
without anyone trying to circumvent or wreck the system.

Police Apprehensions
  397. I quote from the written evidence submitted by ACPO:-

  "The question, however, which most concerns police officers relates to the efficacy of the technology. The
  (Act) naturally does not detail how it will work or what is required of it but, it is clear that, unless it is robust
  and virtually trouble-free, it will be counter-productive. In the worst case it could be massively
  counter-productive. At the least each turnstile must have access to a national database and must be able to
  survey that database almost instantaneously. The machine itself must be durable against sabotage.., and
  must work without persistent fault ....
  All our experience to date has been that computer salesmen have offered much and delivered little. The
  police feel that they must be involved in the specification for any technology and would need to be satisfied
  that it works before support could be given to this scheme. The consequences of repeated failure, hostile
  queues, interminable delays and the rest, are unthinkable".

Computer Reliability
   398. The concern expressed in that passage about computer performance is not unduly cynical. Many
people have personal experience of computer failures in one field or another. The computer "going down" at
an airport causing delays at check-in, computer errors in banks, problems with computerised entrances to the
London Underground, and, recently, computer "viruses", are merely a few examples. These problems
continue to occur from time to time even with computer systems which have been thoroughly tested, which
are widely used and have long ago passed through what was thought to be the teething period. In many cases
such failures cause delay or annoyance but not danger. The technology for the present scheme, however, has
not yet been through the stage of teething troubles. Moreover, the scheme could cause dangerous build-ups if
the technology either failed wholly or failed to work at the stipulated rate. In the London Underground,
where build-ups were occurring, a manned entrance channel has had to be provided at many stations
alongside those which are computerised, as a safety valve. To have to open extra non-computerised entrances
at football grounds would (unlike the Underground) scupper the system. Its whole and sole point is to exclude
hooligans by computer checking.

  399. In fact, the Act seems to leave it open to the FMA to include in the scheme power for a person in
authority to open gates and let spectators in, whether they have membership cards or not, should an
emergency arise (section 2(2), section 5(2)(h), section 5(3)(c) and section 10(12)(a)). If the exercise of that
power should have to be considered, all the problems which arose outside Hillsborough would arise again
- deciding whether the power should be exercised or not; if so, at what moment and by whom; making a clear
decision and communicating it; coping with the in-rush and the loss of control and of segregation it may
cause. If the power had to be exercised, the scheme would be discredited at that place on that day and perhaps
generally.
Relaxation in an Emergency
   400. I said in the last paragraph that the Act "seems to include power" to relax the turnstile requirements
in an emergency. But the power is only to be inferred by implication from the four sub-sections I have cited.
Nowhere is the power expressly given; nor is it said who shall exercise it or how "an emergency" is to be
interpreted. The admission of authorised spectators only, and only by production of their membership cards,
seems to be fundamental to the scheme. Yet there is no stipulation in the Act that cards have to be produced.
No doubt this could be provided for in the approved scheme. But since anyone o, her than an authorised
spectator commits a criminal offence by entering the ground, admitting a non-authorised spectator is a
serious matter and could amount to aiding and abetting a criminal offence. It is therefore surprising that the
Act does not indicate who is to have power to declare an emergency so as to admit all and sundry and in what
circumstances.

Tests
   401. What testing is envisaged? The ITT provides for a "system testing strategy". This is divided into
"laboratory" prototypes and pilot system tests. Two clubs have volunteered and been accepted to be the pilot
sites for the latter form of testing. They are Derby County and Reading. It is envisaged that at least four
different levels of test will be carried out at each of the two clubs. These four levels are likely to be:

                                                        69
    i    issue membership cards to existing members;

    ii   issue cards to all home or away supporters;

    iii small all-ticket match (home and away supporters);

    iv large (near capacity) all-ticket match.

  402. The ITT provides:

  "Each test will try to simulate as close (sic) as possible the live situation with problem cards being used at
  random".

  403. I foresee two problems which beset this testing procedure. First, the difficulty of making the test
conditions truly simulate those which will obtain when the scheme is working nationwide. For example, only
two clubs are to be used for the tests "with problem cards being used at random". Unless the computers at the
two clubs have to search a referral list (whether real or simulated) as long as the national referral list may turn
out to be, they will not have been adequately tested for capacity and speed. The estimated volume of
"banned" cards, according to the SOR, is between 5,000 and 20,000 per annum. The estimate of stolen and
lost cards is between 20,000 and 80,000 per annum. It is not clear whether "per annum" refers to the
numbers on the referral file in any given year or to the number of fresh bannings, losses and thefts each year.
Taking the more conservative approach, however, they could jointly amount to 100,000 per annum.
Accordingly, for a realistic test, the computers at the two clubs would have to be able swiftly to pick out the
"problem cards" from a list of up to 100,000 - somewhat different from the Luton list of six.

 404. The size of the referral list may have an important bearing on the speed at which the technology can
work. I repeat that key objective number 5 in the ITT stipulates:-

  "Keep within manageable limits the size of the referral file containing banned members to ensure that
  speed of access to it is acceptable etc".

  How is the referral file to be kept "within manageable limits"? Its size will surely depend upon the number
of cards banned, lost or stolen. There can be no management control of the numbers lost and stolen and the
number banned will depend on the number of convictions or acts of misbehaviour meriting a ban. The only
way of keeping the number banned "within manageable limits" would be not to ban all those who may
deserve it, which would bring the scheme into disrepute.

  405. The SOR estimates that the number of cards which are unreadable or otherwise require investigation
may be up to 3% of the cards being checked. So at a capacity match with 50,000 present, the test would
require 1,500 malfunctioning cards to be randomly issued. Presumably, the number of unreadable cards
would tend to grow during the first two years of the scheme as the first issue of cards accumulates damage
from rough treatment.

   406. Again, with pilot tests at only two clubs, the hooligans’ response will be unpredictable. They may try
to sabotage the scheme at the pilot clubs which would really put the technology to the test. They may,
however, prefer to misbehave at some other ground where no tests are in progress. When the scheme is
implemented generally, they will be unable to go to any such "other ground" and may only then make their
attempts to sabotage the scheme.

Human Guinea-pigs
  407. The second problem is that tests can only be carried out by using real spectators. Bank computers and
other computer technologies can be tested by putting through figures, data and print-outs. This system can
only be tested by putting through people. So in the very testing of whether the system may cause danger,
danger may be caused.

Disruption and Sabotage
  408. The whole raison dYtre of the scheme is the perceived need to eliminate from football a hooligan
element so substantial, and so determined to make trouble, as to justify this enormous undertaking. Since the
scheme seeks to defeat such determined hooligans, it must be assumed that the hooligans will seek to defeat


                                                       7O
the scheme. They will see it as a challenge. Wrecking or circumventing it will add a new piquancy to the
perverse pleasure they derive from their activities. Mr Ridley recognised this on the launch of the Bill, in the
passage I have quoted, when he said:-
  "Of course there will be attempts to abuse the system but if the scheme is effective, those attempts will
  fail".

  409. Accordingly, the technology will not only have to be capable of fulfilling the requirements of the
scheme without malfunction, in all weathers and at the stipulated speed. It will also have to be resistant to the
ingenuity and determination of those who may seek to sabotage it or find a way round it. It will need to do
these things not just most of the time, but all of the time. This is a very tall order, and for the reasons I have
set out above, I have the gravest doubts if it can be met. Should it not be met in full, the safety implications
would be serious indeed.




                                                      71
                                                 CHAPTER 16
                             WILL THE SCHEME WEED OUT HOOLIGANS?
  410. Even assuming that the technology can be made to work reliably and is not disrupted or sabotaged,
two questions still arise on whether the scheme is likely to achieve its objects. (i) Will the scheme in fact weed
hooligans out of the ground and (ii) will they also be deterred from causing trouble outside the ground or at
places en route?

(i) Exclusion from the Ground
  411. The strategy depends first upon the court banning the hooligan after conviction of a relevant offence
or the FMA banning him after some misbehaviour. But to impose a ban is one thing; to enforce it is another.
True, the banned hooligan will not lawfully be able to enter by presenting a valid membership card of his
own, once he is on the referral list. But he may still enter by other means.

   412. A serious defect in the scheme is the acceptance that the entry procedure will not involve checking
the photograph on the card against its presenter. Such checking is precluded by the need for speed. But the
main rationale of having a photograph of the member on his card is defeated if it cannot be relied upon to
exclude someone else from using the card and will be checked only should the user later be apprehended for
an offence. So ifa banned hooligan can get hold of a valid card he could gain entry. Not being scrupulous by
nature, he may steal one, borrow one or even buy one, for it is not unlikely that a black market in cards will
develop. Despite requirements in the ITT to prevent such abuses, multiple applications and forgeries may
also be successfully made.
   413. It is nothing to the point to say that if a banned hooligan enters the ground by using a stolen or
borrowed card and is there arrested for an assault, he will have committed not one but two offences, the
assault and the unlawful entry. He could be charged with the assault even without the 1989 Act, and without
his commission of the assault, the unlawful entry is likely to go undetected. Nor does it seem sound to say
that if he so enters and is not seen to commit an offence in the ground, all is well. At the very least, the system
is brought into disrepute when he brags to his mates that he has beaten it. Police evidence suggests, moreover,
that the more sinister members of hooligan gangs often do not use violence themselves, but, from a vantage
point in the ground, direct the activities of others.
  414. I refer again to the submission from ACPO, a body with special knowledge of the hooligan problem
and of how hooligans are likely to react:-

  "The success of the proposals will eventually be judged at two levels.

  First, there is the question as to whether this legislation will:-

    (a) progressively remove hooligans from the football grounds and
    (b) deter the allegiance of those who are involved in trouble and violence but do not necessarily attend
        matches.
  Second, and in a sense more fundamentally, the question remains whether or not the simple mechanics of
  processing membership cards through turnstiles can actually be achieved.
  The police view over a long period of time has been that these provisions are, to a great extent, marginal to
  the problem, if for no other reason than they cannot exclude the possibility of fraud by people who are, by
  definition, hell bent upon defeating the system, and because it will take a very long time before a significant
  number of potential hooligans are excluded by the scheme. There are some countervailing advantages:
    (i) the deterrent effect may be considerable;

    (ii) the club disciplinary system may well be able to take strong action on the evidence of CCTV alone;
    (iii) the game will be able to exclude many of the very worst offenders.
  Nonetheless, the police view is that many of the measures that we have already taken.., are having a
  significant effect and are far more critical to the problem of hooliganism".


                                                        72
(ii) Elimination from the Area and Routes Near the Ground
   415. I have already noted that hooliganism inside the ground has been reduced, largely by CCTV, but has
been transferred outside the ground. I refer again to the submission of ACPO:
  "Two aspects of control have done much to change the nature of hooliganism. The legislation which
  prevented the general supply of alcohol in transit and the universality of CCTV have made a major impact.
  Taken together the effect has been that displays of wild aggression from hordes of drunken supporters are
  much less frequent. The hooligan has moved out of the camera’s range and in a word, there has been
  "displacement" away from the terraces to the darker confines of the stadium or to other venues such as
  public houses and to the transit system".

   416. This, together with other police evidence I have received, shows that although football generally and
a match in particular provide the occasion and the focal point for hooligan activity, many hooligans do not
regard it as essential to be able to enter the ground. They need the converging crowds and the inter-club
rivalry or enmity of a match to set the scene for their violence. They do not need the football itself. Mr Ridley,
in his observations quoted above (paragraph 338) said:-
  "If hooligans know that they will not be allowed into football matches, they will have no incentive to travel
  to them".
  However, exclusion from the ground does not necessarily remove the incentive for hooligans to turn up
there.
   417. I fear it may be merely wishful thinking to assume that football hooligans, banned from inside
grounds, will not, if they are free to do so, turn up and cause trouble outside, in public houses or in the town.
It would be surprising if hooligans of Mr Justice Popplewell’s group I (paragraph 48 supra) were totally to
abandon their activities of attacking and baiting away supporters just because they could not themselves get
into the ground.

  418. It is argued by advocates of the scheme that eliminating hooligans from outside the ground, as well as
inside it, has been achieved at LutGn. However, the success at Luton does not in my view bear directly upon
the likely outcome of the national scheme. The main factor in Luton’s success has been the ban on away
supporters which removes the focus for violence. There are also the other factors already noted, the
geographical position of Luton, the comparatively small attendances and the fact that the Luton scheme has
operated at only one club.
  419. I therefore have grave doubts whether the scheme will achieve its object of eliminating hooligans
from inside the ground. I have even stronger doubts as to whether it will achieve its further object of ending
football hooliganism outside grounds. Indeed, I do not think it will. I fear that, in the shor( term at least, it
may actually increase trouble outside grounds.




                                                       73
                                                 CHAPTER 17

                                           POLICE RESOURCES
  420. The scheme envisages that the checking procedure at turnstiles will let valid card holders through but
will produce the three types of failure already described. Each of those three types of failure may involve an
offence by the person presenting the card and the first type is quite likely to do so. There will therefore have to
be police present to apprehend the suspect, investigate the circumstances and, it may be, make an arrest. I
have already quoted the estimated failures of types (1) and (2) anticipated in the SOR. Even assuming the
estimates are correct for the grounds as a whole, there will be no means of knowing how many "problem
cards" will be presented at any particular bank of turnstiles. There will need to be enough police to be able to
monitor each turnstile throughout the admission period. Ifa banned card is presented, the entrant will need
to be taken by an officer to "an investigation area". The SOR anticipates there will need to be one
investigation area at each side of the ground. Presumably, staff there will be equipped with the means to
investigate the problem card fully. It may then be necessary for the suspect to be arrested and processed.
Whilst the officer who has apprehended him is away from the turnstile through which the suspect came,
further card holders should be coming through the same turnstile at a rate of about 1 per 8 seconds or faster.
There will therefore need to be enough officers to cope with further problem cards. Even if the apprehending
officer merely takes the suspect to an investigation room and hands him over to officers stationed there
before returning to his post, the turnover rate at the turnstiles would need a substantial number of officers.
Requiring stewards to do the job may be inappropriate since arrests may have to be made. Again, if the
suspect realises he may be about to be arrested, he may seek to rush off and lose himself in the crowd. So
dealing with presenters of "problem cards" may have to be done solely by the police. If the scheme showed,
after an initial period, that the incidence of"problem cards" had settled down to a modest number, the police
commitment could be reduced. But initially, considerable numbers will be needed to perform these functions
in addition to those habitually undertaken.

  421. Police anxiety about this commitment of resources is summarised as follows by ACPO:

  "The second level at which the technology causes concern relates to procedures following a "red light" at
  the turnstiles. Policing at turnstiles at present is very selective and the Police Service could not
  countenance providing the sort of cover which would allow for a quick response to each turnstile in the
  event of a problem. The only powers conferred in the Bill are on the police and on the face of it every
  attempt to enter which activates a "red light" suggests an offence is being committed. At Manchester
  United for example 30,000 people will pass through the turnstiles in just over 20 minutes before kick-off.
  There are about 100 turnstiles and the prospects of policing this system are absolutely daunting".
  422. The example of Manchester United in that passage is confirmed by the club itself in a paper on the
national membership scheme entitled "A United Perspective". At page 3, the club says:

  "We have yet to be shown the computer hardware that will do the work successfully. Manchester United
  has run a computerised box office for more than 15 years now and it is well known that what is promised by
  computer companies rarely, if ever, performs to anything like its supposed potential in "real" situations
  where they may have had no experience. Average attendances at Old Trafford are around 40,000 but on
  occasions this figure can go as high as 56,000. Experience shows that around 50% arrive in the last 30
  minutes before kick-offand this number increases substantially for evening matches."

  423. There is a risk therefore that, at big matches, police control of procedures at the turnstiles during the
last 20 minutes before kick-off, in addition to their present duties, may create serious problems. Apart from
the numbers of officers needed, space will have to be found for investigation rooms. It is doubtful whether
one "investigation area" at each side of a ground like Old Trafford will suffice. I therefore have strong doubts
about the practicality of policing the scheme effectively.




                                                       74

                     STRATEGIES AGAINST HOOLIGANISM - CONCLUSIONS
  424. I fully understand and respect the reasons which prompted the promotion and enactment of the
Football Spectators Act 1989. However, it follows from my comments in the last three chapters that I have
grave doubts about the feasibility of the national membership scheme and serious misgivings about its likely
impact on safety. I also have grave doubts about the chances of its achieving its purposes and am very anxious
about its potential impact on police commitments and control of spectators. For these reasons, I cannot
support the implementation of Part I of the Act.

Suggested Strategy
  425. As has been said many times, there is no single measure which will defeat football hooliganism and
even a package of measures will take time to have effect.

  426. That said, the strategy I would suggest is to consider relying upon a combination of all or some of the
following measures:-

    (i) Developing the detection and evidential potential of CCTV and the new National Football
        Intelligence Unit;

    (ii) Prohibiting, by creating criminal offences, three specific activities in the ground:
        (a) throwing a missile;

        (b) chanting obscene or racialist abuse;
        (c) going on the pitch without reasonable excuse;

    (iii)Extending the courts’ power to make attendance centre orders, in conj unction with exclusion orders,
         for football related offences on occasions of specified matches so as to keep hooligans away from
         football grounds;
    (iv) Using electronic monitoring (tagging) for the same purpose.
   427. These four measures are all aimed solely at the hooligans and will impinge only on them. Moreover,
(iii) and (iv) are the only measures, other than imprisonment, aimed not only at banning hooligans from the
ground but also at preventing them from getting into it or near it during matches. Put together with progress
towards all-seating, improved accommodation, better facilities, improved arrangements for crowd control
and better training of police and stewards to achieve it, I believe these measures would give the best chance of
eliminating or minimising football hooliganism.

                             PART V - FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
All-Seated Accommodation
   1. The Secretary of State should ensure that spectators are admitted only to seated accommodation at
matches played at sports grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 in accordance with
the timing set out in Recommendations 2 to 4 below.

  2. Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the 1993/4 season at high-risk matches as
defined under the UEFA Regulations set out in paragraph 82 above.

  3. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 above should apply with effect from the start of
the 1994/5 season to all matches at grounds in the first and second divisions of the Football League, the
Premier Division of the Scottish Football League, and at national stadia, subject to a reasonable extension of
time in the case of a club promoted to the second division of the Football League or the Premier Division of the
Scottish Football League. Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 20% of the
present standing capacity (such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8
below), the first 20% deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1994.

  4. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the
1999/2000 season to all matches at all other grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 10% of the present standing capacity
(such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8 below), the first 10%
deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1999.

Advisory Design Council
  5, The Football Association and the Football League should establish an Advisory Design Council whose
functions should be:

    (a) to conduct and marshal research into the improvement and design of football stadia;

    (b) to disseminate regularly such information and expertise as they acquire in this field to members of the
        Football League and, on request, to other football and sports clubs in England, Wales and Scotland.

National Inspectorate and Review Body
  6. (a) If Part I of the Football Spectators Act 1989 is implemented, section 13 should be brought into force
giving the Football Licensing Authority the functions and powers therein specified (power to review the
discharge of functions by local authorities). If Part I of the Act is not implemented or is substantially delayed,
other arrangements should be made for the discharge of the functions and powers in section 13 of the Act by the
appointment of a body to exercise them.

      (b) In either event, the body exercising those functions and powers in relation to association football
should also be entrusted with similar functions and powers regarding the discharge by local authorities of their
certifying and licensing functions in relation to other sports grounds and sports entertainments pursuant to the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and Parts III and IV of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
1987.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
  7. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

A pen or area is to be deemed "self-contained" notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

  8. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide
("the Green Guide figure") subject to the following qualifications:-

    (a) the maximum density permitted under paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide (when the terrace
        or viewing slope is in good condition) should be 47 not 54;

                                                       76
    (b) the minimum figure specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 (when the terrace or viewing slope materially
         deviates from the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
         packed) should be 0 not 27;
    (c) in arriving at "the Green Guide figure", proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
         which should reduce the permissible density including those specified in paragraphs 220 to 224
         inclusive of the Green Guide.

  9. Arrangements should be made:-
    (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
         figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 8 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
         ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.
  10. The maximum notional rate at which spectators can pass through a turnstile should be 660 persons per
hour, not 750 per hour as stated in paragraph 47 of the Green Guide. The maximum rate for any particular
turnstile must take full account of all circumstances including those given as examples in paragraph 47.

Filling and Monitoring Terraces
   11. There should be a written statement of intent, agreed between the club and the police, setting out their
respective functions as to crowd safety and control and in particular as to the filling of each self-contained pen or
other standing area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
variation of the document in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

   12. (a) At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other standing
area (subject to (b) below), a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are
monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress
throughout the period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any
other steward or police presence. He should have ready access to a police officer who can anthorise access
through gates to the pitch under Recommendation 20 below.

      (b) This Recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other standing area where the
spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not exceed one third of the areas
maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, whichever is the lower.

Gangways
  13. Gangways should be kept clear, in accordance with paragraphs 97 to 99 of the Green Guide. Gangways
should be painted in a conspicuous colour whether they are sunk or not. The Safety Certificate should require
that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they be painted.

Fences and Gates
   14. All spikes or similar constructions on perimeter or radial fences, and any sections overhanging or
returning inwards towards spectators, should be removed.
  15. Perimeter fencing should be no higher than 2.2 metres, measured from the top of the fence to the lowest
point at which spectators may stand, and including any wall or other foundations forming part of the perimeter
boundary.
  16. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the standing areas and especially those with
duties under Recommendation 12 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different
crowd densities.

  17. There must be provided in any perimeter fence of a pen or other self-contained area sufficient gates of a
minimum width of 1.1 metres to enable that pen or area to be evacuated onto the pitch in the time prescribed for
an emergency evacuation of that pen or area.


                                                        77
  18. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
different colour from the rest of the fence and marked "Emergency Exit".

  19. Where there is a perimeter fence in front of a pen or enclosure, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully
open during the period when spectators are in the pen or enclosure, wherever those in command feel that this
can safely be done. Whether they be fully open, partially open or closed, they should be kept unlocked
throughout the period when the pen or enclosure is occupied.

  20. Each gate in a perimeter fence affording access to the pitch from a pen or enclosure should be manned by
a steward or by a police officer when the pen or enclosure is occupied. Whether such manning should be by a
police officer or by a steward should be decided by the Police Commander. In either event, the Police
Commander should appoint one or more police officers with power to anthorise access through gates to the
pitch immediately in the event of an emergency.

  21. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there are
perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of a
nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
   22. All crush barriers should be visually inspected each year for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found to be
affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.
   23. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately (if this has not
already been done following the Interim Report) to ensure that it complies with the criteria contained in
Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessment of the maximum capacity figure for that pen or
terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 8 above, should reflect the fact.

Safety Certificates
  24. The Secretary of State should exercise his powers under either section 6(2) or section 15(A) of the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975 so as to make mandatory in Safety Certificates those conditions specified in the
original section 2(2) of the 1975 Act. So far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned "shall" should be
substituted for "may".

  25. In assessing these mandatory requirements in the Certificate for a particular ground, the local authority
should follow the Green Guide criteria. Once that is done, the resultant figures and terms for that ground
should be specified in the Safety Certificate and no variation from them should be permitted other than by
formal revision.
  26. Where a local authority incorporates any provision of the Green Guide into the Safety Certificate, other
than one within the scope of Recommendation 25 above, it should make clear whether that provision is to be
complied with absolutely or with discretionary flexibility.
  27. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate (if this has not already been done
following the Interim Report) by the responsible local authority, which should consult the club in respect of
which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the ambulance service and the building authority.
Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its object should be to ensure that the operative
conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a
matter of urgency following the findings and Recommendations in this Report.
 28. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports ground designated under the 1975 Act for
which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.
  29. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
Certificate should require to be renewed annually.
  30. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
amending and renewing Safety Certificates (if this has not already been done following the Interim

                                                       78
Report). Such review should require that there exists or is provided an accountable administrative structure
whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and effectively supervised by senior officers and
elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance with the local anthority’s rules.
   31. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group (if this has not
already been done) consisting of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire
and ambulance services and of the building authority. The Advisory Group should consult representatives of the
club and of a recognised supporters’ organisation on a regular basis. The Advisory Group’s terms of reference
should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and
attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority, and an effective
procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular written reports for
consideration by the local authority.

Duties of Each Football Club
  32. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured (if this has not already been
done following the Interim Repor0. Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile
remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate anticipated.
  33. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such as
to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the turnstiles
within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced accordingly. Since
this Recommendation includes terms and conditions within the scope of the original section 2(2)(c)(i) of the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 it should be given effect in the Safety Certificate (see Recommendation 24
above).
  34. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be reached
and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile operators for this
purpose.
  35. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before, throughout and at the end of a
match.
  36. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report). It should, in relation to the arrangements for each
match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simPle and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of
spectators to their appropriate viewing areas. Any redundant signs should be removed.
   37. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with the
information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs should
contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.
   38. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report) by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure
that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting spectators to the ground.
  39. Clubs should consider maintaining a record on computer of ticket sales before the day of the match, for
season tickets and tickets for all-ticket matches for seated areas, containing the names and addresses of those
purchasing tickets.
  40. All-ticket matches should be confined to those at which a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected.
When a match has been designated all-ticket, clubs should not sell tickets at the match and should take steps to
advise the spectators of both clubs accordingly.
  41. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.
  42. Clubs should recruit and retain sufficient competent stewards. They should be fit, active and robust, and
preferably between the ages of 18 and 55. Clubs should ensure that stewards are fully trained, aware of their
duties under Annex B of the Green Guide and under the statement of intent (see Recommendation 11) and able
to perform them.

                                                        79
  43. The club should provide a police control room which is:-

    (a) well placed, so as to command a good view of the whole pitch and of the spectator area surrounding it;
    (b) of sufficient size for the commander, his deputy and enough officers to operate the radios, telephones
        and CCTV screens. There should be space for others who may need from time to time to visit the room
        eg other senior officers, club management or a member of the emergency services;

    (c) well equipped with CCTV, radio and telephone facilities and, where necessary, sound-proofed against
         excessive crowd noise.

  It should be the duty of the club to provide a room and equipment to the satisfaction of the chief officer
nominated under Recommendation 44 below.


Police Planning
  44. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated sports ground or more
should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

   45. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground, and the pre-match briefing of all
officers on duty there, should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any is
detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

  46. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground should enable the police to cope
with any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

  47. Police planning should provide that ticketless fans should not be allowed to enter a designated sports
ground except in an emergency.

 48. Arrest procedures inside and outside designated sports grounds should be reviewed so as to keep to the
minimum the period during which an arresting officer is away from his post.

  49. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

  50. Consideration in consultation with the club should be given, especially for high-risk matches, to the
possibility of an early kick-off or a Sunday fixture.

  51. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television monitoring
outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers at turnstiles
or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled in the
interpretation and use of these data.

   52. Consideration should be given to the provision of a specific training course for senior officers presently
acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do so. Such a course should include training in the basic
strategy of policing football matches.

  53. Police authorities should review the charges they make to clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so
as to ensure that realistic charges are made. The Home Office should take steps to ensure consistency of
practice, subject to local discretion and the need to have regard to local circumstances.


Communications
   54. There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be used,
where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves.

                                                       80
  55. There should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate
with his senior officers round the ground.
   56. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines with
telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.
  57. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual areas
outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important announcements should
be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in the ground. This
arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every match.
  58. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.

Co-ordination of Emergency Services
   59. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
liaison concerning crowd safety at each designated sports ground.
  60. Before each match at a designated sports ground the police should ensure that the fire service and
ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of spectators
expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning the
control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control rooms of each of the
emergency services.
  61. Lines of communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from the police control room to the local
headquarters of all emergency services should be maintained at all times so that emergency calls can be made
instantly.
  62. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated sports ground of emergency vehicles from all three
services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility within
the ground itself.
  63. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for the
arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why they are
required.

First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
  64. There should be at each sports ground at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators.
The club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.
  65. There should be at each designated sports ground one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms
and the equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking
professional medical advice and should be made a requirement of every Safety Certificate.
   66. (a) At every match where the number of spectators is expected to exceed 2,000, the club should employ a
medical practitioner to be present and available to deal with any medical exigency at the ground. He should be
trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off
and should remain until half an hour after the end of the match. His whereabouts should be known to those in
the police control room and he should be immediately contactable.

       (b) At any match where the number of spectators is not expected to exceed 2,000, the club should make
arrangements to enable a medical practitioner to be summoned immediately to deal with any medical exigency
at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. The arrangements made should be
known to those in the police control room.
  67. At least one fully equipped ambulance from or approved by the appropriate ambulance authority should
be in attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.
  68. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should be
specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a requirement
of the Safety Certificate.

                                                       81
  69. A "major incident equipment vehicle", designed and equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties, should be
deployed in addition to other ambulance attendance at a match where a crowd in excess of 25,000 is expected.


Offences and Penalties
 70. Consideration should be given to creating an offence of selling tickets for and on the day of a football
match without authority from the home club to do so.

  71. Each of the following activities at a designated sports ground should be made a specific offence:-

    i.   throwing a missile;

    ii. chanting obscene or racialist abuse;

    iii. going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.
  72. Consideration should be given to extending the courts’ powers to make attendance centre orders for
football related offences on occasions of designated football matches. The provision should be capable of
imposition on an offender aged 21 or over and subject to a maximum of 72 hours in the case of an offender aged
17 or over.

  73. Consideration should be given to the use of electronic monitoring (tagging) in the sentencing of offenders
convicted of football related offences.

Green Guide
  74. As a matter of urgency, the Home Office should set up a body to revise the Green Guide in accordance
with this Report, these Recommendations and the Report of the Technical Working Party (Appendix 3).

  75. In any revision of the Green Guide, the values to be achieved by way of percentage recovery after the
required loading tests on crush barriers should be specified. Acceptable values for various materials should be
specified.

  76. When the Green Guide is revised, the need to inspect crush barriers for possible corrosion should be
specifically mentioned and emphasised.

sporting authorities, the managers of sports stadia and football clubs, architects and stadium designers in
France, Holland and Italy. Additionally, the Consular Department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
obtained information about sports stadia and sporting events from British Consular officials in Canada,
West Germany, Portugal, Spain and the United States.

Some 90 letters were received from Members of the House of Commons and three from Members of the
House of Lords. Some 1610 letters were received from the general public.

                           REPORT OF THE TECHNICAL WORKING PARTY

                                                                                             22 December 1989


Dear Sir Peter
You invited the Technical Working Party "to review technical aspects of the guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds; identify areas requiring clarification or amendment; and recommend accordingly." I have pleasure
in submitting its Report, which has been agreed by all members. Detailed supplementary notes dealing with
certain of the technical features will be available for your use in due course.

We note that the Guide is not confined to football grounds and stadia but includes guidance on all sports
grounds, and we have borne this in mind in our considerations. Although not within our terms of reference,
and for that reason not addressed in our Report, we recognise that efficient and effective stewarding is an
integral element of crowd control and safety. Our recommendations complement, rather than supplant, the
need for such stewarding.

The Technical Working Party met first on 18 October and held five formal day-long meetings supplemented
by many working papers and informal discussions during the period available for report. The heavy pressures
of the timetable could not have been accommodated without the fullest co-operation of those concerned, and
I record my thanks to all members of the Technical Working Party and to its Secretary for the integrity,
commitment and enthusiasm with which they approached the task.

                                                                                       LEONARD MAUNDER



                           REPORT OF THE TECHNICAL WORKING PARTY

The Green Guide
   1. The Technical Working Party recognises the valuable contributions of successive editions of the Guide
to Safety at Sports Grounds, commonly known as the Green Guide. Its scope and status are described in its
introduction as follows: "This booklet provides guidance to ground management, local authorities and
technical specialists such as engineers on measures for improving spectator safety at existing sports grounds.
It is a voluntary guide and has no legal force".

   2. In view of the variability of existing sports grounds in function and in scale, there are serious difficulties
in establishing comprehensive and general regulations, backed by legal force, to cover all the complex details
of design and construction. Adherence to the standards set by Building Regulations should provide a
measure of uniformity in respect of new work at sports grounds. Nevertheless, the Technical Working Party is
strongly of the opinion that a much higher degree of standardisation than presently prevails should be sought
in practice.
   3. It considers that a revised issue of the Green Guide should form the basis on which a designated ground
or stand is certified by the certifying authority, and recommends that any departures from its guidance on
technical provisions that may arise from local circumstances should be fully defined and should be subject to
approval in writing by the certifying authority.
ACentre of Expertise
  4. The Green Guide covers a wide range of material, much of which concerns the physical characteristics
of grounds. Its successive issues have been published in response to a number of serious accidents at football
grounds. This process has led to incremental advances in the Guide as experience has grown, but the
Technical Working Party does not believe that such a process, although essential, is by itself sufficient to cope
with present-day requirements.

   5. Many British football grounds were first constructed a long time ago, and improvements have been
introduced largely on an individual basis. A central body of knowledge applicable to the complex design of


                                                       89
such grounds has been conspicuously absent although a start has now been made. As a result, progress has
been piecemeal.
   6. The Technical Working Party considers that this is a serious defect. A continuous and expanding body
of public knowledge, drawn from the relevant professional fields, is required to provide a basis for good
individual designs at modern standards. At a time when substantial improvements are under consideration,
including a higher proportion of seated accommodation, it is imperative to establish and to disseminate
rigorous standards of design if expectations are to be fulfilled. The work of organisations in other countries,
including the Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano (CONI), can provide a valuable reference. The
Technical Working Party recognises, too, the important work undertaken in this country by the Sports
Council. Its recent guide to the planning, design and management of indoor arenas is a noteworthy attempt
to draw together a considerable body of research and practical experience. Similarly, other work on outdoor
stadia has taken place and is currently proceeding under the Council’s aegis. It is important that resulting
publications should be widely disseminated and that any guidance on outdoor stadia should make particular
reference to the structural aspects of safety, comfort and crowd control.
   7. The Technical Working Party therefore recommends the formation of a central body, under a title such
as the Advisory Council for Sports Grounds, to provide an authoritative source of knowledge for all those
involved in the design and construction of outdoor stadia. A detailed specification of its structure and
funding is not proposed at this stage but, as envisaged, its members would be drawn from the relevant
professional fields and would commission specialist advice when necessary. It would be independent of any
Inspectorate. The relationship of such a body to other organisations is a matter for further discussion, but it
is suggested that the Football Association and the Sports Council might wish to play leading roles.
Seating and Standing
  8. The Technical Working Party notes that FIFA has agreed regulations on seating for certain classes of
football matches, and that the regulations are to be imposed within a short time-scale. It also recognises that
the British tradition of standing on terraces runs counter to these international requirements.
   9. It is clear that if British clubs are to continue within the international community, they will be obliged
to close their standing accommodation for matches that fall within the FIFA definition. For other matches,
the Technical Working Party recognises that, whilst standing accommodation is not intrinsically unsafe, the
benefits to spectator comfort and crowd control brought about by all-seater stadia are likely to accelerate the
move towards such venues. The Technical Working Party accepts, however, that although the introduction of
all-seater stadia for leading, well-supported football clubs may be both beneficial and practical, clubs in the
lower divisions may find it less so and the removal of all standing accommodation at these grounds may
affect their viability. Alterations to seating from standing arrangements at existing grounds may have both
design and cost implications through the impact on such matters as spectator sight-lines and crowd density.
   10. In addition, it must be recognised that there are many sports (horse, greyhound, motor racing and car
rallying for example) where the nature of the sport favours the mobility of large sections of the crowd and
where viewing from standing areas is an essential element. Any recommendations towards all-seater stadia
must therefore be carefully worded.

Capacities
  11. The Technical Working Party recognises that the safe allowable capacity of any viewing area, whether
seated or standing, is the least of(i) its holding capacity, (ii) the number of persons who can leave through a
normal exit system within a prescribed time at the end of an event, (iii) the number of persons who can leave
through an emergency exit system within a prescribed time, and (iv) the number of persons who can be
admitted through the turnstiles serving that area within one hour.
   12. The theoretical holding capacity of a seated viewing area is simply the number of seats in good
condition which comply with the relevant Green Guide recommendations including those relating to
distance from exits and gangways and size and spacing. Determination of the holding capacity of a viewing
terrace or slope is not so simple; factors that must be taken into account include the strength and spacing of
the crush-barriers, the position of gangways, the dimensions and physical state of the steps, the effective
standing area, and the acceptable packing density.
   13. A packing density of 5.4/m2 is recommended in the current Green Guide as the maximum allowable
figure for terraces and viewing slopes that meet all the specified guidelines. A reduced figure of 2.7/m2 is


                                                      9O
presently recommended for areas deviating materially from the guidelines. The Technical Working Party sees
no point in retaining reference to the lower figure and recommends that there should be no lower limit to the
reduction; ie if the enclosure had such poor safety standards that it was totally unfit as a viewing area the
figure should be zero.

  14. As to the maximum figures, the Technical Working Party concludes that a uniformly distributed
density of 5.4/m2 should be safe in static conditions where the terraces are in full compliance with the Green
Guide. It recognises, however, that there will be variations of density within a given enclosure, and allowance
should be made to accommodate this factor in the final determination.

   15. The Technical Working Party recommends that the maximum allowable average packing density
determined by the Inquiry should establish a general reference for certifying authorities. For an individual
ground, the packing density applicable to a given standing area should be derived from this figure, the full
figure for areas in good condition and reduced figures for areas in poorer condition. Detailed calculations of
holding capacities should then be determined on the basis of the agreed packing density for that specific
enclosure or other relevant factors. These calculations should take into account specific features of the
crush-barriers and fences and of step dimensions as illustrated in the Green Guide. The Technical Working
Party recommends a thorough review of the examples currently contained in Chapter 16 of the Green Guide,
and the inclusion of appropriate diagrams.

Structural Elements
   16. It is a fundamental requirement of safety that structures at grounds should provide spectators with
safe accommodation and safe means of ingress and egress. They should also enable police and stewards to
exert proper control over crowd movements. Ifa conflict should occur between these objectives, a substantial
re-arrangement may be required; in no circumstances should safety standards be compromised. The
Technical Working Party recommends that references to sub-divisions in Chapter 14 of the Green Guide be
reviewed with these considerations in mind, and that the Chapter as a whole should reflect these principles
more positively.

Separation of Viewing Areas and Pitch
   17. The Technical Working Party recognises the importance of physical barriers as deterrents to pitch
invasions. It also recognises that not all viewing areas present the same risk, and recommends that
consideration be given to differentiating those areas requiring higher levels of security from other areas, such
as seated accommodation and members’ enclosures, where a lesser degree of security might be acceptable.
   18. The general principle of separation endorsed by the Technical Working Party is that the means
adopted should provide sufficient security against pitch incursions to enable the police to take timely and
effective action should such incidents occur. Clearly a balance has to be struck between crowd control and
safety.
   19. A configuration recommended for wider consideration consists of a perimeter barrier on the
pitch-side backed by a parallel and continuous crush-barrier on the terrace-side, set back from the perimeter
barrier so as to provide a clear walk-way between the two; except in emergencies, spectators would not be
allowed to enter the walk-way. Such an arrangement would reduce the risks associated with a common feature
of British grounds, namely that the front steps of terraces are substantially lower than the level of the pitch:
immediate attention should be given to the elimination of this hazard.

   20. The Technical Working Party recommends that the maximum height of perimeter fences should be
 determined in relation to the UEFA standard of 2.2m. It also recommends the removal of overhanging
 sections and spiked or barbed-wire attachments at the tops offences.

    21. A form of separation increasingly adopted in new stadia is the dry moat. To be effective, a dry moat
 must be sufficiently wide and deep, and should be protected by fences on both sides to ensure that spectators
 and players do not fall into it. Where enough space is available, a moat may offer an attractive solution, but
 its application to older grounds is likely to be restricted by limitations of space.

 Emergency Access to Pitch
   22. The Technical Working Party recommends that emergency access to the pitch should be provided
 from all adjacent viewing areas. It considers the provision of gates or gaps in any formal barrier to be in all
 cases advantageous for the evacuation of adjacent enclosures and essential except where adequate, safe


                                                      91
alternative arrangements exist. Where fences, barriers or moats are installed the majority view of the
Technical Working Party is that there should be clear gangways leading to emergency exits on to the pitch.
Such gangways must be properly identified and kept clear at all times. The exit gates or gaps should be at least
1.1 metres wide or as wide as the gangways feeding into them, whichever is the larger and should be sufficient
in dimensions and spacing to allow evacuation of the enclosure within a prescribed time. The Working Party
recorded a minority view that the need to police gangways exacerbated friction on terraces, and that
gangways were not always essential for proper crowd control and safety.

Crush Barriers
  23. A review of the procedures for inspection and testing of barriers is recommended. The Technical
Working Party considers that greater emphasis should be given to thorough recorded and certified annual
visual inspections of all crush barriers. Particular attention should be given to the development of corrosion.
  24. It is further recommended that 25% ofbarriers, evenly spaced through each enclosure as designated by
a competent engineer, continue to be tested each year. In addition, all barriers which the inspection has
identified as of possibly sub-standard condition should also be tested.

   25. The adopted test method should be capable ofapplying to barrier rail, post and foundation anchorage,
a loading equivalent to a uniformly distributed load 1.20 x the design load of the barrier as at present.
   26. The test procedure should be revised in line with current practice for structural testing to incorporate
(i) a detailed visual inspection of the barrier, (ii) a bedding-in cycle taken to a percentage of the design loading
and (iii) a single cycle of proof testing taken as at present to 1.20 x the design loading. Deflections at all
significant points should be recorded.

  27. After the full proof load has been held for a minimum of five minutes the deflections should be
recorded prior to release of loading and the permanent residual unloaded deflections recorded after the load
has been released.
  28. The Technical Working Party recommends the adoption of two criteria for acceptable structural
performance (i) that no significant defects, including corrosion, are revealed by inspection and (ii) that the
percentage recovery of deflections after release of the load during proof-testing achieves acceptable values.
The specific values required will depend on the materials of construction.

  29. The Technical Working Party recommends that the distinction currently drawn in the Green Guide
between "peak" and "non-peak" viewing areas for the purpose of assessing barrier spacing should be
abolished. All areas should comply with the peak viewing specifications.
Stands
  30. A substantial part of Chapter 10 of the Green Guide, ’Roofed Stands with Seated Accommodation’,
deals with temporary structures. It is recommended that this material should be placed in a separate Chapter,
and that it should give explicit references as required to British Standards and to applicable regulations.

  31. The remainder, which might be called ’Covered Standing and Seated Accommodation’, should clarify
the special requirements for safety that are involved, noting that fire risk is not the only hazard and that
statutory control of the requirements may be vested in different authorities. Appropriate references to
Building Regulations should be made. It is important to ensure that all spectators can be cleared into safe
protected escape routes within prescribed times, although such routes need not be exits from the stand as a
whole.

Ingress/Egress
  32. The current Chapters on Ingress and Egress in the Green Guide (Chapters 5 and 6) contain much
useful information, but are nonetheless in need of some revision. Consideration was given by the Technical
Working Party to the possible amalgamation of features common to both ingress and egress, but despite the
common ground it is recognised that emphases might well differ. The Working Party does not therefore
recommend amalgamation of the individual Chapters.

Ingress
  33. The Technical Working Party felt that Chapter 5 needed expansion to incorporate additional clauses
on (a) the positive counting and recording of those passing through each turnstile; (b) the location of

                                                       92
amenities inside the ground to avoid obstructing or disrupting the flow between turnstile and enclosures; (c)
the sub-division of enclosures; (d) the adequacy of well distributed entrances into large enclosures to
facilitate even packing; and (e) the design of entrances so as to avoid local pressure on spectators caused, for
example, by downward ramps. Informative diagrams should be adopted and general principles laid down,
wherever possible. The Technical Working Party would not favour the introduction of numerical examples
which might, in any event, be difficult to establish. It views the current maximum notional flow rate per
turnstile of 750 persons per hour (as set out in paragraph 47 Green Guide) as too high, and recommends a
figure of 500 as the median for a normal turnstile. Furthermore, it recommends that variations up or down
be approved by the certifying authority, subject to a maximum upper limit of 660 persons per hour.

Egress
  34. Greater cross-referencing with other Chapters is required, and the Technical Working Party favours
expansion or amendment of a number of paragraphs. In particular, the density figure set out in paragraph 54
in respect of reservoir areas is felt to be too high, and the members of the Technical Working Party
recommend that, where reservoir areas cannot be removed from egress routes, a lower density of 35-40
persons per 10 sq metres be substituted. The Technical Working Party favours greater emphasis on
networking, and believes that the Green Guide should include a stipulation that each ground produce proper,
networked plans, delineating all aspects of ingress/egress.

Enclosures/Turnstiles
   35. The Technical Working Party strongly recommends that there should be a direct one-to-one
relationship between banks of turnstiles and enclosures in order to maintain accurate counts of entries. A
review of the current state of League grounds had shown that sub-divisions such as had occurred at
Hillsborough were uncommon, and had generally been initiated by police for crowd control. Where such
sub-divisions do exist, it is imperative that the total number of spectators entering each sub-division should
be counted separately.

Stairways and Ramps
  36. The Technical Working Party notes the dangers presented by stairways and ramps, particularly those
used by the public in large numbers, and recommends extensive redrafling of the Green Guide to present
more sharply the hazards involved. It recognises that the standards of safety required for stairways and ramps
which form part of the access between enclosures and an exit and those which exist as gangways within
enclosures differ and recommends that the differences be explained in more detail. Particular attention
should be given by certifying authorities to acceptable upper limits on the gradients of ramps and stairways.
The maximum gradient for ramps set out in the current Green Guide was felt acceptable.

  37. Similarly, the Working Party believes that the channelling of flows by the provision of handrails should
be given greater emphasis. The recommended width of channel for both stairways and ramps should not
exceed three persons (unit widths) in line abreast, and the width of up to 1.8 metres permitted by paragraph
76 should therefore be reduced accordingly. Handrails should extend, by at least 300mm beyond the top and
bottom of any stairway or ramp.
  38. The difference between handrails, balustrades and barriers on or near the top and bottom of stairways
and ramps, and their appropriate strength requirements, needs to be clarified.

  39. The Technical Working Party recommends the inclusion in the Green Guide of a greater number of
diagrams illustrating the potentially hazardous situations in relation to stairways and ramps and of the
principles behind the provisions.

Inspections and Tests
  40. Inspection and tests of all equipment and structures at grounds are vital features of good operation.
Their range is wide, extending from visual inspection before and after each event to regular testing of
structural components. It is a matter of serious concern that the interpretation of requirements by those
responsible is unacceptably variable. The Technical Working Party considers that action should be taken to
ensure that common high standards of inspection and test are realised, and makes the following
recommendations.

  (i) The Green Guide should include a comprehensive tabulation of inspections and tests covering the
      essential technical features of grounds. It should prescribe the minimum frequencies at which the
      inspections and tests should be conducted.

                                                     93
  (ii) The required levels ofcompetence ofthose carrying out the inspections and tests should be defined.

  (iii) Records of the results of inspections and tests, including the identification of defects and the remedies
        adopted, should be certified by those carrying out the work.

  (iv) A national Inspectorate should be established to oversee the adoption of common standards of
       inspection and test. Its terms of reference should include the compilation and maintenance of a
       national register of organisations employed to carry out inspections and tests; central recording of the
       extent and type of the inspections and tests adopted at individual grounds; and the provision of advice
       on inspection and test for those responsible for carrying out the work and for certifying authorities. It
       would be in the interest of common standards if an Inspectorate of this kind dealt with the grounds of
       all relevant sports, and consideration should be given to its formation through an association of their
       governing bodies.

Fire Safety
  41. There is general recognition amongst Technical Working Party members that the current Chapter on
Fire Safety (Chapter 11) is well-defined. It contains much useful advice on egress and means of escape,
application of which is not restricted to fire risks and which would bear repetition in other Chapters.

  42. The Technical Working Party considers that it is essential to maintain simple, clear lines of authority
and communication; independent input from individual bodies is to be avoided. With that in mind, its
members believe that consultation on all safety matters should be directly with the certifying authority who,
in turn, would consult with the fire, police, and other authorities.

Emergency/Auxiliary Power
  43. The Technical Working Party considers that the current Green Guide contains insufficient
information on auxiliary power. It recommends a separate chapter on the topic with a requirement that
emergency power should be sufficient to maintain an adequate level of lighting, and public address system
and to operate any electronic gates, alarms etc for a period of three hours from the time of failure of the
normal supply.

Communications
  44. The Technical Working Party considers that too little weight has in the past been attached to the need
for a comprehensive communications system, capable of reaching both inside and outside the ground.

  45. Chapter 12 of the Green Guide therefore requires substantial amendment to reflect the importance of
effective’ communications systems, the need to make use of high-technology equipment, and the value of
closer co-operation between club and police personnel. The Technical Working Party considers that Interim
Recommendations 31-34 should be retained permanently and incorporated into the Green Guide.

Disabled Spectators
  46. The current Green Guide fails to address the specific problems encountered by disabled spectators
and the Technical Working Party recommends the introduction of a Chapter to cover these aspects. It should
deal in particular with Ingress and Egress and with the provision of self-contained viewing areas.



                              SUMMARY OF MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS
The Green Guide
   1. A higher degree of standardisation in stadia design and construction is required. An updated and
revised Green Guide should form the basis on which a designated ground or stand is certified. It should
incorporate appropriate diagrams and refer to relevant Building Regulations.

Advisory Body
  2. There should be a single, central body (called perhaps the Advisory Council for Sports Grounds) to
provide an authoritative source of knowledge for all those involved in the design and construction of stadia.


                                                       94
Seating/Standing
  3. Whilst standing accommodation is not intrinsically unsafe, all-seater stadia bring benefits to spectator
comfort, safety and crowd control. The implementation of higher proportions of seated accommodation
should be governed by common high standards of design and construction.

Capacities
  4. Capacity depends on standards of ingress, egress and safety generally as well as the acceptable packing
density and the effective area of the accommodation. The current maximum packing density of 5.4/m2
recommended in the Green Guide for standing terraces should be safe in static conditions where the terraces
are in full compliance with the Green Guide. It should be recognised, however, that densities normally vary
over an enclosure, and an allowable average figure should reflect this consideration. The reduced figure of
2.7/m2 should be abolished and there should be no specified lower limit. If an enclosure has such poor safety
standards that it is totally unfit as a viewing area, the figure should be zero.
Separation of Viewing Areas and Pitch
  5. Consideration should be given to different perimeter arrangements appropriate for different areas of a
ground.
  6. The means of separation adopted should provide sufficient protection against pitch incursions without
compromising spectator safety. The maximum height offences should be determined in relation to the UEFA
standard of 2.2 metres. Overhanging sections and spiked or barbed-wire attachments should be removed.
  7. Attention should be given to the elimination of spectator viewing from front steps of terraces which are
substantially lower than the level of the pitch.
Emergency Access to the Pitch
 8. Emergency access to the pitch should be provided from all adjacent viewing areas.

   9. Exit gaps or gates should be at least 1.1 metres wide or as wide as the gangways feeding into them,
whichever is the larger. All gangways must be clearly identified and must be kept clear of spectators in normal
circumstances.
Crush Barriers
   10. A review of the procedures for inspection and testing of barriers is recommended. Greater emphasis
should be given to thorough recorded and certified annual visual inspections of all crush barriers, and to the
establishment of an unambiguous testing procedure.
Stands
   11. The Green Guide should contain a separate Chapter on temporary structures, with appropriate
references to applicable regulations and British Standards.
Ingress
   12. The current maximum notional flow rate per turnstile of 750 persons per hour is too high. A figure of
500 should be adopted as the median with a maximum upper limit of 660 persons per hour. Variations from
the median must be approved by the certifying authority.
Egress
  13. Where reservoir areas cannot be removed, a lower density of 35-40 persons per 10 sq metres should be
adopted. Each ground should produce networked plans delineating all aspects of ingress and egress.

Enclosures/Turnstiles
   14. There should be a direct one-to-one relationship between banks of turnstiles and corresponding
enclosures. Where sub-divisions exist, it is imperative that the totals entering each sub-division are counted
separately.
Stairways and Ramps
  15. The recommended width of channels should not exceed three persons (unit widths) in line abreast.
Handrails should extend by at least 300mm beyond the top and bottom of any stairway or ramp. The design
and strength of handrails, barriers and protection on or near stairways or ramps should be clearly defined.
Ramps should not produce dangerous crowd pressures.


                                                     95
Inspection and Tests
   16. Action should be taken to ensure that common high standards of inspection and test are realised. A
national Inspectorate should be established to oversee the adoption of such standards. Its terms of reference
should include compilation and maintenance of a national register of organisations employed to carry out
inspections and tests; central recording of the extent and type of inspections and tests at individual grounds;
and the provision of advice.

Communications
  17. The Green Guide should be amended substantially to emphasise the importance of effective
communications systems capable of reaching both inside and outside the ground.

Disabled Spectators
  18. The Green Guide should contain a separate Chapter to cover this subject.

                    FINAL REPORT OF MR JUSTICE POPPLEWELL’S INQUIRY

                          CHAPTER 2: HISTORY OF PREVIOUS INQUIRIES
  2.1 When my Interim Report was published, it might have been thought by some that the suggestions
which I set out had only recently been considered. It was said to be unfair to expect the football clubs to have
taken earlier steps to arrange their affairs. It was urged that they should now be entitled to more time and
more money in order to deal with the problems of crowd control and safety at their grounds. The problem of
crowd control and safety had, so it was said, suddenly arisen. I have to say that almost all the matters into
which I have been asked to inquire and almost all the solutions I have proposed have been previously
considered in detail by many distinguished Inquiries over a period of sixty years.
The Shortt Report
  2.2 On 11 June 1923, the then Secretary of State for the Home Department asked the Rt Hon Edward
Shortt KC to form a Committee to inquire, amongst other things, into arrangements made to deal with the
abnormally large attendances on special occasions, especially attendances at athletic grounds. This arose
from disorder which occurred at Wembley Stadium on the occasion of the first Cup Final on 28 April 1923.
The Committee reported on 13 March 1924. The Report was presented to Parliament and published as
Command Paper 2088 at the princely sum of 6d.
  2.3 About responsibility for control inside grounds the Report had this to say:

  "As regards the general question of the apportionment of responsibility inside the ground as between the
  police and the ground authority, the principle to be followed should, in our judgment, be that the police should
  be responsible for all matters appertaining to the preservation of law and order and that for arrangements for
  the convenience of the public the ground authority should be responsible. It is, however, most important not
  only that the police arrangements should be under the control of a single officer, but also that the duties for
  which the ground authority is responsible should be assigned to a definite individual, who should be
  competent to give instructions and to deal with any incident which arises. If responsibility is definitely
  allocated in this matter it appears to us that, in ordinary circumstances, there need be no difficulty in this
  division of duties and that no disadvantage need result from the existence of dual control so long as the closest
  co-operation is maintained between the two authorities at all times. We are of the opinion, however, that if any
  emergency arises or there appears to be the slightest probability of a disturbance, it is essential that control
  should pass into the hands of one individual, and we recommend that, in the case of grounds providing
  accommodation for more than 10,000 persons, on all occasions when specially large attendances are
  anticipated or for other reasons unusual excitement is to be expected, arrangements should be concerted
  beforehand by which one individual can at any moment take control of the situation."
   2.4. That paragraph of the report continued:

   "The question in such circumstances would have become one of the preservation of law and order and we
   therefore have no doubt that the control should then pass into the hands of the senior police officer present,
   and we consider that such officer would be justified in any circumstances, whether in accordance with a
   pre-arranged scheme or not, in assuming control if he considered it necessary for the purpose of the
   restoration of order. As part of the arrangements for this purpose we think that, in the very large grounds,
   there should be a central control box in telephonic communication with all parts of the ground and that the
   principal police and ground officials should be stationed there so that they may be in constant touch with the
   situation."...(Paragraph 22).

   2.5 About stewards the Report said:
   "We understand that there is no uniform practice with regard to the employment of stewards at sports
   grounds, that in some cases they are only used to show spectators into the seating accommodation, and
   that, in cases where stewards are employed for packing of the standing room, they are only employed when
   there are specially large crowds. We consider it desirable in the interests of safety that, for the purpose of
   handling a crowd, stewards should be employed in any case where the crowd is likely to approach the capacity
   of the ground. For seating accommodation stewards should always be employed. It is in the highest degree
   important that any such stewards should be properly trained in their work and intimately acquainted with the


                                                       97
 part of the ground placed under their charge. We doubt whether it is practicable to secure suitable men for
 this purpose unless they are given continual experience in the work, and we therefore recommend that every
 ground with a capacity exceeding 10,000 which provides terraced accommodation for its spectators should
 maintain, or have a call upon, an adequate staff of efficient stewards, and should ensure that they keep
 proficient by requiring them to perform duty at frequent intervals. Stewards should be organised as a
 disciplined body and should act under the control and supervision of their own officers. They should wear a
 distinctive badge of authority, which they should not be able easily to discard." (Paragraph 27).

  2.6 The Report had this to say about precautions against fire:
 "We haVe been somewhat surprised to find that in many cases little or not precaution is taken against the risk
 of fire in stands. We do not suppose that either the risk or the consequences of fire would be so serious in an
 open stand as in a closed building, but we consider it most important that adequate arrangements should be
 made to deal with any outbreak which might occur." (Paragraph 40).

but concluded generally:
  "We are assured that these governing bodies are only too anxious to secure that their sport is carried on under
  conditions which will promote the public safety, and we feel that at this stage it is safe to leave the matter to
  them." (Paragraph 47).

The Moelwyn Hughes Report
  2.7 The next report (published as Cmnd 6846) arose out of the disaster at Bolton Wanderers’ Football
Ground on 9 March 1946. Mr R Moelwyn Hughes KC was appointed by the then Home Secretary to conduct
an enquiry into the circumstances of the disaster which arose by the presence of some 85,000 spectators.
50,000 had been expected. Because of the press of people in an enclosure two barriers collapsed and 33
people were killed.

  2.8 It is interesting to observe that the previous best attendance at Bolton in the 1945-46 season had been
43,000 and it was amply policed by a force of 60. On this occasion there were 103 police to control 85,000
spectators, which is about 1/10th of the present ratio of police to spectators at football grounds both inside
and outside the ground.
  2.9 Mr Hughes made a number of recommendations. He said:

  "Burnden Park is typical of most home grounds of the leading football teams in the country. They have grown
  stage by stage from humble beginnings on sites acquired when the large gates of these days were not
  anticipated, or when the clubs had not achieved eminence. It would be idle to suggest that the grounds, or
  large sections of them, should be rebuilt, but if they are to be made reasonably safe and if the risk of repeating
  the tragedy of Burnden Park is to be avoided, then, I have formed the clear view that the following steps must
  be taken..." (Page 10).
  2.10 The recommendations included inspections of the enclosures, scientific calculation of the maximum
number to be allowed entry, counting those entering the ground by mechanical means and central
co-ordination of the system, all to ensure the admission of a safe number of spectators.

  2.11 So far as future regulation was concerned the Report said:
  "The preceding safety measures cannot be secured without legislation. A Departmental Committee reporting
  on Crowds to a previous Home Secretary in 1924 (Cd 2088) anaemically recommended that adequate
  provision for safety be left to the pressure of the governing bodies in sport. The most important of these was,
  of course, the Football Association, which had not deigned to appear before the Committee...
  The legislation should empower the Home Secretary to issue general regulations for different kinds of
  grounds and the broad conditions necessary for safety.
  No ground of any considerable size should be opened to the public until it has been licenced by, I suggest as an
  appropriate licensing authority, the local authority. The issue of the licence would depend upon satisfying the
  authority as to the construction and equipment of the ground, its compliance with regulations and the
  proposed maximum figures of admission to the different parts."


                                                        98
  2.12 Mr Hughes went on to say:
 "Compliance with the recommendations of this Report will cost money. They will involve grounds in a loss of
 gate money on popular days... The insurance for greater safety for the public demands a premium."
Mr Hughes ended his report by saying:
  "I earnestly hope that, if the proposals I have made in this Report, or similar suggestions, commend
  themselves to you, Parliament will not be slow in granting you the necessary powers." (Pages 11-12).
The Chester Report
  2.13 Mr Hughes’ words fell on deaf ears. It was another 22 years before there was a further report
commissioned by the Government on the problems of football. In June 1966, the then Secretary of State for
Education and Science appointed Mr Norman Chester CBE, as he then was (Warden of Nuffield College,
Oxford), to chair an Enquiry. His terms of reference were:
  "To enquire into the state of Association Football at all levels, including the organisation, management,
  finance and administration, and the means by which the game may be developed for the public good; and to
  make recommendations."
  2.14 Mr Chester made this observation about crowd behaviour:
  "In recent years there has been an increase in disorderly behaviour by spectators. During the period
  1946-1960 there were 195 cases brought to the attention of the FA, an average of 13 per season. In the
  following six seasons 148 cases were reported, an average of 25 per season. The matter was discussed some
  time ago at a meeting between representatives of a number of police forces (including the British Transport
  Police), the Football Association and the Football League. Both these governing bodies have been very
  concerned at this development."
  2.15 The Report continued:
  "We have not been able to devote the time and resources to the study of this problem which its complexity
  deserves. We very much welcome the initiative of the Birmingham Research Group, of which Dr J A
  Harrington is Research Director and have been fortunate enough to see the Group’s preliminary report. We
  are sure that its findings will be of value to all concerned." (Page 97).
The Harrington Report
  2.16 This was made to the then Minister of Sport.1 It observed:
  "Some spectators carry knives, hammers, sticks and spikes, choppers, and other offensive weapons like
  powdered pepper which are not necessarily used for violent purposes but may be used in threatening displays.
  There is also the problem of singing or chanting bawdy or obscene songs and phrases some of which are also
  threatening and provocative." (Page 8).
  2.17 About riots the Report said:
  "While such riots must be regarded as almost unknown accompaniments of football in this country, their
  potential seriousness and danger were exemplified recently by football riots in Turkey, where many people
  were reported killed. While comparable riots seem unlikely here, it would be foolish to rule out the possibility
  of much more serious crowd disturbances at football matches than we have yet experienced." (Page 9).
  2.18 The Report regretted inactivity thus far:
  "The question of public safety and crowd control at football matches was dealt with by a departmental
  committee report published in 1924 (Cond. 2088) and the inquiry into the disaster at the Bolton Wanderers
  Football Ground in 1946 (Cond. 6946)... Unfortunately the most helpful suggestions in these reports have
  often been ignored, though the committee’s recommendations do carry some weight with boards of football
  clubs".
  2.19 The Report went on:
  "The absence of national legislation outlining minimum standards of safety and amenity at football grounds
  means that some club managements do not feel obliged to put their grounds into a state considered by the
  police to be necessary for crowd control." (Page 33).

                                                           99
 2.20 And continued:
 "We feel that improved ground facilities would not only help to deal with the hooligan problem but do
 something towards its prevention. Clubs often seem keener to spend money on the purchase of players than to
 undertake any major spending on ground improvement which would increase safety and make hooligan
 control easier. The loss of revenue which a club may suffer from alterations may be the determining factor.
 There is of course no obligation on a club to convert a ground which can accommodate 50,000 to one which
 takes a smaller number in conditions of greater safety and comfort. Letters from members of the public
 suggest that already some are staying away because of their dislike of poor facilities, overcrowding, and
 disturbances, so that the neglect of ground improvement may ultimately be self defeating." (Page 34).
  2.21 So far as responsibility is concerned, the Report said:

 "We think that those responsible for club management and the governing bodies of football should accept far
 more responsibility for keeping their crowds in order. This applies not only within the stadium itself but to
 club supporters travelling in groups to and from matches. One gets the impression that some clubs disclaim
 any responsibility for the behaviour of their supporters and if the atmosphere of a Roman holiday is not
 deliberately fostered it is looked on with considerable tolerance. Football matches are commercial enterprises
 conducted for profit on private premises and clubs have therefore a heavy responsibility for keeping order and
 safety for the public on their premises." (Pages 35-36).

  2.22 In its summary the Report concluded:

  "The solution of the problem of hooliganism in the football stadium is ultimately the responsibility of
  individual clubs who must each deal with it in the light of local circumstances. While a few clubs are
  exemplary in their attitude to the problem others are laissez-faire and need persuasion to take a more active
  role in trying to control hooliganism in their own grounds. This laissez-faire attitude does not help the police
  in their attempts to deal with the matter." (Page 56).
The Lang Report
  2.23 Shortly thereafter, a Working Party under the chairmanship of Sir John Lang GCB and including a
number of distinguished members, was appointed by the then Minister with special responsibility for Sport
to examine the problems involved in football crowd behaviour to which attention had been called a few
months previously by the Harrington Report. Sir John’s Report was presented on 21 November 1969.

  2.24 By way of introduction it said:
  "The Working Party was dealing with a subject which has been discussed almost ad nauseam during recent
  years. Not unexpectedly the Working Party has not found a single simple solution for a problem which is
  often due to a combination of factors..." (Page 3).
    2.25 The members ofthe Inquiry witnessed the demonstration of CCTV equipment and reported:
    "... the view was formed that closed circuit television could be of value in the general subject of crowd
    control and.., would be an important factor in preventing misbehaviour by spectators at grounds. It was a
    refinement which most of the top class clubs could be expected eventually to have as a matter of course."
    (Page 9).
  2.26 About alcohol the Report said:
  "There can be no doubt that consumption of alcohol is an important factor in crowd misbehaviour, both
  because it stimulates quarrelsomeness and because empty bottles are dangerous missiles. There would be no
  advantage in refusing licence facilities to football club grounds - this would merely stimulate spectators to
  bring their supplies from outside." (Page 14).
The Wheatley Report
  2.27 On 4 February 1971 the Rt Hon I,ord Wheatley was asked by the then Secretary of State for the
Home Department and the then Secretary of State for Scotland to make an independent appraisal of the
effectiveness of existing arrangements for crowd safety at sports grounds in Great Britain, and of the
improvements which could be brought about within the present framework of the law, and to consider the
nature of any alterations in the law which appeared to be needed. This arose from the disaster at Ibrox Park
where 66 spectators died.


                                                      100
  2.28 On 16 March 1972 Lord Wheatley completed his Report and it was presented to Parliament and
published by HMSO as Cmnd. 4952.

  2.29 The Report contained a technical Appendix. Following the Report, the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1975 was passed. A licensing system involving the issue of a safety certificate for designated grounds was
introduced and supporting guidance (the Green Guide) was published. In his Report Lord Wheatley said:

  "I recognise that a decision to introduce a licensing system for grounds along the lines I have recommended
  may cause anxiety to some football clubs and football administrators. As I see it, their misgivings are
  associated with a fear that such stringent conditions might be attached to the granting of a licence that
  many clubs may not be able to afford the cost and some may have to go out of business." (Paragraph 66).

  2.30 "My answer to that is this. My task was to consider the problem of crowd safety at the grounds. Clubs
  which charge the public for admission have a duty to see that their grounds are reasonably safe for spectators.
  That is a primary consideration. It is accordingly necessary that some standards should be imposed and
  observed. This has been recognised by the football authorities themselves ... I have canvassed all the
  alternatives that have been proposed or which I personally thought were reasonable to consider, and the one
  which I decided was best to meet the situation in the interest of the public is the licensing system by a local
  authority. There is nothing new in this proposal. It has been mooted for almost fifty years. It can come as no
  surprise to the football world, and in the light of happenings over the years the demand for an independent
  appraisal and determination of the safety of grounds becomes almost irresistible. I certainly cannot resist it."
  (Paragraph 67).

  2.31 Lord Wheatley ended his Report by saying:

  "I trust that this Report may be of assistance to you in deciding what should be done to solve this
  important question of crowd safety in football grounds. One thing is certain. The public demand for
  something to be done has been growing over the years. I am sure I am reflecting public opinion when I say
  that something must be done now. The evidence certainly supports that view."

The McElhone Report
  2.32 In October 1976 the then Secretary of State for Scotland asked Mr Frank McElhone MP to chair a
Working Group on Football Crowd Behaviour.

  "to consider the problems caused by some Scottish football supporters and to make recommendations to
  the Scottish Football Association and other organisations concerned."

  Among the membership of the Working Group were representatives from the football authorities, from the
football clubs and the Strathclyde Police.

  2.33 In the introduction to the Report2, Mr McElhone said:

  "There is no simple solution to the problem; it is but one of the manifestations of anti-social behaviour
  besetting society in general today. We have however in our findings arrived at a number of conclusions and
  recommendations which we hope, given a commitment to implement them on the part of all those most
  closely concerned, will go some way towards reducing the problem of hooliganism at football matches and
  by so doing turn football grounds once again into places of entertainment where parents can take their
  children to enjoy, in relative comfort and safety, the pleasures of our national game."

  2.34 The Report observed that:

  "A hooligan is a hooligan no matter where he operates and the fact that his behaviour is conspicuous at a
  football match has very often nothing to do with the game itself." (Paragraph 4).

   Mr McElhone saw the problem as one of trying to reduce, or at least contain, the incidence of hooliganism
at football matches without restricting the pleasure of the majority of supporters.


2Report of the Working Group on Football Crowd Behaviour: Scottish Education Department/HMSO 1977.


                                                         101
   2.35 So far as drink was concerned, the Report recommended that it should be an offence for a spectator
to carry or attempt to carry alcohol into a football ground; that is should be an offence to be in possession of
alcohol within the ground or to attempt to gain admission while drunk. The Report recommended that more
people who were physically capable of carrying out the duties of enforcement would have to be recruited and
suggested that, in their recruitment of stewards, clubs should look to their supporters’ clubs to assist in
providing the kind of men required for the job. So far as transport was concerned, the Report recommended
that it should be an offence for anyone to be in possession of alcoholic liquor on a vehicle hired specifically
for the purpose of carrying passengers bound for a football match; or to allow any alcoholic liquor to be
carried on a public service vehicle being used for the purpose of carrying passengers to football matches; or to
allow the carriage of any drunken person on such a vehicle bound for a football match.

  2.36 So far as the separation of supporters was concerned the Report recommended:
  "That in the interests of crowd control and safety, separation of rival supporters at turnstiles should be
  carried out if the police, in consultation with the club, consider such a step to be necessary; that for matches
  where larger than average attendances are expected, sufficient turnstiles should be opened timeously in order
  to achieve speedy admission." (Recommendation 13).
  "In order to protect players, match officials and the pitch, access to the playing area should be made as
  difficult as possible. To prevent an invasion of the playing area by spectators ... the erection of a physical
  barrier in the form of a fence not less than 1.8 metres in height with access points to allow the pitch to be used
  if necessary for the evacuation of spectators in an emergency." (Paragraph 53).

  2.37 A further recommendation was that:
  "the Courts should make full use of the higher fining powers under the Criminal Law Act 1977 in respect of
  common law offences which include malicious mischief, breach of the peace and assault, these being the most
  common offences associated with football hooliganism, and in respect of persistent offenders, should
  normally impose imprisonment without option." (Recommendation 19).

  2.38 The Report recommended that:

  "The police should have statutory powers to search for any containers ... in the possession of any person
  entering or attempting to enter football grounds." (Recommendation 24).

but went on to point out that the clubs must bear their share of the responsibility for the behaviour and
conduct of their staffat all levels:
  2.39 Among other observations the Report says this:

  "We recognise that many football grounds in Scotland are very old; some could even be described as primitive
  in that not only do they lack any kind of comfort for spectators but they also lack basic amenities including
  adequate toilet accommodation. This primitive environment encourages some people to react in a primitive
  manner. Moreover there is a strong case for more seating accommodation. In our view it would go a
  considerable way towards reducing hooliganism; potential trouble spots could be more quickly recognised and
  identification of troublemakers by police would be made that much easier."
The Report therefore recommended:

  "that clubs should consider the provision of additional seating accommodation. In addition clubs must
  provide adequate toilet facilities for men and women and generally improve amenities for spectators."
  (Paragraph 88).
  2.40 This Report also recommended that:

  "players should be encouraged by the clubs to extend their voluntary public relations work in the community
  including personal appearances at youth clubs etc and coaching sessions in schools with the objects of
  promoting the game and the concept of good sportsmanship." (Recommendation 37).
CCTV was recommended and supporters’ clubs encouraged. The Scottish Football Association was
recommended to take appropriately firm action against clubs.

                                                        102
Department of the Environment Working Group
  2.41 The most recent Government publication on the subject of football is the Report of an Official
Working Group on Football Spectator Violence set up by Department of the Environment, which was
published by HMSO in 1984. The Working Group was set up following incidents of violence involving
British supporters at England’s soccer matches in Luxembourg and France in November 1983 and February
1984 respectively. It dealt party with problems arising out of international football.

  2.42 However, as regards domestic football the Report said:

  "the Group reaffirmed the importance of consistent planning, preparation and co-ordination; of building on
  experience; and of the need to consider afresh all possible measures, including those previously thought to be
  impractical or unnecessary." (Paragraph 5.1).

  "We recommend therefore that the FA reviews and better defines its powers and procedures and the
  responsibilities of the clubs. If their powers prove to be inadequate, the Association should consider
  enhancing them."

The Report went on:

  "This would better equip the FA to implement some of the recommendations." (Paragraph 5.5).

  2.43 The Football Association had issued a "blueprint" detailing the precautions which league clubs
should take against violence, which was circulated to clubs at the beginning of the 1983-84 season. The
Working Party Report said that it:

  "... has not been rigorously adopted by all clubs. Since it represents the collective wisdom of football clubs,
  many of whom have successfully countered serious threats of violence, its implementation should have
  prevented some of the violence in grounds last season." (Paragraph 5.7).

  2.44 The Report observed that the enforcement by the Football AsSociation of its "blueprint" occurs after
the event when the deficiencies in a club’s planning has become apparent. The Report recommended that:

  "improved means should be found for ensuring that clubs adopt the provisions of the "blueprint" in a way
  appropriate to their own grounds and matches." (Paragraph 5.7).

The Report went on to recommend that each club should produce a detailed set of plans to be submitted to
the football authorities for endorsement. This would prevent some clubs from avoiding their responsibilities
and might ensure also a more co-operative and committed response.

   2.45 The Report recommended that matches between high risk clubs should be programmed so that the
risk or threat of violence could be reduced. The Report said:

  "It is more likely to take place at the beginning and end of the season and at holiday periods, particularly at
  seaside fixtures when other groups of young people sometimes also clash with football supporters."
  (Paragraph 5.13).

  2.46 The Report went on to recommend the introduction of club membership, the introduction of CCTV
and closer links with the community. It did not recommend that alcohol should be banned in grounds and
concluded that in the absence of clear evidence that the introduction of legislation along the lines of the
Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 would reduce violence at English soccer matches, it could not
recommend such action. Furthermore, said the Report:

  "legislation of this kind would be unwelcome to many; the majority of football clubs are untroubled by
  violence and would unnecessarily be penalised financially and the vast majority of non-violent spectators
  would suffer for the actions of the few." (Paragraph 5.34):

The Working Group did not recommend additional measures for banning alcohol on trains or on football
coaches.

                                                       103
Conclusion
  2.47 A study of all these reports (and there are numerous reports and discussion papers by other bodies)
shows that the following are measures which have been frequently recommended:

 1.   Closed Circuit Television
 2.   Membership Cards
 3.   Segregation
 4.   More seating at football grounds
 5.   Encouragement ofsupporters’ clubs
 6.   Aban onalcohol
 7.   Involvement of the clubs with the community
 8.   Heavier penalties

I too shall argue for these and related measures. It is to be hoped they will be more vigorously pursued by the
appropriate bodies than in the past.

1. INTRODUCTION

Scope and status of the Guide
1. This booklet provides guidance to ground management, local
authorities and technical specialists such as engineers on
measures for improving spectator safety at existing Sports
grounds. It is a voluntary code and has no legal force.

Background to the Guide
2. Guidelines on measures for improving the safety of
spectators at sports grounds first became available on a more or
less comprehensive scale when the Wheatley Report on Crowd
Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1972. The recommen-
dations in the appendix to that Report were extended to include
fire precautions and means of escape from an emergency situation
such as a fire, and then formed the basis of the Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds (which became known as the "Green Guide"). The
application of those guidelines to football grounds over the few
years which followed revealed a need for the advice to be
amended in certain respects. Furthermore, since the safety of
spectators can be affected when crowds are disturbed by hooligan
elements, the recommendations of the Working Party on Crowd
Behaviour were incorporated in a new version, published in 1976,
which was aimed specifically at football grounds, Following the
fire at Bradford City FC ground in 1985 in which 56 people died, a
working party, established under the aegis of Mr Justice
Popplewell’s Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports
Grounds, reviewed the Guide and produced a series of recommen-
dations which have been taken into account together with
comments from others in producing this revised and expanded
version.

H istorical context
3. Serious accidents at sports grounds involving injuries on a
large scale to spectators are fortunately few. But as demonstrated
by those at Ibrox and Valley Parade, and before that at Burnden
Park, tile potential scale of death and injury at a crowded sporting
event is such that it is essential for ground management to take
     such steps as are necessary to ensure reasonable safety at their
                                                                             7. The Guide is aimed primarily at advising on safety for
     grounds. This applies to all sports grounds irrespective of whether
                                                                             spectators in existing sports grounds and as such it attempts to
     or not they are the subject of a safety certificate.                    take account of the constraints and difficulties which are present

 ease of maintenance. All parts of viewing areas should always
 have a clear unobstructed view of the playing area and designs
 should take account of the need for effective stewarding, which
 can play an important role in controlling crowd movement (see
 Chapter 13),

 21, Although controlling crowd numbers may serve to reduce
 some risks to an acceptable level, remedial work is likely to be
 necessary to overcome others. Obvious defects such as trip
 hazards (especially at the head of stairs or steps), loose or weak
 handrails on stairs, and obstructed exits or exit routes, should be
 rectified as part of the general care and maintenance of a ground.
 Structures should be sound (see Chapter 3) and inspected by
 suitably qualified persons (see Chapter 4), Design, layout and
 signposting of exits and exit routes require particular attention to
 ensure that they can safely cope with the number of spectators
who will use them at the end of an event or in an emergency (see
 Chapter 6), Similarly, the condition of terraces or viewing slopes
(see Chapter 8) and presence or otherwise of crush barriers,
correctly sited and meeting the strength tests of this Guide (see
Chapter 9), are important factors. Broken, uneven terracing causes
stumbling. Barriers not only serve to break up crowd pressures but
also assist in controlling movement off the terraces by regulating
the rate of arrival at exits to suit their capacity, and encouraging
the formation of queues so that spectators arrive at exits in an
orderly fashion.

 22, Proper precautions against the risk of fire are vital (see
Chapter 11 ). Good ground management is crucial in reducing or
eliminating the risk. Accumulation of litter is a prime potential
source of fire but can be eliminated by regular and frequent
inspections, good housekeeping, ground maintenance and by
taking particular care over the storage of flammable materials. The
nature and type of materials used in the construction of covered
areas and stands will strongly influence the safety measures

     such pressures safely and allowance should be made for forces
     simultaneously and independently induced by other factors eg
     wind forces or attached installations.

     32. All parts of the ground used by the general public, and
     especially the exit routes, should have minimum headroom of not
     less than 2 metres. Exit routes should wherever possible have a
     headroom of 2.4 metres.

     33. Precautions should be taken to prevent people from climbing
     on to roofs, pylons, hoardings and other structures. Where
     possible such structures should be fitted with unclimbable
     devices eg stout barriers or close-boarded enclosures. Spikes,
     barbed wire etc should only be installed above the minimum
     headroom specified in paragraph 32 above and preferably at a
     minimum height of 2.4 metres from the base.

Spectators should be admitted at a rate which is compatible
with the dispersal arrangements for them inside the ground.

44. Where admission to a ground or parts of it is controlled by
turnstiles, these, by their number and location, control not only the
rate of admission but, to a large extent, the dispersal of spectators
within a ground to their particular sections. Turnstiles should be of
such numbers as to admit spectators at a rate whereby no unduly
large crowds are kept waiting for admission and yet at no faster
rate than the arrangements for distributing spectators within the
ground permit.

4,5. Dangerous overcrowding can be caused if spectators are
able to force their way into a ground already full to capacity by
scaling or breaking through boundary walls or fences or the gates
in them. To avoid this danger such walls, fences and gates should
be of appropriate height and strength, and hand- or foot-holds
which might assist climbing should be avoided. They should be
regularly inspected.

46. Contingency plans should be made to deal with situations
where the available entrances at a ground have, proved insufficient
to stop unduly large crowds from gathering outside. This may, for
example, include opening additional entrances, but local knowledge
of the ground, crowd patterns and advice from the police should be
taken into account in drawing up contingency plans. Larger
grounds should have intercommunication systems and metering
systems at turnstiles (see Chapter 12), and installation of a
centralised computer monitoring system may be of assistance to
management in quickly identifying particular areas of difficulty.

47. The maximum notional rate at which spectators can pass
through turnstiles will depend upon a variety of factors; for
example, the design and age of the equipment, the ability of the
operator and the ticketing arrangements. The admission rate will
therefore depend greatly upon local circumstances but in general,

 to the pitch which could be manned by the police or stewards. A
 walkway between the boundary wall and the terraces, which would
 be solely occupied by the police, first aid and official club personnel,
 has been found to be effective as regards safety and security. In
order to achieve this it might be .necessary to remove one or two
rows of terracing and to protect the walkway from the terrace by a
continuous line of barriers, so designed as to discourage access to
the walkway except at authorised points. The access points from
terrace to walkway should be directly linked with the access points
from the walkway to the pitch. Where a walkway system is in use,
sliding gates may be installed at the access points from the
walkway to the pitch, ie where there can be no crowd pressure
against them (see Chapter 6, paragraph 65 regarding the use of
sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the pitch is usually
unnecessary where seating extends to the level of the playing area.

                      as a crush barrier, or in some situations as a barrier to discourage
                      or prevent access to the playing area except in an emergency,

                      214..The type, strength and height of a pitch perimeter fence or
                      wall will vary according to its location and required function. At one
                      extreme, at a certain type of ground or small stadium used by very
                     few spectators, there may be no need for a perimeter fence or wall
                     at all; or if such a wall or fence exists it may need to consist of little
                     more than a rail to mark the playing area. At the other extreme, at
                     some major soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd movement
                     forms a necessary part of the safety measures, it may be necessary
                     to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
                     circumstances (see also Chapter 14, paragraph 209) but allows for
                     access in emergency. Even at these grounds however specification
                     of the pitch fence may vary for different parts of the ground.

                      215. For most major stadia, whether used for association football
                      or other sports, the pitch perimeter fence will be required either to
                      prevent access to the pitch as mentioned above, or at least to
                      discourage attempts by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates
                      or other access points (minimum width 1.1 metres) should
                      nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency and, at those
                     grounds where a perimeter track is used as part of the exit system,
                     for the departure of spectators at the end of an event. Provision of
                     such gates or access points is particularly important to allow full
                     access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a
                     place of safety in an emergency. Such gates or access points should
                     be properly stewarded and clearly marked so that immediate access
                     to the playing area or perimeter track can be ensured.

                     216. If spectators can lean on the perimeter fence it should be

                an evenly distributed force of either 6.0 KN/metre width                  or handrail, the barrier or handrail, as the case may be, should be
                (400 Ibs f/foot width) or 4,3 KN/metre width (290 tbs f/foot width)       deemed to have failed the test.
                of barrier as mentioned in Chapter 9.
                                                                                          7. A record should be kept of all the barriers and handrails
                2. For handrails the test is to consist of the application of an          tested and of their performances during the tests.
                evenly distributed force of either 4.3 KN/metre width (290 Ibs f/
                foot width) or 2.74 KN/metre width (188 Ibs f/foot width) of
                handrail as mentioned in Chapter 9.

                3. The force is to be in the form of a static load acting on the
                top rail of the barrier or handrail at right angles to the longitudinal
                axis and applied in about ten equal increments.

                4. The force to be applied for three consecutive periods, the full
                force being maintained for 5 minutes each period. The interval
                between applications to be as short as possible, ie to enable
                complete unloading and reloading only. A record should be kept of
                any deformation during the loading periods, during the periods of
                maintained loading, or during the recovery period.

                5. If On the removal of the force for the third time the recovery
                of deformation is at least 75% the barrier or handrail may be
                deemed to have satisfied the loading requirements.

!,°             If this requirement is not met but the recovery is more than 50%
                then the test should be repeated and if on retest the recovery is at
                least 75% the barrier or handrail may be deemed to have satisfied
                the loading requirements.
                If the recovery is less than 50% on the first test or less than 75%
                on the retest, the barrier or handrail shall be deemed to have
    , ~i!i~I,   failed to meet the loading requirements.

                I live          at    that       above       address             w ith my wife            and    family.

                About       a month             before       Saturday,                15th Ap ri l ,       1989 •< 15048?)        I was at

                work       when a mate                who    I work             with

                                  in the         West       S t a n d at         Hillsborough             Football       G round ,     mentioned

                that       he    needed          stewards          for          the    Liverpool          V Nottingham          Forest       game.

                Another          mate       who       I work       with          u s u a l l y w o r k e d at     the    game    but    he    couldr,

                make       it.        I ’d n e v e r        been       to       a F.A.       C u p Semi     Final       before    so    I

                volunteered                to    do    it.

                About       a    fortnight             or a w e e k             before       the   game     I found       out    from

                that       I would          be    definately                working          the   game a n d      he    gave me my t i c k e t

                to g e t        in.        He    told       me    to    be       at    the    ground       for    11.15am       (1115)       as   that

                was       when       the    stewards             would          be    meeting.

                On    the       morning          of S a t u r d a y         15th April             1989    (150489) ,       I entered         the

ground       at    the       Leppings             Lane     end     via        gate       C w h i c h was         open.      There

were    two       stewards             on     the    gate,        one        of    t h e m had a        list a n d       c h e c k e d my

name    on       the    list.            He    directed           me    upstairs            to the W e s t Stand.                 When        !

got    upstairs             into       the     stand and           there           was a       pol i c e    officer       giving

instructions.                    Because          I was      a bit           late     t his     was     just      coming       to a n

end'as       I arriived.

After    the       policeman                had     finished           the        talk                                  took me

downstairs             to    the       refreshment            bar       underneath              the S t a n d        to get a       ’bib'

check    tickets             and       show       people      to       their        sea t s .         I was      workingwith

another          bloke       who       was     an    experienced                  steward and           from what          I

understand             each       temporary           s t e w a r d was            put w i t h a n e x p e r i e n c e d        one

in e a c h       gangway.              I got        to m y    post a b o u t             11.35am        (1135).

From    then       on I d i d n ' t             move      e x c e p t to go a n d           get      some       refreshments          at

about    1pm       (1300)           when        we    went        one at a time.

I received             no    further           instructions                  except       that                                  :ame tc

see,me       to    make          s ure      I was     alright.

At a b o u t      11.40am          (1140)           the    Nottingham               Forest        fans     began        coming      into

the S p i o n Kop.                From        then    on     in the           f ans      were     com ing        in a n d f r o m

1.30pm       (1330)          the       f ans      were     coming            into     the      W e s t Sta n d .        They were          ju
                                                                        -t



coming       in    in t w o ' s          and      three's         and        I was       able        to check        tickets and

show    them       to       their        seats.

From    then       on it was             a      steady       f l o w of people              and      then       at   about 2.50pm

(1350)       a    lot of         p e o p l e in g r e a t     numbers              were     c omi n g      in.          It got      so

bad    I couldn't                check        tickets        with       the        amount       of    people         coming     into       th

stand.           I noticed             t hat      in the      pens           below       the    s t a n d this was

happening          as well.               There       was     a    lot        of    peo p l e     pac k i n g     in.     T his     w as

particularly                so    in     pens       3 and     4 behind              the     goal.

From    then       on       it    just        got    worse.            More        and more          people w ere         packing

into    the       stand and              the      pens     below.            People         were a l ready           squashed

together        and       had       nowhere           to m o v e .         The      same     volume       of    people       d i d n ’t

seem    to     be    moving          into        the      outer         pens     to    the      left a n d      right       of    the

stand,       they were              j ust       packing         behind         the     goal.

I can't        really          put a         time       on     the      following          events        because       I wasn't

watching        wether             the     game       had      started         because          I could        see    that       the

people       were        still       packing             in.       In    pens 3 a n d           4 behind        the    goal       I coul

see    that     they        were         all     pushing           each       other      f o r w a r d a n d m ore       people

came    in.

The    first        thing          I realised             somthing            was     wrong      was     when a young             lad

had    got     from        o ver         the f e n c e    out        of       the     pens 3 a n d 4        I d o n't       know

which.         He        ran a c r o s s the           pitch         towards           the F o r e s t    supporters.              A

p>olicman s t o p p e d             him.

I then       saw     that           other people               w e r e t r y i n g to      c l imb the         fence

from    inside           the         pens, o t h e r s         w e r e t r y i n g to      get     into     the      stand        from t

back    of     the       pens.           Again        this      only applied               to    pens 3        and     4.

I noticed           that       one y o u n g          lad      had      been     pulled          out a n d was laid              out    to

the    right        of    the       g o al       as    I l o o k e d s o m e b o d y , I t h ink          two     people          were

tending        to    him, I c a n ' t            remember                w e t h e r t h e y w ere        police      or a m b u l a n c

By    this     stage           people           were     being          pulled       over the       top    of the        f e n cing.

I don't        know        when          the f r o n t    gates          to    pens 3        and 4 were          opened          because

I didn't        see.           I      saw        that     policemen were                 t r y i n g to    rip the f e n c i n g

away and        kicking             it     to    dislodge            it.

In the       stand        where          I was        it was         chaotic          with      people      standing anywhere

they    could        and       more        being        pulled          up f r o m     the      pens.

As    time     went       on the           crowd        in the          stand       began        g e t t i n g v er y a g g r e s s i v e

and    volatile,            and      they        began         getting         aggressive           towards anybody

connected           with       the       ground.

It w o u l d    be a b o u t         3.40pm           (1540)         when      I wa s      threatened and assaulted

by a fan.            A b o u t five         or    six     fans       had w alked             down from            the b ack        of       t!~

stand.         They wore             no      colours           but      you    could       tell      from their accents

they    were        Liverpool              supporters.                 As      they walked             towards        one    of    them

grabbed        the      front         of m y         shirt       and      p u l l e d me        towards       him over        the       wai;

at    the     side     of    the       gangway.                 He    clenched            his    fist a n d     pulled his a r m

back    as     if     to    hit       me.        He    said          ’Y o u    fucking          Sheffield Wednesday

B a s t a r d ’.      Somebody             knocked             his    arm away and               took    h i m off a n d said,

to    downstairs.                They were             still          shouting            and    s w e a r i n g as    t hey went.

I c o u l d n ’t tell            you       what       the       kid     looked         like      who a s s a u l t e d me.

Because        of     his    aggression                I c o u l d n ’t tell               whether       he was        d r unk     or       not

I noticed           t hat    other             people          in the         stand were          l o o k i n g at me.            The    moc

was    aggressive.                I        got       the       impression             I         was     not w a n t e d      there. I

decided        to     get    out           of    the       stand       because I feared                for my safety.                   I

took    my     bib     off       and w a i t e d           a    couple         of m i n u t e s .       Then    I w ent       down          the

gangway        downstairs                  to    the       r e f r e s h m e n t bar      to    hand my bib           in.

Somebody           handed        me        a    cup    of      water          but     I         was     in that       m u c h of a d aze I

don't       know      who    it was.

Then     I got        to    the       refresment                bar     and     s a w that        t h ere was a y o u t h           behii

the    counter.             He    was          grabbing          trays         of    pop a n d      other      stuff        from

behind        the     counter          and       giving          it     to     the     fans.        T h e y w ere      run n i n g aro<

outside        with        cans       of       pop a n d        other         stuff       in t h eir     hands.         The y o u t h

behind        the     counter          was       in    his       mid     twenties.               He w o r e    blue     d e n i m jean'

and    blu e       demim     shirt             I think          it was.             Other       than    that    I can't

describe           him.          I put          my    bib       behind         the     refreshment            bar,     I saw       t hat

there       were      another          7 or          8 already           there.            I left       the    ground straight

away     at    the     Leppings                Lane    end       but     t h ere      w ere      that    many       people        there          .

c o u l d n ’t tell         you which                entrance           I went        t h rough.

There       were      some       police          officers             forming         a    road b l o c k      just     outside             th

Leppings           Lane     entrance.                 Some       of     the L i v e r p o o l       fans were          h a v i n g a go

at    them,        s h o u t ing a n d          s w e a r i n g , po int i n g            the i r f i n g e r s .      The

policemen           didn't        retaliate                they       just      stood        there.

           I haven't             reported        the     assault         or    the       looting        to the       police,    for       two

           days       I wa s       confused and             couldn't          see    straight.               I mentioned       the

           looting          to                                but       thats       about       it.

           I wouldn't              recognise        the      kid    who       a s s a u l t e d me      or    the    kid who was

           looting          the     refreshment             bar.

           There       were        some L i v e r p o o l     F.C.       stewards          at- the       ground       but w hat      they

           were       doing        I don't       know.

           From       my    position         in the         stand       I did       not     see a n y        incidents     near      g at e

           C or       the    t u n n e 1.

           Saturday          15th April,            198?      (150489)           was      the    first        time    I have    been a

           steward          although         I had       been      to    numerous           football         matches      previously.

           At    no    t ime       did    I come       into     contact          with any          person       that was       injured

           or    deceased.

           Whilst          the     incident        was      going       on    I could          h ear    that    the    tan o y was

           working          but     there     was      so    much       going       on    I couldn't           tell    what    t h e y weri

           saying.

           To    the       b est    of m y    knowledge            I didn't          see a n y b o d y        drinking alcohol             or

           drinking          it     in the       stand       but    there        were a         few      peop l e    d r u n k in the

           stand.           I myself         saw a bo u t       six      people          who    were      drunk.       One m a n     in

           particular              fell     down    the      steps       he wa s         so dr u n k .

           I can       say       that     when     the      people       were       being       dragged        out over the          fence

           by    police          officers        other       fans       were     punching          and       kicking    the    officers

           and also          amublancemen              who    were       tending          to    the     injured.

           I am       a Sheffield United                    supporter            previous          to    15th April,          I had       not

           been       to H i l l s b o r o u g h    for      approximately                t e n yea r s .

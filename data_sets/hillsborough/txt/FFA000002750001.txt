Dear Mr. Kelly,

In response to the tragic events at Hillsborough Liverpool City Council has
formed a 'Hillsborough Working Party' in an attempt to develop as full a
picture as is possible of the events leading up to and including the
circumstances surrounding the deaths of 95 Liverpool Supporters.

At this stage we are reviewing the preparations made in advance of April 15th
with special regard to the Football Association's responsibilities concerning
your planning and decision-making processes and procedures for semi-final
and Wembley final fixtures, including those arrangements within your domain
for Hillsborough.

Oviously I understand the Football Association's involvement with the Taylor
Inquiry. Notwithstanding this, and to facilitate as thorough a response as
is practicable under the circumstances, your assistance in relation to the
following points would be gratefully appreciated

(1)   A copy and/or information on the F.A.'s official guidelines and/or
      recommendations for:-
         (i)   Ground Safety;
        (ii)   Ground Management;
       (iii)   Provision/level of Medical Facilities;
        (iv)   Emergency Plans (e.g. Evacuation/Rescue);
         (v)   Choice of Venue;
        (vi)   Ticket Allocations/Distribution;
       (vii)   Liaisons/Links withAppropriate Police Forces;
      (viii)   Segregation and Security within Stadia;

(2)   A copy and/or information on the F.A. Report for the corresponding
      (Hillsborough) fixture in 1988 and any recommendations implemented for
      the April 1989 fixture.

(3)   A copy and/or information on E.U.F.A. ground safety procedures with
      special regard to fencing policy.

Chief Constable,                 14th March 1991
Furnival House,
SHEFFIELD,
SI 4QN

Dear Sir,


I think that it is pretty disgusting that this casÂ»
of maligning the police and wrongfully accusing them
of not doing their job at the Hillsborough Football
Ground.     I wrote to you on the 5th July 1989 and told
you that I witnessed the whole of that affair and I
know quite well that it was the drunken Liverpool
supporters who caused the trouble.


If you check your records you will find that one
policeman was on the floor being kicked and that
four men were trying to take another man of his
horse.    I also saw a man put his arm around a post
and people climbed up his back onto the top terraces
but they were throw back down again.     I know I was not
the only one to have witnessed this.     I have no
intention of not backing the police when I know they
are right.     I suggest the Government conscripts
men from 14 upwards in to the army and teach them to
be citizens and to protect people.


I do hope that Superintendent Dukinfield will not be
victimised.


Yours- sincerely,

went     down the jrnnnel and               looked    in the Leppi ng s Ln end,                 and then went

back     out ag^in          to have a cigarette.             When^I      came back out,              I stood by

t!entrance                to the    tunnel,    while       I/^Sas standing           there     I saw^fe'ffe

conce r t i n a gate C open,               f o r ^ m i n u t e s          and    poep 1 e js^fme through

it,    and     I could see a P o l i y T horse on the other                     s i ^ f stopping             people

going        through and        it was      closed then.         This w ou ld have been at about

2.40pm        (1440).       I went       back down the tunnel           again,        people w ere^atill

j o s tling        so    I came out a ga in and saw the same                  gate open ^4^in,                but

this     time       it looked as          through     it had been opened              p u j ^ o s e l y,   and

everybody           came through the gate again,                  that was ttfC about £..50 pm—

(1450).        At that        point, I t hought        it was     better      to get       ip. to see the

match,        and was        carried along       the tunnel,         wit h otp&r          people.          There was

the odd one or two P o l i c e m e n at the end of t^e tunnel                                inside         the    pens.
         ~                                                              /                                     :
I saw no disorder,                 and    nobody was       d r in k in g' in si de    the ground.

I d i d n ’t see a ny thing              happening     in the     other      pens,     but as soon as                  1

took     up where          I was    going    to w at ch the m at ch from,               I thought           there was

s om e t h i n g    s e riously wrong,        and started to get              crushed.         I started           to

worry.        This was        happeni no/^dfs the       players       came    out onto the             pitch,          soon

a fter       that       I f el t a si^fge a nd was m ov ed /F orwards.

Du r i n g    this       crush t/nere was a guy to/my               left who         had moved         from       in

front        of me.       When he was         next to /fie, he was out of               it, by that          I mea n

his eyes were              closed and        he was     drooling at the mouth, and he                        was

being        held up by oLKer             people.    His    face was      di sc ol ou re d and he

d ef i n i t e l y needed oxygen.            I also    heard      people      shouting behind                me    that

a w o ma n was           d/>wn and was        being    t ra mpled on. I saw none of the                     m at ch at
                                                                                                                       P AGE          C
                                                                                                                       S2Q21

            The     crush continued an d about 3 minutes                         after       the match was        stopped,        I

            sat down to the             left    of the      pen,      and s t ar te d    crying,       and   I could see

            bodies      on the        pitch,    I sat there           until     I got my breath back.                I left

            the     qround of my own a cc o rd at a b o ^ T 10 (1<b1Q)~4.15pm <1615).                                      I felt

            that     the o rg an is a ti o n     in g e n       1 was         poor,    not    like   l a s t ^ y e a r , w hich

            was     m uch better.        The Poli>^         seemed as though they weye wait i ng                       to be

            told what         to do, w ai ti ng        for an order            from someone'         It was     the    people

            t h e m s e l v e s who    took    the     initiative,        not the Police.             The Police       behind

            us were      telling        us to    push forwards,               and the Police         on the     pitch were

             telling        us to push back,            there was        no    c o- or di na ti on between t^ern at

            all.     Eve n up until           I left the ground the Police                     d i d n ’t         what      to

             do,    they might         just as well         have      not been there,

             I w o ul d just      like to say that            I am not a ngry at tKe Police                     or

            attaching         blame     to them,        the o rg an is a ti o n was          bad all a r ou n d . W h e n    I

            m e n t i o n e d the traffic        build up,         :i.t was     en route       to She ff ie ld

             a r o u n d the Manc he st er area.            Also whe n         I sat    down     it was about         40

            minu te s       later,     and    not 5 minutes.           When     I left       the ground      I a ct ua l ly

             went    back to the         car to        look for my mates.

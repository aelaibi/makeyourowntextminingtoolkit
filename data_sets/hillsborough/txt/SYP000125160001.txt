 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE CHOICE OF HILLSBOROUGH FOR THE MATCH VENUE WAS A BAD O N E . THE AWAY END,        IE

 LEPPINGS LANE WAS TOO SMALL FOR THE AMOUNT OF LIVERPOOL FANS WANTING TO ATTEND

 THE MATCH.    I FEEL THAT WEMBLEY SHOULD BE USED FOR SEMI-FINAL MATCHES,        AS WELL

 AS THE FINAL I T S E L F.

 I FEEL THAT HAD THE~>»S CARD SYSTEM BEEN IN USE         ON THAT DAY, MATTERS WOULD

 H^E    BEEN TWICE AS BAD.

 THE OFFICER    IN CHARGE OF          TCH OVERALL,   SHOULD HAVE HAD MUCH MORE

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS A SLOW RESPONSE TO THE SITUATION BY J t iE POLICE IN FRONT OF THE PENS,

 WHO WERE STILL TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO MQtfE BACK WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 HELPING THEM OUT OF THE PENS.

 Q54                                       O f f     A                      ,
                                                                                N-f
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS y^TAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE WERE INSUFFICIENT POLICE OFFICERS OUTSIDE TjrfE TURNSTILES TO CONTROL THE

 CROWD.    THE CROWD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROPERLY ORGANISED INTO SEPERATE QUEUES

 F #   EACH TURNSTILE.     THE LACK OF POLICEMAN AT THE TURNSTILES RESULTED IN THE

 POLICE HAVING TO OPEN THE GATE TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE.        H O W E V E R , I FEEL THE

 POLICE WERE JUSTIFIED IN OPENING THE GATE TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE.

 I THOUGHT THERE WAS A POOR USE OF THE GROUND T A N N O Y .   THIS COULD HAVE BEEN

 BETTER USED TO INFORM THE FANS WHAT WAS HAPPENING,      AND PREVENT THE AGGREVATION

 BETWEEN THE TWO SETS OF SUPPORTERS.

     JUDICIAL INQUIRY

     THERE WERE NC     IGNS INSIDE THE GROUND DIR

     TERRACES,    AWAY FROM THE CENTRAL TUNNEL /    THE KICK-OFF    HGULD HAVE BEEN

     DELAYED AND AN ANNOUNCEMENT MADE TO'THE FANS OUTSIDE          "HE TURNSTILES

     INFORMING THEM,     THE AMOUNT OF TIMES THAT COACHES WERE BEING STOPPED AND

     SEARCHED FOR DRINK CAUSED A LOT OF PEOPLE TO ARRIVE LATE AT THE GROUND.

!    THE GROUND.     I FEEL THE WHOLE MATCH WAS BADLY ORGANISED.

 THERE WAS    A LACK OF ANNOUNCEMENT OVER/THE TANOY SYSTEM. THE ANNOUNCEMENTS

 THAT CAME    WERE UNHELPFUL.    THERE W/CS AN ANNOUNCEMENT   FOR FANS TO   CLEAR THE

 PITCH.     WHEN THEY WERE THE PEOPUS WHO WERE DOING EVERYTHING.

 THE POLICE CORDON THAT WAS PUT ACROSS THE PITCH WAS NEEDED ORIGINALLY,

 BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT THEN MOST OF

 THE OFFICERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SE*fT DOWN TO HELP AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END,

 ~^RE     WAS NO ORGANISATION BY , ‘HE POLICE.   MOST OF IT WAS DONE BY THE FANS.

YEAR THERE WAS A CORDON BEFORE THE FANS GOT TO THE LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILES

AND IF THEY DID NOT HAVE A TICKET THEY COULD NOT GO ON.           THERE SHOULD NOT BE

DIVIDING FENCES IN THAT END OF THE GROUND.

THERE SHOULD BE MORE TURNSTILES AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END, AS IT IS NOW IT IS

JUST A BOTTLE NECK.

THERE WAS NO GUIDANCE OUTSIDE THE GROUND BEFORE THE MATCH.

 FORM LINES ALONG THE PITCH.                   \--

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADJD WHIG!/ YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THAT THE DISASTER STARTED BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF QUEUES OUTSIDE THE

       NSTILES AND BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ORGANISATION OUTSIDE.      THE GATES HAD

 TO BE OPENED AND THEN TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO RUSH DOWN THE TUNNEL

 ONTO THE PACKED TERRACES.      ALSO THERE WAS A LACK OF SIGNS, PEOPLE WOULD HAVE

 THOUGHT THE TUNNEL WAS THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE TERRACES.

OUR VIEWING POINT WHAT WAS HAPPENIN&< BUT THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO.              IT TOOK TOO

LONG FOR THE AMBULANCE TO GET THERE.         THROUGHOUT THE     INCIDENT I ONLY SAW ONE

AMBULANCE ON THE PITCH,      I FELT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE.      THERE WAS A      LACK

OF EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT E.G.      OXYGEN SUPPLIES.

    I THOUGHT THE POLICE WERE JUSTIFIED IN OPENING THE GATE TO LET FANS IN BECAUSE

    IT PREVENTED MORE CRUSHING OUTSIDE.   H O W E V E R , THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

    DIRECTING THE FANS AWAY FROM THE TUNNEL ONCE THEY WERE INSIDE THE GROUND.           THE

    KEY TO THE WHOLE THING WAS ORGANISATION BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND,

    BUT THERE WAS NONE THERE THAT I COULD SEE.

A fter    entering       the L ep pi ng s Lane          terracing       through a t u r n s t i ^            I made

my way to the high bank at the                      rear of       pen number        seven^C}

not use the tunnel              that    leads     to the      central       pens,    at the back of the

goal.      This w ould be a bout 2.30                 pm    (1430).       The a re a we were            in was

very quiet.           I was standing w ith,                                        o +

                  and                       I only k now him from school,                      he    lives    in the

                 district       of Liverpool.

I us ua ll y stand behind the goal a nd so wit h my two friends we began to

move     to our    right       towards      the terracing,           at the back of the goal                    of

the L e pp in gs Lane          end of the ground,

To   reach   t hi s     part    of    the   ter race all        we/3:Ld w a s w a l k      along       the    rear

of pens 6, 3 and           into       pen 4.       I t h i n k / a lt h o u g h   I c a n ’t remember           that
                                             Pj3. H-
there    were     metal    gates       in the     fence-4     that     separated         the    terracing          into
                                        ---------
pens and that           these    gates must         have     been open.           I certainly did not

climb any fences           to    reach      pen 4.         I d o n ’t remember any stewards                   or

police s tanding          by this area.

Wi th my two friends,                we made      our way forward           into    pen 4,          close    to the

front a nd       i mmedi at el y behind the gate or the                     perimeter          fence.        This

w o u l d have    been about 2.5 0           pm    (1450).        I do not        remember          the teams

being announced.               It was very busy             in this area,          however          the are a      in

front     of us    leading to the            fence was        very quiet.           There were ma in ly

young     couples       in this area.             I remember       one old fella,              age d about 68

years who kept           banging       his walking          stick on the fence a nd yelling at

the Police,        to let us out.

In my q ue st io nn ai re        I have a l r ea dy         indicated my          positions,          once    inside

pen number 4.

I was     seated on top of a metal                  barrier       behind this        perimeter          gate.

This was the          barrier        closest      to the     perimeter        fence.

At this time,           there was some            inflatable        items     being kept            in the air          by

the fans and          I can remember a beach ball and a large b a n a n a .                                 I was

                                                                                                S3661

being    bumped by the        crowd a bit at          this time       but was   not unduly

concerned at        that    time.     E ach time      I lost my balance         on the bar,        I

s imply jumped back on it and sat                   on top of    it again.        I am quite       used

to being      in large      crowds at Anfield.

The a t mo sp he re was electric,            full    of high e xp ec ta ti on for the game

that was almost about           to start.

I was    still     in my    position number          one,    as the two teams        came out to

start    the game,       as the game kicked off,              I was    pushed off the        barrier,

this may have        been just       prior to the kick off.

The    pressure     of the    crowd pushed me forward             into    like a trench,          right

at the front of the           terracing.        People       began to    panic,    and were

shouting at the          police at the track           outside,       to get them out of /-he

terracing.         The   fans were        screaming.        There was a policwoman cyn the

•track   beside     the gate,       she    didn't appear       to know what       she should do.

I was    being     crushed by the          pressure    of the    crowd.                /

I. remember a       fella    and a girl       to my    left,    they    both wore A r r a n type

jumpers,     the    girls    was a round neck,          the boys jumper         had a deep V neck

style.       I have since      seen them both on the             pitch,    recovering,         in a

m a gazine   "Paris Match"          dated

I d o n ’t know who opened the gate                 or the    perimeter    fence.       I was among

the first     twenty to get out of pen 4 through the gate                         onto t h e / ^ T t c h .

The    game was     still    being played w he n        I got out       of the terracing.              I

stood on the        edge of the pitch,          to the       left of    the Liverpool        goal,     as

you    look at     it from the terracing,             an d str ug gl ed to get my breath back

The    game got stopped,        while       I was    in this    position.       There was a lot

of noise     from the       crowd and       I had not       realised at first        that    the game

had stopped.

Once     the game    stopped    I m ov ed forw ar d to the            edge of the      18 yard box,

at the Leppings Lane           end of the ground.

By now there was a mass              of people all a ro u n d the goal area at this                        end

              of the ground,

              A f ter a while        1' joined others a n / picked up a stretcher                      I believe       I

              helped to carry as many as                 15 X e o p l e across     the      pitch.     During    this

              time    I also     removed hoardir\g4 from the N o t t i n g h a m Forest                 end of the

              ground,       to use as m akeshift          stretchers.

              I find       it difficult        to    individually       itemise    each of the         journeys    that

              I made across          the    pitch wit h stretcher          p a r t y ’s.

<~j2c^\ TcJp- On one occas io n only,               I carried one       person,    on a board into the gym.

              I w o ul d descri be this             person as a whi te m a n , aged about 45 J/ear s ,
tsiS\C-
              ^hinni ng ha.i r on top of his              head of brown hair,              he had aye hubby face

          ■   I w o ul d estimate his weight as a r o u n d 14 s t .                  He was a / n e a v i l y built

              man.     He    had a moustache.            He wore a white          shirt,      this buttons were

              open,    exposing       his    chest,     his trousers were          loosen/d at         the waist.

              I think       they were       dark dress      trousers.         I collected this man to the

              right a nd       inside      the six yar d box at the Leppirygs Lane                   end.     He had

              been    lying on his back              I helped    lift    the man c/nto a w oo d e n board.              Hi'

              face was       blue.

                                                                        His    eyes were       open,    they were

              staring,       large brown eyes.            I think       he was alive.          He made a gurgling

              noise as       I helped       carry him to the gym

                                      I carried this man           into    the gym.         There were        police

              officers       inside     this    gym.     There were about 30 dead bodies                    in this

              area,    wit h    police      officers     jackets    over      them.        I put the man down and

              left.        I had enough by then and never                 carried any more,I            left the

              ground about        1610 hours          (1610)    leaving    between the north and west

              stand ar ea.All         the    people     I carried were male.                It is difficult

              for me to describe             each of them        in detail,       having      regard to the

              circumstances          that    I found myself        caught      up in.

              All    the    people    1 carried a p p e a r e d    to be a ro u n d 40 years           old,   and all

              h eav il y built.

             I phoned my home,        then    returned to the ground,          located my friends and

             rny dad and his mate.           I left the gr ou nd to catch my train home about

             4 .50   pm (1650).

             I had bruises and grazes           on my waist and

             I lost my      programme and      loose   cash f r o m y s o c k e t , to an amount   of £3

             or £ 4 .




             I w o ul d describe myself as, a white male,              IS years    old,            medium

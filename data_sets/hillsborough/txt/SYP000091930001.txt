               On Saturday 15th April             1989 (150489)      I was the Inspector        in charge

               of the Barnsley Division Crime and Vandal Squad.                        1't had originally

               been intended that this squad would perform duty at the F.A Cup Semi-

               Final football match at Hi 1lsborough.                 However, a few days prior to

               the match I was informed that the squad would not be required for duty

               at the match,         but should rema      ^on   duty at Barnsley ready fo r

               deployment         if required.



               On the afternoon of Saturday 15 April                  1989 <150489)      I was engaged

               on patrol         in the Crime and Vandal Personnel Carrier               in the Grange

This meant that all available pe                                diately travel to

that    location.



We trave 1led towards Hillsborough arriving at 3.25 pm (1525)                   this

date.     Because of the traffic congestion, PC BOWER was left with the

vehicle some 400 yards from the ground, and myseIf and the other

officers made our way to the ground on foot.            As we approached the

fo ot bal 1 ground I noticed a large number of people walking away from

it.



On arrival at the ground I went         into the Police Room,        but no officers

were present at this time.
                                                                              /

I then went to the gymi            ea and spoke to            e/int^pment B A T E S .

He informed me that the            een some form of crush at the match, as

a result of which there were      casualties and fatalities.              I was
                                         N
instructed to liaise with Chief Ins               C R E A S E R { p r e s e n t at the

time) and assist with the setting u               temporary mortuary in the

gymnasium.



In the gymnasium at this time were a number of bodojgw,               laid on the

floor.     I saw that some of these had a police off\>^erViji_~attendance

and some did not.     More casualties were being brought into the

gymnasium by both police and civilian personnel.              Those obviously

alive were taken to the far end of the gymnasium, where what appeared

to be a medical team administered to them.           Throughout the gymnasium

first aid was being rended by police and civilians.

             PS FIDLER           F ’ Division was in the gymnasium at this time, and I

             saw that' he was 'Commencing a list of fatalities.                   We agreed that

    0^       identification of deceased persons was of prime concern, and that as

             far as possible each body should have one police officer responsible

             for carrying out a search of it,              listing      property on it, and

             attempting   ident i f i cat ion from d oc u m e n t s .     A labe1 should be affixed

             to each body to this effect.            I explained this procedure to the

             of f i cers accompanying me, and myse 1 f and PS ELlA/OTT w ent around the

             room instructing officers to this effect.


                                                                                         e>61
             About 4 pm (1600)     this date I again spoke tg- Superint                  ent BA iES in

             the gy mna si um.   He introduced me to a D                          In company with the

             doctor we spoke to each police officer                     cdqi^^ny ing a body.   The

             doctor examined each person who was apparently dead, and pronounced

             life extinct.       I instructed each officer to record the name of the

             tfoctor and the time of examination upon the label attached to each

    ^jj^t/deceased.                   ime t         5me    procedure was being carried out by

             standby in the North Stand of the stadium.

                                                                                                              S2071

off     for S h e f f i e l d     in                            car,       an O r i on    1.6 Ghia.       We set off

from L i verpool            at about          11 am    <1100)      to get        to S he f fi e ld   in ample

time.        The     five    of us had tickets                va lu ed at £6 for the L ap pi ng s Lane

Stand,         I paid £6 for my ticket,                      J. as su me      the   others did the same.                 We

s e l e c t e d to drive          to    the    game

via the m o t o r w a y and we                found the traffic               quite      heavy and

c o mm en te d that         the    j ou rn ey took about              three quarters            of an hour       longer

than       normal.      We      did make        one stop on the way for                    petrol

and we had           lunch      in the        car when we arrived.                  We a rr iv ed    in S h e f f i e l d

§t about 2 .1 5 pm           ( 1 4 1 5 ) and     parked about              15 minu te s     from the ground

onto       the L ep pi ng s       Lane End.           I recall        we    parked on a housing            estate

an d we wa lk ed        past a          large DIY shop after                 about       five minutes.                  was

at    the Semi        Final       last year at S h e f f i e l d so he knew the way to the

ground.         On the walk             to the ground           I wa sn 't        directed      by Police

Officers although                 I did see several              on the          route    but   I have    seen more

a y other matches.



On my arrival           at      the L ep pi n gs Lane           I had       no diffi cu lt y      in identifying

my ^ t t r a n c e    point       but    I could see a mass                 of    people aro un d the        iron

     tes that        give access          to the turnstile area.                      These     gates were       open       I

would       say that        the    time was about 2 . 3 0              (1430)       to 2.35      (1435)    whe n    I

got     to the L ep pi ng s L a n e .



      n I w or ke d my way towards                    the    t ur ns ti le s     queues     began to form about

      to    15 feet     from them             in single       file after a fashion.                  I believe

that       there was a police                 officer       on each t u r n s t i l e searching           persons

entering.          /I d i d n ’t see an yo ne a tt em p ti n g               to organise        the mass      of

people sue though            I did see          three       police     o ff icers        on horseback      one     of

w hom      Lrhad seen before at Anfield.                         He    is about 45 to 50 dark skinned

           nned,     he has a silver             coloured m oustache,                 I have    heard him speak
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        S2071

at A n f i e l d and he has a L iverpool                  accent.          He was   shouting at        people

trying       to organise         but    the    task see too         large     given the       number    of

people       trying         to get    into the ground.



Uihe n       a rr i ve d at     the    t urnstiles        I was    s ea rc he d and then ent ered

j^mding          in my ticket as          I went     I e n te re d via entrance          *8*    I wasn't

         hed on my way to the              turnstiles        but    there was some        pushing.



As     I got      in I saw two         stewards      or    programme        sellers and       I st op pe d to

purchase          one.       I also    v i si te d the toilet        prior     to my    purchase and

then told us he knew w here                    to stand,      all    five     of us were still

toget he r at          this    time.



In respect            pf alcohol,       I did see anyone            d ri nking      inside the ground

a l th o u g h / I    heard    someone     comment        outside    that     they were       banning
             /
d ri n k i m g    inside and someone            commented         "Get     it down your       neck".     Our

         p hadn't        had a drink at all.


                                                 /
       then went         down the      tunnel .gvifig ac ce ss           to Pens 3 and 4 and                   ea^i

us to the            left    to the tunnel Vint/o Pen 4.                 We made    our way to the           left

of the       pen and took up            position and         10 deep from the           back wall       of the

West S t a n d and about              10 away from the fencing                to Pen 5.        The   pen at

this      time       <about 2. „45 p m ) < 1445)      was    t i gh tl y    packed and then began to

get      tighter and tighter.                 We were     standing         under a red and white             sign

on the West S ta nd a d ve r t i s i n g Suggs Sports                      I believe.     In the

crowd      I was       getting       less and    less     space     in w hi ch to stand and            I was

gett in g        hotter and hotter a l t ho u gh            it d i d n ’t get as hot as a sauna                in

my     position.            I could smell       the heat mi x e d wit h sweat            from    people

an d     thought       to myself       som eone w i l l     faint    in a minute        and    I then

h eard someone about 5                 infront     say,     "Help,       help my friends        fainted".

             The man was          palling       his mate     back and he went            behind me and p resumably

             up into        the West S t an d        by I d o n ’t know for           certain.      I had some

             m ov em e nt    and was      s u b j e c te d to any surge,             I never got to the stage

             whe n       I was a bout     to faint        but the thought            crossed my mind.             I think

             the     five    of us were         t og et he r at this time.            The   noise    of the        crowd was

             high and         I could see         some    of the game and saw            it halted a l t h ou g h        I

             d i d n ’t know      it was       because     of the      crush     I thought     it was     because       of

              people on the          pitch as a result             of an overspill,



                             e al is ed that       the    problem was        serious when        I saw people          being

                                  onto    the     pitch and they a p p e a r e d        lifeless,        I d i d n ’t move

                                  r%ce as       I w a s n ’t then      pressured.        I remember       that               was

                                    he West S ta nd        but    I. d o n ’t know whe n that was,            I

                     elation      to the       incident      I thought       that     the whole     thing was        dealt

           vJ police were         in a line across           the pitch whilst fans s t re tc he re d people

             some /could have            been a ss i st i ng      in other ways.



                a1 so feel        that    if more        p o 1 i ce had been outside         the gates        to organise

               he fans        perhaps an d only           perhaps      things may have        been different.

Dear Mr Wells

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

Thank you for your letter of 23 July to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. I have written under
separate cover to Ian Daines about the possible inspection of documentary evidence, and we
shall write further to arrange access as appropriate.

Your suggestion of a meeting to discuss matters is appreciated and we will be in touch once
the scrutiny is fully under way to discuss arrangements.

Yours sincerely




Mike Ward

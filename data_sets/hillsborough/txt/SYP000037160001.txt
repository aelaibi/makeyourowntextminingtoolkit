     Dear Sir

     TlV. HTT.T.SBOROPGH STADIUM    DISASTER -   -TONES DECEASED

     I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 4 August 1989, concerning Gary Jones a
     victim of the Hillsborough disaster in which you request the copy of a
     photograph in our possession and shown to Mr and Mrs Jones during our enquiries
     for possible use at the inquest on Gary.

     In reply I would advise you that the photograph concerned is one of a large
     number seized as evidence during the disaster enquiry from a variety of sources
     for use (a) in the Judicial Inquiry conducted by Lord Justice Taylor and (b) in
     connection with the Coroners Inquiry on behalf of Dr S Popper, H M Coroner for
     South Yorkshire, Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield S3 7ET.

     As the latter enquiry is still incomplete and the possibility of criminal
     charges has now a r is e n I am sure you will understand I would not want to start
     releasing copies of photographs at this stage. I can, however, confirm that
     copies of the photograph, your refer to, will be passed to the coroner and will
     be available, with any other evidence gathered for presentation at the inquest.

     Yours faithfully

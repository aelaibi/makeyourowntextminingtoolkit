           Wi th reference to the above      I report as follows s-On Satur da y 15th

           April   1989 I attended the F.A. Cup semi       final   between

           Liverpool and Nottingham F o re s-t^artT”H i li^bo rough, Shef field.  I
                       ”~'V)    ________
           attended with/my son                               of
                       /                 \
                    of                   s&^tioned                         and his brother
            X


           We travelled by car and because of difficulities sustained on leaving

           the M56 motorway at Stockport the previous year attending this

           similer occasion,    we    left Ormskirk at   llamyallowing       ourselves three

           hours to travel the di stance of about Jo miles.

           H o w e v e r , the lesson of the previous^year had not    been learned,      as when

           we arrived at this same junctio/T the re was a similar backlog of

           traffic waiting to leave ths/ri56.       We arrived at     this junction      at 12

           moon and it took one\houjp^to complete the final mile of that motorway.

           There was no control ax this junction whatsoever,           which is in the form

           of a roundabout.

           It did appear to me that a further section of the motorway had been

           co mplete d, and was so far advanced that       it already had the road

           markings on it.      Perhaps   consideratiron could have been given by those
                                                                                                      PAGE        2
                                                                                                      R6 2 A

                 in charge to have utilised this section which may have                    reduced the

                 backlong of traffic,          having had the same experience the previous year.

                 As a result,      this backlog of traffic meant          that the remaining 28 miles

                 to Sheffield were          in very heavy traffic.       This    resulted in us arriving

                 and parking about half a mile from the stadium about 2.20pm                     (1420).

                 The name of the road in which we parked is not familier to me but                          I

                 can describe          it as having a hospital    on it and leading to

                 St oc ks br id ge .    From there we walked to the Stadium and turned to our

                 left   into Leppings Ln and to the turnstiles which were then on our

                 right had side.

                 On this    particular journey we/were a pp ro ac he d by about a dozen persons

                 asking    if we had any spare Jii ckets for the m a t c h .

                 From leaving the car to turning             into Leppings Ln the volume of

                 supporters walking to tpe match was quite               light.     When we turned into

                 Leppings Ln,      there we/e a lot more supporters             present,   possibly in the

                 region of about 2000/              The vast majo ri ty of these did not apepar to be

                 moving towards anywhere,             merely hanging about,      particulary in the area

                 round the turnstiles.          Having had the experience of attending              last

                 years semi final,          I knew where to go,    but   it was obvious      that    others

                 did not and certainly I heard comments about the turnstiles makings

                 certainly no more than 1p to 12 and the queue at each at this time

                 about 2.40pm          (1440) wou^d be about    15-20 deep.

                 We approached the turnstiles entrance,             my turnstile      being on the         left

                 of two together,         and bping supervised by a Poli ce wo ma n on the outside

                 and both turnstiles          by a Policeman on the inside.

A\               At first,     there seemep no problem queuing but as we got nearer to the
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     R 6HA

turnstiles,       I began to feel    pressure being exerted from the              rear.

This never became unbearable but           it did make me think that a lot of

people were arriving       late,    either having been for a drink or being

delayed    in traffic as we had been.

Two    persons only stand out as being noticeable to me from the time                        I

spent    in the queue to the turnstile.           One    I would describe as being

male,    white,    25 years, 5*9 slim build,       dark sp&ft hair, wearing           light

coloured clothes.        He was stood inbetwejnf two queues facing away

from the Stadium drinking          cans of J3,uinness from a plastic            carrier    bag

He was    in my opinion drui

The other youth was the k&^son that entered the turnstile                       immediately

before me.        He had been searched by the Pol ic ew om an prior to this.                 I

would describe him as being male, white,                20 years, 5'     10 slim build,

short    cropped ginger hair,       he was wearing a green jumper and jeans and

carried a walking stick.

He was    refused entry at the turnstile,          obviously without a ticket.                   He

said to me on this way out          ’I ’LL TRY SOMEWH ER E E L S E . ’

Prior to him being       refused,    he had had a lengthy conversation with the

turnstile attendant and the Police Of f i c>r^irvs ide the ground.                   This

person,    in attempting to get       i n t h ^ S t a d i u m without a ticket,     hindered

the free flow of spectators getting through the turnstiles.

Once    inside the St^dr\um my jffoup and I quickly made our way to our

seats    in the North St<       >hi ch were    row 33 seats     148,     149,    150 and 151

and 152 which we reached via gangway R.                 We arrived at these seats at

2.50pm    (1450).

On looking    round the Stadium it seemed as though it had filled evenly,

apart from the standing enclosures at the Leppings Ln end,                       the end

allocated to the Liverpool          supporters.     That end appeared to have

three separate enclosures.           Two on the wings and a central              one behind

the goal mouth.
   The t w / ’enclosures on the w i n g s , althoug h being used,   were spars el y

   f i ysed with supporters,    the bulk of these^^prtffig at the rear.      Large

    pen spaces were in evidence at t b | ^ ^ r o n t , close to the perimeter

   fence.

(^\The   cenl                            y filled with supporters and having

   heard tf                              e sardines*   this would apepar

   appr o pr:

  Shortly                                merged onto the playing area and both

   sets of supporters      began to applaud their respective teams        including

   the supporters   in the packed centre area behind the goal mouth.               It

                                                -Hey were not    in any great

                                                 Leppings Ln goal.

   I saw persons trying         leave the centre standing enclosure by scaling

                                                 ed up into the seating a r e a

                                                  the supporters.      From the

   small   few who were attempting to leave the enclosure at first,           it

   quickly grew to large numbers and the supporters began to move             onto

   the playing ar e a .

   As this began to happen,        the referee took the players off the field to

   the dressing   rooms.    This    led to a baiting of the Liverpool      supporters

   by Nottingham Forest supporters by singing.          Obviously,     from their

   position in the Stadium,        which was a similar distance away from the

   crowd scenes as our own,        they were totally unaware of the      problems

                                                                               R6 2 A

     that had occurred.

     I appreciate that at this stage,     nobody realised the full extent         of

     the disaster and that their thoughts were of crowd trouble as were my

     own.     I felt that an early announcement    over the public address system

 would have alleviated this         problem,   informing the crowd that     it was

     not crowd trouble but that people had ben crushed,         even though the

     full extent of the incident was not known.

     This    baiting by the Notting ha m Forest supporters    caused a reaction

     from the Liverpool    supporters.   I saw one y o u t h , run from the crowds

     on the field towards the Forest supporters        in the Spion Kop.     He was

'male, white, about 20 years         of age,   long blonde hair. He was bare
[>
     chested and had scarves wrapped around his w r i s t .     He had obviously

     become    incensed by this chanting and looked as though he was

     beckoning the Forest    supporters to fight.

 He was        chased back by Police towards the crowd scenes where he was

     eventually arrested by Police Officers.

     I must say that during his behaviour Liverpool        supporters    in the North

     Stqand were shouting to him to "behave h i m s e l f ’ and when he was

 arrested,        this was greeted with applause,    not only from the Forest

     supporters but the Liverpool     supporters as well.

     The failure to have an early announcement       left people bewildered as to

     what was going on and it was sometime       later that an a n no un ce me nt was

     made over the public address system.       Unfortunately,     I am unable to

     say what that announcement was because the voice of the speaker was

     not clear,    the sound being quiet and muffled.

     As I have said earlier,     it appeared that those directly involved did

     not realise what was going on.      It appe ar ed on the face of it that

     people were just overspilling onto the playing area.           Once onto that

     area,    they were either wandering around or lying down away from the

     crowd.     It was only when I saw stretchers being carried across         the
ground that I realised people had been injured.                   Shortly after   that,

an ambulance was driven into the Stad iu m and drove along the side of

the pitch directly in front of us towards and into the goal mo ut h of

the Leppings Ln end.

There were two incidents which involved fighting that followed this.

One   in the Leppings Ln penalty area which involved a supporter who was

plainly distressed and could not be                  controlled by his colleagues and

who was eventually persuaded away by the Police and other                   in the North

Stand along gangway R around the area of row 38.                   I cannot give a

reason why this fight started,           but it was quickly quelled by other

supporters.

After a pause in the taunts of the Forest supporters,                   some of them

began to start singing again.             It y & s    obvious to the remainder of

thei r supporters that        it was    inaippropr iate to sing at that t ime and I

saw the majority of them trying to persuade them trying to persuade

them not to.                      g

H o w e v e r , the singing broudnt an immediate          reaction from some of the

Liverpool   supporters alrea dy on the           playing area.      Incensed by what

they had heard and not ^realising that the Forest supporters were still

in the dark as to what/had happened,                 they reacted by a number of t h e m ,

and I cannot recall       hlw many,       charging at the Forest s u p p o rt e r s in

the Spion Hop.            I
It looked at this stage as though the incident might get out of

control    but the police on duty at the Spion Kop end, albeit only a

few, went to face the charging Liverpool                 supporters.

I saw almost simultaneously two Police Officers at the end of the

Forest    penalty area,    one of whom body checked a supporter and the

other withdrew his truncheon.

Both had the desired effect            becase the incident was over before         it

started.    The supporters were quickly moved away by other supporters.

     Following this, about a hundred PoL^fce reinf or cements were m ar c he d

     into the Stadium from the area between the North Stand and the Spion

     Kop.     They were positioned al^ng the front of the North Stand at the

     side of the playing area,

     I can understand why tha$ were       positioned there,    to prevent any

     trouble from the Liverpool       supporters who would have had easy access

     to the    playing a r e a A n d were not controlled fay the perimeter   fence,

     but this brought jr hostile      reaction from those supporters who

 \   obviously felt tynat their services would be better equipped helping
  a o the supporters/at the Leppings Ln end.
<r
   ^ J h e y did not/stay there long but were taken to the centre of the

     playing areia and used as a cordon a cross the half way line.           It was

     still    fell however,   by the supporters   in the North Stand that they

     would be/better employed looking to give assistance to the           injured.

     Around tfhis time, Liverpool      supporters began running to all       parts of

     the gropnd,    ripping advertising hoardings from their        positions and

     tak i ng Ithem back for the    injured.

     At first the stretchers and advertising boards,          being carried by both

     supporters and police and a mixture of both,         looked as though they

     contained only injured persons,       but as the steady stream carried them

     from Leppings Ln to the       playing area by the North S t and /S pi on Kop

     exit,    the first of the dead were being      brought over.     I saw a number

     of dead then that followed and they were being          laid out in an area by

     the corner flag.

     Nottingh am Forest supporters were then obviously aware of what had

     happened and generously applauded the Liverpool          supporters each time

     they ran across with the       injured or dead.

     It was when one of these hoardings were being carried across the pitch

     that    I saw the same man who I had seen earlier drinking Guinness by

     the turnstiles.      He was helping to carry one of these boards.

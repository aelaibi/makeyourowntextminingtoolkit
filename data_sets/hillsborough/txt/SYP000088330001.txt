                  t he     Northern General               Hospital         since       1973.

                  I qualified            in    1974      in S h e f f i e l d    my    qualifications            a re      Fellow         of    the

                  Medical       Laboratory Management                      <CMLM).

                  On Saturday            151h A p r i 1 1 989          ( 1 5 0489 ),        at   aproxirnately          1530        hours       I was

                  listening           to m y    car      ra d i o   when     I heard         that    there      was     something              wrong

                  at      Hillsborough.              They     d i d n ’t s a y    it w a s       a major       incident          but      were

                  requesting           doctors        to a t t e n d at         Hillsborough.           At      that       stage         I carried

                  on my      journey          home.

                  on the        television and              heard     that       there       were    a number         of    fatalities

                  resulting           from     the    Hillsborough              incident.           I decided         to go         to    the
Nor then General                  H / f s p i ta 1    to       see    if     I could          be of      assistance.

t ha t     he    ha d a l r e a d y        left       for       the     hospital.

I arrived            at     the     hospital              at    approximately                 17. 15 h o u r s ^ m d            was

within          minutes        of m y a r r i v a l             and     together           we     completed             clerical           work

relating           to     bodies        that         had a r r i v e d        at     the m o r t u a r y          over       the w e e k e n d ,

 We      also      labelled          the      refrigerator                   doors       as      each    new body a r r i v e d                at

the      mortuary           from      the     temporary               mortuary.               W hen a body a r r i v e d               it

would       be a c c o m p a n i e d        by a h o s p i t a l jxfrter                   but     I am       unable          to

To    the       b es t    of m y      recollections                   we     received            twelve       (12)       bodies        but      I

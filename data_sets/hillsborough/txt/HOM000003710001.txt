  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT:   RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW
  OFFENCES AND PENALTIES

  I should be grateful if paragraph 5 of the letter to ACPO could be
  amplified.  I suggest everything after the first sentence is
  deleted and replaced by:

       "There are two points on which we should welcome ACPO's
       comments. First, do you see attendance centre orders as
       being an effective way of responding to football hooliganism;
       and, if so, what are the implications for police resources of
       implementing the recommendations? Second, since many Chief
       Constables act as agents for managing attendance centres on
 _     behalf of the Home Office and most centres are run by police
 ft    officers in their own time, it would be particularly helpful
       to have ACPO's views on the feasibility of extending the
       arrangements in the way proposed".

  2.       No changes are needed to the draft letter to the CPS.




                                                 MISS J M GOOSE

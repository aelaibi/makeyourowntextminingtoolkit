1011.     HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

          The Committee considered a report of the Chief Executive upon a
request from Liverpool City Council that this Council give its support to the
campaign to achieve a fresh inquest into the Hillsborough Disaster.

          RESOLVED -    That Knowsley Borough Council:~

          (i)     notes that the "Hillsborough" television programme

                  (a)    in uncovering fresh and unused evidence about the
                         disaster, has enabled the campaign for justice for the
                         bereaved families which this Council has supported
                         since 1989. to be taken forward on a stronger basis;
                         and

                  (b)    in bringing to national attention many of the issues
                         surrounding the disaster about which much of the
                         general public has remained in ignorance, has served
                         to expunge the many lies about the nature of the
                         disaster which have perennially surfaced in certain
                         parts of the British media and to finally embed the
                         true story of the disaster firmly on the national
                         consciousness;

          (ii)    in the light of the above, places on record its thanks and
                  sincere appreciation to Granada Television and in particular
                  to factual producer Katy Jones and writer Jimmy McGovern for
                  their services to bereaved families and to survivors of the
                  disaster in having the conviction to commission, research,
                  write and broadcast the programme;

          (iii)   place on record its appreciation to all the media who have
                  given positive support to the renewed calls for justice
                  following the transmission of the programme;


          (iv)    in particular, places on record its thanks to the "Daily
                  Mirror" and their journalist Brian Reade, for their
                  exceptionally robust coverage of the programme and
                  specifically for:-

                  (a)    their front page lead on the morning of the
                          transmission of the programme and the accompanying
                         articles which focused national attention on the
                         contents of "Hillsborough" and provided a detailed
                         analysis of the arising implications; and

                  (b)    the national petition launched by the newspaper for a
                         new inquest into the disaster, the terms of which this
                         Council fully supports;

          (v)     expresses thanks to the many people from all areas of the
                  country who have indicated their feelings of anger following
                  the programme and who have also expressed a desire to assist
                  the families' campaign for justice in any way possible;

          (vi)    notes the legal advice which has been received by the
                  families and fully endorses their demands that:-

                  (a)    in the light of the fresh evidence which has emerged

                         Houldsworth's evidence was kept from public scrutiny;
                         and

                  (b)    the Attorney General orders the High Court to consider
                         quashing the inquest verdict of accidental death and
                         order a fresh inquiry;

          (vii)   requests religious leaders to write to the Director of Public
                  Prosecutions and the Attorney General in support of the
                  families demands;

          (viii) notes with appreciation the stated intention of Liverpool
                 Football Club to assist the families in any possible way; and

          (ix)    conveys its thanks to the Homes Secretary, Michael Howard in.

                    Dear Mrs Hudson

                    Thank you for your lett^ax;-abM£:thff-•traoi-G-evehts at Hillsborough
                    in which you called for a reopening of"the public enquiry.

                   The Home Secretary has seen the television programme Hillsborough
                   and found it deeply moving and harrowing. In the House of Commons
                   he gave an undertaking to consider carefully the points which
                   were raised in the programme and the representations which have
                   been made to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has
                   emphasised that he would not take the decision to reopen the
                   inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be
                   in the public interest to do so and that it would stand a chance
                   of providing a better understanding than there is at present of
                   what happened on that terrible day.

                   In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider
                   whether there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether
                   that evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been
    ^              put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome
                   of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been
                   different.

                   The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide
                   the Home Secretary with a detailed report of all the points
                   raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that he
                   will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon
                   as he has been able to consider all the issues.

                   He has emphasised that, whatever decision he comes to make, his
,                  thoughts will remain with all the bereaved families.
f
                   Yours sincerely




                   Mrs P Mehta

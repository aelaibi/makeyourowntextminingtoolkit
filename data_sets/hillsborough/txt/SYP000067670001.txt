                    me     started        to    get       to     the      stage        where       I couldnt             breath.            I managed              to

                    stopped        s h o u t ing         and     fell       to    the       fYaor

                    thought        that        I was       standing              on    clothing.

started         Ya    climb          over    the       fj-^ces to          get     out     of    the    crush.

I do     remember           at       this    time       there        was    a sudden            surge    in t/ne           crowd and             I

was     pushed        forward.               It wa s       as      though       the       team    had    s c o r e d a goal             but

the     crowd        did    not       go     back.         It      then became            a frantic          f re e    fo r   all,

everyone         was       in a       state       of    panic: s t r u g g l i n g         to    survive.             There        were

children         being        pased          over       our     heads towards              the    pitch and over                 the

barriers         to    safety.               I looked           to m y r i g h t       a n d s a w a girl             go    dow n .          I

thought         she    wa s      about       19    ( I ’v e / s i n c e     l e a r n ’t she w a s           o n ly    1 5 ).       Sh e

was     dressed        in     blue         jeans       andr b l a c k      sweatshirt.             She       had m ed i um            cut

fair     hair,        proportionate                buftld.          We     managed         to    get    her      b ac k     off       the

ground        and     lifted          her    above        our      h e ad s .      He r    face    was       marked




sh e    was     struggling             to    get/her          breath and

front, a n d         over     the      feiyte

We     were     still       struggling             to     survive.              It w a s    a matter           of     staying           on

your     feet        and    breathing.                 I then       saw an         ambulance           come     onto        the       pitch

and     it s t o p p e d      in f r o n t        of    the     pen      I also        s a w a f i r e m a n at            the     fence

pressure         of    th e      crowd       started          to     ease       off.       I saw       pfople         falling           to

the     ground        as    it       started       to     eas e .        I looked          over          the        gate      at, the

front      of    pen t h r e e         and       saw a stack             of a b out        foui/bodies.                At     this

stage      I sat, d o w n            on th e      terrace          with                I looked around,                    it w a s

total      devastation.                    The    police        were       n ow    removing        bodies           from      the       pens.

I dont, k n o w        how       long       I sat       there        I was        totally        in a    state         of     shock.             I

remember         seeing          a    pathway          through        the       people      to    the    tunnel.              We      both

           * got    up a n d        moved      towards        the       tunnel       stepping        over    the   bodies       that    were

             crumpled          on    the    ground.           As    I went       through        the       tunnel   I saw a number

             of    bodies       1y i n g    at    the    si d e .        I d i d n ’t k n o w    if    they were       dead      or

             i nj u r e d .

             When       we    reached       the     other      end       there       were    even more        bodies.       There       were

             some       with    coa t s     over     there         heads     and      people     crying       over    t h em.     J. wa s

             in t o t a l      shock,       I felt       so    guilty        about      the     man

                   by me.           I kept       saying       to m y s e l f     it    should     have       b e e n rne.




             We    eventually met                up w i t h    our      f r i e n d s at a b o u t    4 . S O at   the      tunnel.         It

             was    a    relief       t ha t     t h e y w e r e okay.          We    made    our     way    to      the car     park

             phoning          home    on    the     route.         We    left    Sheffield           at    4.30      andarrived         home

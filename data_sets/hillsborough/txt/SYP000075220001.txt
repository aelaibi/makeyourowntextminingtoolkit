W i n s f o r d Liverpool     S upport ers     O^ab        is an official        club.      I o b t a i n e d my

m a t c h ticket from Gary on the morning                       of the match.        The    ticket          cost

me twelve       pounds and was         for the       seats       in the Leppings Ln stand.

eo-ihs^i went straight         to Sheffield,      not making any stops. We did get
                    '            t<-  Q jiJIcuutS      -

cie 1ayeciN^n the way.          This was brcause of traffic lights between

S tockport and getting           into Sheffield.                There was a lot of traffic                    on

the    road as well.          I think we were              derived for        between an hour an an

hour aTvd a half altogether.                  We a ct ua l ly atV ived in She f f i e 1 d at about

five ffiinut^&ito two          <1355).        The    coach driver parked            in a large              coach

park which was about a mile               from       the Ground.             AfterN^e got       off the

coach,     I went wit h some          other    lads,       about    five      or six,   to a pub t hat

was    near the      coach    park.     We 'H^d about           three    pints    in the        pub which

was    packed w i t h sL iv er po o 1 suppo r teXs .             I c a n ’t remember       the       name of

the    pub.     We   lyeft tlie pub at about           twenty five to three                (1435)       a nd we

all walked       towards      the Ground.           I knew where         the G r o u m ^ was         because       I

 as at    the Liverpool,         Notts.       Forest       semi-final         at HillsboiN^ugh last

year.      It took us about           ten minutes          to walk      to the G r o u n d .         While we

sort    of trouble      on the way to the Ground?                   everyone was        singing and

seeing     three Policemen,           one was a Sergeant,               standing     on the          corner of

a street,       with a lot of beer tins               by them.          Some    of the tins were              open

and the       re'si were     unopened.        There was         between       thirty and forty tins,

                                          just people everywhere.  I saw

    about five Police Of f\ce rs at the turnstiles, two of them were on

    just    out of hand.             I d i d n ’t see any stewards                 at all.         It was         chaos at

    both sets         of turnstiles.                At first        I tried to get in through the                     left

    hand    turnstiles,          the     ones       that     bring you        into the seats.             There was            no

    way of getting            through to            them turnstiles,             there was too           many      people.

    Beca us e    of this,        I pushed           my way ar ou nd the fence to get                     a ro un d to the

    other 't'mrnst i 1 e s , the ones to the                     right.       I remember          seeing a lot            of

    young'N^ad.s climbing              onto       the top of the metal               fence       in between the,

    It was      chaos at        these turnstiles as well.

    At three         o ’clock    (15QQ)         you    could hear from the noise                   in the G ro u n d

    happening,         but    I just      got      carried       in the      rush.      The      crowd went         to the

    right    towards         the gate           round the      corner      from the turnstiles.                    I knew

    there was a gate there                      because     I have been to that Ground about                          five

    times.       I was       carried       round towards.. this gate                 by the       crowd.          Whe n   I

    The    crowd       all   went      through theN^ate.                 I d o n ’t remember seeing any

    About    two hundred           people         came     in through the gate.                  It was a rush

pounds        I decided to take my seat.                     I knew that when          1 got    in the

Ground?        I couldn't       get to where my seat was                 because       it was    the other-

side     of the stand,          behind the metal              fence    on my    left.     I knew    I had to

get    through     the gate         to my     left?       that would     be Gate B.        The gate was

closed but        I saw a steward             standing        on the gate,        so I went     over to him

and    showed him my ticket.                  He had a look at           the ticket and said okay,

then he opened the              gate and       I went        through with another          couple      of

lads.         As soon as we got             through the stewards              closed the gate again.

Can    I just     clarify what             I ’ve just said?        the steward didn't a ct ua ll y

open Gate B,         he opened a metal               gate     just to the       left of the gate.             If

he had a c t u a ll y oepned              the gate,       everyone w ould have          gone through.

1 d i d n ’t see anyone           drinking       inside the G r o u n d , neither did             I see

anyone        fighting     or any sort of disorder.                    As soon as       I had got through

the metal        gate,     I went         straight       to the steps      that    bring you up to the

.coate        Thoeg were        no stewards          or Police        by the steps,       so 1 w alked

                         At the    top of the steps,               there was a couple of stewards

telling        people where        to go.       They weren't a c t u al l y           looking at    tickets.

I found my seat w hich was                   right at the front,              in row one.       When     1 got

                      fell    forwards.         I hit     the ground and        lost    consciousness.           W hen    I came

                      round,,    I became aware           of somebody holding my hand.                   I sat up and there

                      was a woman,        who    I did not know,        holding my hand.             She    said to me,

                      "Are you a l r i g h t ? ’
                                               "        I said,    "Yes",     Then she said,         “Y o u ’ve been

                      knocked out for twenty m i n u t e s 1’.              The w om an stayed with me.

                      I mmediately after           that,    I realised that          there were      two    people       under my

                      legs.      The woman -tielped me to my feet and on looking                          down    I could see

              tO .   a w o m a n and a young        boVv lying on the ground.                Bot h the w oman and the

                      of feet away from the tunnel                  entrance.        Their   eyes were       open but       there

              illT was      no movement at all;            they were        obv io us ly dead.      The woman        1 would

                             the ones withut            sleeves.     The young       boy was white,         aged    between

                      ten and fifteen.             He    had short    fair hair from what            I could see because

                      he was also wearing a red and white Liverpool                          sun hat on his

                      head.      He was well        built;      he was wearing         jeans,     I c a n ’t remember what

                      by somebody.         There was obviously              nothing     I could do so        I started

                      walking     away towards Gate C.               I could see a lot of            injured       people

                      walking     towards Gate C where              there were       some ambulances.            I remember

                      seeing another           lad lying on the ground near to the bottom of the steps

that    1 had fell           down.     He was          lying on his           own,       there    being      no other

people      near him.            He was lying on his                 front,       but his head was             so much

to the side           that    it     looked like he had got a broken                           neck and       was

obv io u s l y dead.          All    I can say about              that      lad was        that he had dark

hair and a blue              coloured jumper.

I got     outside Gate C/N^pd a St.                     Johns A m b u l a n ce m an had a look at m y

left knee.            This was       because as a result                   of my fall          down    the steps,             I

had a swollen             left     knee.        He    looked at my knee and                 checked for any

breaks,       but there were n' t any.                   I was a sked             if I wanted         to go to

hospital        but    I said        no.

Throughout        the time           that 1 regained            c o n s c i o u s n e s s , the woman         who had

been holding my hand                 remained with me.                 I left the Ground with this

w o m a n and    I was       very upset          by this       time,       an d    crying a lot.             I jjsr ft    the

Ground     between four a'Q.d half                    past    ( 1600-1630) .

I would       1 ike to s a y        that from the time that the game was stopped,

there     just w e r e n ’tSeno u g h Police                 there    to    cope.        The     o nes there did a

good job,        but there weren't                   enough.     The       tannoy was h o p e l e ss because

it just       kept     s a v i n g , "Don't          get onto    the       pitch" and when             people

e v e n t u a l l y got    onvs the        pitch,       it would       say,        "Get back off the             pitch",

I thought       thsl there           could have          been more First Aid people                       to c op e

w ith the a m o u n txtf           injured. ,,

Overall,        I would saysthat                thereSwas       terrible           overcrowding and not

e nouoh Police and ' ^ e w a n d s               to cope with t h a t .              I thought         that     tne

L i v erpool     fans shou Id have               been    in the S pi on Hop end due                    to the amount

and    that     it could have          been easily organised.                        The    pens that were

really full,           three and four,                had no escape           routes.          If there       had have

been,     a lot of people w o u ld have been s a v e d ,

            I am aware       of the help    line    number     in relation to the tragedy.

            I did hand my ticket          in at    the Ground?     and   retained all   the ticket.

            However,       I have since    d es troyed   it.

  With     permission,           Mr     Spea ke r ,       I     should           like     to     make        a

f a t a l i t i e s a n d injuries.


T h e m a t c h was d u e to s t a r t at 3 p.m.                   To help e n s u r e o r d e r l y
a ccess, the g a t e s of the g r o u n d w e r e o p e n e d at 12 noon.                               At

                                                   2.




 At    about      2.45     p.m.     t here        was    a     large    crowd       of     Liverpool
 s u p p o r t e r s at the t u r n s t i l e s in L e p p i n g s Lane b e h i n d the W e s t
 Stand.       T h e r e was d i f f i c u l t y     in c o p i n g w i t h the p r e s s u r e on
 the t u r n s t i l e s and the p o l i c e            used    loudhailers          to u r g e      the
 c r o w d to be patient.


A t a b o u t 2.50 p.m. m o r e L i v e rp o o l s u p p o r t e r s a r r i v e d and the
n u m b e r s in f r o n t of the t u r n s t i l e s i n c r e a s e d to some t h r e e to
four      thousand.         Some    supporters            started       to c l i m b      the w a l l s
a n d t u r n s t i l e s and t hose at the f r o n t of the c r o w d w e r e u n d e r
c o n s i d e r a b l e p r e s s u r e f r o m t hose behind.          The police officers
p r e s en t , m o u n t e d and on foot,               were    unable       to    relieve         this
pre s su r e .


The     senior       o f f i c e r .present         considered          that      there        was      a
p o s s i b l e d a n g e r to the lives of the s p e c t a t o r s at the f r o n t
of the crowd,            and in o r d e r to r e l i e v e the p r e s s u r e a r r a n g e d
for an e x i t g a t e n e a r the t u r n s t i l e s to be o p e n e d to let a
s e c t i o n of the c r o w d through.             W h e t h e r that a c t i o n c o n t r i b u t e d
to the d i s a s t e r on the t e r r a c e s h o r t l y a f t e r w a r d s            is c l e a r l y
a c e n t ra l q u e s t i o n to be in v e st i g a t e d .
                                                     3.




I would        like     to pay         tribute        to all          those     involved    in the
subsequent        res c ue       operations           at   the        ground,     including     the
many     spectators        who g a v e          their help;            and to t hose others,
i n c l u d i n g the v o l u n t a r y a g e n c i e s who h a v e s i n c e b e e n w o r k i n g
so h a r d t r e a t i n g the inj u re d and c o n s o l i n g the b e reaved.


I h a v e a s k e d for f u r t h e r fac t ua l rep o rt s f r o m the p o l i c e and
other      services,             the     local        authority           and     the      Football
Association.            I n q u es t s will be held in due course.                         But over
and a b o v e this,        t h e r e is a need for a full                       and     independent
i n q u ir y to i d e n t i f y the c a u s e s of the d i s a s t e r and to e x a m i n e
w h a t n e e d s to be d o n e to p r e v e n t such an a c c i d e n t h a p p e n i n g
again.       I h a v e t h e r e f o r e a s k e d Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r to c a rry
o u t an inquiry, w i t h the f o l l o w i n g terms of r e f erence:


          "To     i n q u ir e    into         the   eve n ts     at    Sheffield

          necessary               changes            in         the       relevant
           legislation".
Mr G e o f f r e y     Dear,        the C h i e f C o n s t a b l e of the W e s t M i d l a n d s „
                                                                                                   1
has     agreed         to      a s s i s t the inquiry as an a s s e s s o r ;               and
arrangements            will      be m a d e as n e c e s s a r y             for o t h e r q u a l i f i e d
a s s e s s o r s to be a p p o i n t e d and for the inquiry to be p r o v i d e d
with     technical             advice          and support.           I      am   asking           that    the
i nquiry s h o u l d p r o c e e d         w i t h all p o s s i b l e speed. Lord J u s t i c e
T a y l o r will       be v i s i t i n g       Sheffield          as soon as p o s s i b l e this
w e e k [ t o m orrow] to b e g i n his i n v e s t i g a t i o n .                  I a m g r a t e f u l to

An app e al          fund       is b e i n g    set up by            [for w h a t p u r p o s e ]          The

this fund.


The     events         at     S h e f f i e l d w e r e an a p p a l l i n g         tragedy        and     the
memory      of       them       will      remain.           Our      task now          is     to     examine
urgently         how        they c a m e a b o u t and w h a t                e l s e can be d o n e to
minimise          the          chances           of     arec u rr e n c e .                 Our     thoughts
immediately            are      with      the      familes         of        those    who     lost        their
lives, and w i t h the injured.                        The w h o l e House, and indeed the
whole      cou n tr y ,        will        Join       in      sending them                  our heartfelt
sympathy.

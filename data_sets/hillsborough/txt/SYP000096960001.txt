 arrangements are made for the Police, the Fire Service, and the Building
 Control Officer of the appropriate District Council to carry out their Inspections
 at the same time, in order to avoid undue Inconvenience to applicants, although
 it appears likely that testing of crush barriers will of necessity take place on a
 separate occasion.

 Dear Sir

 T^--'OFFICE CIRCULAR KO. 130/76

   fjETi OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975:                                            .
 FIRST DESIGNATION OilDER AND ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS

 1. The intention was expressed in Horns Office Circular No. 150/1975 of issuing, in
 due course, further guidance on the procedure to be followed when a ground is designated
 under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 as requiring a safety certificate. ' As~
 will be seen from the enclosed copy, an order has now been made (SI 1976 Ko. 126*0
 designating under the Act. with effect from 1 January 1977, the international association,
 and rugby union football grounds and those of the clubs in the first division of the
 football league.

 2. It is an offence under section 12(1) of the Act to admit spectators to a designated
 stadium after the dare on wirlch the designation order relating to it co.r,es into
 operation, unless an application for a general safety certificate has been m\de and not
 subsequent]y withdrawn or deemed to have been withdrawn* In consequence, therefore,
 of this order, the local authorities for the areas in which, the grounds are situated
 ram jxpect to receive by the date of operation applications for the grant of general
     ■■ty certificates under the Act, which will thereupon fall to be dealt with in
'^g^rdauce with the Act and the regulations, also enclosed made under section 6(1) of
W e Act (SI 1976 Ho. 12b3).

 J>o Guidance as to the procedure to be followed, in conformity with the regulationr,,
 in dealing with applications for general safety certificates is set out in ths aunex
 to this circular*

     It is not proposed at this stage to issue guidance a/-; to the procedure to bo
followed in connection with the grant of special safety certificates, since, under
section 3(2) of the Act, such certificates are not required until general safety
certificates are in operation* Further guidance for this purpose will accordingly be
deferred until nearer the date when a need for spccis.1 safety certificates may arias«
TJicro is, however, one laccor regarding the issue of such certificates which may have
a bearing on the date of the introduction of a general safety certificate and to which
regsvd suould accordingly be paid. Oncc- a general safety certificate has been issued,
a person wishing to conduct an activity calling for the issue of a special safety
certificate i:*.u3t comply with all the requirements relating to ouch certificates 3aid
dowr in the regulations. Where, therefore, such an event has already been arranged,
local*authoriticr; ray v.dsh to consider, where appropriate, the desirability of not
issuing a general certi.fic.-te until after the event has ta3:en place*

5c The- regulations provide upecific time liniivs for the determination of application.'.;
for-           safety certificate.-.:, but this is not the case ae regards goner:;!, saiel.y
cert:i ficatcco Although lo«..a.i authorities and the- clubs a.-jd other orgunioaI••ons         ir.;;
         !,dll };0 dv>i’
                       A;t have done as much pre-plaaning .as powsibj.o, it is a^su.-tcd thac the
J
-r




;Ofys
   Y S and. consultations involved in determining suitable terms and conditions will,
Uny cases, still extend ever several weeks, so that it will not bo practicable,
•cinl.i.y should appellate proceedings arise, to bring certificates into effect
ificantly in advance of the end of the 197b/77 season* In these circumstances,
 './hero a club or stadiun cosupany wishes to take advantage of the close season to
 ■y cut structural work which will have the effect of .-significantly altering the
ic mid conditions which would otherwise have applied, local aut.horit.iea may feel that,
•nding on the condition of the stadium ana having regard to the powers already
..Table to de/il with cases of cevr.ro rick, the maximum advantage is to be gained by
srring the issue of a certificate until the beginning of the 1977/73 season so as
•:uu>le as much work as possible to be done*la this way, it     is hoped that it will
vally be possible for s. sufficient measure of agreement to be reached between the
•rested parties to obviate the need for appeals against the terms and conditions
sscd*

 It is suggested in paragraph 3 of tho annex thirt local authorities will wish to keep
 nnd tne guidelines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds when framing the         ^ {
Litions vliicii they consider should be included in the safety certificate* Some of
$iAcoernendtione have been revised in tho light. of the experience gained in applying
 guidelines during the past year or so* Tha Guido is being reprinted and should be
.lab?-3 well before the first designation order becomes effective; a copy will be sent
,-ou. as soon as it bocciaes available - A list of the proposed amendments to the Guide
*.ttached for reference in the meantime*

 Section 6(1 )(b) of the Act enables the Secretary' of State to make regulations
lerisiap; local authorities to doicrr.iine {.he fees which n:ay be charged in respect of
l.ications for safety certificates-. In the. discharge of this power, regulation
.-ides that such charts r.:iv ba i.v-ide in respect cf applications for the issue or
vtosnt of safety o«a*fcificatvs, bub that they shall not exceed an amount cessmonsurate
1 the work actually o:id reasonably done* As regards the issue of a general safety
iificatn it is hoped that, by affording stadium authorities an opporttmity to co-operate
the full, fcy cp; preparing pinna, checking crush barriers, etc, local authorities should,
the n o w i l course, not find it necessary to charge fees representing more than 17
''daya 1 work*

 The clubs r.-.nd stadium authorities ’..’hose sports grounds are named .in tho designation     {
:r have boon advised about ti;/.ir posit ion. A copy’of that letter is enclosed for
:*^for/satien* The no to appended to the letter and cc/ering the procedure l'egording
liSuionj; for general safety certificates is in tho ca;ne tex'i:i3 as the annex to this
;u.lar,

  A further copy of this circular is enclosed for the infcr.-nation of the Chief •
 •jici.al Officer*

                                                      Yours faithfully

'isS-pnOCEDURE RBQAIiDXXQ APPLICATIONS IOB GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATE

  1.    The Rogu3.atj.oiiG provide that any application for a safety certificate shall bo
  nade la tho for;;i contained in tho SchaduLle to tha he-julations or a form to the like
  effect. Copies of tho form are being eyjdo available to potential applicants ana they
  arc* Using advised of the need to provido such information in support of their applica­
  tion a.ii will enable tho local authority to discharge its functions under the Act. In
  particular, tho application should bo accompanied by detailed information ao to tho
  structure, cap,••city, etc of tho stadiujij, including plans of the stadium, certificates
  rolating to tho testing of crush barriers and evidence of the applicant's status. X t
  is, however, open to a local authority, Under section 3(*0 of the Act, to require, by
  notice in writing, such further information of this kind as it may consider n e cQ o so xy
  to enable it to doterrains tha terms and conditions to be included in the certificate,

  2.    Cn roeoipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local authority
  must first determine whether tho applicant is a qualified person, ie a pereon lilcoly
  to be in a position to prevent contravention of the teres and conditions to be 5s.vjoaod
      tha certificate. If it co,t5side.rs him to be such a person tho authority is then
    dor a duty to issue a general safety certificate to hira. In tho case of a general
  safety certificate, where considerations of time era not paramount, the regulations
  impose no specific tiiao limit for such a determination. In any event, it nsiteio rrica
  facie unlikely that an application for a general safety certificate would be mad* by
  an" unqualified person, there is, however, a right of appeal ©gainst a determination
  by a local authority that an applicant is not. a qualified person (see paragraph 10).

   3.    The local authority is required, by section 3 0 ) of the Act, to send a copy of
   any application for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chief
   Officer of Police end building authority, and must consult them about tho terns and
   conditions to be h ^ l a d o d in the certificate. In flawing fnieh conditions, local
   authorities vrill no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles cr guide lines sot out in
   tho Gnida to Safety at Spores Grounds. In this connection local authorities ere
   reminded that, as vas pointed cut in paragraph 6 of tho Annex to Howe Offico Ciroulcr
  .No. 150/1975, this nor.-statutory document is not a sec of requirements to be rigidly
   applied re gar dloas of Individual circumstances. The Rsxiarasi fD.exibility should be
   maintained to lake account of the different cireu&stuncco at individual grounds deriv­
   ing from differences in such cattera as age, si::*,e and aoda of construction. In this
.Aregard, it should also be noted that the Act provides that ths terms end condition':,
   should be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety'3 and it vrould fco
   unreasonable, even if it vcre practicable, to seek the absolute safety of everyone
   attending tho sports etadiua.

   if,  it is envisaged that there will bo a good doal of consultation between the local
   authority arid the stadias ropreesntntives in tho process of drawing up the certificate
   conditions. In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is rarely filled t o
   capacity, the local author!by may consider it proper to base its requirements on octvnl
   levels of attendiuica over a given period rather than oa maximum capacity. On tho
   occasions on which a' capacity crowd could be expected, separate provision tni^ht bo
   for this contingency on the lines indicated in part’greph 7 beloi/. Again, if a stand
   were found to be structurally weak, tho local authority might, in consultation v;ith th-.:
   stadium repres&nfeativcs, offer tho choice of having apy necessary remedial vorks
   carried out or of restricting admission to the otuiid until it had.been strengthened.

   %    As will b- apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content of a
   safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of tho individual
   case. Accordingly, a standard fora of certificate would not be appropriate;. It s.;ast
   however contain full details of tho terms and conditions imposed ii'xlndi.ug, in
   particular, the ratters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and have aar-orcd to it
   a plan of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be frar^d.
 e.rtificata vhe»n first- issued cay contain r®et.victive conditions which con then bo
 od ox' dolotsd by ciucndraonfc of tho certificate. The local authority nay find it
 i'iont to listc in u covering letter to the certificate, such rcodiflentions ao
 bo r,ubBeqv.o.vii,ly permitted, eg in tho form of n statement of the increased spectator
  itioo to bo al'Aouud for tha separate sections of tho ground whan tho various
 iSSnro ccwnlofcod, of any fufcura works profjrasacie fox' tha ground which' has boon
 d with tha Gindina authorities. This arrangement, by excluding from tho certif--
   itsolf proponed conditions which would apply only to future works, should eorvc
 via.Ce confusion. At tha boko time, howaver, c w s must be taken not to oxcludc
 ths certificate any restriction g-ruon© to current conditions, einco section 5 (3 )
 e Act provide?.: for an interested party to appeal to the Secretary of Stato againut
 .nd u o ion of anything in„ or the onission of car?thing fros, a cafoty ccrtificata,
 has© righto must not bo prejudiced in any way in consequence of the form cf tha
 .ficato*

 As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the Act
.don that different terms and conditions may bo included for differant activities.
,u$jf therefore* a stadium luay bo in regular uso only as a football ground, in
• vhero it is also ueed from tinve to tiuo to stage other events it would be dosir-
  and in ttony cacao obviate the nosd for. special safety certificates, if the terms
:ondifcio.ns appropriate to those events were to bo included in the geusral certif-
>. It is sujr^estod that any such events for which it is considered desirable to
Ldelight conveniently be divided into 2 classes:

 (1 )   those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of tho
        stadium for the normal terms and conditions to bo equally applicable;

 (2)    Those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches* pop
        concorte, etc which isay involve all or part of tho playing area bain#
        given over to spectator aecourvodation and for which separate terns and
        conditions vrill have to bo dcviood. It is not, of course, necessary to
        provido for these contingencies in. cases where no clear need is foroesen
        by tho etadiuia authorities.

 Thera m y also be circu;sstrr,ces in v;hich the tanas and conditions applicable to
nor-r.al activity of the i$U%C&vai inay be found to be inappropriate, eg when a s ocial
t, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected to attract significantly noro
  the usual attendance. In the cas?« ospscially of cup replays the so epocio.1 events
a x 'is o with only a fov? days' notice, within which it would not bo possible to
riiniodafce tho whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to the grant of a special
ty certificate. In order to ovcrcomo this difficulty, it would seem desirable for
X o ^ L authorities and stadiu:o authorities to t»3Gk to work out in advance the
.fi^ions to the normal torma and conditions which might be appropriate to such
isiona, eg the admission of increased nunbsrs to certain areas on tho condition
; extra cfcowards and poli.ee fire employed, that uotico is given to the local
lorily, and so on, aiiid to provide for their incorporation in the general safety
,ificato.

   Onco a general safety cortificato has been issued, subject to the determination of
 appeal,'the terms and conditions can bo varied only by forrcal amendment of tha
Sificate, which may be at the initiative cither of the holder of the certificate or
tho local authority (see section h(P.) of tho Act) and will presumably reflect
i^ot-s in circumstances occurring sincc the grant of tho original cortiiicato*        It
).°thua be to tho mutual benefit of local authorities and clubs/stadium authorities
 a close liaison to bo roaintainod after the issue- of the certificate and certainly
lo e-ny further works of cafoty ine&eureu are boing carried out. It is likoly to be
the sta'tl:Lu;a operators’ finanical intarsst to get the safety certificate amended as
n as possitl.c* al ter work has been cc-rjp.letod, and they should accordingly ensure that
  local authority is keyt in£o:auod of progress. For its port the local authority
i      doubt 'vis'll to co-cpsr-itft by orron/png u.attera so that, following completion
tl,& vork, tin certificate can bo amended without delay.
                                                 <3

 o.   After a certificate has been granted, an application ir.uy be mad® for the transfer
 of tho certificate to another person. Similarly, while u local authority is considering
    application for a certificate'and before the certificate haa boon granted, it may bo
 asked to substitute sane person other than the original applicant a a the person to whou
 the certificate (should be granted. These arc, however, l&sely to bo rare occurrences
 in tho cs.ati of general' safety certificates, >/riero an application will normally bo ncu.o
 on behalf of a club or a stadium organisation by an authorised official of the club
 or representative of the organisation. However, if it does happen, tho local authority
 will be required in both co.cos to determine whether the substituted nominee is a
 qualified parson. Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in tho
 regulations relating to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will
 apply together with any necessary appeals procedure. In tho second case, there is no
 reason why tha local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a
 new application in the terms of the original one and process it from the point it had
 already readied.

  10. In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety certificate
 against tha determination that he is not a qualified parson (see paragraph 2 above),
   #hich, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed transfer of a certificate, the
 'Act provides a further right of appeal to any "interested party" (which term includes
  Jfe holder of the safety certificate) against tho inclusion of anything in or the
  oaassion of anything from a safety certificate or against a refusal to amend or rcplacc
  a safety certificate. The regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety
  certificate, notice of any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following, receipt
  of a notice of the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not
  notified, the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper
  circulating in the locality.

   11. In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or amending
   a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain specified
   •'interested pavtice" and elso to advertise their action in the press. It is regretted
   that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of advertising, but, since
   Section 5 (5 ) of tho Act is not specific in the definition which it provides of
   "interested party” , no other means could be found of ensuring that all persons who might,
   validly claiu to"be "interested parties" within the meaning of the Act should be able
   to acquaint themselves with the local authority's decision, and failure to bring tho
   decision to their notice eould result in a denial of their rights of appeal or of a
   hearing by the Secretary of State. For the same reason a similar obligation has been
     posed on an appellant (by Regulation 8 (?)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and
" 9 person wishing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under
   section 5(*0 of’the Act is required to give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.

  12* Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to'give the 3.ocal authority notice
  of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the appeal. It will
  then be for the local authority, in accordance with Regulation 8 (9 ), to inform the
  Secretary of State in writing within 23 days whether it wishes to oppose the appeal.
  With ai«y such notice, the local authority is required to submit its reasons and any
  relevant supporting documents and to state whether it wishes a hearing under sect:.on
  of the Act. (The procedure governing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in
  Regulation 10*)

  13   It is also open to the Secretary of State, if ho considers it necessary, to order
  a public’inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal. In such a
  case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in Regulation 1c.%

THE GUIDE TO SAIETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

AMEMDKENT5 TO HIE GUIDE

The Cuide to Safet;/ at Sports Grounds waG published in 1973 and is based on the

technical Appendix to Lord Wheatley*s Report of the Inquiry into Ground Safety

at Sports Grounds.      Since its publication, its use on a voluntary basis has

brought to notice the need for some amendments to be made to the guidelines

when applied to football grounds.


2.   During consideration of the Safety of Sports Grounds Bill, Ministers mentioned

that if the provisions of the Act were applied to sports grounds other than

football grounds, separate guides would be compiled for the different classes of

sports grounds.      The existing Guide will accordingly be revised and re-printed

as the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football). " The amendments which will

be made for this purpose are, in the meantime, attached as an appendix to this

note.


3.   These amendments include a new chapter covering the recommendations of thn

Minister for Sport’s Working Party on Croud Behaviour which was established in

1974 to look into means of combating hooliganism at football grounds.      Matters

of crowd control inevitably have a bearing on safety at sports grounds and it

has accordingly been thought right to incorporate the Working Party’s

recommendations for the general convenience of clubs and other stadium authorities.


4.   The main amendments in the attached list are as follows:

     a.   Exits from each area of spectator'accommodation should enable the

          spectators to leave that area in 8 minutes or less.

     b.   Every spectator on the terrace should be within 12 metres of a

          gangway or exit.

     c.   Railings and fences dividing sections of the ground, should be of

          the same strength as handrails.

     d.   Depending pn the condition of the individual stand, the time

          specified for the evacuation may lie between the prescribed

          maximum and minimum.
                                                n


      e.    A recommended distance from terrace to touchline is now given

            only for a terrace gradient of 30° or more.

      f.    The recommended flowrate from all sections of the ground has

            been increased to 60 persons per minute per unit of exit

            width except in the case of stands (where it remains at /|0 ).

       g.   Recommended strengths are given for handrails in various

            situations.

      h.    Recommendations of the Working Party on Crowd Behaviour.


5.     It is again emphasised that the recommendations made in the Guide to Safety

at Sports Grounds are essentially'guidelines and should be applied to existing*

football grounds with the necessary degree of flexibility to take account of the'

particular circumstances at individual grounds.        The aim of securing a*

reasonable degree of safety should be kept uppermost in mind ; ! it would be;,

unreasonable^ even if it .were practicable, to seek the absolute safety of-

     ei’yoi o intending a ground. /

Recommendations of the World.a? Party on Crov.’d Pehavlour

Crowd movement on tcrraces should “be severely limited in
order to give the Police the fullest opportunity for crowd
control. Less problems occur where the terraces are
divided as far as possible into sections by the use of'
railings or barriers, both radial and lateral. Ideally,
each section should be self-contained and should be
serviced by its own entrance/exits, refreshment facilities
and toilets, (see para. 7 * 7 * )

"Home" and visiting supporters should be segregated. It
should not bo possible for spectators to transfer from one
end of the ground to the other.

Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as
possible in normal circumstances while,' at the same time,
providing the Police with proper access to the terraces for
the purposes of crowd control cuid enabling the pitch to be
used in the event of serious emergency. One alternative
to fencing is the construction around the pitch of a wall
v/ith a smooth surface which should be not less than 4 feet
in height on the terrace side. This boundary wall should
have gates or access points to the pitch which could be
manned by the Police or stewards. A wallcway between the
boundary wall and the terraces, which would be solely
occupied by Police, First Aid and official club personnel,
lias been found to be effective as regards safety and
security. In order to achieve this, it might be necessary
to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect the
walkway from the terrace by c. continuous lino of barriers,
bo designed as to discourage access to the walkway except
at authorised points. The access points from terrace to
walkway should be reasonably near the access points from
walkway to the pitch, (see pai*a. 7• 10) • Where a walkway
system is in use, sliding gates may be installed at the
access points from the walkway to the pitch, ie where there
can be no crowd pressure against them, (see pur a 6 .1/1.2
regarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to
 the pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level
of the playing area.

Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be
served in plastic containers.

Home clubs should consider, in conjunction vrith the Police,
each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club* So far
as the terraces are concerned, any allocation should have
regard to the manner in which the terrace3 are divided so
that policing arrangements can be effective.

 The home club should, as a general rule, make it their
 policy not to issue tickets for announced all-ticket matches
 to away supporters on the day of the game. However, the
 local Police will be byst able to assess the situation and
’their advice should be followed, but it is ir-iportnnt where-
 ever possible to discourage ’supporters from travelling to
 all-ticket matches without tickets.

predetermined arrangements for South Yorkshire County Fire Service
participation in the overall activities of the County Council in the
event of a declared Major Disaster in Peace Time.

probable number of services which will "be involved, and the tine v&ich ...

assessment ,-e.g.- an air crash on an airport .involving fifty injured, J.-;
who with relative lease can be removed to hospital, is -not necessarily a .
Major Accident , :whereas a collision involving two trains with fifty
people buried under wreckage could be termed.a Major Accident ^because of

South Yorkshire covers 35 miles from East to West .and 20 miles from •
North’to South; in comparison with most other parts of.the country
large areas of the County are heavily industrialised. Itrip .Pr^S&r'- j
crossed with motorways, airways, and main railway lines? historically- 1
and more significantly South Yorkshire has suffered:extensive'damage,
by flood and gale.

(e)   Aircraft crash

(f)   Railway accident


SECTION 4   CODEWORD FOR ACTIVATION PROCEDURE

The codeword "Catastrophe" will "be used "by Police, Fire, Health and Local
Authorities as a preface to all initial alert and call out messages*


SECTION 5   ACTIVATION PROCEDURE

When a major disaster occurs it is .probable the Police will:receive the
first notification, and consequently act in accordance with their "Major
Disaster" Scheme* ' This scheme is designed to instantly alert all
essential services, i.e. Fire, Ambulance, Medical Authorities, Railway,
Aerodrome authorities etc*

The Police have a'responsibility on site to .control and to co-^ordinate -
suspects relating to the disaster so as to enable Emergency Services and
other "bodies' to discharge their responsibilities. '              r

The extent to which eaich of these services is involved will depend upon
the nature of the disaster "but, whatever form the incident may take and
notwithstanding the size of the task facing each of these ^services the. .
Senior" Police Officer on site will be responsible for the control and
co-ordination of action at the scene so as to enable the Bnfcrgency ;
Services and other bodies to discharge their responsibilities.
Exceptionally and whenever a large scale fire is considered to be a
major disaster,* then the Senior Fire Officer bn site will be in control
of all activity to extinguish the fire; in 4hese circumstances the
Senior R>lice Officer on site will remain responsible for the control
and co-ordination of all other related activity on site.


SECTION 6 -COUNTY/DISTRICT CO-ORDINATION

Whenever a major disaster occurs In South. Yorkshire a "co-ordinating cell"
will be set up in the Bnergency Planning Section at County Hall and
manned full time irrespective of the number of local government authorities
actively involved. This cell will be manned as quickly as possible after
the Police have notified the County Chief Executive of the disaster through
the County Emergency Planning Officer and will commence to operate if and
when the effects of the disaster escalate beyond the resources available
to the District Council-in which it has occurred. :This cell will be the
channel of communications for all reports and all.enquiries of.the County
pertinent'to the disaster.
                                                        **           •


SECTION 7   PROCEDURE FOR DESIGNATING "OPERATION CATASTROPHE"

Where Police and/or Ambulance Services are already in attendance at an
incident the Senior Fire Service Officer present shall not unilaterally
designate the incident a "catastrophe".

 Consultation shall take place between all\three services.and in such
 situations the incident will be interpreted as a "catastrophe" by agreement
 of the Police and Ambulance Services.
    It is important to note that an incident deoandingm&jor mobilising of :>}
    Pire Service resources would not necessarily be designated a "catastrophe*
    unlese a similar scale of involvemerrt is required froa the' ottfer two
    services.

     (b)    if tne Cade of Practice -.vere to be applied literally, then there would
             probtibly be minor oiscrepsmcies such as in the width of the steps on the

 Safety of Sports Grounds let 1975

Following the .joint meeting at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ground on
Wednesday, 13th December, 1973, it was agreed that Dr. Eastwood would prepare
ana submit a comprehensive survey report on matters relating to the above Act.

 You may consider it advisable that, before receipt of that report, members of my
 staff make a joint survey of the premises under consideration with representatives
 of the Fire Service and, possibly, the Police. If you agree with this suggestion
 I suggest that you make the necessary arrangements with the Fire Service and Police
 and advise me of such arrangements.

 Yours faithful^, ^ _______________

Chiaf Fire Officer



Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975                                     2.1.75




I thank you for your lattar dated 22nd December, 1978, and the cooy
letter of the Building Surveyor of the Sheffield Metropolitan
District Council.

It would seem essential that the officers.of the County Council and
Metropolitan District Council involved in the production of the
general safety certificate raauirad by the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club under the above Act, undertake a comprehensive survey
of the around. I fael sure that it would ba beneficial to the Club
if, initially, each department acted in uni3on in this respect
rather than separately and I would make the necessary arrangements
with my_officers for this to be achieved.   ____ ^                 ^

.C copy of the report of each department'should be provided to aach
involved department to enable problems to bs discussed so that an
accepted approach might be determined and consolidated into a single
report which should be forwarded to the Club.

This resort, together with that of Dr. Eastwood, would form the
basis of a further meeting with officials of the Club as differences
of opinion, if any, .would have been identified.

It is my opinion that the necessary comprehensive survey could not
be undertaken satisfactorily without plan drawings. In this rsspect
I refer to paragraph 1.3 of the 1green code*;

"The problem of crowd safety at football grounds is complex and
cannot be solved simply by ensuring that each component of a ground,
such as stairs, passages or sections of terracing, is satisfactory
in itself. The inter-relation cf components is essential: they
should be compatible and ccmbina tc form a balanced unit".

Following the receipt c f drawings I suggast that Officers msec to
acres on identification procedures. In order that each decartment
is able to identify parts of the ground in a uniform manner, I
uculd prefer to have 3tands and terraces clsarly identified, exit
routes, passages, gangways, gateways, doors, etc., numbered in a
consecutive mannsr-and stairways lettered.
                     t
Officers of the County Council and Hetropolitan District Council
have visited the ground and I believe th.-it farther visits should
be part of the‘comprehensive survey. Findings from visits other


                         !                          Cont'd. ...
than the survey referred to will be limited and if we involve
ourselves in consultation with the Club following the submission
of Dr. Eastwood’s report with limited information this could
prove unfortunate in the long term.

As previously mentioned 1 prefer to await the provision of the
plan drawings which have alraady been requested and if any
action can be taken to expedite thi3 matter it would be
appreciated.

 Dear Sirs,
                 Certificate of Safety - Interim Report
        We have now progressed sufficiently far with our
 survey and assessment to be able to submit an interim report
 covering the probable ground capacity and the likely costs of
 improvements which will be required by the certifying authority.
        The green guide has been used as a basis for our cal­
 culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
 will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
 guide.   Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of
 the fire officer and the police.

  Standing Accommodation
  (a)           Spion Kop
                       The general layout of Spion Kop is good.    It
                has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
                well below the maximum laid down in the guide.    The
                slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements for
                good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                       The only questions therefore are the adequacy
                of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
                 permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of


                                                  R agistsrtd in England - No. 1134631
                                                                       t!\

              the exits.
                     Where the barriers are adequate in strength
              and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                          2
              of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m of plan
              area.   Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                          2
              Kop is approximately 3120m which would provide
^            accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                     Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
              standards.    Category A must be able to withstand a
              test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
              and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
              In 1973 you had tests made on all the barriers by
              Toft and Brocklebank Ltd.     Of the 101 barriers on
              Spion Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb
              and a further 15 carried the load but had some actual
              or incipient defect which needed attention.     Most of
              those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
              would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
              On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of
^            a long barrier which was weak.      The general situation was
              satisfactory compared with most grounds.
                     Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
              barriers up to a uniform category A standard.     It
              should be kept in mind that It is now five years since
              the tests and there will have been some deterioration
              due to rusting.    Uost of the barriers are made from
              2$" diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
              inches when new.    Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield*a
             atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers axe subject
              to more rusting than others and we must expect some
              increase in the number needing attention.
                    'Pr&vldexT a ba-rrier can withstand 6kN/m,the
             maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
              guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5° to 2.9m
EASTWOOD Cr PARTNERS




          for slopes of 30°.    These figures apply to 'peak
          viewing' areas.    Spion Kop has an average slope
          of about 17° for which the recommended spacing is
          3. 6m.
                 In calculating spectator capacity each barrier
          is assumed to cater for an area of ground immediately
          behind it which is either 3.6m wide or up to the
          next barrier, whichever is the smaller.   We have
          surveyed the Kop, and our drawing 1610/1 attached
          shows the proportion of the Kop which will be
          admissible in the spectator calculation if all the
          barriers are brought up to category A standard.    It
          will be immediately apparent that the great majority
          of the available area will qualify.   Our calculation
          shows that the permitted number of spectators should
          be about 13,900 i.e. the number ofplaces 'lost' will
          be almost 3,000.
                  If you wish to retain moetrof. these extra places
          (aiming for a ground capacity of at least 50,000
          say) then new barriers could be constructed at positions
          shown by the red lines on the second copy of drawing
          1610/1.    The capacity would then be 16t000.
                  In proposing the extra barriers we are mindful
          that in some cases they will possibly hinder the
          close packing of spectators.    Clearly, there is no
          point in spending money in order to achieve a large
          permitted.ground capacity, if that'numberrcannot
          then be packed in.   However, we think that even with
          an uneven distribution of spectators it will still be
          possible to accommodate 16,000 spectators.
                 You may wish to consider whether the cost of
          these extra barriers will be justified by the additional
          income they might generate over the years.   It is
                                                                  SHEET


EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




          likely that new barriers, which will require fairly
          massive foundation and anchor blocks will cost between
          £50 and £60 per metre run.    Thus the extra 235 metres
          of barrier will cost about £5.00 per extra standing
          place.
                 Spion Kop is not ideally catered for by exits.
          A very adequate gangway system feeds to only three
          exit points.   The total width of these three exits
          at their narrowest points is 12.5m. The guide assumes
          a maximum flow rate through these exits of 60 persons
          per minute for each 550mm of width.    Thus the
          theoretical time to discharge 16,000 spectators from
          Spion Kop would be Ilf minutes, compared with a maximum
          of 8 minutes indicated by the guide.
                 The exits at each end of the terrace are reasonably
          free from hazards, except the one at the North end passes
          under a bridge with a headroom well below the recommended
          value of 8ft.   This defect could be removed by lowering
          the floor level, but I would argue strongly that it is
          far from essential to have such a large headroom, and
          the cost of modification is not justified in an existing
          structure.
                 The exit at the back of Spion Kop is likely to
          raise most difficulty.   The ramp is steep and it has
          an appreciable cross-fall at the top where there is also
          a change of direction.     At one'side is a vertical drop,
          which has guard rails which appear to be reasonably
          strong, but this* can orary be established by testing.
          We shall need some indulgence by the licensing authority,
          if no works are to be requested.     My feeling is that
          continuous handrails will be required, splitting the
          ramp into say tfcjfee separate lanes.
                 There may be considerable pressure to increase
                                                              SHicr   5.

EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




         the total exit capacity.    We can argue that the
         eight minutes allowed for complete evacuation is only
         really valid for stands where there might be a risk
         due to fire, or explosion^. or structural failure.   In
         the case of terracing it is only the impatience of
         spectators which might create danger.    For an interim
         period, at least, this should be acceptable.
                Any changes or additions to the exit arrangements
         should take account of a possible future decision to roof
         over Spion Kop.    It would be possible to incorporate in
         such a scheme a 'squaring o f f at the top which could
         increase the area available for spectators.    However,
         this would probably mean that additional entrances would
         be needed, possibly by tunnelling through the bank at
         lower level.    This would certainly make it easier to
         pack the crowd more uniformly.. However, this is a
         matter for the future and is unlikely to be part of the
         present exercise.
  (b)    The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
                The west terrace is not quite so well endowed with
         barriers as Spion Kop.   The present layout is shown on the
         attached drawing 1610/2.   Our measurements show a total
                      2
         area of 1480m but there are no gangways. We feel that
         some allowance should be made for circulation space as
         spectators have to move quite considerable horizontal
         distances to achieve good packing.   The full area would
         justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would ;
         probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
         of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.   The
         barriers should be designed to match this figure approximately.
                The shaded area on drawing 1610/2 is that which
         may be counted if the existing barriers are of class A.
         About 15 of the existing barriers are likely to need
                                         4^
                                                                       SMifT

 EASTWOOD f t PARTNERS




                 strengthening to achieve this .standard.   Even with
                 this strengthening onl? 4,300 spectators could be
                 accommodated, representing -a loss of nearly half -
                 We presume this would be unacceptable.
                         The extra barriers required to achieve
                 approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
                 second copy of drawing 1610/2.    You may feel that
                 some of the proposed new barriers which are close
                  to the entrances might restrict the passage of
                 spectators undesirably.    In that case they could
                 be omitted.
                         The three exits have a total width of about
                 11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
                  to leave the ground.   Thus the stand could empty
            *     in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
\s>
4                        The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
      or
      ;i          should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.    There are
                  no gangways and some spectators will be 2So from an
                  exit.   But we feel this is of no consequence as
                 movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
                 and quick.
           (c)   The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                         This area is also illustrated in the drawing
                 1610/2.    The gross area available (there are no gangways)
                                2
                 is about 565 m .    Thus if the crush barriers were
                 adequate and the whole area is included the number of      -
                 spectators could be about 3,050.
                        Unfortunately, the crush barriers in this area
                 were shown to be very inadequate when tested in 1973.
                 Only one was tested and the rail and posts were bending
                 at a load of only 270 lb/ft.   Because of this result
                 none of the others was subjected to a test lead.   We

             have examined the drawings of these barriers and
             in addition to the weakness of the rails and posts,
             the holding down arrangements appear to be very
             inadequate and might be treacherous.   A sudden
             failure of a bolt, and they are very highly stressed,
             could lead to a collapse without warning.   These
             barriers need major strengthening as a matter of
             urgency.
                    Assuming that the barriers are strengthened
             it will be seen from the drawing 1610/2 that they
             also need considerable supplementation.   The scheme
             shown on the second copy of this drawing does not
             quite justify the whole area being taken in the
             calculations.   But it would be reasonable to count
             say 2900.   This would bring the total standing at
             the Leppings Lane end .to 10,100..
                    The exits serving this part of the terrace are
             very adequate, but there may be requests for central
             handrailings to be provided.

      Seating Accommodation
      (a) . The North Stand
                      The form of construction of this stand is such
             that it presents a minimum fire hazard.          The exits
             are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy the
             recommendations of the guide.
                      Two matters might cause concern.        The first,
             tfce fac-t- tha-t t&e exits are marginally below the ... .
             recommended minimum of 1.1m, is we think of very little
             consequence.       However, the second, the narrow gangways
             which are only about half the recommended minimum may

          are the sane in the other stands the total number of
          seats lost would be 1,041.   This is almost unthinkable
          and must be resisted strongly.
                 Fortunately, the timing of spectators leaving    _
          the ground on 6 January shoved that a peak of 80 per
          minute passed through one exit.   This is the figure
          quoted by the guide for a 1.1m gangway.   With 18 exits
          for 10,000 people the average vould be 556 per unit.
          Thus the stand vould empty in about seven minutes,
          which is vithin the recommended limit of eight minutes.
                 Our observations on 6 January shoved that everyone
          had left this stand, apart from a few people vho vere
          in no hurry,in about six minutes, although we also counted
          about 40 per exit vho left before the final vhistle.
          The overall picture appears very satisfactory and
          encourages the hope that this stand vill be accepted
          as not needing any significant modification.

   (by    The West Stand
                 This stand is very similar to the north stand
          in its construction.   We vere not able to accurately
          assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
          January because there vere many seats which vere unsold.
          Hovever, there is every reason to believe that there
          will be no difficulty in vacating this stand vithin
          eight minutes also.   There should be no need for
          significant modifications.

          has 5710 seats.    These are served by 10 exits (excluding

          those serving the directors box) so that an average
          of 570 people need to pass through each exit.   The
          count on 6 January shoved an average of just over 70
          per minute passing through one exit vhich corresponds
          to an emptying time of about eight minutes.   Indeed
          there vere very fev people still trying to get out six
          minutes after the final vhistle.   A fev had no doubt
          left early and a fev vere still standing around, but
          the stand had substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                 Having left the top of the stand the spectators
          have to make their vay from the first floor landing via
          one of three staircases.    Two of these are 3 . 6 b vide
          and the other 2.4.    This is equivalent to 17$ 'lanes'
          of 550mm.    At 40 people per lane, 700 people pass per
          minute.    To discharge 5710 people (less those in the
          directors box) vill therefore take almost exactly 8
          minutes as permitted by the guide.
                  The fire officers vere clearly very interested
          in the first floor.    There is very little 'fire load’
          on this floor - the snack bars and the office/lounge.
          But quite a small fire might fill this area vith smoke.
          We suspect that there might be a request for it to be compart
          mentalised by fire doors.
                  At ground floor level tvo of the staircases lead
          almost straight to the open air,, through a compartment
          vhich is separated from the main part of the building.
          The third staircase is not so veil separated and some
          structural vork may be needed.    Apparently the paint
          store is beside this staircase.    This may not be vise.
                  There may veil be requests from the fire officer
          for CQnsiderable extra precautions and structural....

          If all the new barriers which we    have suggested
   are installed the capacity will become

          If it is required to increase this capacity at some
   time in the future Spion Kop could be 'squared off' at the
   back using a steel framed structure and perhaps a further
   4000 places could be provided.   The Kop could also be
   roofed over, of course.

   costs but the following will give an indication of what may

           This total should not at this stage be taken as
    more than a broad guess. Ve may have pleasant surprises
    but there could be shocks.   The total does not contain
    any allowance for the local authority's charges in
    connection with the issuing of the licence or for our
    professional fees.

    Future Action
           Subject to your approval we suggest that the next
    steps might be as follows :-
    1.     We should pass copies of all drawings to the police,
            the fire brigade, the d ty Building Surveyor and the
            County Council.   In addition to drawings showing
            the results of our surveys of the Kop, the Leppings
            Lane terrace and the south stand, we are preparing
            suitable drawings of the north and west stands,
            measuring from the photo-copies of Husbands drawings.
    2.     We should make firm proposals to the police and the
            fire brigade for the new crush barriers, together
            with our computation of the number of spectators, and
            invite comments including any suggestions of further
            measures which may be needed.
    3.     At the same time we should make detailed drawings and
            specifications for the strengthening work on the
            barriers which are known to be weak, andfor the con­
            struction of the new barriers, and obtain tenders.
    4."    We’•'SHbtilrd request-a meeting with the police and -the— —
           flre-brigade^-to -d-iscuss the stands and to try to agree.
           what may need to be done to bring them up to standard.
    5.     We should discuss in detail with the police their
            requirements for a police office, and prepare a detailed
            design.
                                                                 SHEET

     6.     We should discuss with the police and fire officer
            what other services such as alarms, communications
            etc. are needed, prepare an agreed scheme and
            obtain tenders. _

     A Meeting with The Club
            You may feel that another meeting to discuss this
     report and the suggestions for further action, should be
     held shortly.   Dr. Eastwood will be out of the country
     for three weeks from 22 January so that the week beginning
     15 January would be appropriate.

                                                   REPORT ON GROUND CAPACITY

               This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
        which is attainable.
               It deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening
        and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
        calculations are made of the theoretical exit tines.
               Calculations of exit tines are also made for each of
        the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
        made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
               The green guide has been used as a basis for our cal­
        culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
        will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
        guide.   Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
        fire officer and the police.

    Standing Accommodation
    (*)    Spion Kop
                  The general layout of Spion Kop is good.      it
           has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
           well below the maximum laid down in the guide.      The
           slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
           for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                  The only questions therefore are the adequacy
           of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
           permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
           the exits.
                  Where the barriers are adequate in strength
           and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                       o
           of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m of plan
           area.   Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                      2
           Kop is approximately 3120m which would provide
           accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                  Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
           standards.   Category A must be able to withstand a
           test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
           and Category B must withstand 4.3 kK/metre (290 lb/foot)
           In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
           and Brocklebank Ltd.    Of the 101 barriers on Spion
           Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
           a further IS carried the load but had some actual or
           incipient defect which needed attention.     Most of
           those which failed the test, failed so badly tha<£ they
           would-probably-not .satisfy, category B standard eJLther.. .
           On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
           long barrier which was weak. It should be emphasised
           that"the general'situation was satisfactory compared —
           with most grounds.
                  Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                              SMICT 3.

                   barriers up to a uniform category A standard.     It
                   should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
                   the tests and there may have been some deterioration
                   due to rusting.    Host of the barriers are made from
    ^              21’' diameter tube vhich only has a thickness of 0.192
                   inches vhen nev.    Rusting is nov very slov in Sheffield’s
                   atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
                   to more rusting than others and it is possible that
                   there vill be an increase in the number needing attention.
                           Provided a barrier can vithstand 6fcN/m, the
                   maximum distance betveen barriers recommended in the
                   guide varies betveen 5m for slopes of only 5° to 2.9m
                   for slopes of 30°.    These figures apply to ’peak viewing’
                   areas.    Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17°
                   for vhich the recommended spacing is 3.6m.     The elope of the

                   3. lm.
4)                        Whilst ve believe it is arguable that parts of
                   Spion Kop could be considered as not being ’peak
                   vieving areas' ve are prepared to accede to the police
                   viev and use peak vieving area standards for all barriers.
                   This also applies to the stands at the vest end of the
                    ground.
                                 We propose that the existing barriers should be
                    supplemented by nev ones as shovn in red on the attached
                    drawing 1610/1X.          The green shaded area behind each
                    barrier shows the area vhich can then be assumed to be
                  • available for spectators.          This area is 2958m which
                    at 54 persons/10m2 gives a capacity of 15,973.          It
—        ~          s h o u l d -be kept- in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators


                   have been admitted to the Kop in the past.
                                                                inter    4.

                  Spion Kop has three exits, one near each
            end and one at the top.     The total width of
            these three exits at their narrowest points is 12.5m.
            The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
            exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
            width.    Thus the theoretical time to discharge
            16,000 spectators from Spion Kop would be Ilf minutes,
            compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by the
            guide.    We do not consider this to be a serious
            matter.    Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) is very
            desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
            fire, or explosion, or structural failure.    In the
            case of terracing it is only the impatience of spectators
            which might create danger. We believe that for an
            interim period at least the evacuation time of 11$
            minutes should be acceptable.
                    The exits at each end of the terrace are
            reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North
            end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
            recommended value of 8ft.    This defect could be
            removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
            it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
            and the cost of modification is not justified in an
            existing structure.
                    The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
          - from handrails dividing it into lanes.    Some remodelling
            of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
            desirable.
    (b)    The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
             '    tfie we&t 'tferrac« has a total area of 1430m. but
           there are no gangways.      We feel that some allowance should

                                                             SH U T   5.


EASTWOOD rPARTNERS




           be made for circulation space as spectators have
           to move quite considerable horizontal distances
           to achieve good packing.   The full area vould
           justify about 8000 spectators, but ve suggest it vould
           probably be appropriate to allov 10% as the equivalent
           of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
           The barriers should be designed to match this figure
           approximately.   Those barriers vhich cannot vithstand
           6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened, and extra
           ones provided where necessary.
                  The extra barriers required to achieve
           approximately 7200 capacity are shovn in red on the
           attached copy of draving 1610/2X.
                  The three exits have a total vidth of about
           11.5o vhich vould permit about 1250 people per minute
           to leave the ground. Thus the terrace could be
           emptied in about six minutes vhich is very satisfactory.
                  The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
           should be vithin 12m of a gangway or exit. There are
           no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
           exit.   But we feel this is of no consequence as
           movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
           and quick.
     (c)   The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                  This area is also illustrated in the drawing
           1610/2X.   The gross area available (there are no
           gangways) is abfcut 565'm2 . Thus if the crush barriers
           were adequate and the whole area is included the number
           of spectators could be about 3,050.
                  Provided the existing crush barriers are
           brought up to standard and supplemented in red as
                                                                S H IfT g

             shown on our drawing 1610/2X, the area which can
             be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
                                                      o
             shown in green.   This area is about 535m corresponding
           — to about 2900 spectators.   This would bring the total
             standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                    The exits serving this part of the terraces
             are very adequate in width and there will be no
             difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.

      Seating Accommodation
      (a)    The North Stand
                    The form of construction of this stand is
             such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.   The
             exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
             the recommendations of the guide.
                    The exits are very marginally below the
             recommended l*lm width, but we do not consider this
             to be of great consequence.
                    Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
             length (they widen round the exit).   This is well
             below the green guide recommendation.   However, it
             is clearly appropriate to take into account the
             general nature of the stand, the number as well as
             the width of the gangways, and above all the ease and
             speed with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                    On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
             leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
             The figures were 71, 72, 80 and 73.   Thereafter
             the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
             This established that in an emergency the green guide
             figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l*lm gangway)
             can be achieved.   With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators
                                                                SH6CT   7.


EASTWOOO f t PARTNERS




            the average is 556 per exit. Thus the stand vould
            empty in about seven minutes, vhich is vithin the
            recommended limit of eight minutes.
                   Our observations in company vith the fire
            officer^ staff on 6 January shoved that everyone
            had left this stand, apart from some people vho vere
            in no hurry, in about six minutes, although ve also
            counted about 40 per exit vho left before the final
            whistle.   The overall picture appears very satisfactory
            and ve suggest that this stand should be accepted
            as not needing any significant modification.

    (b)     The West Stand
                   This stand is very similar to the north stand
            in its construction.   We vere not able to accurately
            assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
            January because there vere many seats vhich vere unsold.
            Hovever, there is every reason to believe that there
            vill be no difficulty in vacating this stand vithin
            eight minutes also.   There should be no need for
            significant modifications.

    (c)     The South Stand
                   The structure has been surveyed and appended
            are prints of our dravings 1610/3, 4 and 5, vhich
            shov the plans and cross-section.   Also attached is
            a seating plan, draving No. 1610/6.
                   The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
            has 5710 seats.   These are served by 12 exits (excluding
            those serving the directors box) so that an average
            of 476 people need to pass through each exit.   The
            count by the fire officer’s staff on 6 January shoved
            an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
            exit vhich corresponds to an emptying time of about
            seven minutes. Indeed there vere very fev people


                                                                             i /
                                                                 SHEET   8.

           still trying to get out six minutes after the final
           vhistle.   A fev had no doubt left early and a fev
           vere still standing around, but the stand had
           substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                  Having left the top of the stand the spectators
           have to make their vay from the first floor landing
           via one of three staircases.    Two of these are 3.6m
           vide and the other 2.4.    This is equivalent to 17$
           'lanes' of 550mm.    At 40 people per lane, 700 people
           pass per minute.    To discharge 5710 people (less
           those in the directors box) vill therefore take almost
           exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                  At ground floor level tvo of the staircases lead
           almost straight to the open air, through a compartment
           vhich is separated from the main part of the building.
           The third staircase passes through a vide lobby vhich
           will probably need three sets of self closing fire
           doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
           The club intends to move the paint store from the
           space behind this staircase.
                  The front, open-air part of the south stand is
           veil endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
           one passage.    This passage has a theoretical capacity
           of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
           This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.    Because
           the stand is open to the air and there is very
           ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather,
           long emptying time is of any great consequence.      _

    General Requirements

       will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
       further visit.   We would like to be present when any
       further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
       being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood's absence
       which will extend to 15 February.
              If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
       post they would like, this can be considered by the club
       and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
              A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
       might be held around say 16 February.
              In the meantime Eastwood & Partners will be checking
       the various electrical services so that we shall be in a
       position to discuss these at the meeting.

       Future Ground Capacity
              Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
       out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
       ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows
              Seating approximately              24.000
              Standing on Spion Kop              16.000
              Standing at Leppings Lane end
              (total including N.W. corner)      10,100

                                                 50,100

              It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
       has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
       be admitted to the ground. ' ffeis* involved of the-order. of
       19.000 - 20,000 spectators being,on Spion Kop. . Indeed, it .
       is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
       70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
       Kop probably approached 30,000.-                                  — ...
              It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
       excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1976                                          26.3.79


I refer to my minute of 5th March, 1979, and to the reoent telephone
conversations between Mr. O. Vaughan of my staff and Divisional Officer
K. Jones of your Fire Prevention Secfon.

Following the return from holiday of the Chairman of the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club Ltd., the Club Secretary Informed me that the 30th March,
1979 was not convenient. That meeting has, therefore, now been arranged
for 2.30 p.m. on Monday, 2nd April, 1979, after conferring with the members
of the Working Party.
However, because of evident differences of opinion on means of escape,
the original time and date of 10.00 a.m . on 30th March, 1979 (but at
your Headquarters) Is being retained to discuss these differences, prior
to meeting the Club.

It is noted that there are no handrails to the stairs from the stand, but in
view of restricted width and length it is not proposed to require these.

North-West Terrace

1.   Replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear is required.

2.   The removal of under—strength barriers and their replacement by new ones
      constructed to guide recommendations.

Spion K o p

1.   The arrangement for crush barriers as produced by the consultant, whilst
      not complying fully with the guide recommendations, is considered adequate
      if the other requirements are fulfilled. These other requirements include
      the 2 No. radial barriers indicated on Plan 1XA and the provision of an -
      additional 3 m wide egress route to South-East area, and of gated openings
      to give access from the radial gangways to the ground perimeter area.

2.   Make good all broken and spalled concrete terracing.

3.   Increase headroom to North-East egress route to a minimum of 2.1 m.

4.   Check and carry out any necessary work to ensure safety of score-board
     building.

5.   Replace corroded perimeter rails by construction complying with code
      recommendations.

6.   Improve egress conditions at rear by provision of balustrades, rails, etc.
      as indicated on the plan.

General

1.   All crush barriers, balustrade walls, fences and railings to be tested and
      replaced, or strengthened, where necessary.

2.   Provision of handrails and suitable headroom to egress routes to be re­
      assessed after re-routing of gangways etc. has been carried out.

3.    Fire resistance and restriction of flame spread to be improved to all areas
      as discussed; the consultant is to confirm the work proposed to be carried
      out. Arrangements to be made for the clearance of all combustible material
      from under stand areas.

With regard, to future meetings I think it is essential that all matters agreed
be recorded, as we are now approaching finality in many areas and it is necessary
that we have recorded exactly the agreed matters.

I-would also suggest that in view of the approach of certification it would,
perhaps, be advisable to hold future meetings away from the ground, and that
Mr. Vaughan, as the co-ordinator, should chair such meetings.

Yours faithfully,
                    /)

             Dear Sir

             I refer to your letter, reference number DV/AW/5 8 3 , dated 20 April 1979,
             concerning the above matter.

             The requirements I wish to see imposed are asfollows

             1.        The existing crush barriers at the ground be tested on aload of
                       **00 lb./ft., the maximum required by the guide to the Act. (This is
                       to be done immediately and, thereafter, 20 per cent of the crush
                       barriers, chosen at random, to be tested each year, ensuring that
                       each crush barrier is tested at least once every five years)

             2.        Vertical      barriers be placed on the                                                            Spion Kop to prevent                 lateral
                       movement of the crowd.

             3.        Gateways      in the existing perimeter                                                            fencing be realigned                 with the
                       gangways of the Spion Kop.

             k.         The police have the facility to override the public addresssystem.

             5.         A suitable police room be provided.

             Representatives of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have accepted
             these proposals without demur and, with the exception of item 5i will be
             carried out during the close season of 1979. The police room will be
             provided during 1 9 8 0 .

             At the request of your Mr. D. J. Shirtcliffe, I sun enclosing a copy of
             a sketch of the proposed police room.

                                                    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

                                   Since you spoke to me yesterday by telephone, the St. John's
                              Superintendent rang and I have today had a very long discussion
                              with him about the requirements at the Hillsborough Football
                              Ground. I have put my observations into a separate report which
                              I attach for your perusal* Perhaps you would contact me if you
                              require anyducidation of the points and I would esteem it a
                              favour not to get involved in any long meetings with the Glub
                              Officials as there are so many demands on my time that I cannot
                              afford to be away from the office for any length of time.


                                                                     Yours sincerely,




                                                                   H.            BAIIXY.^

                                                                                                          f DOCUMENT No. i5 j.

STRUCTURE

The existing facilities are much below an acceptable standard and I
would suggest the Club consider providing a more permanent structure
which is not likely to require up grading for a very long time. The
internal finish particularly of the Treatment area should be of an
impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered
fairly sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by
the use of tiles or formica type finish etc....

WAITING AREA

The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

TREATMENT AREA

The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
patients at any one time and consideration should be given to the
needs for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that
the three patients may well be lying on couches.

LIGHTING

Good lighting is essential ard at the present time strip lighting
is very much in vogue and would be satisfactory. The provision of
a power point would also appear to be a basic requirement.

WATER

A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
for drinking1. It would also appear reasonable to request provision
of a hand basin and a large Belfast type sink. The Club should
consider whether it would be cheaper in the long run to provide
stainless steel basins which are not subject to chipping.

TOIIET REQUIREMENTS

The Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
the use of the public and should consider whether they should provide
an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

STORAGE

Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and   for two sets
of wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen.   This storage
should be lockable.

EQUIPMENT

The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service.

Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accommodation is
cubicledo

Six Stretchers.
Two sets of stretcher wheels.

20 Blankets*

Six Pillows*

One Minute-Man Rcsuscitator.

TEtflPHDKg FACILITIES

A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979*  This can be
achieved by an extension from the main switch* or sharing with police

CAR PARKING

The Club may also consider what facilities should be extended to the
St. John’s personnel for the parking of staff cars*

AMBPIAKCES

Access for ambulances at the present time appears to be adequate but
must not be overlooked in any redesigning. It is understood that the
perimeter track is insufficient in dimension to easily run the
ambulance around the football pitch.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

I have now received the detailed comments of all of the discipline*
represented on the Working Party.

These have been collated Into the attached schedule which, together with
plans, confirm formally In writing the matters discussed by the Working
Party with the Club over the series of meetings held so far and which
the County Council feel require attention so as to secure reasonable
safety at the Ground.

They are, of course, Indlvldualxrequlrements on specific matters and are
addltlonaljto the general requirements set out in the specimen form of
General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with my letter of
8th December, 1978, and discussed at the meeting held on 13th December,
1978,
After the Clu£ has had the opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps
you would let me know which of the requlr aments you feel will be able to
be carried out In the close season.

Should you have any queries, Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (ext. 422) would
be happy to discuss thejn with you.

                                    Yours faithfully,




                                    Chief Executive

                       EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE


The following notes of guidance are prepared and issued to assist all
official stewards and others in a position of responsibility at the
Hillsborough Stadium on the action to be taken and procedures to be followed
in the event of the possibility of evacuation of the stadium during the
playing of a game when spectators are present. The notes are not intended to
be a comprehensive list of all the action necessary, but are for personal
issue to each steward and for retention by the steward for immediate ref­
erence all the time ho/she is on duty at the stadium.

It is appreciated that the reasons evacuation may become necessary are many
and varied, but the most obvious are fires or information that explosive/
incendiary devices have been placed somewhere within the stadium/ground.
That information may be received or discovered either by members of the staff
at the stadium, or by telephone to the stadium, police.- local or national
newspapers.

IT IS STRESSED THAT WHENEVER SUCH INFORMATION IS RECEIVED THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE DECISION TO EVACUATE ALL OR PART OF THE GROUND RESTS WITH THE SENIOR
MANAGEMENT OF THE CLUB.  (The senior police officer on duty will be in a
position to advise as to whether the 'bomb call' is likely to be genuine or
not).

Whenever such information becomes known, a message will be relayed to the
police officer on duty in the KP. A. Commentary Box" at the ground, who, on
instructions from the senior police officer, and irrespective of whether
the match is in progress or not, will cause the record 'g   m    g      S     to
be played over the loudspeaker system.                     Pur The . fceTTifi

The playing of that record will indicate to everyone present at the ground,
other than spectators, that a possible emergency situation exists.

N.B.   As part of the regular pre-match brief of referees and linesmen and
       both teams, this information should be passed to then so that the
       game officials are also aware of the possibility of an interruption in
       play and the significance of the playing of the record.

On hearing that record all club stewards will make their way to their des­
ignated duty points on gangways/gates/exits, etc. Those on exit gates will
open the gates and remain at that point. During this period senior
officials will consider the nature of the emergency alleged and will decide
to evacuate all/part of the stadium. Once that decision has been taken, but
not until, the senior police officer on duty will cause a spoken message to
be relayed over the :,P. A. System" which will have the effect of:-

 (1)   Stopping the game and reooving players from the field of play;

 (2)   Informing the spectators/officials of the precise nature of the
       emergency and its location if known, and requesting all or specified
       sections of the public to leave their seats and make their way out of
       the ground by the nearest normal exit route unless specifically directed
        to do otherwise by means of the :!P. A. System".
IT IS STRESSED THAT NO EVACUATION WILL TAKE PLACE EXCEPT HI EXTREME
EMERGENCY 2ND ALTHOUGH THE PREPARATORY EARNING RECORD 'THREE BLIND MICE’
MAY BE PLAYED, THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT INITIAL ENQUIRIES WILL
ESTABLISH THE PERPETRATION OP A HOAX, ETC., AND IN THAT CASE, INSTEAD OF
A SPOKEN MESSAGE TO EVACUATE.- THE FACT THAT THE EMERGENCY HAS   PASSED
WILL BE INDICATED BY THE PLAYING OF THE RECORD - *USgPE. 'G3P& &  ,   jSttC A
ON HEARING THIS ’ALL CLEAR' STEWARDS ON EXIT GATES AND GANGWAYS WILL
REMAIN ON STAND-BY AT THAT POINT FOR FIVE MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING THE GATES
AND RESUMING THEIR NORMAL DUTY POSITIONS.

In the event of any steward/club official discovering a fire or receiving
information that an emergency situation exists within the ground, he will
immediately -

  (i) Notify the Club Secretary by telephone;

 (ii) Inform any police officer.

(iii)   He must also, on discovering a fire, activate the fire alarm system
        by means of a 'Break Glass' call point.

The activation of the call point will not immediately sound any form of
audible alarm but will indicate by light signal in the police staffed
control point the location of the emergency. The police controller can
then deploy manpower to investigate the cause.

In the event of discovery of fire by a steward, he should take additional
action in accordance with the following points

 (A)    Sound the a l a m by breaking the nearest break glass call point;

 (B)    Tackle the fire with the appropriate extinguisher if safe    to do so?

 (C)    Close doors within the immediate vicinity of the fire;

 (D)    At no time mention the words 'Fire' or 'Bomb'.   Remember,   if you
         don't panic, neither will the crowd;

 (E)    Upon completion of the evacuation of your section, report to the
         assembly area (which has been specified by the Club) and report to
         the person in overall charge, who will, in turn, report to the Fire
         Service and any other relevant emergency service which may be in
         attendance.

ALL STEWARDS MUST FAMILIARISE THEMSELVES WITH THE LOCATION OF:-

 (a)    Fire Alarm 'Break Glass' call points;

 (b)    Location of the Fire Fighting Equipment;

 (c)    Knowledge of all escape rout** at their sector of the ground.

    Dear Mr. England,
                    Certificate of Ground Safetyy 1979
               Test on Crush Barriers/ Balustrades and Fences
          We have pleasure in presenting a formal report drawing
    together the results of all the load tests on crush barriers,
    fences etc. which were carried out between June and December
     1979.

    Crush Barriers
          The first series of tests were made on all the barriers
    existing at the time of the application for a safety certificate.
    These are shown on the attached prints of drawings Nos. 1610/61 and
    62.   The barrier numbers used in the following descriptions of
    the tests are as shown on these two drawings.

     (a)         A total of 19 barriers failed to carry the specified test
                 load of 6 kN/m length when first tested.   Seven of these
                 failures (Nos. 40, 41, 42, 57, 58, 62 and 68) were caused
                 by defective retaining clips on the horizontal rails.
                 Seven failed because the horizontal rail suffered permanent
                 deformation (Nos. 34, 87, 91, 92, 93, 97 and 98) and five
                 failed because of bending of vertical posts (Nos. 4, 18,

                                                    Rtglitarad In England —No. 1134531
                                                                        6 0

EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




         19, 37 and 38).
              During the course of the testing careful inspection
         was made of each barrier and it was found that, although
         they passed the test, a number of barriers had~minor
         defects mainly due to corrosion.   A total of 32 new clips,
         eight new rails and five new posts were fitted in addition
         to strengthening of those barriers which failed the test.
         All protruding or sharp edges were removed.
              One further barrier was modified because it was initially
         significantly lower than the minimum height recommended in the
         green Code of Practice.
              Following construction of the new additional barriers on
         Spion Kop and the completion of repairs to the old barriers
         a second series of tests was made.   All the new barriers
         and all the repaired barriers now passed the test.

   (b)   Leppings Lane
              In the first series of tests six barriers (Nos. 104,
         105, 106, 107, 110 and 123) had failures of the tube
         retaining clips.   Five barriers (Nos. 107, 114, 115, 121 and 130)
         suffered permanent deformation of the horizontal rail.
              All these barriers were repaired.    In addition 13 new
         clips and five rails which were badly corroded were replaced,
         and any protruding or sharp edges removed.
              After construction of the new barriers, they and all
         the repaired barriers were tested and all withstood the
         test load satisfactorily.            •••- ' •      ...

   (c)   North West Corner
              The initial testing of the first few barriers in this
         corner showed that all of them were only capable of taking
         about half the test load.   The rails deflected excessively
         and the holding down bolts were also inadequate.
                                                                  SHEET


EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




            Major strengthening in the form of extra posts to
       shorten the span of the rails and to share the load with
       the existing posts were installed.   A new type of holding
       down arrangement was devised.
             When re-tested all existing barriers plus all the
        new barriers successfully withstood the specified load.

^ ?he Safety Cage
        When the first series of tests were made on the crush
 barriers it was found that the safety cage along both ends of
  the ground had defective supports.   It was found that certain
 holding down bolts had not been fixed when the fence was
  installed.   There was also a need for support from the
 concrete perimeter wall in some places.    After appropriate
 remedial work the fence was successfully test loaded in 4m sections
  along both ends of the ground using the normal crush barrier
  loading of 6 kN/m length.

 Boundary Fences
        Concern had been felt for the boundary fence along the
  idge of the ramp from Spion Kop.   Any failure of this fence
 as the crowd leaves the ground could result in people being
 spilled down a steep bank.    The whole length of this fence
 from the score board down to the bottom was therefore tested
 using the lateral force specified in the green Code of 2.74 kN/m.
 The whole length carried the load satisfactorily.
        The continuation of this fence round to the north-east
'corner of the pitch, plus the two lines o f fence which protect
 the island of spectators to the west of the tunnel were also
 appropriately tested (the lengths marked in red on the attached
 print of drawing 1610/11).    All the sections successfully
 carried the test load without signs of distress.
        It was also found to be possible to test load five sections
 of the boundary fence round the top of Spion Kop as shown by the
 short red lines.    The load applied was again that appropriate to
    EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




      the lateral force on exit routes.     Again the load was
      satisfactorily resisted.

   South Stand Balustrade
         The final testing was-on the south stand balustrade.
   At the foot of every gangway a length of 2m was subjected
   to the same test load as crush barriers i.e. 6 kN/m length.
4) In every case this load was resisted without distress.
         In between the gangways, the balustrade was subjected
   to a test load of 3 kN/m length applied to the whole span
   between successive pairs of supports.   Again the load was
   everywhere satisfactorily resisted.

     Future Numbering of Crush Barriers
           Many of the barriers have been lengthened and also
     additional barriers have been installed.   It is obviously
     inappropriate to continue with the old numbering system.
     We therefore include prints of two new drawings 1610/63 and 64 which
     show a new numbering system for Spion Kop and the whole of the
^    west end of the ground.   It is proposed that these numbers
     will be used in all future reports.

                                          Yours sincerely.

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 ~
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited

    I thank you for your letter dated 15th July.

    After consultations with the Building Authority and in view of the fact
    that all of the barriers were tested prior to certification, the County
    Council is able to agree this year vith the course of action which you
    propose. However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
    upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as
    to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
    25(2) of the Safety Certificate.

    May I also mention the Certificates by:-

    (a)      a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by
             paragraph 24 of the Safety Certificate) as to all structural
             parts of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;

    (b)      an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
              26 of the Safety Certificate) as to the electrical installation
             within the Stadium; and

    (c)      an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
              12(2) of the Safety Certificate) as to the condition of the
              Emergency Power Supply.

    I take it that if the Club has not already done so( they will shortly be
    requesting you to supply these.

                                                               Yours faithfully,

                  ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED
                           BY THE CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY

               On various dates in July I made inspections and had
        approximately one-fifth of the crush barriers tested by members
        of my staff under my control.     A final inspection was made on
        28 August in company with Mr. D. Sheriff C.Eng., M.I.Struct.E.
        of the City of Sheffield Building Surveyor's Department, acting
        on behalf of the licensing authority.
               In my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
        satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium to be used
^       to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of Ground Safety.
               The crush barriers Nos. 1-39 (see our drawing No. 1610/63)
        were tested in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Guide
        to Safety at Football Grounds on 21-23 July.     Certain barriers
        suffered excessive deflection, generally on the second or third
        cycle of the test load. In some other cases retaining clips had
        to be replaced.     The barriers concerned were Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15,
         17, 18, 24, 26 and 34.    After remedial work these barriers were
         successfully re-tested on 11 August.
                I am now able to certify that all 39 barriers have a satisfactory
         strength.
                Certain items of maintenance work which it is suggested should
         be carried out at an appropriate time have been recommended to the
         club.    A list is attached.

The Chairman opened the meeting by. stating its intention of assessing the
planning, action and incidents relating to the FA Cup Semi-Final between
Tottenham Hotspur and Vfolverhampton Wanderers held at Hillsborough on
Saturday 11 April 1981.

Certain problems had occurred but in his and the Chief Constable's opinion
we had acted correctly. One letter of complaint had been received from a member
of the public as well as one letter praising the police action in a dangerous
situation. Chief Superintendent Herold mentioned that other letters
congratulating the police on their actions had also been received.

Mr Go siin said that it was his decision to remove spectators from the Leppings
Lane end of the ground to the other side in order to ease a dangerous situation
where serious injuries or even fatalities were a real possibility. He then
read the letter of complaint, which contained an allegation that the police
herded more and more people into the Leppings Lane enclosure when it was obvious
that it was full.                     c:-'
 •                            •.



The Chairman invited views on this point. Superintendent Chapman said that the
entrances to Leppings Lane were controlled to ensure an even distribution of
fans. However, as .the gorund filled up the usual packing problems occurred.
There was space in the centre of the enclosure but fans refused to move over
and fill it. Police officers were placed into the crowd to ensure iAat the
best use was made of the available space. The Mounted Department also assisted
at the- rear of the crowd to prevent more people entering that part of the
ground.

Chief Superintendent Herold pointed out that the problem was exacerbated by a
series of incidents which culminated in the late arrival of a large number of
fans. This meant that instead of arriving over a period, they all arrived
together very close to kick-off time.

At 11.25 am an accident occurred on the Ml Motorway involving 13 cars, causing
two of the three lanes to be closed cown. for one and a half hours. Just north
°f this, and at about the same time, a PSV broke down. Passengers alighted from

                                                                 Continued/
 it and caused problems on the motorway. The pontoon bridges and extensive
 roadworks on the motorway in the Derbyshire Police Area also created delays.
This 90 minute delay resulted in a sudden flood of vehicles, all of thea
•Spurs supporters, into Sheffield. Acting Chief Superintendent Thompson took
up this point and said that he accepted that the traffic route, designed to
 divide, the football supporters from the city centre shoppers, was too tortuous,
although this may not have proved a problem had there been a steady flow of
 spectators rather than the sudden influx caused by the incidents described by
Mr Herold.

The Chairman then sought the views of the meeting over the crushing incidents
when several spectators were injured and which necessitated the removal of
scse spectators from the Leppings Lane enclosure.

Mr EeroId said that the capacity for the Leppings Lane enclosure, stated in
the certificate issued under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, is 10,100.
This must, of necessity, contain a safety margin. The actual turnstile
reading;was 10,425 to which must be acced the 70 Spurs supporters who had
masaged to obtain tickets which put them amongst the Wolves supporters. These
had been moved to Leppings Lane from the Kop for their own safety. This made
a total of 405 spectators over the authorised limit. Inspector Calvert pointed
oct that this created a similar situation to last year when about 400 forged
tickets were printed for the Leppings Lane end, although the same problem was
•not experienced then.                                                ‘

Mr Eerold had already referred to the late arrival of a large number of
spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane enclosure when
the match started. The flashpoint occurred when Tottenham scored after only
three minutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was
happening and caused a crush, which resulted in the injuries.  Inspector
Greenwood also mentioned that there had been two or three fights, albeit of
a tinor nature, at the same time. This had resulted in the order from Mr Goslin
tc open the gates at the front of Leppings Lane in order to release some
spectators onto the pitch surround. This was done by opening the gates,
releasing a few spectators and then closing thea to allow a steady flow. This
was difficult to maintain because as soon as pressure was relieved at the
frcnt the crush from the back- filled the void.

The lack of a reserve serial between the South Stand and the Leppings Lane
stand (where one has normally been situated} caused a few minutes delay in
the deployment of officers to police this situation but this problem was soon
overcome. Superintendent Chapman stressed that there was still roon in the
centre of the Leppings Lane enclosure although it was quite full. This was
only to be expected when there was a capacity crowd, but the refusal of
spectators to fill spaces had caused difficulties elsewhere in the enclosure.

The discussion progressed to the construction of the Leppings Lane enclosure.
Mr Goslin felt that it was inadequate and required more divisions .so that
spectators are not in such a solid mass. He also felt that the limit of
10,100 was tocr high, although Superintendent Chapman disagreed with this.
The Chairman disagreed with Mr Kerold's suggestion of a -6 ft to 8 ft wide
channel down the centre of the enclosure to divide spectators and segregate
opposing fans on the grounds that such a small segregation gap only encouraged
opposing spectators to throw articles at each other and at police officers
in the middle. Inspector Calvert expressed concern about the central


                                                               Continued/
entrance to the Leppings Lane area because it always causes delays and
blockages-  It would benefit from reconstruction.

.The Chairman said that talks would take place with Sheffield Wednesday
 Football Club on the ground capacities and for any reconstruction thought to
be necessary.

The discussion progressed to the fans who ran onto the pitch during the half
time interval.

Mr .Herold said that the trouble steamed from the front central gate being
opened from where about ISO young fans were led onto the pitch surround.
These were the ones who eventually ran onto the pitch although at the time
it was necessary for the gate to be opened to relieve crowd pressure. The
match referee, Clive Thomas, had said that he was unable to start the match
when he wanted to. This was, however, based on a five minute half-time
interval aiid not on the normal ten minute one. It was unfair to suggest
that the match was held up as a result of the fans on the pitch.

Mr Goslin said that he may have mace a wrong decision at half-time to try
and get the fans from the pitch surround onto the Kop. They had not been
causing any trouble where they were, yet the decision to move them onto the
Kbp precipitated a minor pitch invasion. The half-time interval was, on
reflection, insufficient to carry out the necessary manoeuvre.   Some of the
people who were being shepherded into the Kbp refused to go in, resulting in
a minor 'break-out' which was quickly csntrolled. Mr Eerold said that it was
apparent, for future reference, that when people have to be moved from the
Kop the area behind the hoardings is an ideal position to put them into. Chief
Inspector Smith also pointed out that SC-100 fans had been successfully removed
from the pitch and placed into the centra of the Kop. Mr Eerold said that
this situation prompted the only criticism of the police by the club in that
we seemed to be helping fans to climb ever the railings.   Inspector Sykes
replied to this criticism by saying that only, the fans who had become stuck
whilst attempting to climb over the railings to avoid the crush had been
helped by police officers so they did not injure themselves. The other fans
were released, in small groups through a police controlled gate.

One problem which was totally unnecessary was that caused by the sale of
unwanted tickets by Wolverhampton Wanderers direct to Tottenham Hotspur. This
is contrary to FA directions and neither the FA, Sheffield Wednesday FC nor
the police were told of this decision. This made a nonsense of the
segregation arrangements and was a contributing factor to the difficulties
which occurred. Discussions were to take place about this situation.

The Chairman then asked for any comments cr criticisms which could prove
useful for future occasions. The following points were raised:

Acting Chief Superintendent Thompson
                                    0
The route for traffic from the motorway was too tortuous and the more direct
route, the Parkway, should be considered in the future. Chief Superintendent
Herold pointed out that this would bring the fans through the city centre
and into -direct conflict with the bus routes for walking spectators.




                                                               Continued/
 Mr Thompson also relayed criticisms that officers outside the ground had
 made no attempt to direct traffic at blocked up junctions. This cricitism
• was not accepted because with the size of the crowd some delay must be
 accepted and anticipated.

 Superintendent Chapman

The absence of a reserve serial between the South Stand and West Stand caused
a slight delay in the deployment of officers to the disorder situation and
there should be a reserve stationed there in future -

There should be female officers available at the turnstiles to assist in any
necessary searches. There was a marked absence of female officers'at the
gates.

The back to back radios are not useful in the situation when there is
extensive media coverage at the ground. There is a high degree of inter­
ference.

Acting Superintendent Ruddy    .

The communications had proved successful with three channels being used
(1, 2 and 4). The splitting of the ground control and the public order control
meant that the caravan for public order control need no longer be situated
inside the ground and could be moved about outside for optimum reception.

Mr Ruddy also pointed out that the supervisory officers from foreign
forces had made many complimentary remarks about the planning, organisation
and operational aspects of this event. He felt that we were being over
critical of ourselves.

Inspector Calvert

Mr Calvert suggested the inclusion of a de-brief chart so that the comments
of any officers at the ground could be included for discussion.

Sispectcr Sykes                      '

Cn this occasion officers from foreign forces had been employed on duties
inside the ground. Mr .Sykes felt that this should be the duty of the regular
officers ('F* Division)' who are familiar with the territory.

Mr Eerold pointed out that the reverse situation had applied last year and
there were still difficulties.  In fact, the local knowledge of the visiting
officers who were inside had helped to overcome situations, which our own
policemen may not have been able to deal with easily. There are also
logistical difficulties with the deployment of foreign officers outside the
ground.

Sergeant Purdy

Difficulties were experienced because officers from foreign forces had not
read or understood the correspondence sent to them. Despite having maps and
being taken on a tour of the ground, some had gone to a different part of



                                                              Continued/
the ground to where they had been deployed. This could have had serious
consequences whpa assistance was urgently needed.

•The local call signs (eg Sierra S - Sergeant) should be stressed to visiting
 officers as the lack of this knowledge could lead to confusion.

There had been too many people inside the control room   a maximum of nine
persons during the critical stages in a room designed for three, and this
had shown that the ventilation was inadequate. On this point Superintendent
Chapman said that the number of senior officers in the control room at this
time had caused confusion because on occasions conflicting instructions had
been given and the control room staff did not know which particular
instruction to accept and relay.

The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) agreed to consider all the points
raised for future occasions and thanked all present for their attendance.

The meeting closed at 7.20 pa.

              Dear S i r ,

               SEMI-FINAL - 11TH APRIL 1981

               On the occasion of the above match, there was an incident
               at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
               enclosure, which resulted in injuries to spectators
               because o f crushing.                               >

               From our enquiries it appears the crushing was caused
               through Tottenham supporters arriving late, due to
               problems on the Motorway, and rushing to their places
               after the game had commenced, thereby causing problems
               to spectators at the front of the terracing who had
               been in the ground a considerable length of time.

               According to our turnstile readings there were 335 in
               excess of the stipulated capacity for that particular
               area; this was the result of Tottenham fans having
               purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival
               at Turnstile *N*, Penistone Road, which was the
               Wolverhampton standing area, were directed b y the
               police to the other end of the ground where the
               Tottenham fans were standing.

               I give below details of injuries reported to me:-
                      30 spectators treated b y St. John*s Ambulance
                                   Brigade for minor ailments, etc.
                      Treated at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital




                                                                  cont.



                                                               DOCUMENT No. IVZ
South Yorkshire County Council        15th April 1981




Treated at the Northern General Hospital - 5 Spectators.
As the hospital refuse to co-operate with names, addresses, etc.,
I can only tell you that according to the police, injuries
received were
                    2 - Broken arms
                    1 - Broken leg
                    1 - Head graze
                    1 - Not known

The overall report of crowd behaviour, both inside and
outside the stadium, was very good indeed.

Yours faithfully,




Secretary.

  In a c ~ r dance with^your instructions, and d-a to your fully c c m i t t e d
  diary this weak, I can report that I sat with tha Club Secretary cf
  Shaffiald Wadnaadayr ”»r. E2ic England, pricr to tha =a.tch with Grissby
  or. Tuasday, 23 April 1021. »fa discussed car actions at tha 3c=i-final
  and I i n f c m a d hi= that the Ciief Cons tails weald be reporting
  independently car pssition to the ?cotball Association. In his report
  to tha 7.A. .tsr. -England .is ccing to include that fact.

  I have acquaint ad >r*= with all car efforts to nova tha 'Spurs fana
  into tha less dansely path ad central part. o£ tha tarracisg and of tha
  us* of tha public addraos systea, etc.                  .                        ._

  Mr.. 2 ngland new tails =a that despite his earlier fcalief that the
 • referee, Clive Thcnas, .was going to report adversely to tha Football
  Association, in fact.ha does not now know whether Thcsas will do so or
  net. Cartainly, tha r.A.officials wera present and saw what occurred,
  thenselves and will, I think, ‘ endsrstand the position when they receive
  the rsports frca tha .Club and the Chief Constable.              *

 I have i n f e m a d Mr. England that our consensus view is that the 10,100
 crowd figure specified in tha Safety Certificate is hco high. Under­
 standably, he fafutes this and defands tha position b y stating that the
 f o m e r capacity, prior to tha isplacantaticn of the Safety Cf Sports
 Grounds-Actrat Hillsborough in Decanbar 1379, was 11.100, and that on a
 Tiisnbarjof occasions in previous all-ticket satches tha terracing has
 accc=t-cdated that r.urbar. Cartainly, at tha 1020 5a=i-fir.al, when wa
 again had a capacity crowd of 50,174, we also had sc=a hundreds of
 forged tickets, all for tha Lappings Lana end, and apart frc= or.a vary
 ninar crushing of spectators thare was no prcblen.

 Mr. Zncland >:*,«» bean acquainted with our view that tha Leppings Laae
 terracing should be sectioned ’virtically* front to back to produce
 jsr.s to enable =cra accurata crowd control and pravent sidaways cove—
 -ant and he is. already actiraly-'ccasidaring this. I2a has also cor.-
 aidared usinc turnstiles 1—4 for eta part of tha tarracing and 5-5
 for anothar part and controlling tha crowd entering through those turn­
 stiles by -'u«> placing cf safaty barriers in that open area betvean ths
 Lepping 3 *Lane turnstiles and tha back of the West Stand/terracing. * I
 agree with hir that for sost natchas that would possibly work but have
 graTe reservations as— to its efficacy for the potentially trocblescne
 gaues. Additionally, to irpls=ent it he weald have to find sosa way
 for spectators to enter tha 3est Stand without crossing the other
 corridors cf supporters.

  Mr. England accepts the prcblen with the tickets and, quite properly,
  says that is a natter over which he and tha Hillsborough Club
  officials had no control whatever. ’Spuss played Coventry cn tha Saturday
 before Wolves sold their ticket allocation on ’open sale*. .We do not .
 know if scse stayed overnight or travelled on the Sunday to -tha Wolves
 -Club, but certainly-the 'Spurs Club fcn** full. v-11 froa tha^ tin* Pn~ _ •
 wards-that-substantial nunbers of their supporters had purchased tickets
  fcr tha Violvaa end.. They did not tall us or Sheffield Wednesday.        >.
The Minetas recorded-by Sergeant Johnscn are incorrect: whan v s state
that that sal* by Hclverhaspton Wandersrs was Contrary to Football
Association directionsr Thera were no such directions, but an
agreement, between, the P .A., the participating clubs and Sheffield
Wednesday, as to tie ticket allocation, was t^iits clearly cir curran ted.
Hr. Zngland is~rscc=gnding to the F.A. that in future they should
give directions to participating clubs that they will not act in thi3''
way and sust retain, or return any unsold ticxata and sot put ties cn
opan sale as Wolves.bad done c n this occasion.

No other points of. any great importance were discussed but you shculd
be aware that"I- have -condeded to Hr. England that with hindsight ye
accept that our attempt to c o t s the ‘Spurs fans frc= the periseter
track to the ’S o p ” during the 1 isitad period at h a If time w a s ,.perhaps,
ill advised. I have told Mr. England that no police officer encouraged
fans to clirb the--fence and, despite his opinion/ all w e d5d was to
assist these who did so and becaae stuck or injured in the process.

I have also informed Hr. England of the Caief Constable’s concern at
the attitude of senior members of the Hillsborough Club to you and the
Chief Constable and of the±± apparent lack of co-cperaticn and support.

X reccssr-end that a repor t , setting out the Police position in this
case, now be compiled and forwarded under the Chief Constable's
signatura for the information of the Football Association.

Dear Sir

FA CUP SEMI-FINAL          -   11 APRIL 1981

I would refer to the FA Cup Semi-Final match between Wolverhampton
Wanderers Football Club’and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
Saturday 11 April 1981.                                      _

As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100.

Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
afternoon could have been anticipated.

I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
and which shauld be anticipated for future similar occasions.

Cn the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
which were at a premium in London.  Others also made the journey from London
to Wtolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
groups of standing supporters at opposite ends of the ground. Neither of
     the two. participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to inform the South
     Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club or the Football
     A spect          about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
     w a s n o t ”properiy*catered for. The result of this was that some 400
     Tottenham fans had to be removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
     of general safety and public order, and were accommodated in the Leppings
     Lame end of the g r o u n d , . .which had been designated for use by Spurs
     supporters. ■ .......... ..
                              •«
                               .
     The capacity at the Leppings Lane end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
     a safety factor. At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
     gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
     apparent difficulty. However, on this date turnstile readings showed
     that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

     A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
     large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised,
-v   On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
     day     taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
     centre of this enclosure,’
                              - thereby creating a jamming effect at the
     extremeties of it. The late arrivals caused an immediate problem upon
     gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
     imnediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
     after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
     terrace including broken arms, legs and crushed ribs. In all, some 38
     fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John Ambulance
     representatives present at the game.

     As a result of this the safety gates at the front of trie Lessings Lana
     enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
     onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
     terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
     refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
     get in. In my view no other course of action could have been adopted in
     the interest of public safety.

     During the half H n w interval m y officers attempted to move the spectators
     who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
     spectator axeas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
     did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
     by officers within the ground.

      In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
      inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
      I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
      at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future similar
      events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
      of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
      the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

      Yours faithfully

                SAFETY OF SPORTS GROl'SOS ACT. 1975

      Note of a Visit to the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield,
                        on 8th June, 1981

PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

           E. England (Secretary)

           Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

           C. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
           F. Davis (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
           R. Grimshaw (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
           R. Herold (South Yorkshire Police)
           A, Roberts (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           J, P, Ruddy (South Yorkshire Police)                               !
           D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           D.I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1._____ Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981.  The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2 .____Inspection of   Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)    South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be gi,ven.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)    West Stand

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).

Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.


                                    -   1-                  __

                                                     I OOCUMEMTHo.
(c)     North-West Terrace

The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

It was also noted that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been protectively wrapped.

(d)   ' North Stand

The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kop) had been made good.

(e)    Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
be attended to shortly.                                                     !

The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained.  However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forphcoming season.

(f)    General

It was noted:-

(i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

                      EDUCATION OF CLUB STEWARDS

   You are both aware of m y feelings that Club Stewards at Hillsborough often
   do less than they should and are at times not aware of our function and
   operation and our respective roles.

    X. crossed swords with them personally once or twice last season and in an
    effort to set things right for the coming season X have arranged, through
... the Club Chairman and the Secretary - Mr. England - for the stewards to
    attend in the gymnasium at 1 p m on Saturday, 22 August 1981, prior to
    starting their duty, and I should like you to address them.

   They should be told very bluntly that each of them should be aware of the
   location of their respective fire points, emergency exits, the recently
   introduced evacuation procedures, how to react-to the broadcasting of the
   nursery rhyme records, etc.etc. They should also have drawn to their
   attention the Ground Rules of the Club, and in particular the recently
   introduced (and even more recently revised} Rule 15 which, in effect,
   appoints police officers as* agent? of the Club and allows us to deny
   admission to the ground on the Club's behalf.

   We' should stress to the stewards that the admission of spectators and the
   packing of _.th6 se'.spectators at the 'b£gger ';gaines on to the terracing is
   primarily their "function and not a police one.

  -Such unruly behaviour as the throwing of cushions, etc., also falls within
   their responsibility. -              _                           ^
        m         '                                                  *
                                                                     =
                                                                     ■
   When I received critical letters from the Club Chairman^ast year after    —
   several of the matches, X replied to the effect that much of the criticsm
   he levelled at the police'should more properly have been levelled at his
   own administration and the stewards. ..

   We should cooperate- fully with, them and they with us, and not pull in               .....
   opposite directions.

   I remember one particular incident (X believe during the Derby County
   game last year) when the steward on the South. Stand Terracing close to our
   new Control Box quite deliberately ignored fans climbing the railings
   between the Leppings Lane Terracing and the South Stand Terracing when I
   and a number of other officers had witnessed it and drawn it to his attention.
   The steward subsequently maintained that the fans in question had occupied
   those seats for the whole of the time, obviously with a view to 'taking the
   easy way out'.

   That is not their function, and indeed it would be m y intention   certain
   circumstances to call upon stewards to give statements of evidence that
   might support a prosecution. In the past we have never done that but they
   would be good and relatively independent witnesses.

    I aca-^ure you'vi.ii both understand what I have in mind and get the message
    otfer to the stewards. I have already personally told the Club Chairman and
   /the Secretary oS^ray views and they both support them.

For the attention of Mr. P. Vaughan,

Dear Ur. Vaughan,
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
              Radial Fences at Lappings Lane Bad
     We have been Instructed by the Club to organise the
Installation of tvo radial fences on the terrace at the
Lepplngs lane end of the ground.
     It Is Intended that these fences are so positioned
that they divide this section of the terrace Into
approximately three equal areas, each served by Its cnra
entrance.
     By dividing the terrace sore control over supporters
should result. A visiting teas vlth only a fev folLoiars
vlll be allocated one section, vlth the other tvo sections
retained by the hone supporters.
     Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
accommodated In tvo or all three areas as their numbers
dictate.                                    —
     A 1.19 metre vide gate Is proposed at the rear of
each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
during a game. The*gate could be left open, but fastened
back, to connect the areas during a game If adjacent ones
                                                                   2




are accupled by supporters of the same team. When establishing
the height ve have considered that the views to the corner
flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
present by the perimeter fence. We therefore propose that the
top of the fence should be approximately 1680m above the
terrace.
     This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
but should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
Fences this height appear to vork successfully at St. James's
Park, the home of Nave as tie United.
     We vould be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
vlthln the Working Party and your comments forvarded to us.
     Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
various locations around the north stand. Nov the gymnasium is
open to the general public security toother parts of the ground
must be maintained. It is proposed that gates are provided at
the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand vlth additional
gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
stand. A separate gate vlll be placed behind the vest ramp to
prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium tovards
Loppings Lane.
     Six copies of our draving 3563/1 together vith tvo copies
of our dravings 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
     As previously intimated to you we carried out tests
otL approximately one fifth of the crush barriers in July and
also made a preliminary inspection in company with Mr. Shertff.
     One or two of the crush barriers showed signs of distress
under the test load and along a length of the boundary fence of
the Kop at the Horth East corner it was discovered that certain
of the stays were rusted through.    Remedial work has new been
carried out and the defective crush barriers have been successfully
subjected to the test load*    We shall be inviting Mr. Sheriff
to inspect the remedial work in the next few days following
which Z will issue a certificate on the lines of that which I
sent to you last year.

                                      Yours sincerely.

            new radial fences on West Terrace and details of new securitv
            gates (sheets 1 and 2).

   I attended this meeting, together with Superintendent Chapman and
   Chief Inspector Stuart of Operations Division.

   Members of the Fire Service and Buildings Department were in
   attendance and the only reservations expressed were by the Fire
   Service, who indicated that the security gates - which will be
   open during football matches - should not in any way restrict the
   egress routes, which they feel are of minimus width as it is.

   The Buildings representative indicated he would seek further
   information regarding the construction materials to be ussd but
   this would pcse no problem.

                  Note of a Meeting of the Officer Working Party
                  (Sheffield District), held at the Division Street
                  Fire Station, Sheffield, on 11th September 1981


PRESENT:     D.   Chapman (South Yorkshire Police)
             B.   A. Ellis (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
             P.   Garner (South Yorkshire Police)

             T.   W. Stuart (South Yorkshire Police)
             D.   I. Vaughan CSouth Yorkshire County Council)

1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners on behalf of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
gymnasium was open to the general public..

2.    Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any problems
of this nature.

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Terrace.

It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.

IT WAS AGREED  that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
thatthe Officer Working Party   sees no objection to the proposals to instal
two 1680mm high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

      (i)         the further calculations required by the Building
                   Authority being satisfactory;

      (ii)        confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                   available at the rear of the Terrace, and

       (iii)        the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
                   under police control.




                                                             DOCUMENT No. So<\
3.    Security Gates around North Stand

Now that the gymnasium was open to .the general public, the Club wished to
erect security gates at the top o t -the ramps at both ends of the North
Stand, with additional gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road
end of the Stand. A separate gate would also be placed behind the West
Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Leppingp L a n e .

These gates would.be fastened when the gymnasium only was in use so as to
provide security for the rest of the ground. However, on match days they
would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access.

IT WAS AGREED that Hr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
gates around the North Stand, subject td the gates and/or their supports,
hinges, etc not impinging on the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

4 .____ Police and First Aid Facilities

It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid
facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim basis.
The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
position to the existing timbered facilities during the 1980 close
season. Whilst some progress had been made in discussing details of the
facilities, no firm indication had yet been given as to when they would
actually be provided.

IT WAS AGREED that M r ..D. Vaughan should press the Club and/or its
Consultants   for a firm indication as to when the new police and first
aid facilities are to-be provided.

5.    Lottery Ticket Boxes

Attention was drawn to the blocked egress which could result if the
timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps were, to
be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should draw the Club's attention to the
desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Pootball Club

Referring to your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working Party
(Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
letter of 2nd September and accompanying plans.

1.     Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst welcoming the increased control on the Terrace which should
result, concern was expressed as to the problems which could occur with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the entry/
exit gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
problem was of such a snail scale that it could be easily coped with by
the police.
Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
to the proposals to instal two 1680 mm high radial barriers, with 1.15
metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:-

(a) the further calculations required by the BuildingAuthoritybeing
    satisfactory (Mr. Sheriff to contact you direct);

 (h) confirmation that adequate headroca will be available at the rear
     of the lerrace after installation of the barriers and gates, anc

 (c)   the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
       control.

 2.    Security Gates around North Stand

The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club's need to provide^
security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gymnasium is in
use.
 Provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc. do not
 impinge on the existing critical ramp widths and the gates are secured
 in the fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
 sees no objection to the erection of security gates around the Horth Stand,

to the Police and Firat Aid Facilities^ and the sitingofcertainof J±e

                                                                         *
(a) Police and First Aid Facilities

       It vas recalled that the existing unsatisfactory poliee and first
       aid fadlitiea under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim
       basis on the u n d e r * tadding that the Club would provide purpose built
       replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

       It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are
       still continuing, but it is felt that the Club should be asked to give
       a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities are to;
       be provided.
 (b)   Lottery Ticket Boxes            7      '

       Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
       the timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps
       were to ba tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

       The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested t©
       re-site the boxa* in a lass critical position.

I attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

        ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED
                   BY THE CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY

      On 23 September 1981, I made an inspection of the ground,
after having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
and sections of the perimeter fence on Spion Kop tested by members
of my staff under my control.
      In my opinion the various structures on the ground
are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium
to be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
Ground Safety.
      In July, crush barriers numbers.40,41,42,47,48,49,50,
55,56,57,58,59,60,61,68,69,70,71,85,90,114,115,116 and 118 (see
our drawing 1610/63) were tested in accordance with the procedure
laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds. Certain
barriers deflected excessively and would not sustain the test load.
 In one instance a clip retaining the horizontal tube had to be replaced
      Remedial work was carried out on barriers 41 (one post)
and 115 (one post and one clip). At the same time two corroded fence
posts and four corroded fence post stays were replaced.
      After remedial work the sections of barriers which failed
were successfully retested on 9 September. I am now able to certify
 that all 24 barriers have a satisfactory strength.
      The step at the top of the original stair flight at the
 back of Spion Kop has been filled in to give a safe landing.

           A permanent barrier has been installed adjacent
        to the servery at the bottom of the new stair flight
        leading from Spion Kop and a new concrete landing added
        in the same area.
           Certain items of maintenance work which it is
        suggested should be carried out at an appropriate time
        have been recommended to the club. A list is attached.

      For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan
      Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                        Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End
                              and Security Gates
            The work on the radial fences and security gates
      indicated on our drawings 3563/1-3 which we sent to you on
      2 September 1981, is now substantially complete.
<s          Three first team home games have been played since the
      fences were erected. We have not heard any formal comments
      from the Working Party about the operation of the fences and
      their access gates but we understand that representatives of the
      South Yorkshire Police have inspected the work and they are
      satisfied with the new arrangements.
            To increase security it is proposed that pairs of gates
      are installed at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of
      the West Stand. Two copies of our drawing 3563/4 are enclosed
      showing details of the gates.



                                                                            Yours sincerely,

                                In reply to your letter dated 14th December, 1981, I understand that
                                the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification
                                on a small number of points regarding the proposed installation of pairs
                                of gates at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of the Vest
           •4                   Stand. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points and, of
                                course, to the gates being secured in the fully open position during the
                                time the public parts of the stadium are occupied when matches are
                                being played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to the proposals.

                                As regards the radial fences installed on the West Terrace and the
                                security gates around the North Stand, the Officer Working Party wishes
                                to make the following comments

                                (a)        Radial Barriers on West Terrace

                                The matches played at the stadium since the installation of the barriers
                                confirm that they appear to be working well and satisfactorily effect the
                                segregation of opposing groups of fans, fiowcyil?«,Tth<fc~

                                The Police inform me that, on installation of the new radial barriers,
                                the existing crush barriers have been extended in some places up to and
                                completely through the new radial barriers at a height of 4'611 or so
                                from the ground. The effect is to make it very easy for fans to climb
                                from one pen to another. In other places the existing crush barrier
                                rails have been cut off short of the radial barriers in a manner which
                                leaves dangerous pieces protruding into some of the gangways.

                                (b)        Security Gates around the0North Stand
        vvULviJKiJ & k
                                You will recall that my        letter of 14th September, 1981 stated that,
                                provided that the gates        and/or their supports, hinges, etc., do not
                                impinge on the existing        critical ramp widths, the Officer Working Party
            «-a                 saw no objection to the        erectiotffof thejsecurity gates.

                                I am informed that the manner in which the gates have been installed   ,
                                has resulted in each gate's hinge impinging at least 7j" into the width*
                                of the ramp. This means that there is a 15” reduction in width of the \

 means of escape on each ramp.

 As the Annual winter inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium is due
 to take place anytime around now, I would suggest the opportunity be
 taken to discuss these matters at the inspection.

 Perhaps you would contact Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (extension 422)
 so that the necessary arrangements may be made.

nitBTjrii iilint 1ini                                26 Safuary 1982
South Yorkshire County Council,

Barnsley,

S7Q 2TN.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Hr. Vaughan,
                 Safety of Sports Ground Ac*
        Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
        Z believe the small number of points needing
clarification have already been discussed between
John Strange and Mr. Sheriff.     One of these refer to the
need for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
in fact already provided by the sheeting frrfme.    There is
also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
of reinforcement in the 1 0 0 m thick retaining wall.   There
is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
maintenance repair will be carried out*
        Turning now to the radial barriers on the West
terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
it will make it easlir -for anyone who. so wishes to climb :..
over.   Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
leave the crush barriers as they are.     Zf all barriers
were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.
 There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
 capacity which Is undesirable from the Club's p4int of
 view.   However from the point of view of safety a strip
 of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
 major hazard.
         It should be kept in mind that the introduction
 of these radial barriers has effected a very great
 improvement fro* the point of view of segregation of
 spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
 view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.
 Z believe that what we have done is a reasonable compromise
 between the various interests.
         Zn the second paragraph on this subject you
 refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
 crush barriers.    Z have not had an opportunity to check
 this since receiving your letter but Z am informed that
 the word 'dangerous' is a little exaggerated and they
 do not of course protrude into a gangway as there is no
 gangway at this position.
         With regard to the security gates around the North
 stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
 the gate width is at all critical.       The remaining clear
 width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
 Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
 eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
 per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
 routes.   The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
-practice more-than-half- the number tend to use the lover--
 exits since, most spectators ..are. reluctant :,to .walk uphill . „
 to the upper set of exit stairways.       The picture is that
 fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
-exits which-can-aeeomaodate 5r760~in-eight-iaJinutes-.
        Cher* w n   very good structural reasons for placing
the gates in this way.   The theoretical exift capacity has
not been changed since it was always a six unit gateway.
There is no funnelling effect, and there is a good
•reservoir* area upstream of the gates*
        X telephoned your office yesterday but gather
you were on leave and have again telephoned this »orning
with a view to agreeing a tentative date for the winter .
meeting of the working party.   I will try again in the
next day or so.

                                Yours sincerely.

1.   Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss^the apparent difference of opinion
on-certain'aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
and-the- security gates at the top of ..the North stand raaps, as well as to
carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

2.   Ground Inspection

A.    West Terrace

Whilst the w h o l e Terrace-had.-yet_£iaJa&-J»s^Jthe matches played since the
erectionjof ..the .radial barriers indicated^ that generally they’worked veil and
satisfactorily effected the s e g r e g a t i o n ^      groups-of* fans.

However. the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
had been extended up >.oran<r,rin’,soae..case^',”Icbiapletely ’through~the-nev
radial barriers, which had the ef fect_.of making .it relatively easy for anyone
wh^~wishea' c~a"do”so to* "climb from one pen to another. Also, in the pen
nearest to the South Stand, a saaii’length of existing crush barrier had been
lef t“ims'upported.         ....

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
prevent crowd surge by ~the"existing barriers being extended up to and/or
through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
current season.

 (ii) That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
 be cut off.

                                           -1-



                                   E)
One of the .security gates -which the Club wished to instal at. the bottom of
the two staircases had now been erected.               ...

IT WAS AGREED     that this could be regarded as satisfactory.

C.    North Stand

The Fire Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available

The Club's Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the
of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not

IT WAS AGREED   that, as the point might well have been covered in the
initial consideration of the Club’s application for a General Safety
Certificate,  the point would notbe pursued at the moment.

      NOTE -A search of the file subsequently revealed that, as
             suspected, the point had been considered at a
             meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
             the relevant part of the Note of the meeting reading:-

                  "the construction and width of the ramps being
                   such that they could quite properly be
                   regarded as elevated roadways".

D.    Spion Kop

It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
the left of the original exit at the top of the Kop had taker. place;that
the boundary fence at the top of the Kop had been reinforced, andthat the
existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
levelled off as agreed.

E.    South Stand

The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

F.    Items of General Maintenance

IT WAS AGREED     that the following items of general maintenance required
attention

(i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
the exit at the southerly end of theWest Stand (tobe done that day), as
well as the roundingoff ofthe brackets to   the North Stand securitygates.

(ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
Gate "0".

            the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) to be protected (cracks and
            exposed bar).

            G.             Temporary Structures
            Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
            of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used m connection with
            television transmissions..
 J )
            Paragraph 20 of the Club'sGeneral SafetyCertificate required                                                       T.V.cameras
            and portable equipment to be placed onlyin suchpositions asmay be agreed
            between the Police and the Club. The Club also were generally required to
            ensure that the Stadium complied with good engineering and building practices
            and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

             IT WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept
             under review, and that the Club's Consultants should give advice to the
             Club.

             3.            Future      Developments

             A.              Police and First Aid Facilities

           ‘It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
            Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council
            that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
            forthcoming close season.

              B.            Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road

              The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of their
              intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season with the demolition or
              some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in
              order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
              Stadium.

               C.           Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

               Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
               rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
               When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
               walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.




                                                                         m                           '

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.,                   12 July 1982
Hillsborough,
Sheffield,
S6 1SW.
For the attention of Mr. E. England

Dear Eric,
               Annual Certificate of Ground Safety
     We have completed the testing of the remainder of the
barriers at the Spion Kop end of the ground excepting
those bar#i*«s which because of their position cannot be
subjected to the test load.    Z am pleased to say that all
the barriers withstood the load but unfortunately in a number
of cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed
considerably.    It is inevitable thatwwater gets under
these clips and they rust thus becoming weaker with the
passage of time.    In one or two cases the clip actually
snapped as the final load was taken off.       A total of 25 new
clips are needed on Spion Kop including a few on the barriers
at the top which have not actually been tested.         John also
inspected the Lepplngs Lane end and 10 clips are sufficiently
corroded to make it wise to change them rather than wait until
they are tested during the next ^tw^yea r s ^ jffe are using
a heavier gauge metal for the x atnfforocwie c l i p s so that the , .
future life expectancy will be increased.            ._
     The metal in the tube beneath the clips is also subject
to corrosion and 11 lengths each about '8ft. long on Spion Kop
are clearly nearing the end of their life.       We have to^bear
in mind that the corrosion which can be seen on the outside may


                                                                         /
be natched by corrosion Inside the tube which cannot
of course be painted*    Whilst all 11 lengths successfully
carried the test load you may think it prudent that they
should be replaced now because they could become dangerous
within five years*
     Zf all this work is carried out (new clips on both
Spion Xop and Lepplngs Lane plus 11 new lengths of barrier
top rail on Spion Kop) the likely cost is between E12S0
and £1500 exclusive of professional fees.    Z should be
pleased to have your view as ttowhether we should carry out
the whole of this work or merely replace the clips on
Spion Kop which deformed under test in which case the cost
of the work would be approximately halved.
     John has already walked round the ground and he tells
me that some splitting and spelling of the concrete columns
is developing at ground floor level at the back of the
South stand.   !>•shall be making ay inspection in company
with the Building Surveyors department representative during
this month and it is likely he will raise the matter.    In
any case it is important that splitting of this kind be dealt
with reasonably quickly so as to retard the* rate at which the
reinforcement corrodes.    Z will discuss this matter with you
when Z have seen the damage myself.

ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED BY THE
                                CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                    On 16 August 1982, I made an inspection of the ground,
after having          had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
on Spion Kop tested by members of my staff under my control.
                    At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 43, 44, 45,
46, 51, 52, 53, 54,                                62,63, 63A, 65, 66, 72,                    73, 74, 75, 76, 78,
79, 80, 86, 87, 88,                                89,91, 92, 94, 95, 97,                    98, 99, 100, 101, 103,
104, 105, 107, 108,                               109and 110 were tested                     in accordance with the
procedures laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.
All the barriers sustained the test load although in some instances
the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed.                                                    These clips have
been replaced.                     At the same time, other clips and horizontal rails
showing signs of advanced corrosion were replaced.
          I am now able to certify that all 41 barriers have a
satisfactory strength.
          Two radial fences have been installed on the Leppings
Lane terrace to segregate spectators.
                    Gates have been installed at various locations arming
the ground to prevent intruders entering the stands.
                    Repairs have been carried out to six stanchions
supporting sheeting along the boundary wall near gate 'O' on
Penistone Road.

             Sharp corners on the underside of the landing of
   the south exit at the front of the West stand have been
  ground smooth.
             Various minor items of remedial work to concrete
   and brickwork walls, steps, terracing and the like have
  been completed as part of the maintenance programme.
             Certain other items of maintenance work which it
   is suggested should be carried out at an appropriate time
  have been recommended to the Club.      A list is attached.
             I certify that in my opinion the various structures
  on the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate
   for the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down
   in the Certificate of Ground Safety.

Dear Ur. 8herrlff,
       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd..
               Barrier Testing 1983
     Over June 2 0 - 2 4 , crush barriers 121, 122, 123, 124,
124A, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134,
135, 136 (part), 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144 (part),
145, (part), 146    (part). 147, 148, 149 (part), 150, 151, 152,
153 and 154 (part) at the Lepplng lane end were tested in
accordance with the procedure laid dovn in the Guide to Safety
at Football Grounds. The layout of the barriers is shown on
the enclosed print of our drawing 1610/64B.
     8pans 3 and 4 of barrier 136 could not be loaded because
of the recently installed radial fence. Soae spans of
barriers 144, 145, 146, 149 and 154 could not be tested because
being towards the back of the terrace the absence of a suitable
reaction point or obstruction prevented jacking.
     In all but one case the barriers sustained the test load
although in tvo cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube
deforaed. These/vere on barrier 136 between spana 6 - 7 and
8-9.    New clips have been fitted. On barrier 129 the tube

has been welded onto the clip to give a aore positive
fixing, but nevertheless the teat load was resisted.
     Tha only failura was tha centre support of barriar
141. Tha angla lag, which was corrodad round tha top
rivets, partad during tha first load application. Tha
angla has bean platad and naw bolts insartad to conplete
tha connection. This la shown on our ancloaad sketch,
4644/2.
     Also ancloaad ara single copias of our record sheets
showing the results of the barrier tests.

              O n 25 July,           1983 I made an i ns p ection of the g r o u n d after
 h a ving h a d a p p r o x i m a t e l y one fifth of the crush b ar r i e rs
 tested b y m e m b e r s of my staff u n d e r my control.

              A t the end of June,                         crush b ar riers num b e r s 121,                            122,    123,
 124A,         125,     126,       127,          128,            129,       130,       131,        132,     133,      134,    135,
 136          (part),    137,        138,          139,           140, 141,                142,     143,       144    (part),     145
  (part),         146    (part),             147,          148,            149       (part),        150,       151,    152,    153

 w er e tested in a c c ordance w i t h the pr o c ed u r e s laid d own in the
 Guide to Safety at Fo o tball Grounds.

              In all but one case the b a r r i er s s ustained the test load
 although in two cases the clips reta i n i ng the h or i z o n t a l tube
  deformed.             These clips were on b a r r i e r 136 b e t w e e n spans 6-7
  and 8-9.            N e w clips h ave b e e n fitted.

         Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
         League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

         2.   Ground Inspection

         A.   South Stand

         The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
         had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
         Working Party.

         IT WAS AGREED -

         (i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
         the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
         by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

         (ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
         Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

         (iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
         of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
         should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
         with the appropriate Regulations.

         (iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
         of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

         B.   West Stand and Terrace

         The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
         Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
         of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
         temporary barriers. This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
         was the policy of the Police to aim for’exclusive use by'visiting supporters
         of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
         visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
         obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.


                                                     °17
  r WAS AGREED

 (i)   That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
 permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
 being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
 usual way.

 (ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
 at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
 to be monitored.

 (iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
 Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

 C.    North West Terrace

 No ccRments.                                              —

 D.    North Stand

 IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
 continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
 the area would be regarded as acceptable.

 E.    Spion Kop

 It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
 the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
 Club's development proposals proceeding'; that the loose coping stores
 had been removed from the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
 South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
 Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

 IT WAS AGREED -

 (i) That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
 continue to be monitored.

 (ii) That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
 wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

 F.    Lighting Pylons

 The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
 inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

 IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
 carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

 3.    Public Address System

*"The-Glub pointed out'-that- an-improved public- address system had-been- installed,
  and the Police confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
  better than the previous system.
«♦.   Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Officer Working Party confirmed that plans for the revised catering
facilities at the rear of the West Stand had been received from the Club's
Architect and had been formally approved.

The Club reported that the scheme for the general up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand) was shortly to be
considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would submit the proposals for improved toilet
and catering- facilities for approval in the usual way, subject, of course,
to the Board's decision whether to proceed with the scheme.

         SOUTH YORKSHIRE METROPOLITAN AMBULANCE SERVICE

                    MAJOR INCIDENT PLAN


Introduction

A major Incident is a situation that we can never predict, it can occur
at any place at any time. The object of this plan is to enable us to
deal with any incident in an organised professional way, by each and
every meffber sticking to their own job and knowing exactly what their
role is.

The Ambulance Service has more problems regarding manning levels than
the other two Bnergency Services especially at night, the weekends and
Bank Holidays. This problem alone makes the construction of a plan
such as this a major task due to the difficulties that can occur in
contacting off duty personnel. The plan has been designed to be simple,
easy to read and each duty itemised so individuals can concentrate on
the areas that concern them and all unnecessary information left out.

Attention must be drawn to the following factors:-

The colour of Safety Helmets will denote the duties and rank of the
wearer i.e.

1. An±>ulance Personnel transport         =   White
   Leading Anbulance Person               =   White with Black Band
   Bnergency Support Team (Foot Squads)   *   Yellow
   Ambulance Officers                     *   Blue

2. All personnel must ensure that their H. V. jacket and suitable
   footwear are taken to the scene of any major incident with other
   items of personal safety equipment.

It is most important that the Incident Officer remains in or close to
the Cannunications Vehicle, this being the centre for directing and
monitoring the whole operation. He must also ensure that a V.H.F. R/T
Handset (which will be marked) is given to the first available crew
that depart for the designated hospital so it can be handed over to the
Liaison Officer who will be on duty.

Antiulance crews must remain with their vehicles at all times, their
role at a major incident is transportation and Ambulance Nursing whilst
mobile, all rescue and treatment duties will be performed by the
Bnergency support team which are Anbulance Personnel without ambulances.

Delegated officers will be issued with a U.H.F. R/T Handset to enable
cannunications to be made via the mobile Control.

The support and ccmnunication vehicle will be based at Headquarters, this
vehicle will contain all the necessary equipment and drivers will be
allocated by Control.

To enable the plan to run efficiently, it is essential that all personnel
concentrate on the objectives and check list of their individual role.
MAJOR INCIDENT/CATASTROmE PLAN

   Dear Mr Chester

   SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS TO LEPPINGS LANE END OF THE GROUND

   With reference to our conversation of last week regarding improvements
   required to the West End of the ground, I forward herewith our thoughts.

   You will see that we favour the erection of a stone wall on the ground side
   of the current terraces, with such wall housing a bank of turnstiles. Our
   belief is that once a spectator goes through the turnstiles he should then
   be segregated from the other fans, and this can be achieved by the erection
   of permanent high metal railings on that concrete area at present behind
   the Stand. Similarly, there should be a high metal railing down the centre
   of the West Stand. What is then created is total segregation of all three
   portions of the Terrace and the two areas of the West Stand, with each of
   these segregated areas having its own refreshment and toilet facilities.

   If you have any query on these recommendations, no doubt you will come back
   to me.

   Yours sincerely




    Chief Superintenden

          I have pleasure in enclosing three ooples of our
    sketch 6705/2 showing a possible layout which segregates visitors
    froa hoae supporters reasonably well. Xt also allows flexibility
    in allocating varying amounts of accommodation to visitors • -
          Suggestions are also made for new refreshment and toilet
A   areas utilising vacant volume under the ltaefc stand.

 For the attention of Mr D Vaughan

Dear Mr Vaughan,
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
   Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End
     The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team's supporters
 as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
 their exit at the end of a game.
     We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
 drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
 turnstiles (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing
  and new gates.
      It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
  proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
  the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                                                    Yours sincerely,

               Note of a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield
               District) held at the Police Sports & Social Club, Niagara
                             Sheffield, on 18th April 1985


PRESENT: N. Atkinson (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
         C. Calvert  (South Yorkshire Police)
          R. Grimshaw (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
          G. Stanley (South Yorkshire Police)

             §ykes    -“(South .Yorkshi r-e Police)
          D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
          A. Vickers    (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)


1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
and plan   from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

2.    Consideration of Proposals

The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
home supporters as well.

The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
Police representatives, subject to:-

(a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
      and the wall of the inner access road;

(b)   the   central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
      visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in half by a new
      central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
      pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
      to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
      secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
      on the plan to be abandoned);

(c)   the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
      terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence
      running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
      fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
      home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

(d)   the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
      installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
      area

                                         1.


                                                                DOCUMENT Ho.
The County Fire Service saw no objection in principle to the proposals,
subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

3.   Action

IT WAS AGREED

(a) That R. Grimshaw should investigate as a matter of urgency the means
of escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan know the
outcome.

(b) That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions of the South
Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of the
necessary detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

                    Dear Sir

                    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
                    SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FC

                    Further to the joint meeting on 18 April 1985, to discuss the proposals for
                    new crowd control arrangements, the means of escape implications have now
                    been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
                    certain gates have the minimum widths (in metres) as indicated on the enclosed
                    plan. It is understood that these gates will be supervised by either the police
                    or club officials.

                    Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact
                    this Department.

                    Yours faithfully

        Dear Sirs,

        Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1985
        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

        In reply to your letter dated 9th April, whilst a meeting of the
        Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) was held on 18th April
        to consider the proposals which you outlined, the County Fire
        Service requested additional time to consider the means of escape
        aspects.

        I am now able to say that, subject to the incorporation of the
        following points and to the submission of detailed plans and
        calculations under both the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and
        Building Regulations, the proposals outlined are regarded as
        generally acceptable:-

        (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile
J             numbered 16 and the wall of the inner access road;

        (b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral
              area or visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in
              half by a new central radial fence running from the tunnel
              entrance to the pitchside security fence with gates erected
              so as to permit entry to be diverted to either half as
              appropriate (the proposed new secondary radial fence
              adjacent to the existing fence indicated on the plan to be
J             abandoned);

        (c) the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
            terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial
    .   ? ^ fence running from back to front with two gates (the existing
         ’  radial fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral
            area and home supporters •• to have a second gate installed /

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                           Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                    Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
to you on 9 April.
                    In the interim period several of the points which you
raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                              However I
would ask that further consideration should be given to the
request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                                             If these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                                   a
 steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
would hardly be justified.                                               It is our view that in the event of
emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
 gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                                           Yours sincerely,          DOCUMENT (to.            q-

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

In reply to your letter of. 3th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
(c) of ray earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the request
of the South Yorkshire Police.

Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
are incoprorated in the'latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
the Police are nreoareri to concede the request for two gates ner radical fence
in the right hand area of the Mappings Lane End Terrace (indicated as hone
supporters' terrace on the plan).


                                        Yours faithfully

Dear Dick,
                                       Alterations at Leppings Lane End
                We have pleasure in enclosing two prints of each of our drawings
6705/5 and 6705/8 showing two possible alternative arrangements for
the turnstiles and toilets at the back of the West stand.
                Both drawings show the following turnstile arrangements.
                        Turnstile Nos                        1 - 8           -   North stand
                                                             9 - 13 -            North west terrace, home supporters
                                                            14 - 16 -            West stand, home supporters
                                                            17 - 19 -            West stand, away supporters
                                                            20 - 23 -            South west terrace, away supporters
                The proposals for the toilet and refreshment facilities are also
the same on each drawing.                                           You will see that we propose to build a new
ladies toilet for away supporters using the end of the existing
refreshment bar.                          The existing ladies toilets will be refurbished for
the use of home supporters.                                               The existing gents toilets will be
divided and refurbished.
                Drawing 6705/5 indicates present turnstile                                          housings (17 & 18)
remaining with the ajoining fence covered with sheeting to completely
separate the home and away supporters.                                                However, doing the calculations
for the evacuation of the ground reveals that there is a pinch point at

       he fin a ll y a c c e p t e d t ha t it was not n e c e s s a r y to do any m o r e

 He   felt that       a higher        fence      t h a n t h e p r e s e n t one o r a d o u b l e
 fence was necessary.                 I s u g gested that we                should have     a double
 fence w i t h a gap bet w e e n           s o as t o k e e p the            spectators     apart
 and to p r o v i d e    a space       in w h i c h h i s o f f i c e r s c o u l d     stand.
 F e w e r p o l i c e m e n w o u l d b e n e e d e d if th e      spectators had a
 g a p b e t w e e n t hem.       It so h a p p e n s      that right          alongside       th e
 existing       fence there         is a g a t e o n t o the p i t c h a n d            if the
 second fence were p l a c e d on the other                       s i d e of t h e gate,        it
 will provide         an e a s y a c c e s s g a n g w a y     for t h e p o l i c e    and they
 w i l l be able      to move       in a n d o u t o f th e         gap d e p e n d i n g on the
 situation.           Mr.     Moseley was         cl e a r l y very p l e a s e d by this
 suggestion and subject to your                       approval,        we      are   including
 t he w o r k   in the c o n t r a c t     for     s e g r e g a t i n g the    spectators      at
 L e p p i n g s L a n e end.
       I should point out that                   it w i l l m e a n    losing about a metre
 of advertising          space      because        th e h o a r d i n g s    carry    straight on
 past that particular               gate     at present.              There will        have    t o be
 a ga p    in t h e   hoardingsto enable                the police to get              in a n d o u t a n d

Dear Mr. Calvert#
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
      Further to .'our telephone conversation on 24 June we have
pleasure in enclosing two copies of our drawing 6705/8 showing
the proposed arrangement of the turnstiles and fences and gates
at the rear of the West stand.
      Zt is also proposed, but not shown on the drawing to
install a single barrier rail, just above head height down
the centre of the seated area and also a fence approximately
2m away from the existing radial fence.on the right hand side
of the terrace (looking from the pitch),to separate standing
spectators. The fence will be just like the ones ailzeady installed
      Although Dr, Eastwood has discussed the proposals in
outline with Chief Inspector Moseley we would also appreciate
receiving your comments.
      Perhaps the work can be completed ready fox the start
of the season if the scheme meets with your approval.

                               Yours sincerely,

    Dear Dick,
                        Alterations at Legpings Lane End

         We have pleasure in enclosing a set of prints of our drawings
    showing details of the work at the Loppings Lane End.
         Drawing 6705/8A is worth a look at because it shows the proposed
    layout of the turnstiles and fences. South Yorkshire Police have
    given their approval to the scheme though we have not received
£   anything from thea in writing.
         Tenders are due back on 11th July, 1985.
                                 Yours sincerely.

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

As requested by your letter dated 16th July, I have written a confirmatory
letter to the Club regarding the steel sheeting and non-slip surface of
the timber deck to the South Stand upper seated area (copy attached for .
your information).

I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval
have been made by the Club in respect of (i) re-organisation of fences
and turnstiles and alterations to toilet facilities at the rear of the
West Stand, Leppings lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
Spion Kop Terrace.

the Officer working Party considered and gave approval in principle to the
rear of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in May but, other than
brief mentions by the Club or yourselves at routine meetings of the
possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
of such proposals have been considered to date. -•

As on previous occasions, Z am assuming that you will submit the necessary
detailed plans, specifications and calculations for Safety of Sports Grounds
Act approval (bearing in mind the General Safety Certificate requirement
to give the County Council at least 21 days notice of any proposed
alterations or extensions at the Ground) should the Club decide to implement
the proposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

                                                   Yours faithfully.

                      SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

Note of a Meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) held at
the Police Sports and Social Club, Niagara, Sheffield, on 29th July, 1985

PRESENT:   S. Allcock (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).
           N. Atkinson (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council).
           Ms. J. Barker (South Yorkshire Police).
           J. Freeman (South Yorkshire Police).
           D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council).
           D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council).

1.     Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the detailed plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was
recalled that consideration of outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some of the work had actually
commenced, Messrs. Eastwood'and Partners had apologised by 'phone that
submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
holidays. The plans also included details of repairs to certain crush
barriers on the Spion Kop.

2.     Consideration of Proposals

The 14 detailedplans submitted were each considered anddiscussed individually.

IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points and to the submission of
the necessary detailed calculations to the Building Authority, the proposals
for segregating visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium were generally acceptable:-

(a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes,
a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided; .

(b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
(river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller shutter gate
between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

(c)    Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
(e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
be required;

(d)     Plan No. 6705/10A - same conments as for plan 9A;

(e)    Plan No. 6705/11A - no objection in principle,but details of exact
location required;

(f)   Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
indicated;

 (g)    Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
 slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements to give


                                                      DOCUMENT No.
foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to take
measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to climb
over will have to be borne in mind;

(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

(i)    Plan No.' 670S/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Pence Gate to be provided;

(j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May, 1985,
it is essential that all th« new gate*'are fully supervised by Stewards,
who must be fit, able and properly trained.
                                                                                 a/?'

For the attention of Mr. D« Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                     Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
             Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.                                                    We note
the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
by the Building Surveyors Department.                                            We believe that all the
calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
checking and comment.
              With regard to your detailed observations our response
is as follows                                                   •
 (a)          We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
the proposed extra security gate.                                          There is already a gate in
the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
police.           This same gate will still be available for the spectators
 in emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
which will be under the control of the police.                                                    This point may
 perhaps be clarified during the Working Partyrs visit on 7 August.

 (b)          The foundations"for this fence are in fact already aligned in
                                   An Unlimited Company. Ragtotarad In England - No. 1833144                    I*   C . f-C   K fV + C (

  the way you suggest.

  (c) and (d)
           We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
  single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
  walls.    The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
  vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
  Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
  durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

  (e)      The refreshment area is under the most westerly
  staircase up to the north west corner terrace.      There will
  be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.

  (f)      The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4'1")
  above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
  step.

  (g)      The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
  chamfers which will not form good footholds.

  (h)      Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
  object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
  the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

  (i)      As with point   (a), we are not sure what is intended,
  and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

  (j)      Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
  taken care of by Mr. Chester.


            It will be much easier for your Working Party to
  appreciate what is intended when they see the works under
  construction.     There will also be an opportunity to see
  the metal decking of the South stand.


                                Yours sincerely,

      Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield on
                            7th August, 1985

PRESENT: Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

          Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

          D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
          F.   Waterhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.    Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the ''summer" inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.    Ground Inspection.

A.    Leppings Lane End

The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party's meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive's letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and comment.

On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
45 chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

 The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
 aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
 and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan submitted).

 As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
  in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
 Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
■ was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
  by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
  the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern thdt the


                                                          OQCUMEHTNo.
                                                      -                 -   .   — »

dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
concrete slabs. It was noted that there were same 9 inch thick brick walls
in the Male Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed out that thenew toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

The position of the new refreshment area uoder the     wfetftterly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the Police.
This gate would still be available for the use of spectators in an
emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required. It
was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access level.

IT UAS AGREED

(a)   that the condition of the internal walls in the new male and female
toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

(b)   that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new radial fence;

(c)   that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
the new South Central Terrace Pen;

(d)   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
area should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;

(e)   that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
upper seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance;

(f)   that the corrosion of the steel columns at the rear of the Stand
should receive attention on a maintenance basis.

B.    South Stand

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper
concrete outer portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
surface was to commence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
start of the season).
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcame the flammability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of the metal sheeting.

C.    Spion Kop

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club's
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed. Its present condition
remained acceptAble *rLth continuing maintenarjee.

In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present.
IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrangement to assist access and egress.

D.   North Stand

The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
(in front of the Ladies' Changing Facilities in the Sports Hall) were
inspected.

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.

E.   Closed Circuit Television Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that a 2| kg. CO2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
Police Control Box and'the Disc Jockey Box;

(b)   that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
secure.

    For the attention of J.C. Harris M.A. LL.M.
    Chief Executive StCounty Clerk____________


    Dear Sir,

    Many thanks for your coranunication dated 9th August 1985.

    I can confirm that arrangements have been finalised with South Yorkshire
    Police Authorities, Hamnerton Road, for the staff concerned to be briefed
    on matters relating to safety/emergency procedures prior to our first home
    game, Saturday 17th August 1985.

    The written instructions are already in existence with the amended "warning
    message" of an emergency situation confirmed during season 1984/5.

    My Head Steward and various sectional senior stewards, are kept fully
O   informed of the various matters and are responsible for advising the
    "match day" staff accordingly.

    In addition the staff are supplied with distinguishing attire, and are
    given specific duties to perform and required to be in attendance at those
    points throughout the entire period.

    With the approval of South Yorkshire Police, due to holidays and the
    unavailability of a full complement of staff, I have delayed the convening
    of an evenings seminar/instructional course, by the Fire Authorities until
    after the season has commenced. Having spoken to the Fire Authorities they have
    confirmed their willingness to attend leaving only the finalisation of the date
    in abeyance.

    Yours faithfully,

    R.H. Chester Eqq,,                                          15 August 1985
    Secretary,
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic,
    Hillsborough,
    Sheffield,
    S6 1SW.



    Dear Dick,
          Many thanks for your note of 12 August enclosing the
    copy of David Vaughan's note of the meeting held at the ground
    on 7 August.    A copy of ay letter to David Vaughan was sent
    to you the same day so that our letters have crossed in the
®   post.
          You will see that Z have taken up very strongly the
    suggestion by Don Sherxlf that the workmanship in the brickwork
    was poor and would lead to weakness. Zt is unfortunate that
    David Vaughan did not record that Z had completely refuted
    what Don Sheriff said.    David now recognises that this was a
    mistake but & putting the matter right by circulating a copy
    of my letter.
          Turning- to the matter* on the second .page *-_____  __
    ■Zt was agreed"
    My comments on the points you have in mind are as follows i-
    (b)   This refers to the existing gate between the new 2m wide
          gap formed by the radial fence which will be used for
          police access only.    You will notice from the wording
          jh■*
          o f David's minute that Z persuaded that that steps oould


                                           I L 'l
      be used.   Z have Interpreted   this as being from
      the Inside only which means that we will not lose
      any of your advertising space.   We have added the
      provision of some timber steps on the Inside to
      the work being carried by Gleeson.

(c)   The other radial fence forming the small visitors
      pen has left a length of terrace without a direct
      access on to the pitch. There is of course a gate
      at the top of the terrace connecting into the next
      pen and we had hoped that the police would accept
      that as an adequate means of exit in emergency.
      However at the meeting they made the point very
      strongly that if someone had to be got out of the pen
      which has no gate or if there was misbehaviour the
      police would only be able to get in via the neighbouring
      pen, passing up the terrace through the gate at the
      back and then down again in the isolated pen. They
      considered this unacceptable.   Z think that this
      particular item can be paid for out of the contingency
      sum and suggest that it be added to Gleeson's work.

(d)   You will recall that when you and Z went round with
      Superintendent John Freeman he pointed out; that the
      advertising hoardings on the parapet of the seating
      area of the West stand were simply hooked over the
      parapet walland.some jot r:the hook* had. been,bent*.....
      We agreed th&t_a_ fixing would be provided. Be had
      apparently reported this to David Vaughan so the
      matter wss raised again. Zt is clearly a good point
      because any hooligans in the seated area could easily
      drop an advertising board on to people below.    z have
      in mind that the hoardings can be fixed by a runner
      of timber and again subject to your approval, this
      can be carried out as part of the present works.
                                ^   ■   7*7
                                                                   3.




(e)   This is a very minor matter which c*n "be dealt with
      next year.

(£)   You will probably know that the bases of the steel columns
      behind the West stand have bean queried year by year
      by Don Sheriff who has requested ^hat excavations be
      carried
            *
               outto ensure hhat the steel is not rusting
      below ground level.    By chance Gleesons had exposed
      one of the columns and I was interested to see that it has
      not suffered badly.    However I have pointed out that the
      columns do net carry any load.    They fora part of the
      previous structure and were chopped down to that level
      when the new concrete stand was built for the World
      Cup.    They merely form a frame within which the brick
      wall is built. There is therefore no cause for concern.
      At the next meeting in February Z will try to get this
      item deleted from the list.



      Quite a number of items have now been added at Police
request. In addition there is the cost of the new gas main
and also unexpected costs in connection with the electricity
supply to the new refreshment area in the North West corner.
Z am asking John Strange to check on all these Items to see
whether they can be accommodated within the contingency sum
which we included In Gleesons contract. Z^am on holiday but
John wliXJbej               ntext week.

                      Yours sincerely.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                                 Safety of Sportsgrounds Act
                                                        Roof of North Stand
            I spoke to you before going on holiday regarding the very
advanced state of corrosion which we discovered when I made an
examination of the external steelwork of the North stand roof
at the end of the laist football season.
            Attached are four photographs which are representative
of the conditions which I discovered.                                     Photograph 1 shows one
of the main trusses.                                   It will be seen that the vertical
member and the top boom and diagonal were fairly rusty and they
 clearly needed a paint treatment because the paint had largely
 disappeared and corrosion can be expected to accelerate from now
 on.         It has to be kept in mind that the roof was designed for
 the pre-1970 wind loadings including downward suction when the
 wind is blowing from the back of the stand so that factors of
 safety have always been slightly less than they would be
                                   An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No^ 1833144       ■   ■■..   ..■   . n»

 according to the present day Building Regulations.
          At the time of my first inspection the bottom boom
 member was covered by some flashings which hid two side
 legs.      I arranged for representative lengths of these
 flashings to be removed and as you will see from photograph 1
 rusting had been taking place rapidly for many years.       It seems
 that when the roof was painted last time the flashings were
 left in place so that there had only been the original paint
 treatment which had disappeared long ago.          Photograph 2
 was taken on the same day at another location.      You will
 see that there is a very large rust lamination on the nearside
 leg of the bottom boom where a large piece of rust is splitting
 away from the remainder of the steel.
          In addition to the very serious rusting of the vertical
 flanges, there were many places on the web of this bottom
 boom member where rust had progressed quite considerably.
 The web had clearly been painted 18 years ago but because
 of the very shallow slope of the bottom boom (parallel to
 the roof) the rain which falls in it had been ponding thus
 keeping the steel wet for a considerable portion of the time.
  This had tended to occur locally where small dams of dust had
  built up.
        As a result of these findings I reported to the Club
  that all the steelwork needed painting as a matter of urgency
  but in addition, the bottom boom would need to be blast
  cleaned before painting and finally that a completely different
  form of flashing should be incorporated which would stop
  rain from falling into the trough and which could also be
  easily taken off when next the roof is painted.
          The Club took the decision to carry out the painting.
  Tenders were obtained and work began at the beginning of
  July.     When the flashings were taken off everywhere, we found
  even worse conditions in some places than had been discovered
  in the original inspection.     Photograph 4 shows the extent to
EASTWOOD f t PARTNERS




 which metal had been lost in some parts of the bottom boom.
 Photograph 3 was just as bad but the damage does not show
 up quite so well in the photograph.      Incidentally, photographs
  3 and 4 show son»6 nice'bright clean, blue paint or* the remainder
 of the members.      This steel had of course already been painted
  and does not represent the original condition.
           During the work on the underside of the roof which
  has also been painted but for which the Club is not intending
  to apply for a grant, we discovered that at many places
 water had been leaking between roof sheets and had caused
  some localised rusting.      The reason for this leakage is clearly
  the very shallow slope of the roof which is only about 1°
  (1 in 60).      A normal minimum roof slope is about 5°.        With the
  1° slope it seems that when the wind is blowing from the south
  rain which falls on the roof can be blown up the slope under
  the lap between sheets and small amounts leak into the stand.
           In order to give long term protection from this leakage
  which could in time cause the steelwork beneath the roof to
  become unsafe, I have recommended to the Club that they spend
  approximately £3,000 in having the lower edges of each roof
  sheet lifted and a seal placed before fastening the sheet down
  again.
           The Club will therefore be applying for a grant towards
  the cost of
  (a)   painting the external steelwork
  (b)      blast cleaning the steelwork which was worst affected
           by rust.
  (c)      completely new flashings over the bottom boom of the
           main trusses of a kind which will shed the rain and
           can be easily taken off for future painting.
  (d)   placing of the seal between all roof sheets.


           For your information the total cost of all this work
  including professional fees will be in excess of £60,000.
  This does not include the cost of the internal painting for
  which the Club will not be applying for a grant.        It is
EASTWOOD f t PARTNERS




 regarded as routine maintenance.
        It will be very much appreciated if the County Council
 can certify., that in its opinion the items of work (a) , (b),
 '(c) and (d) set out above were essential in the interests
 of ground safety and that they would have been made a requirement
 of the next    annual safety certificate if they had not been
 carried out.


                            Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr. M.P. Robins.

Dear Nr. Robins,
               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                 Segregation work at Leppinos Lane
     The segregation of supporters at the Lepplngs Lane
end of the ground was first proposed some tine before
September 1981. We do not know the exact date but the
original request that schemes be looked at was made by
South Yorkshire Police In the days when Mr. England was
the Club Secretary. Some rough outline sltbenes were
prepared at that time but the work did not proceed.
     Zn February this year the matter was raised again
and more schemes devised. Approval of a scbane was
given by SYCC in May. Shortly after that another, much
less expensive scheme was put forward. After agreeing
several matters of detail with SYCC and the Club,
construction work eventually started on 22 July* 1985.
The work is now almost complete.
     Enclosed are copies of the following documents
relating to the segregation work*-
     a)   Our letter dated 9 April,to SYCC.
     b)    Their reply dated 2 Hay.
     e)    Our letter dated 8 May to SYCC.

           Bill of Quantities received from Gleeson
           $Bkeffield) Ltd.
     The scheme involved the alteration of existing toilets,
the provision of new ladies toilets and refreshment
facilities because segregating walls prevented access to t
the existing toilets and refreshment bars by either the
hose or visiting spectators.
     Also included in the Contract were various items of
ground safety work. These are items 6 and 8, page 7/1 of
the Bill of Quantities, items 1 to 4, page 8/1 for the
repair of barriers on Spion Kop which failed the load test
earlier this year and items 1 to 3, page 9/1.

  Note of a Meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) held at
  the Police Sports and Social Club, Niagara Sheffield, on 13th November, 1985

              R.   Woodhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service.)


  1 .____Purpose of Meeting

   The purpose of the meeting was to consider the response to be given to the
   proposals outlined in the letter dated 25th October, 1985 and plans received
^ f r o m Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
   in c r e a s e d capacity for the Spion Kop and consequent additional exit routes.
     ptline details of the roof to be erected over the Spion Kop had also been
 f   rovided.

  2.     Disabled Facilities

  The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of the suggestions
  proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled. If the disabled
  continued to be accommodated in front of the North Stand, they would still
  be in the "firing line" of mis-aimed shots and any clear sheeting over the
  top of the area they occupied could constitute an unacceptable hazard to
  persons who might vacate the North Stand in an emergency situation by
  clintoing over the front wall of the stand onto the pitch perimeter. It was
  accepted that the means    of escape did not provide for this to bedone, but
  it had to be recognised    that in practice this was a real possibility. The
  structural strengphof such a structure would also be something of a problem.
  The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled in front of the perimeter
   fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) was also
^unacceptable for the reasons stated by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

 ( j / B t i e suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
 flower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
   to provide, say, a two-tier level landing on which to accoiranodate the disabled,
   with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch perimeter fence in
   front of this area could be removed, and the disabled would continue to gain
   access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the North Stand as at present.
   This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
   toilets under the rebuilt terracing of the Spion Kop.

   The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.

    IT WAS AGREED that the proposals for the disabled, as now
   .outlined by the Police     representatives, should be supported and
     transmitted to Messrs .' Eastwood & Partners as the views of
    the Officer Working Party, subject to there being no obstruction of exit
    routes and flows.

    3.   Enlarged Spion Kop

   The Fire Service and the Building Authority agreed that calculations showed


                                                                  DOCUMENT No.
    that the enlarged Spion Kop would provide for an increase of some 5,Q00
    spectators on the present capacity of 16,850, and that the number of exit
    widths required to achieve evacuation was 46. The proposals to increase the
g-pitunnel exit on the north side of the Kop to 8 clear units and to provide a
    complete new six unit staircase on the south side were regarded as acceptable.
    As when the original calculations had been made, the units of exit width
    included the emergency gates in the pitch perimeter fence, but it was cons­
    idered that landings in front of these gates should be constructed (as has
    been done at Bramall Lane).

   IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, the proposals from the
   enlarged Spion Kop submitted by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners were generally
   acceptable:-

          (a) adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the
              upper rear and the new south side exit routes:
          (b) to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents'
              toilets and the new ladies' toilets in the new six unit staircase
              on the south side;
          (c) to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
              gates in the pitch perimeter fence;
          (d) to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
               the south side and on the Penistone Road side;
          (e) until acceptable alternatives are available,    the new exit gates to
              be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement under the control of
               stewards.

   4 .Roofing of Spion Kop
    _




   Whilst it was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals hadbeen
   supplied to date, the Building Authority pointed out that the plans showed
   that the gables were not lined.

    IT WAS AGREED that this should be pointed out to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
    as well as the fact that should any of the proposed works on enlarging or
    roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season, it will be
    a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to prevent
    unauthorised access.

    5.     Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

 (^Hie Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of
    spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

    It was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the physical restraints
    to achieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present
    position to continue.

    6 .___ Duties of Stewards Booklet

    IT WAS AGREED that the draft of a Booklet prepared by the South Yorkshire Police
    outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and should be distributed
    to designated grounds for the information and guidance of stewards employed at
    such grounds. Factors peculiar to particular grounds could, of course, be
    added if considered appropriate.

     7.    Spot Checks at Designated Grounds

    The Fire Service reported on the success of the recent spot check carried out

                                               .2 .
  at the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club in conjunction with the
  Police and the Building Authority, and reported that the Divisions of the
-—Brigade were being asked to carry out similar spot check s at designated
  grounds in their areas.

 IT WAS AGREED that such spot checks were essential to ensure that the required
 standards were being maintained by the Clubs.

         TO:            §®cretaries_of_Football_League_Clubs


         Dear Sir,

         Following lengthy discussions between The Football Association
         and The Football League, we are now able to send you, over our
         joint signatures, a revised Memorandum on Crowd Management.

         This document sets out to amplify and clarify the responsibilities
         of Clubs in relation to this most difficult problem. Both our
         bodies are fully aware of the enormous amount of time, money and
         energy expended by our Clubs in ensuring that the public can
         attend matches in safety.   With the eyes of the world on us,
         however/ we cannot afford to relax for one moment.

         We ask you to study the Memorandum in great detail. Failure to
         act on any of the recommendations may be taken into account should
         a Club subsequently be charged with misconduct under Football
         Association Rules 23 and 24.                      .     .

                                                                     !            Yours faithfully,

'lEASON 1985/1986 AND UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE


A.           ADMISSION OF SPECTATORS

             1. Clubs must, in consultation with the Police and visiting Club, consider
                whether any natch should be made "all ticket".
                a» If a match i5 mad# "all ticket" the hoaae Club shall decide, in
                   consultation with the Police and visiting Club, how many tickets,
                   if any, shall be allocated to the visiting Club*
                b. Under no circumstances should tickets- be sold on the day of the
                   match. Maximum publicity should be given to this fact, in the
                   areas of both Clubs.
  A             c. Clubs are entirely responsible for the distribution of tickets
  w                allocated to them and must take all possible steps to ensure that
                   tickets are not sold to supporters of the opposing team.

                d. Ticket sales should be restricted to two per person.

             2. Clubs must give serious consideration to restricting admission to
                part-of their ground to "members only".
             3* The Football Association may order any match to be "all ticket" or
                 "members only" and restrict the distribution of tickets in any way
                 it deems appropriate.
 B»          PRIOR PLANNING
                                                        i
             1. Clubs must, in addition to the above, undertake detailed liason with
                 the Police, opposing Club, rail and coach operators and supporters'
 A              Travel Clubs at least 10 days before a match to determine the likely
I               movements of spectators and any other relevent matters. In the cases
                 of Cup ties, due consideration must be given, at the time of the
                 Draw, to possible replay arrangements.
             2. The number of Police and Stewards to operate at each match must be
                agreed with the Police

             3. Clubs should consider, in the interests of control at particular

               6. Wherever possible, segregation should be effected by permanent
                  structures such as wall, barriers or fences. Only in
                  exceptional circumstances should Police be called upon
                  to form a "human" barrier.
               7. Double barriers and walkway systems should be installed to
                  allow the Police to reinforce segregation and to gain access
                  to terracing or seating should the need arise.
               8. Spectators must not be able to circulate freelybetween

                  moat, double-barrier, wall or other system capable of
                  denying access to spectators. Any form of protection must
                  incorporate an adequate number of exits, manned at all times,
                  to allow access to the Field of Play in emergencies.
               3. The Football Association may instruct a Club to install such
                  a fence, moat, or barrier, subject to any Designation order
                  under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act which may be in force
                  at the Club.
               4. Clubs must provide adequate protection for players and officials
                  entering and leaving the Field.

 ^     a)   There is no doubt that the Kop is covered by the Building
^           Regulations and that we shall need Building Regulations
            approval. However, there has effectively been no change
                    in the 1985 Regulations.
                    Even if there were a change in Regulations, it is obviously
                    commonsense that facilities for the diabled apply to the
                    ground as a whole and not to one particular building. At
                    the moment there are perfectly adequate facilities under
                    the overhang of the roof of the North stand. There is a
                    level approach. The disabled are under the cover, of the
                    cantilever roof. Any facilities at the front of the Kop
                    would be less sheltered from the rain, and more prone to
                     disruption by the fans immediately behind. It is not a good
                     place at all for disabled people.

b)   We have no intention of entering into further discussion
     regarding a way in which the 50 or any other number of
     places could be provided under the new Kop. There are
     adequate facilities for the ground as a whole at the
     moment.

c)   The Building Authority clearly has no knowledge whatever
     of the cost, of football ground structures. The extra
     £500,000 is made up of several components. Firstly,
     there is a steel frame supporting a precast concrete
     deck, some of it at very high level. Very expensive
     piling is required for the columns of this steel frame
     because most of the columns are high up on the bank.
     Secondly, the main roof girders have to carry very much
     more load, because of the larger area. The spans of the
     radial girders are also that much greater so they have
     to be stronger. The cost per square foot of all the
     covered space is increased. In addition the framing and
     sheeting at the rear of the stand are on average very
     much higher and, therefore, more expensive. Thirdly,
     the addition of the extra spectators has resulted in
     the need for complete re-organisation of exit routes with
     considerable extra expense. New turnstiles are needed and
     additional toilet accommodation.. A re-examination of our
     figures shows the additional cost for the 5,000 extra places
     is about £560,000. To simply roof over the existing Kop with
     no extension would reduce the cost of the scheme to less than
     a half of that for the enlarged Kop. I trust we shall have
     no more of this uninformed opinion.
     This extra money is being provided to achieve 5000
     extra spectators. If we give up 1000 of those spaces to
     provide for say 100 disabled plus 100 helpers then over
     £100,000 of the extra cost of the enlarged Kop has to be set
     against the disabled accommodation. The Building Authority
     must accept that the extra £580,000 the Club intends to spend
     is to cater for those days when the ground is full or nearly full
     to capacity.
                                                                SHEST


EASTWOOD f t PARTNERS

     With regard to the proposal that a glazed shelter might
     be placed over the disabled accommodation in front of the
     North stand, it was not our intention that any seats within
     the North stand would have an obscured view although a few
     of the spectators might have to look through the glass of
     the canopy to see the near touchline. There are materials
     available for the glazed roof which might prove to be safe for
     that purpose.   ,'
     I regard it as regrettable that there has been such a
     negative attitude on this particular matter. We have not,
     of course, taken the design study any further with regard
     to the possibility of a covering for part of the disabled
     area nearest to the Kop end of the North stand, but would
     reconsider the matter if the Working Party has a change of
     heart.

     Enlarged Kop
          With regard to the request for a barrier to protect
     the ladies toilet, it has perhaps not been realised that
     there is handrailing already in place. A gap will be
     created for an entrance to the ladies toilet. The
     final version of the proposed arrangements is shown on
     the attached print of drawing number 6648/53. The new
     brickwork is shown shaded.

      Roofing the Kop
            We are really surprised by the suggestion that the
      steel frame of the gable walls and presumably the back of the
      stand should be sheeted over. It is a common feature of
      every stand structure that I know of in any football ground
      in the country that the sheeting rails and other bracing
      members are exposed on the inner face. In older structures
      they are generally only at 1.2 m centres but in more modern
      structures they are generally at 1.8 m centres. With the
       1.8 m spacing it would be extremely difficult indeed to
       climb up except adjacent to a column. However, I know of
       no instance where the sheeting rails of an existing stand
       are regarded as being such a hazard that they should be boxed
       in, with an inner skin as well as an outer skin. I find
       it very surprising that this matter is being pressed.

          This correspondence on these matters leads me to believe
     that there would be great advantage if the Club's advisers were
     present for part of each of the meetings of the Officer Working
     Party. Matters of this kind need to be discussed round the
     table rather than in lengthy correspondence. We can be of great
     assistance in providing information which may result in fewer
     matters becoming contentious. It is also inevitable that we
     send you plans which are in some ways preliminary in order
     to give the opportunity to comment at an early stage. The
     plans are incomplete in some respects and this may lead to
     misunderstanding of what is intended or a lack of appreciation
     of the thinking behind what is proposed. There is also the
                 **
     difficultyjan the light of comments received from the Club, and
     indeed those from the Working Party, quite significant
     changes may take place at a very late stage. It is desirable
     that any late changes be dealt with in as short a time as
     possible. In this regard I now enclose six prints of each of
     our drawings numbers 7C, 8A, 9A, 17A and 56. As the Club
     will be wishing to place an order for the new building not
     later than the end of January, it may be that an oral presentation
     to your Working Part of what is proposed might be beneficial
      all round.

                        Yours faithfully.

Dear Sir,

As a result of several incidents during the recent past, involving casualties
within Sports areas, I have decided to delegate one of my Officers the
specific task of liaison with the Football Clubs within the South Yorkshire
boundaries.

This Officer will have the task to ensure that advice and, if necessary,
training can be provided by this Service to members of your staff. It is also
to be his responsibility to ensure that the South Yorkshire Metropolitan
Ambulance Service are totally aware of the geography of your ground and of any
Incident Plans which you may have drawn up in order to ensure the safety of the
general public.

Obviously, in order for this task to be successful it is necessary for you to
accept,in principle, our involvement and I should be grateful if you would
consider this proposal and communicate with me when you have made a decision.

I will ensure that if you require a visit or any form of advice associated to
this suggestion an Officer will be made available to meet with you or your
colleagues to explain our intentions.

I look forward to hearing from you with any comments you may wish to make.

Yours faithfully,

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 7/1986

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT 1985

Introduction

1. HOC 54/85 and 5/1986 were copied to Chief Executives of
Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs in view of the
forthcoming transfer to them of responsibility in the Metropolitan
counties and Greater London for the administration of the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA).  The purpose of this circular is to
advise successor authorities of the changes to the SSGA brought
about by the Local Government Act 1985 (LGA) and to give guidance
on discharging these responsibilities*  It is not intended to affect
any internal or locally agreed arrangements which may be in train to
ensure that all those who have an interest in securing safety at
sports grounds are fully consulted.

SSGA 1975

2.  The SSGA gave effect to the main recommendations contained in
the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds which
was prepared by Lord Wheatley following the serious accident at
Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971.

3.     The main provisions of the Act are:

       a.  A power, exercisable by the Secretary of State, to
       designate sports stadia with a capacity for more than
       10,000 spectators. Once designated, a stadium will require
       a safety certificate from the local authority.

       b.  An obligation on the local authority to issue such
       certificates.
       c.  A discretion for the local authority to set terms
       and conditions under the certificate with the object
       of securing a reasonable degree of safety for spectators.
       Safety certificates are of 2 kinds - firstly, the general
       safety certificate (the main form of control) and,       *
       secondly, the special safety certificate (for occasions
       or activities not covered by the general certificate).

       d.  A right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in
       relation to the issue of safety certificates and their
       contents, the procedure for which is set out in
       regulations made under s.6(1) of the Act.

       e.  Rights of various interested bodies (police, building
       authorities or, in the Metropolitan county areas after
       "abolition11, fire authorities) to consultation, access to
       grounds and information and to the appeals procedure.

       f.  An emergency procedure for      restricting the admission
       of spectators to a wider range      of sports grounds than
       those to which the designation      provisions apply, if the
       risk to spectators is seen (by      the courts) as justifying
       this.

       g.  Powers of entry and inspection to sports grounds;
       and prescribed penalties for offences under the Act.

A sports ground is, broadly speaking, any place where sports or
other competitive activities take place in the open air and where
accommodation has been provided for spectators.   A sports stadium is
a sports ground where   accommodation for  spectators wholly or
substantially surrounds the area used for the activities taking
place therein.

LGA 1985

4.  The combined effect of s . 16 and Schedule 8 paragraph 7 of the
LGA is to transfer to Metropolitan District Councils and London
Boroughs the functions, duties and powers as the local authority
responsible for administering the SSGA in place of the Metropolitan
County Councils and Greater London Council.    A summary check list of
these responsibilities is contained at Annex A for ease of reference.

5.  Paragraph 7(3) of     Schedule 8 of the      LGA redefines "local
authority" in England     and Wales for the      purposes of the SSGA as
meaning:

     • a.  in Greater London, the London Borough Council or
       the Common Council of the City of London;

       b.  in England, in the Metropolitan counties,         the
       district council;

       c.  in England outside Greater London and the
       Metropolitan counties, or in Wales, the county council

6.  In order to avoid any anomaly or duplication arising out of the
Metropolitan District Co un ci ls1 and London Bo r o u g h s 1 responsibilities
      Guidance to the SSGA procedures

‘
2^9-   A copy of the SSGA and the Regulations (Statutory Instrument
   1263 1976) are enclosed with this circular.   A detailed description
   of the Act and its provisions is contained at Annex B.  The Regu­
   lations set out the procedures and time limits associated with
   safety certificate applications and appeals.   These same regulations
   also empower local authorities to determine fees in respect of
   applications for the issue or amendment of safety certificates. A
   guide to the procedure for the issue of a general safety certificate
   is at Annex C.  Similarly, the procedure for the issue of a special
   safety certificate is at Annex D.

      • 1-0. The foxiuwing points are hignxighteci as' Deing'oi   pa rticular
       potential interest to local authorities:

           a.  Procedure under s. 10.  Paragraph 21 of Annex B refers.
           Authorities may wish to note that this procedure can be
           applied to all sports grounds within the meaning of the Act,
           not just to stadia.   It is hoped that authorities will not
           feel inhibited from invoking the procedure, as necessary,
( ^       where they perceive   the risks to be such that urgent action
           is required to provide reasonable safety for spectators.

          b.  The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) (The
          Green Guide).  Attention is drawn to paragraphs 5 and 6 of
          Annex B and paragraph 3 of Annex C.  Authorities will no
          doubt bear in mind the contents of paragraph 4 of HOC 54/1985
          dealing with action on the Interim Report of the Inquiry
          contains additional recommendations on the content and
          structuring of the Green Guide which will be revised as soon
          as possible.  In the meantime the existing guide, a copy of
          which is enclosed, may be used until such time as the revised
          version is available.

      Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds

    11.      The Final Report of Mr Justice Popp-lewell1s Committee of Inquiry
    into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds was published on
    16 January 1986 (Command 9710).       A separate Home Office circular,
r^piumber 5/1986, was sent to local authorities - including Metropolitan
" D i s t r i c t Councils and London Borough Councils - on 20 January 1986,
    giving details of the G ov er nm ent’s response to the safety .recommend­
    ations contained in the Report, and next steps.

      Other

      12.  A list of designated stadia for England and Wales is attached at
      Annex E.  Management of those stadia in Metropolitan counties and
      Greater London have been informed of the change in responsibility for
      administration of the SSGA and have been advised to copy applications
      for special safety certificates or amendments to existing general
      certificates to successor authorities (see Annex F).

       13- This circular is copied to Chief Executives of County Councils,
        Secretaries of the successor authority coordinating committees, and
        to Chief Fire Officers for information.  Paragraph 10 is of
        particular relevance.
                                   Ty i O


E.R.
   as "Building Authority", paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 8 of the LGA
   redefines, for the purposes of the SSGA, "building authority" in
   England and Wales as meaning:

          a.  in England, outside Greater London, and the
          Metropolitan counties, or in Wales, the district
          council.

   The effect of this, together with amendments to Sections 3(3), 4(7)
   and (8), 5(5), 10(4) and 11 of the SSGA resulting from paragraph 7(1)
   of Schedule 8 of the LGA, is that in Metropolitan counties and
   Greater Londo n, w h e T e - the; "building aaUioriCy1‘! and "local authority”
   are synonymous, the local authority is not required to refer safety
   certificate applications to the building authority or consult it
   about the terms and conditions of a certificate.            Similarly the
   building authority in these areas does not have the status of
   "interested party" and has no need of the right to authorise entry
   and inspection of a sports ground because these powers are vested in
   it as the local authority.
                                                                                    -'■'N
   7.  An additional change brought about by paragraph 7(1) affects the '
   role and status of the Fire Authority in Greater London and the
   Metropolitan counties.  The converse of paragraph 6 applies in
   respect of the Fire Authority which, from 1 April 1986, has the status
   of "interested party" in Metropolitan counties and Greater London.
   In these areas the local authority is required to refer safety
   certificate applications to the Fire Authority and consult it about
   the terms and conditions of a safety certificate; and the Fire
   Authority will have the right to authorise entry and inspection of
   a sports ground.  The reason for these changes is that the newly
   constituted fire authorities will not (as in the past) be the same
   as the local authority.

   Transitional Arrangements

   8.   Under article 2 of the Local Government Reorganisation (Transitional
   Provisions) Order 1985 (SI 1985 No 1781), London Borough Councils and
   Metropolitan District Councils will acquire certain anticipatory powers
   including powers in respect of safety certificates for sports grounds )’
   The provisions of SI 1985/1781 were explained in DOE circular LGA(L)
    (DOE) 13/LGA(MC)(DOE ) 16 of 26 November 1985. The Secretary of State
   takes the view that Metropolitan County Councils and the GLC are not
   empowered to issue new safety certificates or amend existing safety
   certificates to take effect on or after 1 April 1986: SI 1 9 8 5 / 1 7 8 1
   therefore allows successor authorities to consider, before 1 April
   applications for certificates to come into effect on or after 1 April.
   Successor authorities will therefore wish to ensure that they are kept
   informed of the progress of safety certificate applications or amend-
   ments to existing certificates now under consideration by the Metro-
   politan County Councils or GLC. Much of this information will auto­
   matically have come to successor authorities in their present role as
   building authorities but they may nonetheless wish to establish
   early contact with the current 'certificating' authority to ensure a
   smooth transfer of responsibility from 1 April 1 9 8 6 without impairing
   the safety cover afforded by the certification process. In this
   context successor authorities will no doubt wish to bear in mind
   that applications for special safety certificates for events on or
   after 1 April 1986 m a y require advance consideration if a certificate
   is to be issued in time. Similarly, successor authorities will doubtless
   wish to be acquainted with any other action or initiatives currently
   in hand by the present certificating authority in respect of sDorts
   grounds in their area.                                             H

      *                        Safety of Spores Grounds Act 1975

  atroduction

  he Panel will recall that a report was submitted to the March 1386 Meeting

 overing the general safety of sports grounds legislation as it affects the City

 louncil.        This follow-up report aims to deal in detail with the current

 iituatiirj in Sheffield as inherited from the South Yorkshire County Council.

 Chere are 2 sports grounds currently subject to the legislation - Sheffield

 Wednesday Football Club and Sheffield United Football Club; the Owlerton Sports

 '(       iium is likely to be made subject to the legislation shortly.

 ~ ^piield Wednesday Football Club — Hillsborough

The Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited was designated as requiring a

Safety Certificate in August 1978 and such a Certificate was issued by the

County Council on 21st December, 1979.         The Stadium is currently undergoing

major works which, when complete, will form a roof over the Spion Kop and thus

substantially•improve the accommodation for spectators.

Sheffield United Football Club, Bramall Lane

The Club was designated as requiring a certificate in August 1984 but to date


(•* certificate     has not been issued as there are outstanding works to be

apipleted. The County Council took the view that the certificate should only be

issued as and when the Ground was up to the appropriate safety standard and not

before.        This procedure effectively insured that the terms of the Safety

Certificate ware not breached as soon as it was issued.         It is hoped that the

Council will be in a position to issue a certificate before the start of the

1986/87 season.                    *

Owlerton Sports Stadium

It is understood that the Home Secretary will shortly be designating the Stadiua.

as requiring a Safety Certificate in accordance with the Popplewell Report

recommendations.         It will, therefore, be necessary to arrange for a full

inspection of the Stadium in the next few weeks to find out what works are
      going to be required to raise the standard of the Stadium to appropriate levels.
      h:' '
      The Panel is probably aware that the Stadium is Council owned but is currently

      leased to the Owlercon Sports Stadium Limited.    This Lease will expire on 1st

      November, 1987.

      Safety Certificate Standard Conditions

      At the moment the Safety Conditions attached to Safety Certificates are

     'standardised throughout South Yorkshire and-both the Folios and-Ch* Firs Ser»ics

      have -indicated that they would wish this situation to continue for reasons of

      administrative simplicity.   The Conditions do, however, give some cause for
r     concern, as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.   The

     ^^rafting of these Conditions is of particular importance as it is a serious

      criminal offence to contravene any of them punishable by the Statutory Maximum

      Fine (Currently £2,000) or 2 years imprisonment or both.


      It is proposed to re-draft the Certificate conditions, where appropriate, and to

      submit thee to the Panel for approval.   The Sheffield Wednesday Certificate

     would then be replaced in accordance with Section 4 (1 ) (b) of the Act.    The

      Sheffield United Certificate could then be issued with the new conditions before

      the start of the 1986/87 season.    The re-drafted conditions would, of course, be
(.
      submitted to the Fire Service, the Police and Building Surveyor for comment;

 ^fc>ther authoritiesin South Yorkshire could also be involved’ in this process.

      Existing Administrative Arrangements

      The County Council system for administering the Act is based on 2 main

      components - (a) bi-annual inspections of the Stadium; and (b) meetings of an

      officer working party.   The bi-annual inspections consist of representatives

      from all the interested authorities and involve thorough inspections of the

      Stadia and the identifying of any defects.    These defects are at the time of the

      visit brought to the attention of the certificate holder and its technical

      representative if one is present.    Depending on the nature of the faults found

      (if any) steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Certificate Holder
to rectify them or so arrange matters that no risk to the public occurs.      The

Working Party consists of representatives from the Police, Fire Service,

Building Surveyors and the County Council - it considers in detail various

matters (such as the Spion Kop development at Sheffield Wednesday Football

Ground) and also any outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.       The

Working Party is effectively a corordinating body which attempts to ensure that

a balanced and consistent approach is maintained to current issues at the Sports

Grounds.    Any recommendations it makes are subject to approval by this Panel.

The Health and Safety Executive

Recommendation 9 of The Popplewell Committee's Interim Report read as follows

1“There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety Executive and

the Fire Authorities and Local Authorities as to how best to co-ordinate and

communicate their inspections and reports”.    Bearing this in mind the local

office of the Health and Safety Executive was invited to participate in the

administrative system for safety at sports grounds.    This invitation was

declined.    The Executive will apparently take no direct part in the

Certification system.

In view of this problem the Home Office was contacted and the position

explained; it appears that negotiations are unifer way between the Home Office

and the HSE about Popplewell's recommendation but as yet there has been no

useful outcome.

In these circumstances the Council could keep the Health and Safety Executive

informed of all developments in Sheffield and to invite their comments on them.

It would then be the responsibility of the Executive to decide whether or not to

respond.

Fees

The basis on which fees may be charged is set out in Regulation 14 of the Safety

of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 which states "14.    A local authority may

determine the fees to be charged in respect of applications for the issue or
    amendment of safety certificates but such fees shall not in a particular case

    exceed an amount commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done."       The

     South Yorkshire County Council did-not fix any fees under the Regulation

    apparently as a matter of policy and the Panel is therefore asked to decide

    which of the following options to adopt:- (a) state as a matter of. policy that

    no fees will be charged in respect of Safety of Sports Grounds legislation or

     (b) decide in principle to fix fees and to ask for a report back on the coscs

    to the Council.

    Conclus ion

    The    Panel is asked to:-

^[a)       Note the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

           County Council and authorise its continuation for the time being;

     (b)   Note the position of the Health and Safety Executive and request the Head

            of Administration and Legal Department to keep the Executive informed of

            all matters relating to sports ground safety;

     (c)    Request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to draft new

            safety certificate conditions in consultation with the appropriate

            authorities approval by the Council;

     (d)    Either resolve that no fees will be charged under the legislation or

P           request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to report on the

            Council's costs in this respect.

 Correct Money Turnstiles         South Yorkshire Police requested that the Club have
                                  "Correct Money Only" turnstiles for entry onto the Kop
                                  to speed up entry time. R. H. Chester agreed to look
                                  into the possibility in relation to the number of turn­
                                  stiles available.

     Keys Around Ground           South Yorkshire Police requested that the keys
                                  allowing access around the Ground be standardised.
                                  R. H. Chester agreed to do this and to provide
                                  8 sets for the use of South Yorkshire Police.


           Plan of Ground         South Yorkshire Police requested that the update plans
                                  of the Ground showing positions of new turnstiles
                                  should also show the positions of fire points.
                                  R. H. Chester confirmed that this would be done.

        Before the start of next season I want you to arrange a Seminar for
stewards and programme sellers so that they can be informed exactly of their
duties.
        It is important that you draw up a list of stewards and their
respective duties, and similarly with programme sellers. In the case of
programme sellers they must be instructed that this job is a selling job and
they must go out to our supporters to sell and make some vocal contribution to
it. They must be strategically placed and their performance monitored.
        Many of the-above requirements apply also to stewards.
         Do you think it would be rewarding if other people such as our
turnstile operators were also properly instructed along these lines?

    Dear

    I refer to our visit of today concerning                              the proposals for a meeting
    prior to the start of the new season with                             a view to considering a
    number of aspects which were noted during                             last season. As agreed,
    for your information I set out details of                              the points we would wish to
    discuss:-

     1.      Stewards

     2.      Access to ground - turnstiles, Leppings Lane end in relation
             to away supporters

     3.       Sale of programmes outside the ground -                               •

     4.       Security in West Stand to prevent supervision of used tickets
              being re—used                 ^ '••• "*■*  *.   •

     5.       Movable barrier in West Stand

     6.       Feasibility of correct money turnstiles in Penistone Road " v*--'.*'
                                                                                   I *.•— * '
     7.       Common keys for locks in ground                         —     v' —                *

      8.      Examination and marking of fire points in ground -                                                            *

      9.       Evaluation of closed circuit television.* -

      Perhaps it would be appropriate for the meeting to take place during
      this month and I should be pleased to-receive from you details of when
      you may be available.

               EVACUATION OF SPORTS STAOIA
               I have pleasure in                               enclosing a copy of Appendix *L '                                      of our Force Standing Order
               on the policing of                               football matches.   You will see                                       that it incorporates most of
               the points made by                               Mr. Justice Popplewell following                                       the Bradford Fire.
               I hope that you can find the time to read through the Appendix prior to our
               meeting at Bramall Lane at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday 10 July 1986, as obviously it
               will assist our deliberations and hopefully, agreement, in resp&ct of crowd safety
               during the forthcoming football season.
               I look forward to meeting you on Thursday but if there is any point on which you
               require further clarification, please do not- hesitate to contact myself or
               Inspector Godwin at West Bar Police Station.

Dear Dick,
                             Home Office Document on Fire Safety ana
                                    Safety at Sports Venues
                        I have read through the part of the document which deal*
 with Sports Grounds. I do not see any grounds for objecting to
 any of the recommendations. There will be little if any change in
►the procedure already established at Hillsborough. The document
 envisages that far more grounds for various .ports will be designated
    but in appropriate circumstances the procedures will not be so
    onerous as those relating to Hillsborough.             However, as it is a
    •top* ground we cannot expect that there will be *uch relaxation
    compared with the present arrangement*.
             There is a welcome statement on page 11 that due accoun
    .hould be taken of the -need to keep the cost, to club, and local
" 'authorities to reasonable proportions.              There are also various,
    references to Safety Certificates ref lectin, the
    each particular ground and the number of spectators who are likely
    to attend <see page 14).   These words may be useful to us in
    future, although we can expect to have more stringent retirements
    compared with some of the smaller clubs.
             It is comforting to know that the new Green Guide will not
    become a slitutory code, and will continue to be subject to
                                3 ? ‘7




interpretation•
         The reference to prohibition notices by either the fire
authority or the local authority on page 19 may       concern to
some clubs. But in paragraph 2.38 on page 20 there is a clear
implication that it is only necessary to reduce the risk to
an acceptable level, rather than trying to remove all risk. This
wording will help curb excessive demands, and may be useful to
us sometimes in negotiations.
         1 am returning the document herewith.

                          Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Chester

Following your recent telephone conversation with Mr Wilkinson on 28th July 1986
in regard to your Club supplying passes for Officers from the South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service, I am submitting t h e following information for
you to discuss with your fellow directors.

On the 16th July 1986 Mr Wilkinson visited yourClub along with twoother Officers
from the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and Sergeant Godhard
of South Yorkshire Police. The meeting was held with Mr Ward, Senior Groundsman*
After touring your complex and discussing evacuation plans with South Yorkshire
Police, it was felt that the Ambulance Service would normally only become involved
in any events after they had already occurred and therefore, slight delays could
be experienced on occasions in responding to the incident. To avoid this I would
ask if two passes could be supplied to the Ambulance Service which would enable
us to ensure that an Ambulance Officer was in your ground at all home fixtures.

There would be no cost to the Club for this facility, and it would improve ground
safety. In the event of any untoward occurrence my Officers would be in a position
to identify problems prior to them happening and would therefore be in a much
better position to respond to any emergency.

If you require any further information then pleasedo not hesitate tocontact
Mr Wilkinson on Rotherham 361581 extension 259, who will ask one of our
Offciers responsible for the safety of your ground to contact you.

Yours sincerely _
         /■'

         Dear Sir,
                                Safety of Sportsgrounds Act                                          1975
                   Application for Increased Crowd Capacity                                          on the Spion Kop
                 I am grateful to Mr. Bownes for sending us                                          a copy of your
         letter to the Club dated 14 August. This enabled                                            me to see it over
         the weekend, and to do a little research into the                                           points you have
         raised.
               The proposed meeting at 2.00 p.m, on 21 August is convenient
    IjJ for the Club officers. It is likely that the Chairman will be present,
        but he is indisposed at the moment. A director with special
        responsibility for the ground, Mr. Keith Addy and the club secretary
        will also attend, and I will hope to deal with the technical side
        assisted by John Strange.
               Turning now to the matters raised in your, letter, I think it
        appropriate to make a preliminary response, so that the members of
        the Working Party may be informed of our thoughts. No doubt there
        will be fuller discussion at the meeting on Thursday.
               I will use the same nomenclature a to f, as is used in your
        letter.
          (a)    The statement is made that the new terrace construction does
          not comply with the plans submitted to the Council for Building
          Regulations Approval.
                 As far as I can see it is incorrect to say that our drawings

 do not show the steepest slopes.
         I should explain that the submission of plans was
 complicated by changes of mind which were forced on the Club
 by circumstances beyond their control. The intention was to
 redevelop the Kop broadly as the present scheme. They were
 informed at a very late stage that the level of grant which
 had been expected may not be forthcoming, because of demands
 from other clubs following the Bradford fire. The scheme was
 therefore changed in January of this year, to roofing with no
 extra accommodation.     All our drawings had to be changed.
 The contract was let in early February and we sent a very full
 set of drawings and calculations to the Council on 24 February
 1986.     Following a good run in the cup the Board were able
 to revert to the original scheme in March.     By that time the
 steel frame for the roof only scheme was ordered and we had
 to make use of it. The columns and the bracing arrangement
 against wind now had to be modified to receive the new terracing.
 In effect a third scheme had to be prepared utilising steel which
 was more suitable for the roofing only version.     Thus, we had
 to do completely new calculations and drawings in March and April.
 This necessitated a re-submission for building regulations approval.
         However, that re-submission showed the steepest slope
 which occurs on the terracing, and the drawings submitted in
  March and April show accurately what has been built.
          I enclose a phbto-copy of our letter of 30 April which was
  the one which accompanied most of the drawings relating to the
  new inclined terracing. It will be seen that it lists the drawings
  which were enclosed, five of them, Nos. 45, 47, 48, 49 and 51,
  being drawings of the Kop terracing. Prints of these five drawings
  are enclosed.
          It will be seen that each of these drawings has a small
  triangular diagram above the steps which gives the rise and the
  tread of the steps, and hence indicates the overall slope.
                                                              SHEET   3.


EASTWOOD » PARTNERS




         Four of the drawings, Nos. 45, 47, 48 and 51 show
 sections through the main part of the new deck and have a slope
 of 173/330 which is just over 27J°.     The drawing 49 shows a
 section through one of tise two •'wings’^at the back of the stand.
 This has a slope of 173/285 which is just over 31°.     The
 slope occurs everywhere in the wings, and there is nowhere
 on the Kop where a greater slope occurs. Thus it is not correct
 to say that the terrace 'does not comply with the plans
 submitted....... ' and 'in particular...... is now steeper'.
         We believe that because the City Council did not respond
 to the drawings which were sent on 30 April within the five
 weeks allowed, we have Building Regulations approval for the
 construction shown on those drawings.
         It is expected that this development is subject to the
 Safety of Sportsgrounds Act as well as the Building Regulations,
 but as the same officers advise the Council on both matters, there
 could now be a possibility of a charge of maladministration if the
 Council decides to restrict the crowd capacity in the Safety
 Certificate because of the slope of the terrace.
         With regard to possible danger,, the Green Guide clearly
 envisages 30° slopes because the spacing of crush barriers for
 such a slope is given in table 12.3.
         No doubt there will be discussion on this matter at
 the meeting on Thursday, but the slopes we had to use were
 determined by the very crude shape of the existing Kop. Matching
 the main new part of the terrace to the old part so as to give
 good sightlines determined the slope of 27°, to which we assume there
 is no objection. Because of the presence of Penistone Road the
 corner had to be swung round and this modified the slope in the
 wing areas to just over 31°.    We consider this difference of just
  over 1° to be acceptable bearing in mind the very good crush
  barrier arrangement and the excellent viewing which will stop the
  crowd craning forward and thus causing a surge when some exciting
  play takes place in the goal area (the viewing can only be judged
  by visiting the ground).

     (b)    The vertical steps from terrace level to the new gangway
     cam be measured in different ways depending on which foot it is
     assumed will be used to step down. As a result of observation
     at other grounds wh«re an ^exactly similar arrangement exists it is
     found that the spectator generally holds the rail with one hand
     and steps down with the opposite foot. This reduces the step to
     just over 1ft.   Even if he does not use the opposite foot he
^    still steps onto the higher step which is available.
'p'"         But if it is thought to be necessary, the addition of a
  G short length to the barrier running parallel to the gangway
     can direct the spectator a little further up the slope, so that
     he will automatically take a small step downward. This can be
     discussed with the Fire Service and the Building Control Department.
     Only one or two of the gangways need consideration.

      (c)    It has always been intended to sheet down to the ground
      level at the Ozzie Owl corner, but the precise detail had to wait
      until that part of the Kop was built, and the trees cleared. When the
      frame had been erected it was my view that it was preferable not to
      sheet to ground level for reasons which I have expressed to the
W     Working Party. As my view was not agreed the work is proceeding
      as was intended.

       (d)    We are a little surprised that the Building Control officer
       who has spotted a pre-cast step resting on (as we understand it)
       a bearing of 50mm instead of the intended 75mm did not point it out
       to either my resident engineer or to the contractor so that if there
       was need to take remedial action it could have been done there and
       then.
              However, we understand that it is one of the concrete steps
       which has a short span, and it rests on steel.    In that case it is
       probably incorrect to say that the seating is sub—standard. The
       Code of Practice to which we are working gives the Engineer
       discretion to reduce the step below 75mm.    (See attached, photocopy
       of clause 5.2.4.3).   Firstly the seating is subject to a permissible
       tolerance so this will reduce the 75mm.   Also this is a solid step

       with a full width of bearing to take the load. In other buildings,
       precast units are often narrow beams supporting wide* infill pots,
       and all the load is concentrated on the narrow beam. A smaller
       seating can clearly be permitted where the beam is of full width.
       If as we understand it the beam in question is of short span, which
       means the load at each end is small, I think it highly likely that
       when I know which one out of the approximately lOOO new steps
-<ixr
   , ^ has the smaller than specified seating I shall take the view that
       it is perfectly safe and no action is needed. If I think it necessary
       we can weld a small plate to the steel on which it rests to increase
       the bearing width, but this is very unlikely to be necessary.
              I am surprised that this matter has been raised in this way.

    (e)     The reference to the provision of a toilet and kiosk underneath
    the new terrace not featuring in the application is surprising. The
    word 'provision' makes it appear that these have been constructed
    as part of the scheme. They were built about three years ago. The
    work was not designed by us, but I know it was subject to building
    control from discussions I had with the Building Control Department
    at the time.
            The presence of the kiosk and the toilets was shown on various
    of our drawings. For example the drawing 6648/16 (a copy is enclosed)
    shows the way in which the foundations had to be orientated to miss
    the toilets and also the kiosk. This drawing was submitted for
    Building Regulations approval. Drawings 7 and 9 were issued for
    distribution to the Working Party together with others to explain
    our scheme, on 23 December 1985 (see last page of attached copy
    of my letter). These drawings each show parts of the toilets or
    of the kiosk protruding from under the stand (copies enclosed).
            The drawing No. 6648/9 showing the rear elevation of the stand,
    which was included with our planning application in July 1985 shows
    the upper part of the kiosk projecting into the sheeting.    Our
    drawing No. 6648/7 which was also distributed via the Working Party
     secretariat in December, 1985, shows the toilets and kiosk protruding
     from under the roof of the Kop
                                                                  $H«lT 6 -

               The Building Control department was visiting the site very
     frequently during late February and March, 1986, to watch the
     piles being installed immediately,alongside the toilets and the
     kiosk. Visits have taken place frequently since May.
               I am at a loss, therefore, to understand why this matter is
     being raised now. However, the kiosk is not used for storage.
     All saleable material is taken back to a central store after each
     game.      During a match the jgoods on sale consist of no more than
( p a c k e t s of crisps, and Bovril, tea and Coke served in paper cups.
 ^ The number of cups and packets of crisps is not great and there
     is no significant fire hazard.
               The kiosk performs exactly the same function as the several
     kiosks inside the south and north stands. These kiosks are also
     on exit routes, and have never been considered a hazard by the
     Fire Service.
               One matter which might cause concern is the fact that the
      roof of the kiosk is combustible. If this matter is considered
      critical, the Club would no doubt be prepared to put a fire resistant
      inner and outer skin on the roof.

 ^   If)     The discussion on evacuation times which has arisen in the
I£   last month was apparently sparked off by the Popplewell report
     recommendation No. 24. This says that the Green Guide should be
     revised to make it clear that the suggestion of an eight minute
     evacuation time is concerned with 'the effect of crowd turbulence
     on the rate of flow' which arises if there are delays in evacuating
     spectator accommodation.
             It may be that the wording of the Green Guide had not
     always been understood by other licensing authorities, but there
     was no misunderstanding on this matter in the South Yorkshire
     Working Party when the ground was granted its Safety Certificate
     in 1979. The calculated evacuation time for the Kop with its
     pre-certificate capacity of 20,000 (23,000 until the Ibrox disaster
     in 1971) had been about 16 minutes (or 181 minutes pre 1971).
      At that time there were far fewer crush barriers to control
      turbulence in the crowd, and the barriers were not so strong.

 The very experienced police officers on the South Yorkshire
 Working Party, who had been in attendance at games for many years,
 said they had never seen turbulence occur when the crowd was
 sufficient to give an evacuation time in excess of 8 minutes.
 It should be remembered that through the 1960's the attendances
 would he such that more than 11,000 people would be on the
 Kop at almost every game (this number could just get out in
 8 minutes with the exits as they were at that time).
         The present Chief Fire Officer, Mr. Harry Wright, was
 on the Working Party at the time. He requested an extra exit
 route from the very top of the Kop. This was constructed by the
 Club at a cost of £16,000 (1979 prices).      He was prepared to
 count the exits onto the pitch as part of the evacuation system
 in an emergency (each gate is controlled by a policeman). With
 these measures the evacuation time in an emergency was brought
 below eight minutes, and disregarding the gates onto the pitch the
 evacuation time in normal circumstances with a full Kop (16,850)
                3
 would be 11 /4 minutes (see attached extract from Minutes of
 Working Party dated 2 April 1979).
         The Fire Service at that time took the view that the very
 slight risk of turbulance (if there really is such a risk) could
 not justify greater expense to the Club. The Fire Service in
 its advisory role is always having to balance money against
 slight or very slight risk, and this was a calculated decision
 which Mr. H.E. Wright supported.
         I am a frequent attender at the ground. The police are
 there e v e r y week. There has never been an occurrence to my
 knowledge of turbulance associated with this 11/4 minute
 evacuation time in the seven years since the ground received
 its Safety Certificate. The police can give their own view.
         I know that at other grounds longer evacuation times have
 applied without there being the slightest trouble. For example,
  at Bramall Lane, the evacuation time was almost 20 minutes at
 the Bramall Lane end until the new exits were constructed onto
 Bramall Lane near the centre of the stand about three years ago.
 There had never been 'turbulance' of the kind envisaged in the
  Green Guide as far as I know.
         Further, in recent years various police forces have
  adopted a policy of keeping the gates closed at one end of the

  ground for 10 minutes or so after a match to keep the rival
  fans apart.- This puts the eight minute rule in perspective.
          The words 'eight minute rule' are not really correct
  of course. The Green Guide uses the words 'it is suggested'.
  It is not nearly so positive as it is about its other
  recommendations.
          With this as background the Club has been quite shocked
  by the suggestion that the gates onto the pitch should be ignored
  in the calculations of evacuation times, and that eight
  minutes should be achieved by means of ordinary exits. They
  feel this change of view cannot be justified. The fact that
  Popplewell has clarified what it is the Green Guide suggests
  is of no relevance in Sheffield where we have always interpreted
  the Guide correctly. The change of view is not the result of
  Popplewells clarification.
          If the City Council chose to ignore the gates onto the
  pitch in setting the number of spectators which will be
  allowed the effect would be to limit the capacity of the enlarged
  Kop to almost the same as it has been since 1979. The completely
  new exit which has been built at the south end of the Kop, and
  the widening of the exit at the north end, will only cancel out
  the loss of the exits onto the pitch.
          It should be emphasised that the provision of the new
  decking to accommodate almost 6000 more spectators, the new
  exit routes, extra toilets, and the part of the roof over the 6,000
  extra places, will have cost about £500,000. It has stretched
  ingenuity to find room for the new exit routes, as the Fire
  Service will I am sure agree. I see no way in which further exits
  could be provided even if there were unlimited money available.
          However, it should be brought to the attention of the City
   Council that I entered into discussion with the South Yorks
  Working Party at a very early date and kept them informed of our
   proposals regarding the exit arrangements for the Kop at all times.
   In particular, I sent a clear exposition of our proposals in a
   letter dated 25 October, 1985. It will be seen that near the end
EASTWOOD tr PARTNERS




 of the letter I described the proposed new exits and enclosed
 drawings showing their positions. I also gave the arithmetic on
 which our proposals were based (see copy attached).
        Th§ proposals were placed before the'Working Party on
 13 November, 1985, and their decision was sent to me in a letter
 from S.Y.C.C. dated 14 November 1985. A copy is enclosed. It
 will be seen that under item 2 on page 2 it is stated that the
 Working Party "agreed with your calculations and proposal to increase
 the tunnel exit on the north side of Spion Kop to 8 clear units
 and to provide a complete new 6 unit staircase on the South side" .
        The only change we have made since that submission in
 October is to improve the arrangements by widening the tunnel
 exit to 9 units instead of 8.
        In the light of that completely unequivocal acceptance of
 proposals last November the Club has proceeded with the scheme
 in its entirety. The Fire Service did not voice any second thoughts
 until July, 1986, by which time the structures were virtually
 complete. It is now not feasible to construct a new exit route.
 The new decking for the extra places, the new exit routes, and the
 extra cost of making the roof large enough to provide the extra
 places amounts to about £500,000. This would now be wasted.
        It is quite unacceptable that with the Popplewell report
 being published in January, 1986, only a few weeks after our proposals
 had been approved by the Working Party, the Fire Service did not
 give any indication of a possible change of mind until July, 1986.
 This is clearly maladministration in the Clubrs view.
        The Club did not make the decision to install the extra
 decking until March, and did not erect it until June/July. If the
 change of policy had been indicated earlier the Club could have
 been saved much of the additional expense.




        With regard to the proceedings on Thursday, we would like to
 have a clear statement of all the points which cause concern, so
 that we can properly answer them. I presume that the various matters
                                                                   SHEET

     will be explained to the Committee by officers of the Council or
      by the Fire Service representatives. Following that, I presume
     we will be allowed to ask questions. It will then be our turn to
  *V /give •our •j»»pepiW«»'          w i l l b e questioned.
              Finally, I suggest there will be a brief summing up.
              I mentioned in our telephone conversation yesterday that
      the Club thinks it would be very helpful to the Committee in
      coming to its decision if it would inspect the Kop. Indeed we
^    believe it will be very difficult for them to get a true picture
  4^to enable them to make a fair decision from drawings. They would
     be welcome to visit on Friday afternoon, say if they decide to
     reconvene their meeting at Hillsborough, or such other time as
     will suit their convenience.

        The depth at the face o f the supporting member should be determined from shear conditions in accordance
     with 3 J.6.2 but using the modified definition o f a , given above.
         The main tension reinforcement in a corbel should be designed and the strength o f the corbel checked,
     on the assumption that it behaves as a simple strut and tie system. The reinforcement so obtained should
     be not less than 0.4% o f the section at the face o f the supporting member and should be adequately anchored.
     At the front face o f the corbel, the reinforcement should be anchored either by welding to a transverse
     bar o f equal strength or by bending back the bars to form a loop; in the latter ca se the Jacanag         o f the
    *load should nor project beyond tiw r t u i p t portion o f the "bars forming the main tension reinforcement.
        When the corbel is designed to resist a stated horizontal force, additional reinforcement should be pro­
     vided to transmit this force in its entirety; the reinforcement should be welded to the bearing plate and should
     be adequately anchored within the supporting member.
        Shear reinforcement should be provided in the form o f horizontal links distributed in the upper two-thirds
     o f the effective depth o f the corbel at the column face; this reinforcement should not be less than one-half
     o f the area o f the main tension reinforcement and should be adequately anchored.

     5.2.4.2 Continuous concrete nibs. Where a continuous nib less than 300 mm deep provides a bearing as on a                 F tb. 1976

     boot lintel, the nib should normally be designed as a short cantilever slab in accordance with the following
     provisions and definitions:
     (1) the projection o f the nib should be sufficient to provide an adequate width o f bearing for the type o f
    member to be supported (see 5.2.43). The reinforcement in the nib and any reinforcement in the supported
    member should have a minimum nominal overlap on plan o f 60 mm;
      (2) the line o f action o f the load should be assumed to occur at the outer edge o f the loaded area, i.e. at the
    front edge o f the nib, at the beginning o f the chamfered edge, or at the outer edge o f the bearing pad as
    appropriate;
       (3) the maximum bending moment in the nib should be taken as the product o f the load supported and the
     distance from its line o f action to the nearest vertical leg o f the links (see (6) below) in the beam. The tension
     reinforcement in the nib should not be less than that required by 3.11.4.1 and should be adequately anchored;
       (4) the tension reinforcement should extend as near to the front face o f the nib as considerations o f
    adequate cover will allow and be anchored there, either by welding to a transverse bar o f equal strength or
    by bending the bars through 180° to form loops in the horizontal or vertical plane. Vertical loops should be
    o f bar size not greater than 12 mm;
       (5) the shear resistance o f the nib should be checked in accordance with 3.4.5.1 except that f , given in
     Table 14 may be multiplied by 2d/a„ where a , is the distance defined in (3) above;
       (6) links capable o f transmitting, in addition to any other forces which they resist, the load from the nib
     to the compression zone o f the main beam should be provided in the main beam.

     ensure proper anchorage o f tension reinforcement (see 3.11.7.1). Precast units should have a bearing o f at             F tb. 1976
     least 100 mm on masonry or brickwork supports and o f at least 75 mm on steel or concrete; this bearing may
     be reduced at the discretion o f the engineer, taking into account relevant factors such as tolerances, loading,
     span, height o f support and the provision o f continuity reinforcement. Nevertheless, when reduced bearings
     are used, the minimum anchorage lengths o f reinforcement required by 3.11.7.1 must be provided and
     precautions must be taken to ensure that collapse o f the unit cannot occur due to accidental displacement
     during erection.

     S.2.4.4 Bearing stresses. The contact surfaces should not contain excessive irregularities and when adequate
     intermediate padding is not provided, the compressive stress in the contact area should not normally
     exceed 0.4/c„ under the ultimate loads. When the members are made o f concretes o f different strength, the
     lower concrete strength is applicable. Higher bearing stresses may be used where suitable measures are taken
     to prevent splitting or spailing o f the concrete at the interface, such as the provision o f well-defined bearing

          a)   There is no doubt that the Kop is covered by the Building
               Regulations and that we shall need Building Regulations
               approval. However, there has effectively been no change
               in the 1985 Regulations.
               Even if there were a change in Regulations, it is obviously
               commonsense that facilities for the disabled apply to the
               ground as a whole and not to one particular building. At
               the moment there are perfectly adequate facilities tinder
               the overhang of the roof of the North stand. There is a
                level approach. The disabled are under the cover; of the
                cantilever roof. Any facilities at the front of the Kop
               would be less sheltered from the rain, and more prone to
                disruption by the fans immediately behind. It is not a good
                place at all for .disabled people.

             With regard to the proposal that a glazed shelter might
s^ e;        be placed over the "disabled accommodation in front of the
             North stand, it was not our intention that any seats within
             the North stand would have an obscured view although a few
             of the spectators might have to look through the glass of
             the canopy to see the near touchline. There are materials
             available for the glazed roof.which might prove to be safe for
             that purpose.
             I regard it as regrettable that there has been such a
             negative attitude on this particular matter. We have not,
             of course, taken the design study any further with regard
             to the possibility of a covering for part of the disabled
             area nearest to the Kop end of the North stand, but would
             reconsider the matter if the Working Party has a change of
             heart.

             Enlarged Kop
                  With regard to the request for a barrier to protect
             the ladies toilet, it has perhaps not been realised that
             there is handrailing already in place. A gap will be
             created for am entrance to the ladies toilet. The
             final version of the proposed arrangements is shown on
             the attached print of drawing number 6648/53. The new
             brickwork is shown shaded.

 <m           Roo finer the Kop
                    We are really surprised by the suggestion that the
              steel frame of the gable walls and presumably the back of the
              stand should be sheeted over. It is a common feature of
              every stand structure that I know of in a n y football ground
              in the country that the sheeting rails and other bracing
              members are exposed on the inner face. In older structures
              they are generally only at 1.2 m centres but in more modern
               structures they are generally at 1.8 m centres. With the
               1.8 m spacing it would be extremely difficult indeed to
               climb up except adjacent to a column. However, I know of
               no instance where the sheeting rails of an existing stand
               are regarded as being such a hazard that they should be boxed
               in, with a n inner skin as well as an outer Skin. I find
               xt very surprising that this matter is being pressed.

            This correspondence on these matters leads me to believe
     that there would be great advantage if the Club's advisers were
     present for part of each of the meetings of the Officer Working
     Party. Matters of this kind need to be discussed round the
     table rather than in lengthy correspondence. We can be of great
     assistance in providing information which may result in fewer
     matters becoming contentious. It is also inevitable that we
     send you pjaj^s -which .jure i# aome".ways'VpreliMnary in /order
     to give the opportunity to comment at an early stage. The
     plans are incomplete in some respects and this may lead to
     misunderstanding of what is intended or a lack of appreciation
     of the thinking behind what is proposed. There is also the
                 ivsUr
     difficulty^in the light of comments received from the Club, and
     indeed those from the Working Party, quite significant
     changes may take place at a very late stage. It is desirable
     that any late changes be dealt with in as short a time as
     possible. In this regard I now enclose si* prints of each of
     p n r drawings nranhers 7C» 8A. 9A. 17A and 56.    As the Club
     will be wishing to place an order for the inew building not
     later than the end of January, it may be that, an oral prasentatio
     to your Working Part of what is proposed might be beneficial
      all round.

    ktc'i.4 The Group concluded that this so-called "eight minute rule" was concerned solely with the effect
             of crowd turbulence (arising from delays in evacuating specator accommodation) on the rate of
            flow. It was not related to emergency evacuation time criteria (see paragraph 32 below) and the
             Group recommends that the Guide should make this clear.




  Photocopy of Recommendation 24 from Final Popplewell Report.




                6.5 Recent research has indicated that when it takes more than
                7 minutes to vacate an area of soectator accommodation the
                urowd flow tends to become turbuient. Ia these conditions in­
                dividuals can lose control over their own movement and the rate
                of flow may be reduced. It is therefore suggested that the writs
                from each area of spectator accommodation should be so
                that the spectators can. if desired or reauired. leave that area in
                8 minutes or less.

                    and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

                      Hillsborough Stadium. Sheffield: 2nd April, 1979

PRESENT:           Representing the Club

                   Dr. W. Eastwood (Consultant)

                   Representing the Working Party
                   Dr. H. Bailey (Sheffield Area Health Authority)

                   H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions
Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of the Club's activities. The Club's
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED -
1.    That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time limits for the issue of
General Safety Certificates, it was essential to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the start of the 1979 /80 Season.
  2.    That, as the Club wanted to attract representative games, the aim should
  be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

  3.    That as much work as possible should be carried out in the close season,
  bearing in mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
  will be more restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah's Witness Bally had
  also to be borne in mind.

  2.   Discussion on Standing Areas

  A.   Spion Kop

  IT WAS AGBEED -

  1. That the siting and angle of the new barriers to be installed be the subject
  of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

  2. That the Chib consider the Installation of simple lateral barriers (Hot of the
- climb proof type) for crowd control purposes In the blocks on either side of the
  central block (but not so as to obstruct the gangways).

  3.     That, In view of the clearance time of I l f minutes compared with the
  8 minutes specified in the Guide, the means of escape be discussed in detail
  between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service (including the re-siting of the gates
  in the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
  an increase in their number).

  4. That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be increased to the
  maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

 5.    That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
 be tested to the appropriate standards.

  6. That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the
  crush barriers and the scoreboard structurebe the subject of detailed discussions
  between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

  7. That the Club's longer term proposals for the improvement of the means of
  egress be unanimously welcomed.

  8.    That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
  points have been resolved.

the County Council feel require attention so as to secure reasonable
safety at the Ground.

They are, of course, individual requirements on specific matters and are
additional to the general requirements set out in the specimen form of
General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with my letter of
                                                                                                                        I  L jr i^ r L .c d

After the Club has had the opportunity of considering the schedule* perhaps
you would let me know which of the requirements you feel will be able to
be carried out In the close season.

Should you have any queries, Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (ext. 422) would

                    Matters reqiiring attention at the
      Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield

Spion Kop

1.       To secure a crowd capacity of 11, 040 people the following work to be
         undertaken:-

(a)      Improve the width of the exit from the Southern end of the Kop to a
          minimum of 4.7 metres throughout. This can be done fay providing              y
          a gate through the perimeter wall in front of the Hillsborough Suite as   v       /
          indicated on plan no. 1610/11.
(b)      Increase the headroom of the north east exit to a minimum height of 2.1
          metres.

2.       To secure a crowd capacity of 16,850 people the following work to be
         undertaken, in addition to item 1:-

(a)      Provide four gates of at least 1.1 metre wide from the radial gangways to ^ /          /
         the perimeter track of the ground area.

(b)      Provide an additional exit from either the top or side of the Kop of at        -
         least 3 metres width. It should be so designed that it does not impede
         the egress from any other gangway, (enclosed for guidance is a form                ^
         FS 902).
3.       The arrangement for crush barriers as produced by the consultant, whilst
         not complying fully with the guide recommendations, is considered
         adequate if the other requirements are fulfilled. These other requirements
          include the 2 No. radial barriers indicated on Plan 1XA and the provision
          of an additional 3m wide egress route to South-East area, and of gated
          openings to give access from the radial gangways to the ground perimeter
          area.

4.       Make good all broken and spalled concrete terracing.                       y
 5.      Check and carry out any necessary work to ensure safety of score-board
         building.
 6.      Replace corroded perimeter rails by construction complying with code
          recommendations.

 7.       Improve egress conditions at rear by provision of balustrades, rails,
          etc. as indicated on the plan. C«xs • »<c»c/iz} .

                           ' Spion Kop Development
              As design of the roof over Spion Kop and the extension of the
     terracing proceeds we thought that the Working Party should be
     given an early opportunity to comment upon the proposals. At this
     stage the roof, although it will be an impressive structure, does
     not hold the individual interests of all members of the Working
  ( Q p a r ty and we will deal with the roof at a later date.  However, we,
     would like to discuss the parameters surrounding provision for the
     disabled, the increased capacity of the Spion Kop and the exit routes
    as we see them.
         Enclosed are six prints of our drawings 6648/7, 8, 9, 16 and 17
    showing in outline the areas of terracing for the enlarged Spion
     Kop together with the exits. ~
          It was initially thought that the disabled could be accommodated
     along the front of Spion Kop between the North stand in front of the
     perimeter fence, which would be set back about two metres. There
     are disadvantages to this proposal. The advertising boards would
     need to be mounted well into the perimeter track level reducing
     its width. The disabled would be in the 'firing line' of mis-cued
     shot* on goal but also it would mean that the emergency exit
     gate, could po.sibly be obstructed. Providing suitable
     protection for them from the weather would also be difficult

     the projection and a purpoM made, low level cover, could
     obscure the vision of spectators behind them.
          There are ways round these difficulties and it is not
     one hundred percent certain that the disabled will not eventually
     be accommodated along the front but the present favourafe proposal

     timber frame with clear polycarbonate Foof sheets so as not

           The number of wheelchairs attending matches varies but it
     probably average, about 33. A. you would expect the number
     increases to .ay 40 or more for the attractive matches.      The
     ambulant disabled occupy normal .eats in the stands.
         To serve the disabled whether they are placed in front of
    the North stand or eventually along the front of Spion Kop we
   propose that toilet facilities are provided, possibly beneath
    the terracing adjacent to the ramp leading down the side of the
   North stand gable. We calculate that the new capacity o t

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) met yesterday afternoon to
consider the proposals contained in your letter dated 25th October. 1985
and accompanying nlans.

1.    Disabled Facilities

The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of your suggestions
for the disabled. If the disabled continue to be accommodated in front of
the North Stand, they will still be in the "firing line" of mis-aimed shots
and any clear sheeting over the top of the area they occupy could constitute
an unacceptable hazard to persons who might vacate the North Stand in an
emergency situation by climbing over the front wall of the stand onto the
pitch perimeter. It is accepted that the means of escape does not provide
for this to be done, but it has to be recognised that in practice this is a
real possibility. The structural strength of such a structure could also be
something of a problem. The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled
in front of the perimeter fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to
the North Stand) is also unacceptable for the reasons stated by you.

The suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terxacing
levelled to provide, say, a two-tier level landing on which to accommodate
the disabled, with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch
perimeter fence in front of this area could be removed, and the disabled
could continue to gain access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the
North Stand as at present. This would also enable free access by the
disabled to the proposed disabled toilets under the rebuilt terracing of
the Spion Kop.

The current legislation relatin g to the disabled was also discussed.
In the circumstances, the Officer Working Party consider that the
proposals for the disabled suggested by the Police should be supported
subject, of course, to there being no obstruction of exit routes and
flows.
2.    Enlarged Spion Kop
The Officer Working Party agreed with your calculations and proposals to
increase the tunnel ex it on the north side o i the Spion Kop to 8 clear
units and to provide a complete a w 6 u n it etairc&s^ on the Seroth side.
Accordingly, the Officer Working Party agree th at, subject to the following
points, the proposals for the enlarged Spion Kop are generally acceptable
(a)    adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the upper
       rear and the new south side exit routes;
(b)   to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents'
       to ile ts and the new la d ie s' to ile ts in the new six unit staircase
       on the south side;
(c)   to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
       gates in the pitch perimeter fence (as at Bramall Lane);
(d)    to confirmation of the number of new tu rn stiles to be provided on
       the south side and on the Penistone Road side;
(e)    u n til acceptable alternatives are available, the new exit gates to
       be fitte d with a tum -bar arrangement under the control of stewards.
3.    Roofing of Spion Kop
I t was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals has been supplied
to date, but the Building Authority point out that i t appears that the gables
are not to be lined and thus i t would be comparatively easy for them to be
climbed.
Also the Police asked me to stress that should any of the proposed works on
enlarging or roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season,
i t w ill be a requirement that the areas concerned w ill have to be secured to
prevent unauthorised access.
4.     Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium
The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of spectators
from a ll parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.
I t was agreed that i t was d iffic u lt to see how th is could be overcome, as the
physical restrain ts to achieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than
allowing the present position to continue, but I was requested to reg ister the
point.

 Dear Sirs

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 19*75
 SAFETY CERTIFICATES:
 SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB, HILLSBOROUGH,                                         SHEFFIELD.

 I write w ith reference to the above and following the recent
 telephone conversation that took place between my Environmental
 Health Officer, Mr. Moore, and your Mr. Addy.

 I would confirm that a number of defects are felt to be in
 existance with regard to structural aspects of the club's extended
 "spion k o p ” and that these may constitute a significant hazard to
 members of the public using this facility..     These include the
 apparent lack of a suitable pedestrian guard rail, the unsuitable
 positioning of radiating gangways and the gradient of the terracing
 at some areas.

  My officer understands that, in the opinion of the H.S.E., these
  matters are best dealt with by the provisions of the above
  legislation and hence by the Local Authority Licensing Team.
  Furthermore I understand that you do .not wish to attend a
  programmed site visit or make represetations to the club’s
  Management upon these matters.

  I shall, with your approval, convey these findings to the C o u n c i l ’s
  Chief Licensing Officer so that he may request a safety input into
  the certification procedure from my Department.


  Yours faithfully,

                                                       734690 - Mr. Bownes
During Kr. Bownes’ visit to the natch on 25th August It was noted that very
little of the fencing which should have been Installed to protect the sheeting
at the rear and sides of the Kop was in fact in place and it 1s also understood
that the P.A. System on the Kop was not in operation during that catch. It was
also noted that several pieces of fencing were In fact wired to the structure of
the Kop presumably as a temporary measure. Z consider these Items important and
that it is in everyone's Interest that they are dealt with immediately and in
any event before the match on 30th August.

t have sent * copy of this letter to Dr. Eastwood as usual.

Yours faithfully,

      Dear Dick,
                                                                                  Safety Work 1986

        During the summer inspection Inspector Calvert asked for some
   of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end of the ground to be
   removed so as the allow easier access into the various pens.
   Rather than ask Ackroyd & Abbott's sub-contractor to do the work,
   who were at that time working overtime, we instructed George Shaw
(^Engineering Ltd.   tohave the work completed before the Everton
 "game. This theydid and today we have forwarded a certificate
   for the payment of £129.92 plus V.A.T. to them. The original of
   the certificate and their invoice is enclosed. Payment should be
   received by them no later than 16 October 1986.
                                                                                      Yours sincere]

       SUBJECT:        SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS - REVISED EDITION
                       OF THE GUIDE TO SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


       I have gone through the whole of this extremely comprehensive document
       and whilst a considerable amount of the contents is applicable to management
       of the club, engineering problems and fire officers, certain paragraphs
       are worthy of mention in relation to Sheffield Wednesdays Football Ground
       at H illsborough. .

       Paragraph 16 relating to crowd pressures. As you are aware the kop has
       had a tendancy at recent matches to produce this wave effect and it is
       necessary that when a large match is anticipated in the future, we should
       ensure that the numbers allowed onto the kop strictly adhere to the capacity
       allowed. It is imperative therefore that the automatic counting system
       is always in working order for 'A' and 'B1 category matches, such as the
       visits of Manchester United, where almost capacity crowds can be expected.

       Paragraph 23 onwards lays down the management responsibility very clearly
       and is to be welcomed, since there have iiithe past, been grey areas as to
       who is responsible for crowd control etc.

       Paragraph 28 recommends the appointment of a safety officer and identifies
       his duties. I can only presume that the safety officer is in fact Mr Lock,
       although I have never heard him designated as such, and this should be
       clarified with the club.   Furthermore, in the discussion of a central
       control point being designated (other than then police control), one would
       assume that the central control point designated in respect of the Sheffield
       Wednesday ground would be the video viewing rocsn in the south stand.

       Paragraph 43 relates to records of tests kept and examination of the ground.
       I am not aware that these are kept by the club.

       Paragraph 199 relates to exercises of stewards regarding emergency procedures
       and I am not aware that the club have ever carried out exercises in this
       respect.

       In conclusion, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have complied with the
       guide to a very large extent, more so I would suspect, than the majority
       of clubs in the country, and it is only on minor points as identified above
       where inprovements could be made, so far as police procedures are concerned.

   For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bownes


    Dear Sir,

    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

    Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986, in respect of the above
    Club.

    Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

    An inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November, 1986.        The
    comments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
    individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
    it is assumed that from previous correspondence and documentation that the
    various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

    MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

    North Stand

    Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

     The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7.8.85
     in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

     There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
     with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
     ment of these buildings.

     Spion Kop

     A.      Timber framed and clad unit located on main central exit route has not
             received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for its
              installation, this should be removed immediately.

      B.     It is understood that the gates in the pitch perimeter fencing form
              part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten


                                   All communications to be addressed to the Chief Fire Officer.          DOCUMENT No.        1 ,2 -0
      with barrel bolts secured to the gate both top and bottom and open in
      a sideways direction.    It is doubtful that if it were necessary to
      evacuate the stand onto the pitch in an emergency that the gates would
      open if pressure were generated by a crowd.      No record can be found
      in respect of discussion on gate fastenings.      It is recommended that
      a satisfactory security device easily openable from the pitch side should
      be found and fitted to all perimeter gates.

C.    During the inspection it was observed that several concrete steps on
      the lower terracing were in need of repair and in one case the complete
      step had erroded away.     Every endeavour should be undertaken to ensure
      that, all steps are kept in a good, state of repair- -

D.    The wire mesh protecting the stanchions and bracing supports from being
      climbed is ineffective.    It has been observed that patrons visiting
      the Kop can, in large numbers from the back of the Kop, climb into the
      lower half of the roof.   The mesh should be extended to alleviate this
      situation.

E.    It was observed     that where the terracing is above 1 m higher than the
      lateral gangways     wire mesh infill had not been located along the full
      lengths.   Where     the mesh had been provided this had been spot welded
      but the mesh had    not been given an additional vertical support.

F.    Exit gates should be unlocked and keys             held by stewards manning   the
      gate before patrons enter the stands.

West Stand

A.    Timber framed and clad units located under this stand have been             there
      for some considerable time. No record exists of:-

      (1 )    acceptance of these units or,

      (2 )    that they have been treated with fire retardant paint or solutions.

B.    Exit gates to the pitch perimeter as item B under Spion Kop above.

South Stand

The accommodation is divided into four areas

A.    Ground   floor     offices,   directors   suite,   players area, function   suite,
       kitchen etc.

 B.   First    floor, upper stand walkway,       press lounge, players lounge,     paint
       stores, disused bar area.

 C.    Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

 D.    Rear stand, covered seating.

 With respect to the four areas, the following observations are made:-

 A.    Ground Floor:-

             (i)   During normal working hours most doors from the office area
                   are kept locked shut.   All doors marked    'Fire Exit'   should
                   be made readily available for use by any person within the area.
  (ii)   A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stores
          and directors' suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
          fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above.       It
          also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
          by corrugated, lightweight plastic sheeting.

         The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
         should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
         requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

 (iii) All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures and these
     . areas alwayfe maintained freis from such storage.

First Floor:-

   (i)   Again, a number of rooms i.e. players' lounge, press lounge,
          the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint
          store ventilate into this area.     Any ventilation requirements
          should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

  (ii)   Valves should be fitted to the gas supply line to each of the
          five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be cut
          off should an emergency arise.

 (iii)   All timber construction within this      area   should   be   suitably
         treated so as to be flame retardant.

  (iv)   The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
         mixtures and present a hazard which it is considered should
         be removed from this area.      Proposals to relocate the stores
          should be discussed with the Fire Authority before any work
          is commenced in order that suitable siting and any need for
          licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

   (v)   The timber constructed cupboard and     the portable     sales   kiosks
         should be removed from this area.

  (vi)   In the cleaners'     cupboard to this area, the fire resisting
         separation between    the ground and first floor levels is breached
         by the passage of     cables through a wall.   The area around the
         cables should be     infilled with material to ensure a minimum
         fire resistance of   thirty minutes.

 (vii)   All rooms onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
         it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any doors
         being to the same standard and made self closing onto 25 mm
         rebates.

(viii)    Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
          purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

Uncovered Seating Area:-

The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
the rear part of the stand.   Should this route not be available then
evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having the
ability to climb over the front wall on to the pitch perimeter tr&'ck.
This wall is approximately 1.5 m high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
to 1 a high at the West end.
     To facilitate easier forward evacuation on to the pitch it is recommended
     that openings be provided in the wall at the foot of radial gangways.

D.   Covered Seating Area (Rear Stand):-

     The means of escape from this area is not considered to be" satisfactory
     in that escape is possible in one direction only, this being down through
     areas described in A and B above.

      Subject to all the recommendations outlined in A and B above and made
      later in respect of automatic fire detection being implemented, the
     *«ea«s..of escape fram the covered seating, area would be acceptable.

AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION

In 1979 the working party discussed the provision of automatic fire detection
in the South Stand.

It is recommended that such provision should be made in all areas beneath
the seated area of the stand as soon as possible.    The system should also
cover the Tavern Club which has a direct link on to the first floor corridor
of the South Stand.

The automatic detection provided should be tied in to the existing fire warning
system.

In order that persons using the Spion Kop can receive early warning of any
fire occurring in the "Stands" Club, it is also recommended that automatic
fire detection be provided in that Club.

EMERGENCY LIGHTING

Spion Kop

The emergency lighting has yet to be tested - no test certificate received.

South, North and West Stands

In letter dated 12th November, 1980, from Eastwood and Partners, it was
suggested that following test certificates dated 11th August, 1980, a period
of 5 years should elapse before re-testing for South Stand and 2 years for
North and West Stands.  As of today no record appears to exist as to whether
these areas have been re-tested or that the test certificates together with
maintenance records have ever been re-presented.      The emergency lighting
system should therefore be re-tested for the whole of the ground and test
certificates produced.   In addition the whole of the system should conform
to B.S. 5266.

FIRE ALARM

West Stand

Existing call points to be relocated to accessible positions outside of
franchise areas and be increased to cover the upper areas of the stand.

North Stand

As West Stand above.

  SUBJECT:    .        Safety at Sports Grounds

  Meeting held at Division Street Conference Room, 1C March 1987.
  Present:-       D Bownes (Lie) , Mr Moor (Enviro Health) , Messr's Bulter and Swain (Bldg
                  Surveyors), Messr's Hildreth, Grizr.shaw, Bir.r.ington, Waterhouse, Woodhouse,
                  and Miles (SYCFS) .
J^Contents of letter dated 18.2.S7 (SYCFS - D Bownes' were discussed and agreed that
 ' t h e se matters be taken up with the Club. With ren-.rd -o the tinker buildings
    beneath stands, it was agreed that the Club re reques_ed tc remove or resite these
    structures.
  With respect to locked doors under the South Stand, it vas agreed that this matter
  would be dealt with under F? Act 1971. Fastenings tc sliding gates were also
  discussed and a copy of a sketch showing a single hock arrangement for securing
  such doors was circulated.  It was agreed that D Bowr.es would put this solution to
  the Club for their comments.
  Stewarding and securing of all gates was discussed and the Fire Service indicated .
  that existing arrangements were only acceptable subject to exits being stewarded
  and unlocked during 100% of the time that the ground was in use for a designated
  purpose. Any relaxation of this would mean an ir.sistar.ee that par.ic fastenings
  only be provided.
  Discussion then took place on areas of responsibility and ground inspections.
   On areas of responsibility D Bownes did not want to be tied down to individual
   references and even indicated that his Department could not act independently but
   must refer all matters to the Council Committee responsible for SASG Act. Whilst
   all others present would prefer definitive areas of responsibility (-allowing that
   there must be some overlap), David Bovnes preferred tc refer back to a future
   meeting following further consideration of the matter.
   On ground inspections, D Bownes referred to the recent Lords decision that grounds
   should be inspected annually, he anticipated that this would mean a much more
   thorough examination than the present system of bi-anr.ual inspections, and that this
   would be backed up by inspections during games.
   This was agreed by all present, hut reservations about the suggestion that during
   game inspections be carried out by the whole working r;arty were expressed by the
   Fire Service.   It was agreed however that one such 'during game' inspection would be
   set u d and the outcome monitored.

It was also pointed out by the Fire Service that the new guide now included
a section which defines in detail, management responsibility.   It is recommended
by -the Fire Authority that the Club Certificate specifies as a condition of
licence that this' section be complied with.

  Dear Sir,

  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

  In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to conaent on the
  condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
  have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
  received them as yet.
  The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
  with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
  receive is very satisfactory.

  The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
  information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. Some points in the
  letter have now been further clarified as follows:—

  (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-slted away
  from the walkways.
  (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
  dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

  (c) Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches: if this
  cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

  I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
  particularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of final
  exit gates. As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
  the sliding gates and have Indicated that as and when they reach the end of
  their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
  Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) to show a
  better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
  outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
  type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
  current locks, about which they are very concerned.

              I note your request for a report orr Lhevconaltion of the above
              Stadium.

              You will appreciate that to carry out a complete survey of all
              parts of this complex is a long and time consuming job which
              should not be approached in anything other than a thorough
              manner.

              I have therefore yet to find available diary time for my Officers
              to spend on this site.

              A report will be sent to you after a complete inspection has been
              undertaken.

    SHEFFIELD,-"'
f   S I 2!£•:.

    For the attention of ”r . D . Bo~./r.es
    m

    Dear Sire,

    In reply to your latter da-sd 1'Sth Mar/, 1987 regarding the "Future Administration
    of the Council's Certificating Function" under the Safety of Shorts Grounds Act
    1975j please find fcelcw the observations of this Department.

    1. With respect tc theschedule detailing        a proposed division of responsibilities
        between authorities it is felt that this should remain along the lines of
        the document issued by the previous certificating authority i.e. South Yorkshire
        County Council, a copy of which is attached. As this document has stood the
        test of tine uitii t c : : problons, it is raccmmandsd that a meeting of all author­
        ities concerned cc cailed cc see;: as possible in order to discuss the division
        of responsibilities it lays down.

              Whatever the- outcome one area where there-cey be a need for emphasis is a
              reference to the fact thr.t all authorities should be more a\/ars of other author-
    ^        itias responsibilities and that when considering any proposals a l l aspects
    ™        of the green suicU    shouldto taken into account in order that full consul­
              tation can take place with other interested authorities.

    2.       The pcno-ijrJ. for one annual inspection by the working group in conjunction
             with individual inspections by authorities as and when considered necessary
             i3 asreed with although it is envisaged that because of manpower resource
             limitations the decree of central co-ordination referred to nay cause problems.

             The Fire Authority vould wish to carry out such inspections subject to the
             limitations referred to above and tinder varying conditions at the ground.
             Obviously any adverse comments on crowd safety would be forv/orded • to your
             Department.    As tc the annual inspection, a good time would be at the end
             or towards the end of a season in order that any necessary work can be followed
             up before- the ccr.'zencer.or.t of a new season.

        3-   Whilst the situation regarding the status of working group is fully appreciated,
             this authority feels that the recognition of the group as a decision making
             body by the City Council is imperative if it is to remain effective. As under
             the County Council however, the terns of reference of the gi’oup would be within
             the conditions of certification laid down by the City Council, anything beyond
             these terns beinc referred back via your Department for a Committee decision.

                                                                                    Cont.         ...
 f'City of Sheffield                         —                                  7.7.1987
  Metropolitan District



    4.   The procedure outlined for colling additional meetings of the working group
         is agreed with although it is considered essential that full minutes of all
         meetings ore produced and circulated and in particular should maic- direct
         reference to outstanding matters from previous meetings in order that these
         are not 'lost* in the minutes.

    In addition tc the abov3:matters it would be appreciated 'if both Sheffield United
    and Sheffield Wednesday Football Clubs were contacted in order to discuss the
    ■wtst3n:i.±n£ features dealt with in correspondence between *Cf Division Headquarters
    and your Dep^Sraent dated 9tn December, ly36 in respect of Sheffield United mid
    18th February, 1987 in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.

 If there are any queries on the above matters, please do not hesitate to contact '
^the Officer concerned.

• Yours faithfully,

Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
encountered.

Moving on to the "working party'* structure I think it is d e a r from the meeting
of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required. It is
reasonably d e a r from the County Council's records that the working party as
such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority.  I propose that when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Authority. This list will be circulated as well.

Would you please consider the points I. have raised and let me have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Future Administration of the Council's
Certificating Function

Please note that I have arranged a meeting for all interested parties on
Thursday 16th July, 1987 at 9.30 a.m. in the Town Hall to discuss the above
matter further. I hope that the meeting will produce a consensus view on future
administrative procedures which will form the basis of a report to the General
Purposes Panel of the City Council. I should emphasise that no decisions have
yet been made on this subject and any comments or suggestions which you have
will be most welcome. I intend that my report to the Panel will be near
completion by the end of July and it is, therefore, important that the maximum
advantage is taken of the meeting on 16th July.

This meeting may also provide a useful opportunity to discuss dates for
inspections of the stadia prior to the beginning of the 1987/88 football seasono

Should the need arise please do not hesitate to contact my Chief Licensing
Officer, Mr. Bownes on the number given below.

Yours faithfully,




 Head of Department

Dear Sir

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Future Administration of
the Council's Certificating Function

Thank you for your letter dated 14 May 1987 which I have now
had the opportunity of discussing with Superintendent I
Stuart.

As you rightly point out, there is an overlap of interest in
the matters you outline in the draft, and therefore I feel
it would be helpful to have a meeting as soon as possible so
that comments may be made by all parties concerned before
making a final decision regarding this matter.

If I can be of any further assistance prior to the meeting,
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours faithfully

For the attention of Superintendent Stuart


Dear Sir

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
Future Administration of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
the above subject.

Many points were raised at the meeting but I think that the general feeling was
that the roles of each Authority involved in the system should be defined
perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

I have no objection in principal to roles being defined in this way but I should
make it clear that if it is agreed that particular Authorities adopt particular
roles then they will be under a duty to consult with other interested parties
where there is an overlap of interest. As I see it the Authority which carries
out a particular role will have the responsibility of advising the Council as
Certificating Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.

I have drawn up a draft Schedule which attempts to define Lead Authority roles.
I should point out that the draft is intended to be open for discussion and I
would therefore welcome your comments on it. Would you please also let me know
if there are any other matters which should be included in the Schedule.

Moving onto the question of inspections of stadia, this point was also discussed
at the meeting on 10th March. My view is that the existing system of bl annual
limited inspections is no longer appropriate; I feel that one major inspection
per year should be carried out on each stadium which should include all the
areas and installations within the scope of the legislation. To bade up this
inspection there should be a number of "during performance” inspections by
Officers. I think that there is general agreement in relation to "during
performance" inspections as they would highlight the performance of the safety
system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.
                                                           Cont..

                                                                                 734690 - Mr. Bbwnes
                           For telephone enquiries on this matter plea n ring,   ............................ (STD Cod* 0742)
                                                     Tain 64243 (Administration ft Legal)
Perhaps "during performance” inspections could be arranged so that each
Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
encountered.

Moving ontothe “working party" structate 1 think it Is dear from the meeting
of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required. It is
reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the working party as
such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Authority. This list will be circulated as well.

Uould you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

Future Administration of the Council's Certificating Function.

Dear Sir,
            I refer to your letter dated 14 May, 1987.

            So far as the 'Division o£ Responsibilities between Authorities' tm concerned

thtre 15 of ppurse, as you point out, an overlap of-’iirterest in some areas and            this leads

to consultation being necessary with other authorities*
                                                                                                       \

            I feel that wherever possible the SOSGA 1975 officer working party should meet

as agroup     and that the meeting should be minuted by the licensing authority. This leads

to a good working                   ned all members of the working party. «a»e aware vf all the

I & e o note that 'Communications' is not ircluded and this is of particular concern to

the police at stadia.

  y-'Z. agree that there should be one major inspection of nix stadia each year by the

officer working party.    So far as 'during performance' visits are concerned, these are

of course constantly monitored by police officers carrying out duties at the grounds.

       I am, as you will have noted from my previous comments in full agreement with your

recommendations at the penultimate paragraph of your letter, the officer working group

having due regard to the 1936 issue of the Guide to Safety at Sports Ground which covers

of course the areas of responsibility.

       Finally, I note, as I understand do the fire service, that the areas of responsibilit

allocated tc the Director of Environmental Health and Consumer Services (Sheffield City

Council) are generally covered by 'Means of escape' and that 'Food aa£ety and hygeine,

toilet accommodation' are not really matters for the Safety of Sports Ground Act Officer

Working Party.

Mr. Beatties opened the meeting      and statedthat     thediscussionswouldbedivided
into_ four areas:-

1. Definition of Rolls
2. Inspections
3.   Status of Group
k.   Admin. Machinery of the Group                V ■



1.     It was agreed that rollsshould be broadly defined andresponsibilities
     taken on by the appropriate of the three "lead authorities" i.e. Police,
     Fire and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs.

     A1 contact with the grounds should be through the licensing authority.

     Environmental Health would take a "general safety roll” and not be a
     "lead" authority.

2. The annual inspection is to be a joint full inspection to be carried
    cult n*ar th**. ctnd of-each «<??.con. ■ ■ ••— ' ‘ - ^ r* - '

     D.P. inspections to be done on an individual basis. Prior arrangements
     to be made with the Police, but not the Club. The Licensing Authority
     to be informed when an inspection has taken place.

3- The meeting was informed that legally the group is essentially an advisory
   authority - only the council can be the ultimate decision making authority.

4. Individual authorities to correspond to the sports grounds through the
   licensing authority who will subsequently circulate copies of all letters
    to each "lead" authority.

     Meetings of the group will be held at irregular intervals depending
     on need and can be called by any member of the group. Individual
     authorities need not attend specific meetings if they have no "interest".

     Agendas will be issued prior to each meeting.

Dear Sirs,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 -
DRAFT REVISED SAFETY CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS

In reply to your letter dated 7th July re the above, please find below
the observations of this Department

Section 9(a)   An additional item agreed with Barnsley and Doncaster Councils
               in respect of their standard, conditions is that the age
               range of stewards should be 18 - 65-

Section 10(a) Whilst specified in the green guide, it is difficult to
              imagine how this task can be controlled by stewards. This
              matter should be considered further.

Section 10(i) Reference should be made to the opening and securing open
              of exits on the intiation of any emergency procedure or
              at the end of a game and to assisting and directing spectators
              out of the exits.

Section 18     Add . . . "The emergency power supply should operate independ­
               ently of the main power supply and come into automatic
               operation on the failure of the latter and be capable of
               maintaining the necessary power output for a minimum period
               of three hours.

Section 23     Reference to "compressed gas or liquid” should be amended
                to . . . "flammable liquid or compressed gas (except fire
                extinguishing apparatus)".

Section 24     Add after "whatsoever"   "whether combustible or not".

Section 28     The old SYCC certificate required that the Police had knowledge
                of the whereabouts of the doctor.

Section 29     Again the old SYCC certificate required that members of
               the press, T.V. and radio were identifiable.
Section 35(d) This requires that the electrical installation be examined
              and a report submitted to the Council every 12 months.
              The same requirement should also apply to emergency lighting,
              and fire warning (including P.A.) systems.

Section 35(f) Sub paragraph (iii) requires emergency lighting to be tested
              at least 24 hours prior to an activity. It would be preferable
              that the original requirement of testing 3 hours before
              an activity be maintained.

Two additional items for consideration are:-

 (i)   That a competent electrician employed or retained by the      Holder
       shall be present during a specified activity.

(ii)   The Holder shall provide and maintain within the stadium to the
       satisfaction of the Council the access routes for emergency vehicles
       shown on the plans.

SCHEDULE - Interpretation

Whereas the old SYCC Certificate required certain matters (e.g. fire alarms,
extinguishers etc.) and the maintenance of these to be to the satisfaction
of the Chief Fire Officer, the proposed Certificate now requires these
to be to satisfaction of the City Council.

This Department does not foresee this causing any problems subject to
copies of the required annual certificates of test being forwarded to
us for examination.

If there are any queries on the above matters, please contact Divisional
Officer Grinshaw.

Also enclosed for your information is a list of sports grounds and indoor
sports premises within Sheffield and known to this Department.

Yours faithfully,

        SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB, PENISTONE ROAD, SHEFFIELD
        SAFETY CERTIFICATION INSPECTION, 6TH AUGUST, 1987.

        I write with reference to the above and following our recent site meeting
        aad subsequent general inspection .o£>v2:he warned football -ground: As
        requested, I would now submit my Department's findings to the "Safety of
        Sports Grounds Advisory Group" and to yourself as Certificating Officer.

         Spion Kop

         1. An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding
            to the side of the Kop is corroded and torn.

         2. It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving
            radial gangways had become defective.

         3. At some positions within the new development there is a
            difference in height between a terraced area and radialgangway
             of over 600mm. As such these areas require to be protected by
             a suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.

         4. Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
             minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would
             be adequately controlled by means of "ongoing" maintenance.

         5.    The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires
               to be repaired.

         North Stand

         1. It is important to ensure that the groundman's store beneath
             this stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
             fertilisers or weedkillers.

         Health and Safety - General

         1.    At a number of points within the standium various pieces of
               abandoned builders waste were readily available for use as
               projectiles by the crowd. Such material should be collected
               and suitably disposed of.

         2.    The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
               first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
               become ill or injured within the sports ground.

          3.   In order to ensure that the football club fully discharge their
               duty to supply an adequate number of first aiders, I would require
               that a minimum of 12 be employed to render first aid to sepctators
               during an activity. If the club continue to use the voluntary
               services of the St. John's Ambulance Brigade, then it would be
               necessary to formalise their relationship with them in order to
               ensure adequate deployment.
4.   I am to understand that the club is now prepared to appoint,
     in writing, a safety officer of adequate status and authority.
     I would propose that he has the functions described in the draft
     safety certificate conditions.

Conclusions

During the inspection of the football club's standium it became obvious
that the stands and associated areas are subject to excellent standards of
maintenance and upkeep.        Bearing in mind the size of the premises the
abbvfe-.-m«B»:lQOed points a?ee of’only;a£aLor« 'tignificasce attdil  suitably
impressed with the level of ground management being maintained.

I would advise that the identity and role of the Ground Safety Officer be
formalised in accordance with the green guide and without undue delay.

PURPOSES   panel

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - THE CURRENT    SITUATION AMP PROPOSALS FORTHE
FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNCIL'S CERTIFICATION FUNCTION

Introduction

The Panel will recall that on 1st April 1986 the City Council inherited from the
South Yorkshire County Council the role of certificating Authority under the
1975 Act.    The Act itself is basically aimed at     ensuring adequate standardsof
safety at designated stadia; there are three of      these in Sheffield at Che moment
- Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield United Football. Club., and the
Owlerton Sports Stadium. A detailed report on the Act and its application in
Sheffield was submitted to the Panel on 6th May 1986.- -

The Current Situation

The Panel at its meeting in May 1986 identified several main areas for further
investigation.

Firstly it was accepted at the time that the broad outlines of the
administrative system organised by the County Council should be continued for
the time being. This system has now been reviewed and the proposed
reorganisation is detailed later in this report.

The Panel also asked that the Health and Safety Executive be kept informed of
all matters relating to sports ground safety and that the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities also be asked about the HSE's involvement. As far as
keeping the HSE informed of safety developments at the stadia the Executive made
it fairly plain that they would not make any comments. The practice was
therefore discontinued. The involvement of the AMA in the BSE issue has bees
somewhat forestalled by action at central Government level to review Che HSE's
relationship with local authorities; this review was announced in the
Government's reply to the Popplewell Report but no results of that review have
yet been received. Fortunately, however, the Council's Director of Health and
Consumer Services has permitted his Officer's to provide ahealth and safety
input into the decision making process in relation to safety of spores grounds, .
This substitution, therefore, temporarily covers the absence of an input from
the HSE.
                         •» •_
The Panel also made reference to consultation on the safety of sports grounds
policy with the other District Councils in South Yorkshire. Unfortunately,
attempts at arranging consultation meetings have been unsuccessful to date. It
is proposed to try again to organise some consultations in the fairly near
future, perhaps when the Certification system has settled down in each area.
                 ‘               * •

The drafting of new safety certificate conditions in consultation with the
Council's advisers has been progressing steadily and new draft conditions are
currently under consideration by those advisers. It is hoped that the new
conditions will be submitted to the Panel at its meeting in October for final
approval;-

                 j
                    - ..
                     -


As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 legislation, it should be
be made dear, that such fees are only payable on the grant of a Certificate.
It is anticipated that if the Panel approves the new Certificate conditions a
Certificate will thee be issued to Sheffield United and at that time it is
proposed to deal with the question of fees.




                                       EJ
Future Administration of the Council's Certificating Function   ^

Following a thorough review of the legislation it has become clear that a
detailed administrative system aeeds to be established in connection' with the
Council's Certificating function. Discussions on this matter have been underway
for some time with the Police, the Fire Service, the Council's Building
Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services on the establishment
of such a system.

Accepting that the Council as the Certificating Authority will act on the basis
of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service) the question arises as to how
that‘advice may be best formulated. lax£h* faast, *he Coaccy Coudt.1 organised
an Officer Working Party which was apparently used as a forum for discussion
between Officers prior to the final formulation of advice to the Council* That
particular working party also appeared to have had some decision making powers.

As it is essential that meetings take place due to the potential overlap of
requirements in many areas, all the Authorities and Officers have now agreed
that it would be appropriate to establish a revised form of the working party to
perform a similar function for the City Council. It is recommended that the
"Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group" (which would consist of
representatives from the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's
Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services), would function as
a forum for discussion between Officers; its most regular use would probably be
the discussion of items of advice to the Council before they are finally
formulated by the appropriate Authority. Meetings of the Group would be held at
the request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the Head of
Administration and Legal Department would-arrange a meeting and despatch a list
o£ Items to be discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting a further.list of
items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be tak<m by each
Authority would be noted. It is then anticipated that detailed written advice
would be provided by each discipline and be acted upon as appropriate.

In addition the Bead of Administration and Legal Department will keep copies of
a n relevant correspondence which will be available to all participants in the ^
Group.

Under the old County Council administrative structure the different Authorities
represented in their working party had fairly clearly defined roles within which
to operate. Although it can be seen that there is some merit in this idea the
areas of potential overlap of responsibility are quite extensive in dealing with
spores grounds. However it appears that the various Authorities and Officers
wish for some definition of roles and the following have been agreed

Authority                                      Area of Responsibility

The Building Surveyor                  All matters relating to the structure of
                                       stadia including crush barriers, walls,
                                       etc.

                  .      E )
It is anticipated chat che Health and Consumer Services Department would have an
input to the Advisory Group on (a) aspects of general safety; (b) the general
safety management of stadia; (c) various special items such as first aid
requirements'. It will be appreciated chat these areas of responsibility are not
exhaustive but it is anticipated that any areas of doubt vill be dealt with“by"
<iiscuss‘
        £on8 at advisory group meetings.
                                                                       *


Inspections

Moving on to a matter of more general policy it has been suggested .that one
large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out by the Group backed up
by a series o£! inspec'ions vhidh Hill take, place actually -du&iag bvtn£s>.«
This proposal is in line with both the Popplevell Report and vith licensing
practice in other areas.

Delegations

There is also a further question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
to the day to day decision making required for the running of the Certification
System. At the moment decision making powers rest with the Panel but this, is a
highly Impractical arrangement which needs to be reviewed urgently, it seems ■
that as an interim measure all routine matters could be delegated to Head of
Administration and Legal Department with other matters remaining at the
discretion of the Panel. It is proposed that when the revisedCertificate
Conditions are in force then the delegation will be much more closely defined.
Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment with the current Certificate of
Conditions.
         *     ^

Recommendations

The panel is recommended to:-

(a) Note the current situation;

(b) Approve the revised administrative system detailed in this report including
    the establishment of the "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group”.

(c) Delegate to the Bead of Administrates and Legal Department authority to
    deal with all routine matters in connection with the Administrative System.

   Dear Sirs,

   Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Gate Release Devices

   I refer to your letter of 19th August and the enclosed plans of a proposed gate
   release device.

   The proposed device has been discussed by the various Authorities at some length
   and it has now been suggested thatjfeerhapsa prototype device could be fabricated
   and fitted to one of the gates for testing purposes. It has also been mentioned
   that with some modifleafions the proposed device could also be used for the
   sliding gates at Sheffield United Football Club*

   I look forward to hearing froa you with your coanents on this aatter.

   Yours faithfully,

         IMPLEMENTATION OF PART II (SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS)         SECTION 25

         INSPECTIONS UNDER SECTION 10B OF THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT
         1975



         Introduction
        Further to HOC/71/87 giving advice about the effects of changes
        brought about by implementation of Part II of the Fire Safety and
        Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act) this circular
        introduces Statutory Guidance given by the Secretary of State on
        inspections of designated sports grounds under section lOB of the
        Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) as inserted by
        section 25 of the 1987 Act.
        General
        The Statutory Guidance, drawn up following consultation with the
        local authority associations, has effect in respect of any
        inspection carried out under section 10B of the 1975 Act after 1
        January 1988 when, by virtue of the Commencement Number 1 Order,
        Part II of the 1987 Act comes into effect.
         Local authorities should bear in mind the mandatory nature of the
         Statutory Guidance on inspections carried out under section 10B
         of the 1975 Act whereas the supplementary, explanatory memorandum
         enclosed with the Statutory Guidance is not binding.
Resource Replications
Whilst it is not intended to restrict the time local authorities
say feel should be devoted to this task, inspections under
section 10B (when taken with existing commitments to inspect
designated sports grounds) should not result in significant
resource implications. The scope of inspections under paragraphs
3 and 4 of the Statutory Guidance, together with associated
report work, are not intended to be as detailed or extensive as
that often required of the holder of a safety certificate, or
that which may sometimes be necessary prior to the issue of a
safety certificate. In general, inspections are not expected to
take more than about 2 man days per ground on average*
To assist local authorities prepare a report and record of
inspections a suggested basic format which can be adapted
according to preference is enclosed at Annex A.

Supplementary
Any enquiries about this circular or the statutory Guidance
should be directed to Mr Macnamara 01-213 7338.

                                        Yours faithfully

STATUTORY GUIDANCE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES ON INSPECTIONS TO BE
CARRIED OUT UNDER SECTION 10B OF THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT
1975


The following guidance is given by the Secretary of State in
pursuance of section 10B(2) of the Safety of Sports Ground Act
1975 (as inserted by section 25(1) of the Fire Safety and Safety
of Places of Sport Act 1987}.


General
1.   The local authority should be satisfied that inspections
under this guidance are carried out by a person or persons
qualified for that purpose.
Scope of inspection
2.    Inspection of the ground should, where practicable, include
inspection of the following certificates of testing and records
as required under the terms and conditions of the safety
certificate to be kept by the holder and/or submitted to the
local authority.
(a)   any certificate covering testing of
(i) strength/loading tests carried out on crush barriers, guard
rails, hand rails, balustrading, walls or fences;
(ii) strength, stability of buildings or other structures;
(iii) inspections and condition of electrical installations.

(b)   records of the following
(i)   spectator attendances;
(ii) accidents involving spectators?
(iii) maintenance and other inspections of buildings, components
     anc. installations, together with identified deficiencies and
     recorded remedial measures taken;
(iv) tests and checks on emergency lighting, public address
     system, fire fighting equipment, fire warning system (if
     installed);
(v)   emergency evacuation procedures and steward training
      sessions.
3.   The inspection of the ground should normally include
inspection of the following items:*
(a) any part of the ground where an accident or incident
resulting in serious injury to spectators has occurred since the
last inspection;
(b) any recorded defect or deficiency which has arisen since the
last inspection and which, in the opinion of the inspecting
officer would be likely to lead to an accident which could result
in serious injury to spectators;

(c) major remedial work carried out since the date of the last
inspection to ascertain that it has been satisfactorily carried
out;
(d) all public stairways for their general condition, slip
resistance, condition of hand-rails (see also (j) below), trip
hazards especially at the head of stairways, adequacy of lighting
and structural fire separation;

(e) all egress routes used by the public, including emergency
exit routes, for obstructions, operation of exit gates, adequacy
of sign-posting and lighting, presence of any uncleared litter;

(f) fire fighting equipment and fire warning system (if
installed);
(g)   for the presence of any accumulation of litter,

(h) the emergency lighting system including any generator or
batteries
(i)   first-aid facilities and equipment;
(j) 10% of any crush barriers, balustrading and hand-rails for
overt signs of weakness which might signal the need for further
testing, remedial action or (additional) restriction on the
number of spectators allowed to occupy that part of the ground;
(k) 10% of the terraces or viewing slopes for general surface
condition, even-ness and slip resistance;
(1)   anchorage and fastening of 10% of any fixed seating.

(m)   any provision for the disabled.
Where the inspection of a sample as in paragraphs (j), (k) and
(1) reveals matters giving rise to serious concern for the safety
of spectators, the authority should go on to inspect all the
crush barriers etc, terracing or seating in that part of the
ground where the sample indicated that there were deficiencies.

Testing of equipment
4.   Tests should if possible be carried out to confirm that the
following is in working order:-

                             E3
                                f-2 -7



(a)   lighting, particularly on stairways and exit routes;
(b)   emergency lighting;
(c) public address system, including the proper functioning of
zoning where this facility is part of the requirements of the
safety certificate;
(d)   fire warning system (if installed);
(e) 10% of any metering system for recording the admission of
spectators to parts of the ground.




Home Office
25 November 1987
Supplementary advice and explanatory notes to the Statutory
Guidance to local authorities given by the Secretary of State
under section 10B(2 ) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

Introduction
1.   The following advice does not fora part of the Statutory
Guidance given under section 10B of the 1975 Act. The following
advice is given in good faith but it should be remembered that
only the courts can rule authoritatively on interpretation of
points of law.
Objective of Inspections
2.   The object of the inspections is to monitor the suitability
of the terms and conditions of the safety certificate (where
issued) in the light of any change in the condition of the ground
and secondly, to assist local authorities in enforcing compliance
with the terms and conditions of the safety certificate or other
notice served on the ground occupier.
3.   Local authorities may wish to note that the inspection is
not intended to shift responsibility for spectator safety away
from the holder of any safety certificate or ground occupier, but
rather to help see that he succeeds in achieving (and
maintaining) the safety standards intended to be set by any
certificate for the number of spectators authorised to enter the
ground for a specified activity.

General
4.   As the size, age, configuration, condition and usage of
designated sports grounds as well as the attitude of management
can give rise to different inspection needs, the discretion of
local authorities to carry out more frequent or more extensive
inspections than is laid down by section 10B of the 1975 Act is
not restricted. The requirements of the Statutory Guidance have
been set at what is seen as the desired minimum likely to achieve
the objective described above leaving authorities free to add to
the content of the inspections or increase their frequency
according to locally determined needs. In this context local
authorities may wish to bear in mind that inspections carried out
under section 10B of the 1975 Act are in addition to, not a
substitute for those required to be carried out under the terms
and conditions of the safety certificate by or on behalf of the
holder.
Inspection frequency
5.   As section 10B(3) of the 1975 Act stipulates that an
inspection should take place of a "designated" ground at least
once every twelve months, this frequency must be observed even if
the issue of a safety certificate is delayed. Where a safety
certificate has not been issued, the inspections carried out
prior to its preparation and issue should be such as to fulfil
the requirements of the Statutory Guidance. Once a safety
certificate has been issued at least one further inspection of



                             d
    the ground should be carried out either
    vlthln a year of its issue, or
    within a year of the last inspection, whichever is the earlier.

    Thereafter, inspections should take place at least annually from
    the date of the last inspection.

    Where an inspection of a sports ground takes place at the
    discretion of the local authority for some other reason, for
    example as a result of proposed alterations or an application for
    amendment to the safety certificate, that inspection can be
    regarded as an inspection carried out under section 10B of the
    1975 Act provided the criteria of the Statutory Guidance are net.

    Inspection Team
     6.   The Statutory Guidance allows the local authority to
£   determine how best to arrange and effect inspections under
v   section 10B of the 1975 Act and does not stipulate that they
    should be carried out by a particular professional discipline.    j/
    As it is nonetheless important that inspecting officers are
    qualified for that purpose, the guidance places an onus on the
     local authority to be satisfied on this account.  (The Guide to
    Safety at Sports Grounds (paragraph 36) envisages that
     inspections arranged by ground management will be carried out by
    someone who is professionally qualified. Local authorities may
    wish to consider whether inspecting officers should also be
    professionally qualified.)
    7.   Local authorities are also asked to bear in mind the
    potential advantages of a team approach to inspections under the
    Statutory Guidance and the role of the fire authority, building
    authority and the police. Local authorities in London and
    metropolitan counties may therefore wish to arrange at least one
    inspection per year to be carried out with a representative of
    the fire authority in attendance. Elsewhere, local authorities
*   will no doubt wish to consider inclusion of a member of the fire
    service as well as a representative of the building authority.
    Local authorities may also wish to consult the Chief Officer of
    Police so that the opportunity can be given for a police officer
    to attend at least one inspection each year.  (It is not intended
    that these considerations should interfere with any internal or
    locally agreed arrangements between the local authority, fire
    authority, building authority, police and any other agency with
    an interest in safety at the ground.)

    Scope of Inspections
    8.   Where possible all the items listed in paragraphs 3 and 4
    of the Statutory Guidance should be inspected and tested, it is
    recognised however that there may be occasions when one or more
    of these elements cannot, for some reason, be inspected. For
    this reason there is a degree of discretion within paragraphs 2 -
     4 of the Statutory Guidance. In this way it is hoped to avoid
    the situation where the local authority has to pay repeated
    visits to a ground in order to comply with the Statutory
the ground should be carried out either:-
within a year of its issue, or
within a year of the last inspection, whichever is the earlier.
Thereafter, inspections should take place at least annually from
the date of the last inspection.
Where an inspection of a sports ground takes place at the
discretion of the local authority for some other reason, for
example as a result of proposed alterations or an application for
amendment to the safety certificate, that inspection can be
regarded as an inspection carried out under section 10B of the
1975 Act provided the criteria of the Statutory Guidance are met.
Inspection Team
6.   The Statutory Guidance allows the local authority to
determine how best to arrange and effect inspections under
section 10B of the 1975 Act and does not stipulate that they
should be carried out by a particular professional discipline.
As it is nonetheless important that inspecting officers are
qualified for that purpose, the guidance places an onus on the
local authority to be satisfied on this account.  (The Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (paragraph 36) envisages that
inspections arranged by ground management will be carried out by
someone who is professionally qualified. Local authorities stay
wish to consider whether inspecting officers should also be
professionally qualified.)
7.   Local authorities are also asked to bear in mind the
potential advantages of a team approach to inspections under the
Statutory Guidance and the role of the fire authority, building
authority and the police. Local authorities in London and
metropolitan counties may therefore wish to arrange at least one
inspection per year to be carried out with a representative of
the fire authority in attendance. Elsewhere, local authorities
will no doubt wish to consider inclusion of a member of the fire
service as well as a representative of the building authority.
Local authorities may also wish to consult the Chief Officer of
Police so that the opportunity can be given for a police officer
to attend at least one inspection each year.  (It is not intended
that these considerations should interfere with any internal or
locally agreed arrangements between the local authority, fire
authority, building authority, police and any other agency with
an interest in safety at the ground.)

1.0   Sploo Kop

1.1 The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main
    means of escape exit route from the KOP should be removed, since
    it is causing both a high risk and a narrowing of the escape
    width.                                                                B.S.

1.2   A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier
      adjacent to the tunnel exit at the north end of the KDP to be
      removed, and the crush barrier be modified to join onto the end
      of the new steel supported barrier directly adjacent to it.         B.S.

1.3   A timber hut at ground level, under the KDP structure should be
      removed.                                                            B.S.

1.4   An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed
      adjacent to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended
      terracing. This was agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.                 B.S.

1.5   An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding to the
      side of the Kop is corroded and torn.                               HCS

1.6   It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving radial
      gangways had become defective.                                      HCS

1.7   At some positions within the new development there is a
      difference in height between a terraced area and radial gangway
      of over 600mm. As such these areas require to be protected by a
      suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.                          HCS

1.8   Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
      minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would be
      adequately controlled by means of "ongoing” maintenance.            HCS

1.9 The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires to
    be repaired.                                                          HCS

2.0 North Stand

2.1   A broken glass panel in the west gable end should be replaced.      B.S.

2.2 The step between seats 12 and 13 on row 43 is loose and should be
    correctly bedded down.                                                B.S.

2.3   It is important to ensure that the groundman's store beneath this
      stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
      fertilisers or weedkillers.                                       HCS

3.0   West Stand

3.1   Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be
      permanently secured at the following positions

      a) between seats 1 and 14
      b) between seats 20 and 28
      c) between seats 136 and 150.
       Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactory for this
       purpose.

       Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
       be correctly bent (or otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

3.2    Rain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should
       have a gauze inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles
       onto the crowd below.                                               B.S.

3.3    It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the
       suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
       emergency exit stairway on the south end of this stand. The
       fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
       cannot easily be unfastened in the direction of travel, andis
       impossible to be unfastened from the other side.                    B.S.

4.0 Miscellaneous Points

4.1    At a number of points within the stadium various pieces of
       abandoned builders' waste were readily available for use as
       projectiles by the crowd. Such material should be collected and
       suitably disposed of.                                               HCS

4.2    The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
       first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
       become ill or injured within the sports ground.                     HCS

4.3 The provision of qualified first aiders is being reviewedat the
    moment; it is felt that the existing arrangements require
    formalisation. The Club's views on this point are sought.              HCS

             Safety of Sports Grounds Act
             Stewarding at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d . ,
             Hillsborough. Sheffield______________________________

             I am advised by a member of my staff, who has attended recent games, that
             there has been a lack of effective stewarding on the Kop, resulting in
             the crowd occupying the radial gangways as additional standing areas,
             throughout the games.

             Although it is appreciated that these games were important Cup-ties and,
             therefore, attracted increased crowd capacities, stewarding must be of a
             quality and of such numbers as to maintain these gangways free from
             congestion during performances.

             It is also understood that the turnstile capacity on the Penistone Road
             frontage was insufficient, and that many of the spectators were still
             entering the ground up to 15 minutes after the kick-off.

             The combination of late arrival and ineffective stewarding could lead to
             dangerous occurances.

             It is considered that the Club should be made aware of these matters and
             be required to confirm that stewarding will be made available to keep these
             areas clear.

             This is possibly a matter that should be raised at the next meeting of the
             Working Party, so that police and fire authority comments may also be sought.

                          DESCRIP1ION                               ACTION TO BE TAKEN


    S.W.F.C, - Building Surveyor's memorandum of 2.2.88

    The Building Surveyor's representative outlined the
    memorandum and the circumstances which gave rise to it.
    Superintendent Stuart indicated that the gangway problem
    had been discussed with Sheffield Wednesday who were
    going to take measures with their Stewards in an attempt
    to resolve it. As far as the turnstile question was
    concerned, a pattern has developed of people arriving
    some 15 mins. before the start of the game hoping to
    gain admission.   This trend may be due to the banning of
    alcohol at sports grounds which could lead to people
    going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the football
    match.  As the available turnstiles operated quite
    effectively for the naiority of the time, and ch?t the
    late arrival problem could perhaps only be dealt with by
    education of spectators.




    Owlerton - General Principles

    Discussion took place about the south and east terraces
    which Eastwoods in their original report had recommended
    be closed.  There was no disagreement with the idea of
    closing the south terrace (which is in a very poor
    condition), but.whether or not there should be
    maintained along the front of the terrace a public
    walkway so that complete public access could be allowed
    around the perimeter of the stadium was not finalised.
    It was mentioned^-that the Company planned in due course
    perhaps to re-site the speedway pit on the site of the
    old south terrace.;'




    The Capacity of Owlerton Sports Stadium
                          ..
    There was a fairly lengthy discussion about capacity
    principally revolving around Eastwoods' original capacity
    estimate of 6,781 people.   There was also discussion
    about controlling the access, of spectators to particular
    areas or zones of the stadium by various means.      It was
    recognised that such area control would be difficult as
    the stadium is not at the moment physically split into
    different zones or sections,   As the stadium at the
    moment reauires considerable  works .to, be undertaken
                      isonable standards, - it was felt, that

                   With the exception of a small hut and the steel
              clad groundsman's accommodation, which are both
              located under the ramp and not the stand, the timber
              clad buildings have been removed.
                   We believe that the reference in the minutes
              dated 7 August, 19 85 was to storage facilities and
              not to buildings.

     removed so that the width of the exit route is not
     reduced.
     b)    This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.
     c)    Some of the concrete terrace steps have been
     repaired but, as has always been accepted, the
     repairs will continue to be a regular maintenance
     job.
     d)    The intention of the mesh was not to prevent
     people from climbing onto the steelwork but to act
     as a guard preventing spectators damaging and
     possibly loosening the rear sheeting.
           We disagree that spectators climb onto the
     steelwork in large numbers although we do not deny
     that the police have, at some matches, had to tell
     a few spectators not to sit on the steelwork.
           The cost of erecting a full height fence
     would be several thousands of pounds. The Club is
     not at present contemplating that magnitude of
     expenditure just to protect a few spectators from
     their own foolish behaviour.
     e)    There are four or five lengths of barrier
     where the drop in front is just over one metre,
      but as far as we are aware this has not created
      any hazard. In fact to the contrary, because
      people can leave the ground by going under the
      barriers onto the lateral gangway. This is a
      common feature of most league grounds.
            The welding is performing well and it seems
      that any additional vertical support is
      unnecessary. However, the welding can be inspected
      at regular intervals to make sure that it con­
      tinues to hold the mesh securely.

     f)   Exit gates are unlocked before spectators enter
     the ground. The keys then remain in the possession
     of the steward(s), given the responsibility of
     unlocking the gates, until after the end of the
     match and all spectators have left the ground.
     West Stand
     a)   Do we understand correctly that the
     reference to 'timber framed and clad units' is to
     the bar fittings at first floor level? If so, then
     those fittings were part of the original construction
     for which Building Regulations Approval has been
     granted. There has not been any previous comment
     about the presence of the bar fittings in that stand
     or other stands. We do not consider that they
     present a hazard.
     b)      This    i tem h a s a l r e a d y b e e n d e a l t w i t h   in ou r

     South Stand
     a)   (i) We note the comment about the doors and
     this point has been dealt with under the regular
     procedures of obtaining a Fire Certificate under
     the Fire Precautions Act of 19 71 for the offices.
     Fire Officer Roger Woodhouse has been dealing with
     the matter.
         (ii)      We see the principle behind the creation
     of fire compartments. That is sensible. Sealing
     off the windows is not difficult but the provision
     of ducting to the south wall is, and furthermore
     very expensive. A major exercise such as providing
     ducting would by necessity have to wait until the
     redevelopment of the South stand in 1991.
EASTWOOD f t PARTNERS                                                                SHEET




         (iii) We agree that stored materials should be
     removed from stairways and exit routes. There is a
     particular problem outside the kitchen area, at
     ground floor level, but the caterers have been asked
     to clear that particular area well before the public
     are admitted on match days.
     b)     (i) It was agreed in 1979 that the fans
     ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
     be fitted with intumescent grilles with smoke
     controlled shutters. Those grilles and shutters
     were fitted although we see that two recently
     installed fans do not appear to have similar grilles
     and shutters. As the form of fire protection from
     those lounges has already been agreed with the Fire
     Service, the Club are not prepared to have ducting
     installed, although the new fans should perhaps be
     fitted with intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
     shutters.
           (ii) A close inspection of the gas supply pipe­
     work in the five bars revealed that four bars have
     valves fitted to the feed pipe or to the appliance
     when there is only one appliance in the bar. The
      pipework in the bar nearest to the Spion Kop has
      been replaced recently but without a valve.
                     However,       t h e r e is a m a s t e r valve,          at
      g r o u n d f loor level,      w h i c h i s o l a t e s the gas    supply

          (iii) We confirm that all the timber facing onto
      the public circulation areas was treated with an
      intumescent paint during the work carried out in
      1980. Since then the walls have been re-decorated

             d)   Escape through the rear of the stand has always
             been accepted by the Officer Working Party. Further­
             more, it has been readily accepted with the
             protection which has been provided so far to the
             escape routes.

             Automatic Fire Protection
                  We will suggest to the Club that proposals
             should be put forward for the provision of a fire
             detection system but the system is not likely to be
             installed until the major re-development of the South
             stand which is planned for 1991
             Emergency Lighting

                  Testing of the emergency lighting system is
             being organised and we will be contacting the Fire
             Service in the next day or so to agree a date and
             time for carrying out the test.
                  The testing of the general electrical circuits
             will also be organised over the next few weeks and
             a current IEE Certificate produced.
             Fire Alarms

                  The Club was told by the Fire Service to put
             the call points in the bars in the stands. Moving
             the call points again is out of the question.
             Inidcator/Control Panel
                  The Officer Working Party was asked, at the
             time of installation, where the indicator/central
             panel should be placed. The Club was told that it
             should be located in the Police control centre,
             where it is now. No duplicate panel was asked for
             and it is not considered that one is necessary.

     Gates
             The comments about the gates are noted.

     The Club have expressed to us their increasing con­
cern that with the introduction of each new member of the
Fire Service to the Officer Working Party new or
different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
which in some cases openly contradict the recommendations
offered by his predecessors. Whereas we agree that many
of the observations and recommendations are of a
subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
spending money on matters which are purely a matter of
personal opinion. Some consistency in the comments
offered by members of the Officer Working Party would be
appreciated.

Dear Sir,

Do you provide the best standards of Ambulance Care for the large number of
Employees and Members of the Public whilst they are on your premises?

Major Sporting Events have always relied heavily on the resources which are
provided by the Voluntary First Aid Organisations.

We acknowledge the very valuable contribution which the St John Ambulance
and British Red Cross Society make. There are, however, areas where the
level of care which we can provide, of necessity, exceed those which can be
provided by the Voluntary Societies. These include Advanced Ambulance Aid,
Treatment of Fractures with the most modern equipment available
(particularly Spinal Injuries), Stabilisation of patients with Head
Injuries,    Intubation,   Intravenous    Infusion,   Cardiac   Monitoring,
Defibrillation and the Administration of Drugs.

ran    be of assistance to you ? If so, get in touch with Don Trueman on
Rotherham (0709) 828820 to discuss your requirements.

If we can't help with your immediate requirements, please place this letter
on file for any future occasion when we may be able to assist.

I am sure that you will be more than happy with any the facilities which we
are able to offer.

Yours faithfully,




A. Page.

   For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes



   Dear Sirs,

   SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB -
   SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUND ACT

    Following the inspection at the above sports ground on 19th May 1988, the following
    items are forwarded for your attention.

    Spion Kop

    Rubbish is accumulating under the new structure and requires removing.

    South Stand

    a)     The extractor fan from the laundry has an accumulation of fluff, and requires
           cleaning.

    b)     The new Sponsors Lounge on the first floor has been fitted with an extractor
           fan that breeches the fire resisting wall. At the time of the inspection it ‘f
           could not be determined whether it is fitted with an automatic heater detector
           operated shutter or not. If not, some such device will be required.

     West Stand                                                                                                   -

     There were only two small EXIT signs situated above the exits from the covered
     walkway which could not be seen from the extremities of the walkway. As this
     stand is used by visiting fans it is recommended that larger signs be fixed,
     in a more prominent position.




                                    All co m m u n icatio n s to b e a d d re sse d to th e Chief Fire Officer.
   D. Bownes                                                        25.5.88




Fire Safety

It is recommended where gas cookers are used in the snack bars that a fire blanket
be provided.

Should you require any further information concerning these matters, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

                THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

                ANNUAL INSPECTION OF SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
                ON THE 19th MAY, 1988

                I write with reference to Che above and following our recent site meeting
                and safety Inspection of the named premises.

                I would confirm that while the general standards of health and safety
                being maintained were found to be satisfactory a number of points did
                require attention.  I have itemised these below for your convenience.

                Splon Kop Development

                1.    The pylon situated to the left-hand side of the kop was not suitably
                      protected from unauthorised access and climbing.

                2.    To several locations around the kop, accumulations of associated
                      builders wastes and stonework that could easily be obtained for use as
                      projectiles were noted.

                3.    At some positions within the new development, there is a difference in
                      height between a terraced area and radial gangway of over 600mm. I
                      would advise that these areas be protected by a suitably constructed
                      pedestrian guardrail.

                4.    An area of stair nosing was found to have become defective upon the
                      "new" part of the spion kop and a similar defect was located upon the
                      older radial gangway.

                5.    Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of minor
                      repairs.

                6.    A loose rainwater pipe and length of guttering were located to one of
                      the Penistone Road turnstiles.

                 7.   An area of glazing serving one of the Penistone Road turnstile huts
                      has been broken.

                 8 . The club might consider the now combustible nature of much of the
                      vegetation situated immediately behind the spion kop and take the
                      appropriate remedial action.

                 9.   The rendering to the entrance gate side wall was still found to be in
                      a loose and defective condition.

                 West Stand

                 1.   In a number of cases terrace nosings require to be repaired.
2.     A number of seats were defective and require to be renewed or
       repaired.

3.     To the left-hand side of the stand, some pieces of old barbed wire
       were found to project over a walkway at head height.

              Travelling First Aid Kits

              The contents of small travelling; first aid kits (for use, in some circumstances, in
              establishm ents where there is dispersed working, or by employees working away
              from their employer’s establishment or by self-employed persons) may vary accord­
              ing to the circumstances in which they are to be used. However, item s included
              should always be among those specified above. In general, the following item s should
              be sufficient:
                 a. six individually wrapped sterile adhesive dressings;
                 b. one medium-sized sterile unmedicated dressing (approx 10 cm x 8 cm;
•Pi                  examples of suitable dressings currently available are the Standard Dressings
                     No 8 and No 13 BPC);
                     one triangular bandage (this should, if possible, be sterile; if not, a sterile
                     covering appropriate for serious wounds should also be included);
                 d. six safety pins.
              Supplementary equipment
              The approved code states that where first aiders and occupational first aiders are
              employed in an establishment the employer should provide appropriate, carrying
              equipment for them to use. In addition it is recommended that where sucn
              equipment is provided, blankets should be stored alongside the equipment and in
 L3           such a way as to keep them free from dust and dampness.

              Protective Clothing and Equipment
I’l i         Protective clothing and equipment should be provided near the first aid m aterials
              where there is a possibility that the first aider or occupational first aider might need
               rotection to avoid becoming a casualty him self while administering first aid.
p             ftotective clothing and equipment should always be properly stored and checked
              regularly to ensure that it remains in good condition.                          a

     The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
replaced now.   There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
barrier 144/ when tested,and we also recommend that that rail
is also replaced.
     As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
the start of the coming season.
     Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
results of the barrier tests.

Dear Mr.                 Sheriff,

            Following your telephone call I am very pleased to enclose
a copy of my report to the Club concerning the barrier testing
at the West end of the ground in July,                                                  1988.           You will see from
the carbon on page 2 that a copy of the letter part of our report
was certainly sent to Mr. Butler in your department and to
Mr. Bownes in the Legal department.                                                  I know it is our normal
practice to send you all the record sheets but if we did not do
so, a full set is now enclosed.
             I               also enclose a copy of the test certificate from Sheffield
Testing Works who checked the calibration of the testing equipment
the previous week.


                                                                           Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell


Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                     Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                           Barrier Testing 1988

        Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
        The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds* •
        In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
withstood the applied load.     A clip over the rail of barrier 124
broke before reaching the full test load.
        Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those, t rsted on the
Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
load.
     The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
replaced now.   There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
barrier 144 , when tested, and we also recommend that that rail
Is also replaced.
     As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
the start of the coming season.
     Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
results of the barrier tests.



                                Yours sincerely.

            DESCRIPTION:                               One hydraulic pump complete with two hydraulic cylinders.
                                                       The force on the cylinders, under an applied force is
                                                       measured by a pressure gauge mounted on the pump.


            IDENTIFICATION:                            Pump: D948005
                                                       Gauge: BGF 168 SR
                                                       Cylinder 1: 04773                       Model RC 53AF9N
                                                       Clyinder 2: 04772                       Model RC 530J8N


           METHOD

           The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0.5 lever arm testing machine                                                            in
           terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf). The uncertainty                                                          of
           the forces applied during the calibration is +0.556*

           Three tests were made on each cylinder.

           Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at fixed loads.

                      Annual Inspection of Hillsborough Stadium as required
                                      by the Certificate of Ground Safety



                     On 18 July 1988,                           I made an inspection of the ground
    during the time that                                        this year's quota of crush barriers
    were being tested by                                        m y firm.
                      The results of the crush barrier testing are given
    in a separate report                                        of today's date.
^                     I made a visual                           inspection of all the ma i n                                structural
    features of the ground.                                             Particular attention was paid to
    gates and entry and exit routes and to boundary walls and
    fences.                     N o significant defects were noted.
                      The roof of the South stand                                           was inspected from the ground.
    No deterioration in its condition was observed.
                      I certify that in my opinion the various structures on
    the                   ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for
    the stadium to be used to the full capacity as                                                                        laid down in
    the Certificate of Ground Safety.

                  On Tuesday 9 August 1988, a meeting was held at Hammerton
                  Road Police Station to re-establish further liaison with the
                  Fire ana Ambulance Service in the event of a major disaster
                  occurring a t .the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.

                  The meeting was chaired by Superintendent Murray and attended
                  by Superintendent Marshall, Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector
                  Sewell, Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer Hopkins and Assistant
                  Chief Ambulance Officer (Operations) Jones, South Yorkshire
                  Ambulance Service and Assistant Divisional Officer Rowlands
                  of the South Yorkshire Fire Service

                  A senior ambulance officer already attends all home matches
                  at the Sheffield Wednesday Ground and is allocated a compli­
                  mentary ticket for the South Stand.   He is in direct radio
                  contact with ambulance control and in the event of a major
                  disaster at the ground, he would be the first line contact
                  with ambulance control.   Contingency plans are already in hand
                  for the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service to rendezvous with
                  their vehicles at Herries Road bus garace and the senior
                  ambulance officer already at the Wednesday Ground would control
                  the ambulance vehicles in and out of the Wednesday Ground.

                  Arrangements have been made for the senior arr.bulance officer
                  who attends the Wednesday Ground to meet the 'FI' Liaison
                  Inspector outside the players' entrance at 2.15 pm, before
                  each home match to re-establish contact and also contact will
                  be maintained with Mr Lock, the sacurity officer at the
                  Wednesday Ground.  In the event of an evening kick off,
                  further arrangements will be made to establish contact time
                  with the ambulance service.

                  In the event of a major disaster occurring, the senior
                  ambulance officer at the ground would, where possible, make
                  his Way to the gymnasium to direct his operations.

                  It was considered that this ambulance officer would be better
                  based in the North Stand so he could get to th e gymnasium
                  without problems,   However, the senior ambulan ce officer who
                  attends is off dut y and the Sheffield Wednesda y Football Club
                  only wish to alloc ate the complimentary ticket s to the ambulanc
                  service for use in the South Stand, so that th e club physio,
                  Alan Smith, can si gnal straight away to the a~:bulance officer
                  if an ambulance is required for a Wednesday pi a y e r .

     Following discussions with the Fire Service Officer it was agreed
     that the fire service would attend by the quickest possible
     routes direct to the immediate scene of any fire and as such
     no rendezvous points or pre-arranged routes could be determined.
     The main points raised, in relation to the fire service, were
     that it was imperative that the Police Control give the exact
     location of any fire or incident and as much detail as possible
     given. No senior fire officer is on duty at the match.
    To assist the fire and   ambulance services in any major disaster,
    two Police Tango units   will be specifically detailed to assist,
    one with the ambulance   service and the other with the fire service
    The exact details will   be written into the serial order for the
    mobile unit concerned.

    Safety of Sports Grounds - Draft Revised Safety Certificate Conditions

    I refer to your letter of 13th August 1987 (your reference FP19/2/4:RG/EB) in
    connection with Safety Certificate Conditions.

    I now enclose for your attention a copy of the final revised Safety Certificate
    Conditions which as far as possible incorporate the comments made in your
    letter. You will appreciate that the wording of certain of your comments has
    had to be amended slightly but I hope that the objective has none the less been
    achieved.

    There are four points which require some further consideration:-

               (a)   You say in your letter that an age range should be specified in
                     connection with stewards. I think however that the wording of
                     Condition 11 should be satisfactory without stipulating an age range.
                     No final decision has yet been taken on this issue and you may like to
                     consider it further;

               (b)   police knowledge of the whereabouts of a doctor - I believe this is
                     adequately covered in Condition 7;

               (c)   identifiability of press T.V. and radio personnel - I am not sure of
                     the justification for such a Condition and wonder if you have any
                     further comments on it;

               (d)   the attendance of competent electrician - again I wonder what the
                     justification for this Condition would be.

    Would you please let me have your comments on the new Conditions in due course.

    Yours faithfully,

                     GUIDANCE FOR SAFETY CERTIFICATE HOLDERS


INTRODUCTION

This note has heen prepared by the Sheffield City Council in.!order to inform
Certificate Holders as to the general background of the Safety Certificate
Conditions. The Council in dealing with Safety Certificates'takes advice from
the Chief Eire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director of'JHealth and Consumer
Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.. These Officers;-;and the Council
itself is concerned to see as far as possible that the spectators at any
specified activities are reasonably safe.                  ■■Yj-gS.’ .

GUIDANCE                                                       .

Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
should be acted upon in accjrdance with the time constraints given in the !
advice. The holder is reminded that failure to take steps to ensure the
reasonable safety of spectators could give rise to a prosecution.

The Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
relation to "public order" situations the correct handling of which should
reduce any risk to spectator safety.

The Chief Constable must therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative
purposes. These facilities are essential if public order is to be maintained
and the risk to spectators minimised.

The Chief Constable must also be informed at the earliest possible moment of the
proposed date and content of all specified activities so that appropriate
planning can take place-

In addition there must "be consultation and agreement between the holder and the
Chief Constable well in advance of specified activities about the proposed
methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation must also
take place if advance information is such that public order difficulties may
arise. As a result of this consultation it is possible that the Chief Constable
may require, for reaso-ns of preserving public order, that the specified activity
is "all ticket" or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
Stadium or the day and the time of the specified activity should be changed.

The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever means are appropriate to
exercise control over spectators for reasons of safety and as part of this
control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas of the
Stadium.

                  SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS

        I refer to the correspondence from Chief Superintendent (MS) in
        respect of the above.

        Enclosed for information is a copy of the Certificate issued by
        the then South Yorkshire County Council in December 1979- Also
        attached is a copy of the first Draft prepared by the City Council
        in August 1987.

        Referring to the latter could I draw your attention to paragraphs
        if, 5 & 6 which have been totally deleted from the new draft.
        Similalrly could I draw your attention to paragraph 10 which outlined the
        duties of stewards. To some degree the first draft made the stewards
        answerable to police officers. In the latest draft the reference to
        police has been totally removed.

         Generally speaking the new draft certificate ,apart from matters
         relating to the police, is reasonably consistent with the first
         draft. However you may consider it appropriate at some stage to seek
         the views of Chief Superintendents Broomhead and Duckenfield.

D ear Sirs
SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS - CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS
Thank you for your letter dated 30 March 1989 and enclosures detailing your
proposed revision of Safety Certificate Conditions. I will consider the proposals and
reply in m ore detail in due course.
Meanwhile, I am concerned to note that the conditions do not appear to require the
attendance of police officers at football matches, as provided by Section 2 of the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (as amended by Section 21 of the Fire Safety and
Safety of P laces of Sport Act 1987). I am forwarding a copy of your correspondence
lo the Police Authority Legal Department for advice on the matter and will contact you
when that advice is available.
kYours faithfully




 Chief Constable

     For the attention of Superintendent Stuart
     Headquarters Operations

     Dear Sir,

     Safety of Sports Grounds - Draft Revised Safety Certificate Conditions

     I refer to your letter of 4th August 1987 In connection vlth draft Safety
     Certificate Conditions. 1 now enclose for your attention a copy of the final
     draft of the nev Certificate Conditions which take into account the observations
     aade In your letter.

     You will however notice that there are no references as such to the Police
     within the Certificate. 1 have carefully considered this aatter and have coae
     to the conclusion that Conditions which purport to delegate the Council's
     functions to outside bodies are unenforceable as they are beyond the powers of
j    the Council. Therefore several Conditions which were Included In the first
 ^   draft (relating to for exaaple discussions between Certificate holders and the
     Police) have been deleted or Modified.

     1 am, of course, conscious of the very Important Police role In
     connection with the safety of spectators at sports grounds and I have therefore
     taken two steps to ensure that this role Is properly recognised In the
     certification systea. Firstly the definition of "authorised officers" In the
     Conditions Includes Police Officers. Secondly there Is also a new Condition
     which relates to guidance given by the Council on safety matters. A draft of
     the proposed guidance Is enclosed with the new Conditions and you will see that
     It refers largely to Pollce/CertlfIcate holder relations.

     Would you please let ae have your consents on the draft Conditions In due
     course.

     Yours faithfully,




     Head of Department

    INTRODUCTION

    This note has been prepared by the Sheffield City Council In order to Inf ora
    Certificate Holders as to the general background of the Safety Certificate
    Conditions. The Council In dealing with Safety Certificates takes advice froa
    the Chief Fire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director of Health and Consuaer
    Services and the Council's Building Surveyor. These Officers and the Council
    itself Is concerned to see as far as possible that the spectators at any
    specified activities are reasonably safe.

    GUIDANCE

    Where advice Is given to the holder by any of the four Officers aentioned It
    should be acted upon in accjrdance with the tiae constraints given In the
    advice. The holder is reainded that failure to take steps to ensure the
    reasonable safety of spectators could give rise to a prosecution.

                Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly lnportant role in
    *          at ion to "public order” situations the correct handling of which should
               reduce any risk to spectator safety.

    The Chief Constable must therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
    the stadiua for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative
    purposes. These facilities are essential if public order is to be aalntained
    and the risk to spectators minimised.

    The Chief Constable aust also be informed at the earliest possible aoment of the
    proposed date and content of all specified activities so that appropriate
    planning can take place.

     In addition there oust be consultation and agreeaent between the holder and the
     Chief Constable well in advance of specified activities about the proposed
     methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation aust also
     take place if advance information is such that public order difficulties aay
_ arise. As a result of this consultation it is possible that the Chief Constable
 '5‘ aay require, for reasons of preserving public order, that the specified activity
   • » "all ticket** or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
     Stadiua or the day and the tiae of the specified activity should be changed.

     The Chief Constable' should also be able to use whatever aeans are appropriate to
     exercise control over spectjtors for reasons of safety and as part of this
     control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas of the
     Stadiua.

  For the attention of Mr. D. Sheriff

  Dear Mr. Sheriff,
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                        Barrier Testing 1988
0      Following your telephone call I am very pleased to enclose
  a copy of my report to the Club concerning the barrier testing
  at the West end of the ground in July, 1988. You will see from
  the carbon on page 2 that a copy of the letter part of our report
  was certainly sent to Mr. Butler in your department and to
  Mr. Bownes in the Legal department.    I know it is our normal
  practice to send you all the record sheets but if we did not do
  so, a full set is now enclosed.
       I also enclose a copy of the test certificate from Sheffield
  Testing Works who checked the calibration of the testing equipment
  the previous week.

                                                                       Yours sincerely,


   c.c. Mr. D. Bownes

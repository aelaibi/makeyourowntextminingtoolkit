STATESs I WAS AT THE MATCH, THERE WAS MASSIVE CONFUSION OUTSIDE THE GROUND.
EVERYBODY WAS LATE & TRYING TO GET THROUGH ANY TURNSTILE, EVERYONE WAS
CONFUSED. THERE WAS NOBODY TO DIRECT SUPPORTERS TO THE CORRECT TURNSTILES. I
WAS SITTING IN THE NORTH STAND. I SPOKE TO A POLICE SGT INSIDE THE TURNSTILE A
TO THE NORTH STAND. I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE TROUBLE OUTSIDE & TOLD HIM TO DO
SOMETHING BUT HE WALKED OFF. THERE WAS ONLY A POLICEMAN & A POLICEWOMAN AT THE
TURNSTILES, THEY COULDN'T COPE WITH THE CROWD. THERE WERE LOTS OF POLICE
OFFICERS SURROUNDING THE GROUND BUT ONLY THE 2 AT THE TURNSTILES. EXCEPT THE
MOUNTED POLICE THERE WERE NO QUEUES & NOBODY CHECKING TICKETS. EVERYBODY WAS
L» £ & THEY COULD NOT FIND THE CORRECT TURNSTILES. I GOT INSIDE, YOU COULD SEE
P 0 P L E CLIMBING OVER THE BARRIERS.

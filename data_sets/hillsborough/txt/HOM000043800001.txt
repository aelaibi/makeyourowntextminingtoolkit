HILLSBOROUGH : ORAL STATEMENT BY THE HOME SECRETARY
                    MONDAY 30 JUNE 1997




With permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to make a
s ta te m e n t ab o u t th e Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


2.   Ninety six people lost th eir lives as a result of th e
Hillsborough disaster, which happened on 15 April 1989.
That was m ore th an eight years ago b u t no one who saw
th e news rep o rts on t h a t dreadful Saturday will have
fo rg o tte n th o se terrible events.    For th o se who lost
loved m em bers of th eir family, th e pain is ever-present.
Following Hillsborough, m em bers of this House w ere
united in th e ir determ ination to do all in th eir pow er to
p rev en t anything like th a t ever happening again.
(i)       Public inquiry


3.    Madam Speaker, a fte r th e Hillsborough disaster, a
num ber of inquiries and investigations took place,
|§lsi»i!»§~-a#=asp©cts^                                   fche m ost
                            <   |   * r   -v   • „ *


tho ro u g h and wide-ranging )was th e Public inquiry led by
                              L'
Lord Taylor. The term s of reference of t h a t inquiry
encom passed n o t only inquiring into th e disaster itself
b u t also making recom m endations ab o u t crowd control
and safety a t sp o rts events.


4.        Lord Taylor's inquiry took oral evidence from over
170 w itnesses a t public hearings during May and June
1989 and considered many hours of video evidence from
d iffere n t sources, in his interim re p o rt in August 1989,
Lord Taylor found th a t              th e disaster had a num ber of
causes.       He did n o t a ttrib u te all th e blame to a single
cause or person, b u t in paragraph 278 he m ade clear

th a t:




                                               2
       "The main reason fo r th e disaster w as th e failure of
       police control”


5.     in t h a t   interim     rep o rt   Lord   Taylor    m ade   43
im m ediate recom m endations. His final re p o rt in January
1990     m ade      a fu rth e r   76 recom m endations.            The
developm ents which have taken place since th en in
safety a t football grounds and in th e policing of football
m atches       have      been      based      largely      on   th o se
recom m endations.          Football in this country has been
tran sfo rm ed since th e Taylor Report. To a large e x te n t
t h a t is due to his wide-ranging and soundly based
conclusions.


(ii)   C oroners Inquest


6.     The d eath s which occurred on 15 April 1989 w ere
also th e subject of inquests conducted by th e coroner of
th e w estern district of South Yorkshire.

inquest is a fact-finding inquiry, conducted by a Coroner
                                            /
in fro n t of a jury, and aimed a t establishing th e answ ers
to fo u r im p o rtan t questions, namely:


       The identity of th e deceased


       The place of d eath


       The tim e and th e /d a te of d eath and


       How th e deceased came by his or her death.

        /   coroner's     rules       require   proceedings   and
e v id e n c e to be directed solely a t finding answ ers to
     lose questions. )


9.     The jury a t th e Coroner's inquest, a fte r examining
th e evidence, found in March 1991 t h a t th e cause of




                                  4
d e ath of th o se who died a t Hillsborough was accidental
death .


(iii) West Midlands Police Investigation


10. A fu rth e r investigation was conducted by th e w e s t
Midlands Police, supervised by th e Police Complaints
Authority, to establish w h eth er th e re w ere any grounds
fo r criminal proceedings, and to consider w h e th e r any
police    officer   should   be   subject   to   disciplinary
proceedings.


11. That investigation involved th e taking of over 5000
sta te m e n ts and th e scrutiny of all th e m aterial which
had previously been examined by th e Taylor inquiry.
A fter t h a t investigation th e evidence was se n t to th e
Director of Public Prosecutions, who concluded t h a t no
person should be subject to criminal proceedings.




                              5
12. The Police com plaints Authority decided th a t th e

chief su p erin ten d en t and sup erin ten d en t in charge on
th e day should face disciplinary charges fo r neglect of
duty/I in th e event, th e chief sup erin ten d en t retired due

before th e hearing takes plac e ] J The Police com plaints
A uthority later decided th a t disciplinary proceedings
against       th e   sup erin ten d en t   should   be   w ithdraw n
because th e retirem en t of th e chief su p erin ten d en t
m ean t t h a t w hat, in effect, was a joint allegation of
neglect of duty could n o t be fairly heard in th e absence
of th e m ore senior officer.


(iv) continued calls for fu rth e r investigations


13. Madam Speaker, Hon Members will be familiar w ith
th e unhappiness of th e families of th o se w ho died,
ab o u t th e inquest. They later applied fo r judicial review

14. The events surrounding th e disaster have th e re fo re
been subject to investigation on several occasions. But
concerns have rem ained about w h eth er th e full facts
have y e t em erged.        I have m et relatives of th e
Hillsborough victims w hose suffering is exacerbated by
th e ir belief th a t th e re are unresolved issues which
should be investigated fu rther.

have been m ade to me, to th e A ttorney General and to
th e Director of Public Prosecutions. A Granada television
program m e in December last year dram atised            th e
disaster and raised a num ber of issues which, in th e
view of th e program m e makers, rep resen ted new

subm itted on behalf of th e Hillsborough Family su p p o rt
Group. Those rep resen tatio n s have related in particular
to video evidence of th e disaster and (medical evidence
                                          f
ab o u t th e tim e of death of th e victims.


16.   Madam speaker, my D epartm ent, th e office of th e

                                          ___     I
A ttorney / General and tljie crow n Prosecution Service
have considered very cajrefully all the/ evidence/ which
          I                     I               I   /
has b eeniput forw ard in ifecent months]                       —


17.   The Director of Public Prosecutions has taken th e
view th a t th e m aterial so far p resented to her would not
justify fresh criminal investigations. The th en A ttorney



                                      8
        /
General, also took th e view, again on th e m aterial
p resen ted to him, th a t any application to th e High Court
fo r a new inquest would n o t have any realistic p rospect
of succeeding.


18. Nonetheless,       I am   acutely conscious th a t      th e
families of th o se who died a t Hillsborough and many
o th ers including Hon Members of this House are very
concerned     th a t   unresolved   issues   remain.     I am
determ ined to go as fa r as I can to ensure th a t no
m a tte r of significance is overlooked and th a t w e do n o t
reach a final conclusion w ithout a full and independent
exam ination of th e evidence.


19. I can th e re fo re tell th e House today th a t th e
A ttorney General, th e Director of Public Prosecutions
and I have agreed th a t it is in th e public in te re st th a t
th e re should be an independent scrutiny to ascertain
w h e th e r th e re now exists any new evidence relating to
th e d isaster which was n o t previously available, w e are



                               9
appointing Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord

Justice of th e Court of Appeal, fo r th a t purpose. His full
term s of referen ce are:


    To ascertain w h eth er any evidence exists relating
    to th e disaster a t th e Hillsborough stadium on 15
    April 1989 which was not available:


    (a)        To th e inquiry conducted by th e late Lord
              Taylor; or


    (b)        To th e Director of Public Prosecutions or
              th e A ttorney General fo r th e purpose of
              discharging    th eir   respective   sta tu to ry
              responsibilities; or


    (c)        To th e Chief Officer of th e South Yorkshire
              Police in relation to police disciplinary
              m atters;




                              10
     And in relation to (a) to advise w h eth er any
     evidence     not    previously   available   is   of   such
     significance as to justify establishm ent by th e
     secretary of s ta te for th e Home D epartm ent of a
     fu rth e r Public inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c)
     to   draw to       th eir a tte n tio n any evidence not
     previously considered by them           which may be
     relevant to th eir respective duties; and to advise
     w h e th e r th e re is any o th er action which should be
     taken in th e public interest.


I am today placing a copy of th e se term s of reference in
th e Library.


20. w e have asked Lord Justice stuart-sm ith to examine
all th e w ritte n and o th e r evidence which has been
subm itted.     He will also consider any fu rth e r m aterial
which in terested parties wish to submit.




                                11
21. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's task will be tw ofold.
First to advise me w h eth er any evidence n o t previously
available is of such significance as to justify a fu rth e r
full public inquiry. His advice to me will be available to
th e House and th e public^ Secondly, he will identify for
th e   A ttorney    G eneral.i and   th e   Director of   Public
Prosecutions/ and th e Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
Police any evidence which m ight be relevant to th eir
decisions which has not previously been considered.


22. I hope th a t this examination will enable us to
establish conclusively w h eth er or n o t m aterial evidence
ab o u t th e causes of th e Hillsborough disaster has been
overlooked. If it has,i I can assure th e House th a t I will
tak e w h atev er action is needed. /fwe owe it to everyone
touched by th e tragedy, b u t above all to th e families of
th o se w ho died, to g e t to th e bo tto m of this m a tte r

Dear Mr Steen


You wrote to Mr Moynihan on 25 April 1989
enclosing one from Mr           about the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Miss Bannister,
in her letter of 18 May 1989, mentioned that
your letter and your constituent's had been
forwarded to me as the Secretary to the
Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
Taylbr who has noted it.

                                Yours sincerely


                                K_

 DeoS fi, £
As you know, your letter of 25 April to Mr Moynihan enclosing a
copy of a letter written to the Prime Minister by Mr                                             of
                           Totnes, Devon,                                 was passed on
to the Home Office for a reply.


I have passed on copies of your letters and of your constituent's
to Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the Inquiry set up under Lord
Justice Taylor, to investigate the events at Hillsborough in
order that the Inquiry may take account of the points your
constituent raises.   Mr Whalley can be contacted at this address.

         I think you will have received a copy of this
         one written to the Prime Minister by a constituent
         of mine. There seems a lot of good sense in what
         he says. Do you agree.

         that     was     my      lot.        I thought              I was       going         to    die.




         Then      somebody           moved         behind        me.        I got        my     lungs       full      of    air      and    I

         managed        to     kneel        up.          Somehow          I got     myself           up.        As    I got      to    my    feet      1

         was     still       standing            on      people.

Hedi c: to 1 d me         he was     dead a nd that       the      lad had got      no ribs.         T hey had

b e e n s q ua sh e d .



At    this    time       I felt     gu i l t y because    here was        this young      lad. dead and             I

d i d n "t ha v e a sc rate h .



I then star t e d          to help other         fans    to y4rry      injured      people     on

advertising          hoardings        to the F o r e s | / s n d of    the    pitch.      I made about

t e n ru n s .



By then every o n e            knew what was        going    on.      A loudspeaker        said for

people       not    to    leave the        ground until      the Police        said so.



The Poli ce         then said that           fans   on coaches and           trains    could    leave      so       I

Once      I got         outside            I looked             for     a telephone                 to    call     my Mom,           The       pho n e

boxes        had      queues          so       I knocked           on a h o u s e          and       the w o m a n      let me           use    the

phone .



1 then        got       back      to       the          coach and           I got        home       at a b o u t    '7.40 pm         (1940).




The    two        girls       who         I mentioned              earlier            ie S a r a h       and        ctoria HICKS,                    I

During        the       whole         incident              I would          s ay     t ha t    a good          percentage           of     the

P o 1 i ce    inside          the         ground          were     not       prepared           for       f a t a 1 i t ies    in the

crowd.            They      seemed             to       be rno r e g e ^ r e d        up    f o r c:r owd        cont r o 1 .        A    lot        of

Police        were        standing              around          d3o i \/q    nothing.



If    it h a d n ' t        been          for       the     Liverpool            supporters               I would       say        that

I attended              the     semi-final                  last       year      at      H i / 1sbo r ough         between          the     two

same      clubs,         there            was       a    cordon        of    P o 1 i\c/ a n d        Mounted        Police         across            the

gates        by     L.e p p i n g s       LN    entrance,              to    control           the       numbers.         ihis       year

             1"he    ground          at    Hi 11 s b o r o u g h     has       & Y q a oci t a n n o y    system    and    a    large

             scoreboard.                  Neither        of    t h em     yfe re    u s e d to     tell     the    crowd       what    was

             going         on.       I believe           thVl       t/Us       could       have    helped     the    yrluation.




             1 would           lay    blame       with        the   Police          and     the   Emergency         Services          for    no t

             acting         quickly          enough       and       the    Sheffield            Wednesday         Football       Club

             because           the    gates       and     the       pens       were      likei c a a e s    and    once    inside       there

             was     no     way      out     in    a    crush.




             I    also      believe          that       the    allocation             of    tickets        w a s wrong.         Liverpool

             should         have      been        given       the    other         end     of   the      ground.

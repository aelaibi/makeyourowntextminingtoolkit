I attach a draft letter and covering submission, following on from
Tuesday's meeting with South Yorkshire. South Yorkshire would not
accept the proposed special payment outright, nor reject it, but
asked if we could offer improved terms.
2.   Lord Ferrers asked after the meeting whether an improved offer
could be made.    We doubted that it could, particularly without
giving South Yorkshire the opportunity to consider the existing
offer a leisure and with the full Police Authority.
3.   Hr Nagler made the point that it would not be a good time to
go back to the Treasury in the context of our PES discussions. You
may want to put something in the draft submission about this point.
4.   I have drafted the submission for Hr Addison to send but Hr

issue a writ. Could I have comments/contributions a.s.a.p.?
6.   I hope Fin Div 2 can supply figures on block grant etc and
also say whether they agree with my assertion that South Yorkshire
could not do better under any previous special payments formula, if
the costs reach at least £4 million as expected.    (That is if you
think it is worth putting in. None of the precedents is entirely
apt, since there has not been a special payment to a single service
police authority before - at least the miners' strike payments were
devised when the Hetropolitan counties were still in existence
although some of the new authorities have subsequently received
payments under that formula.)

HILLSBOROUGH : COSTS OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
At the meeting with South Yorkshire Police Authority Lord Ferrers
undertook to write to them setting out the details of the proposed
special payment. A draft letter to the Chairman of the Authority
is attached for Lord Ferrers' consideration.

2.   Lord Ferrers asked whether a case might be made out to the
Treasury for further limiting South Yorkshire's maximum
contribution (for example from £975,000 to £500,000).

3.   The formulas used for previous special payments have varied
according to circumstances, but none of them, when applied to
anticipated costs of at least £4 million, would limit South
Yorkshire's contribution by any more than the proposed formula.
Some would have been less generous. We would thus be asking the
Treasury for a payment effectively more generous than all previous
ones (including the one for the miners' strike).

4.   When we discussed this with the Treasury, they pointed out
that it would be the first special payment to a police authority
since police grant was increased from 50% to 51%. In 1988-89, for
example, South Yorkshire would have received [             ] more
than under the old rate of grant.
5.   The Treasury could also have pointed to changes in the block
grant position which effectively treat police authorities, in
particular the metropolitan authorities, more favourably than was
the case at the time of the miners' strike. Under the new system,
South Yorkshire received a year on year increase of block grant in
1989-90 of (£         ]. The contribution by central government to
South Yorkshire's budget in 1989-90 will be around    % (and single
service authorities, unlike county police forces, are certain of
receiving all the block grant assigned for policing).

6.   The Treasury also pointed out that assistance provided to
local authorities as a result of the 1987 hurricane was at 75%
above a penny rate threshold. We pressed in South Yorkshire's case
for a more generous payment on the grounds that police authorities
face more uncertainties over possible large-scale demands and that
the single service authorities have fewer resources with which to
cushion themselves than do local authorities.

7.   The Treasury accepted the case but would be very unwilling    to
concede any further ground. They would say that with a budget      of
£85 million and a contingency fund of £1 million plus reserves     of
nearly £1 million South Yorkshire should be able to absorb costs   of
up to £975,000.

8.   There is also a claim for a special payment from Kent Police
Authority under consideration. They expect to incur £5.1 million
additional costs on policing the P and O ferries dispute and their
lp rate produce is £2.034 million. So far Kent have not pursued
their claim vociferously (in part because they probably anticipate
a favourable outcome) but they are unlikely to take it quietly if
they are refused a special payment once South Yorkshire are known
to have received one. Our chances of doing something for Kent are
likely to be reduced if we squeeze the Treasury for more for South
Yorkshire.

9.   As I said after the meeting with South Yorkshire, I believe
that a number of the representatives at the meeting were favourably
impressed by the offer and there is a reasonable hope that, on the
full Police Authority, their views will carry the day.
10. When we made the offer we were aware of the main points which
South Yorkshire put to us at the meeting. I believe that a payment
which will effectively apportion the costs some 23 to 20% to South
Yorkshire and some 77% to 80% to Central Government (with Central
Government paying an even higher percentage if costs were to go
above £5 million) does take account of South Yorkshire's position
and that there is a good case for putting it as it stands to the
full Police Authority for consideration.

                     4.   You also take the view, as I understand it, that
                     when it was subsequently decided to establish the enquiry
                     under Lord Justice Taylor and to place the results of the
                     investigation at the service of that enquiry, this so
                     changed the character of the investigation, and its
                     scope, that as a matter of principle the South Yorkshire
                     Police Authority should no longer be expected to bear the
                     costs.

                     5.   You also made the point that the expected scale of
                     costs could be such as seriously to threaten the
                     efficiency of the South Yorkshire police force and could
                     not        be$fc\  absorbed within the Authority's own
                     resources.

                     6.   As I explained at the meeting, the Home Secretary
                     accepts that, because of the scale of the investigation
                     and its unexpected nature, the likely costs could not be
                     absorbed by South Yorkshire within the usual police
                     funding arrangements without serious detriment to the
                     efficiency of the force.
        a
                     7.   He also recognises that, as a result of the decision
                     to make the results of the investigation directly
O * Ua w .           available to Lord Justice Taylor, it has been widened to
                     cover /aspects which aro- □pacifically ac.irva.nq— llm purpuye

                     8.   Nevertheless it remains the case that much of the
                     investigation will be concerned with the policing of
                     events on the day, a matter which is inescapably the
                     concern of the South Yorkshire police.
             1   v

                     9.   Taking all these consideratons into account, the
                     Government is prepared to offer South Yorkshire Police
                     Authority a special payment towards the costs of the
                     investigation.  This would apply to costs incurred by
                     South Yorkshire Police Authority in reimbursing
           additional costs incurred by West Midlands Police as a
           result of the investigation.     (By additional costs we
           mean costs such as overtime, travel, subsistence and
           accommodation of personnel directly involved in the
           investigation, together with consequential overtime costs
           incurred as a result of the need to provide cover for the
           officers assigned to the investigation.)

           10. The level of assistance which we are prepared to
           offer in this case would be for the Government to meet
           90% of all costs «flc^~\ihcae l-eachnd the product of a lp
           rate (which we understand would be around £1.3 million)77
           Moreover a limit would be placed on the total amount
           which South Yorkshire Police Authority would have to
           contribute.      Whatever the total costs of the
           investigations, South Yorkshire would have to contribute
           no more than the product of a 3/4p rate, which we
UiArviXJ
           calculate would be about £975,000.

           11. Special payments have previously been made in only a
           small number of cases.    Government already contributes
           substantially to police expenditure through police grant
           and block grant.       In South Yorkshire's case the
           contribution amounts to some [           ] of the Police
           Authority's budget.

           12. This would be the first special payment provided
           since the increase in police         from 50% to 51% which
           was intended in part to *aiifow/police authorities epjeateis
                        ^ » v f w - s Ks» A.t*
           oeopo to cushioa unexpected expenditure.

           13. There is no pre-determined formula for special
           payments. In deciding to adopt the formula used in the
           miners' strike we were taking account of the particular
           circumstances of this case.

           14. I have fu3riy considered/the points you made to me at
           the meeting. ^ I believe that the terms of the offer
           recognise South Yorkshire's position and the fact that
the investigation is contributing to the enquiry by Lord
Justice Taylor as well as being of relevance to South
Yorkshire Police. No more than £975,000 would need to be
contributed by the Authority whatever the costs.      On
current estimates, the costs may reach £4 to £5 million.
At that level of costs the authority would be
contributing between 23% and 20% of the total costs, and
the Government between 77% to 80%.

At the meeting with South Yorkshire Police Authority Lord Ferrers
undertook to write to them setting out the details of the proposed
special payment. A draft letter to the Chairman of the Authority
is attached for Lord Ferrers' consideration.

2.   Lord Ferrers asked whether a case might be made out to the
Treasury for further limiting South Yorkshire's maximum
contribution (for example from £975,000 to £500,000).

3.   The formulas used for previous special payments have varied
according to circumstances, but none of them, when applied to
anticipated costs of at least £4 million, would limit South
Yorkshire's contribution by any more than the proposed formula.
Some would have been less generous. We would thus be asking the
Treasury for a payment effectively more generous than all previous

4.   When we discussed this with the Treasury, they pointed out
that it would be the first special payment to a police authority
since police grant was increased from 50% to 51%. In 1988-89, for
example, South Yorkshire would have received [             ] more

5.   The Treasury could also have pointed to changes in the block
grant position which effectively treat police authorities, in
particular the metropolitan authorities, more favourably than was

6.   The Treasury also pointed out that assistance provided to

8.   There is also a claim for a special payment from Kent Police

and that there is a good case for putting it as it stands to the

                      POLICE

                      I promised to write to you following our recent meeting
                      on this subject. I would like to say that I very much
                      enjoyed meeting you and the other members of your Police
                      Authority.   I am only sorry that it should have been
                      occasioned by the distressing events at Hillsborough.
                      May I again express my sympathy for all of you at this
                      difficult time.

                      2.   I was very grateful for the clear and courteous way
                      in which you explained your Authority's position to me.

                      3.   As I understand the position, you accept that the
                      Chief Constable of South Yorkshire initially decided that
                      another force should be called in to investigate the
                      events at Hillsborough because it was desirable that the
                      investigation should be seen to be independent of South
                      Yorkshire police.

                                                                           35688 9.85 XNW
4.   You also take the view, as I understand it, that
when it was subsequently decided to establish the enquiry
under Lord Justice Taylor and to place the results of the
investigation at the service of that enquiry, this so
changed the character of the investigation, and its
scope, that as a matter of principle the South Yorkshire
Police Authority should no longer be expected to bear the
costs.

5.   You also made the point that the expected scale of
costs could be such as seriously to threaten the
efficiency of the South Yorkshire police force and could
not have been absorbed within the Authority»s own
resources.

6.   As I explained at the meeting, the Home Secretary
accepts that, because of the scale of the investigation
and its unexpected nature, the likely costs could not be
absorbed by South Yorkshire within the usual police
funding arrangements without serious detriment to the
efficiency of the force.

7.   He also recognises that, as a result of the decision
to make the results of the investigation directly
available to Lord Justice Taylor, it has been widened to
cover aspects which are specifically serving the purpose
of the enquiry.

8.   Nevertheless it remains the case that much of the
investigation will be concerned with the policing of
events on the day, a matter which is inescapably the
concern of the South Yorkshire police.

9.   Taking all these consideratons into account, the
Government is prepared to offer South Yorkshire Police
Authority a special payment towards the costs of the
investigation.  This would apply to costs incurred by
South Yorkshire Police Authority in reimbursing
additional costs incurred by West Midlands Police as a
result of the investigation.     (By additional costs we
mean costs such as overtime, travel, subsistence and
accommodation of personnel directly involved in the
investigation, together with consequential overtime costs
incurred as a result of the need to provide cover for the
officers assigned to the investigation.)

10. The level of assistance which we are prepared to
offer in this case would be for the Government to meet
90% of all costs once these reached the product of a lp
rate (which we understand would be around £1.3 million).
Moreover a limit would be placed on the total amount
which South Yorkshire Police Authority would have to
contribute.      Whatever the total costs of the
investigations, South Yorkshire would have to contribute
no more than the product of a 3/4p rate, which we
calculate would be about £975,000.

11. Special payments have previously been made in only a
small number of cases.    Government already contributes
substantially to police expenditure through police grant
and block grant.       In South Yorkshire's case the
contribution amounts to some [           ] of the Police
Authority's budget.

12. This would be the first special payment provided
since the increase in police grant from 50% to 51% which
was intended in part to allow police authorities greater
scope to cushion unexpected expenditure.

13. There is no pre-determined formula for special
payments.   In deciding to adopt the formula used in the
miners' strike we were taking account of the particular
circumstances of this case.

14. I have fully considered the points you made to me at
the meeting.   I believe that the terms of the offer
recognise South Yorkshire's position and the fact that
the investigation is contributing to the enquiry by Lord
Justice Taylor as well as being of relevance to South
Yorkshire Police. No more than £975,000 would need to be
contributed by the Authority whatever the costs.      on
current estimates, the costs may reach £4 to £5 million.
At that level of costs the authority would be
contributing between 23% and 20% of the total costs, and
the Government between 77% to 80%.

15. If you agree to proceed on these terms, we would
quickly put in hand arrangements to cover payments.
Also, my officials would be happy to discuss with yours
any queries they may have about the details of what would
qualify for payment.

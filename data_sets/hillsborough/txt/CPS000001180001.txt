Dear Sir

You are aware of our instructions on behalf of Mr Bernard Murray in relation to this
private prosecution which is next returnable at the Leeds Magistrates’ Court on 7
December. The papers are before you so that you can consider taking over this
private prosecution and quashing the proceedings. We would be grateful to know
whether the decision is going to be made by 7 December, or if not, what date the
decision will be made.

        Dear

        Thank you for your recent letter to the Minister for Sport which
        has   been  passed   to   this   department   in   view  of   our
        responsibilities for safety at sports grounds.    I apologise for
        the delay in replying to you.

        Your view that all seated accomodation at football grounds will
        not solve the problems of crowd safety and control has been
        noted. However, it is a view which the government does not share
        and which does not equate with the views expressed by Lord
        Justice Taylor in his Final report on the Hillsborough Stadium
        disaster.   He recognised that there was no single solution to
        achieve total safety and cure all the problems of crowd control.
        However, he was satisfied that seating does more to achieve these
        objectives than any other single measure.   Further more this is
        in line with the policies of both FIFA and UEFA.

        I have also noted your concern about the cost incurred by clubs
        in carrying out ground improvements.   However, this may not be
        quite so severe as you fear.    As you are probably aware the
        Government are making available £100 million to the football
        industry over a five year period to assist clubs in installing
        extra seats.  The Football Trust expects to provide clubs with
        a further £75 million over ten years, in addition to almost £26
        million provided each year by television and pools companies.
        Consequently there is a considerable ammount of money available
        to football clubs to make the necessary ground improvements.

        A further reason for the cost incurred by clubs being less than
        may be expected is that current attendances at many grounds are
        well below the maximum capacity of the ground.     Lord Justice
        Taylor commented, in his Final Report, that a small scale
        redevelopment possibly involving only part of the ground might
        be sufficient in some cases.


                                                           Yours sincerely


                                                           Steve Bilbe

 NOT OPENING THE FRONT PERIMETER GATES IN TIME. ✓           ING PEOPLE BACK INTO THE

 CROWDED PENS THEY WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OUT            PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO AftfS WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THI;

 J UDICIAL INQuIN Y ?

 I THINK THE WHOLE SITUATION WAS CAUSED BY THE INCREDIBLE TRAFFIC JAMS OUTSIDE

 AND THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE OUTSIDE TRAFFIC POLICE AND POLICE

 IN SHEFFIELD AND IN THE GROUND,       THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE FANS WOULD BE

 DELAYED AND THEREFORE WHEN THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY THE CASE THE GAME SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN DELAYED,       THIS WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE CRUSH OUTSIDE AND THE GATE WOULD

 NOT HAVE BEEN NEEDED TO BE OPENED,       THE CENTRAL PENS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED

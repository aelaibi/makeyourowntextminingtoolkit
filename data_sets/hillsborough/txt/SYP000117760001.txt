                 causing        crowd control          problems.          I recall         quite     clearly an officer -

      shouted      the    nec e s s a r y orders and         set     off       running    towards        the

      was a male         but   I d o n ’t,know       if    it was alive            or dead.        The    tunnel          had

      people     in it but       to the       best    of my        recollection          it wa s n ' t    packed.          At

      the end of the           tunnel I t      was    split        by a fence and           1 ran down          to the

people     back and y e l l i n g at           them to       clear         the    stand,



I made my way 'to the               front      of the      crowd w hich was               tigh t l y    packed,

yelling      at the      spec t a t o r s     to clear       the    stand.             I could near          other

oft leers      behind me doing              the    same    thing.          As    I got    to the       front,       the

press    of the       crowd dim inshed ana a space a p p e a r e d                        in front        of me,,         1

could see a pile             of bodies         against       the wall,            mv    recollection          is that

they    looked as         if they       had been         piled on          top of one a n o t h e r          like

bricks.        I*m not       sure     how many          there were          probably       7 to     10.       The

faces    of the       bodies      that      I could see were                purple and mottled,                they

locked     to me as        if they were a l r e a d y           dead,,



There was an officer                on the fence           Kicking          at    it and     1 think he was-

joined     by another,            1 don't         recall     how    but         1 realise     they were         trying

to get     the    fence      open     so that w <s could get                    the    dead and     injured         out

managed      to force        an opening.               Having   done        that we       lifted       the    bodies

over    the wall       and     onto     the    pitch where          they were            laid out.           i. recall

that    o f f i c e r s / s p e c a t a t o r s also    carried     some         of the deaa/i,njured back

up towards        the tunnel          entrance,,



Once    the bodies         had- b e e n ’cleared          I got     over         the wall     and      onto    the

pitch.       I recall        helping        to, carry an         injured          fan across        the      pitch

  shouting       etc.         The middle           sect i o n of the           gym was       ope r a t i n g as a

  then     left the            gym and as           I made my way back                onto     the      pitch I     was

  grabbed       by s Chief           Inspector         or      Superintendent            and             told      to      get        some

  was    so    laboured        I felt       that     he might         have a c o llapsed                lung,

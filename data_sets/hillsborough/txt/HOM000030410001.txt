Subject:     HILLSBOROUGH

We spoke about further requests for information and statements on Hillsborough.

I understand from Ms Adlington that she still requires statements R566D Brooke, R109 Wallace and
R336 Huckstepp and the original version of R293 Illingworth’s statement. I believe we are also
committed to providing her with the original version of PC2909 Wild’s statement (QOR 84). I have
the three page version of the statement which I understand is the amended version.

Miss Adlington had also queried the meaning of the QOR, etc references and the relationship
between the Q O R and ORMNF files.

There is an outstanding request for disclosure of the statement from Dr Jacob. Can you let me
know whether or not he has given his consent to its release.

Thank you for your assistance.
                                              Vv.-

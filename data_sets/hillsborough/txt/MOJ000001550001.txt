                SKELETON ARGUMENT OF BERNARD DEAN JMURRAY



 1.     The discretion to authorise funding in this case is derived from the statutory power under

 section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972 and the statutory duty under section 6 of the

 Police Act 1996.



 The power

 2.2    The power of the police authority: Section 111(1) LGA 1972, so far as is material:

             a local authority shall have power to do anything (whether or not involving the

        expenditure ... of money...) which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or

        incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions.”



                                                  1

          the word “functions” embraces all the duties and powers of a local authority; the sum total

    of the activities Parliament has entrusted to it. Those activities are its functions.” (Per Lord

    Templeman, Hazell *v- Hammersmith L.B.C. [1992] 2 A.C. 1 at page 29F.)



    2.3.     ITie sub-section is couched in the widest possible terms, It is elementary that such a broad

    enabling provision cannot empower a local authority to do an unlawful act, or to do anything

    which is expressly or by necessary implication prohibited by other statutory provisions, or to do

    anything which is not truly in discharge of its functions. But unless so limited the power exists

    and is cxercisable subject only to challenge on the basis of an improper exercise of discretion

    amounting to Wednesbury unreasonableness.



    2.4       Section 111 (3) is an example of an express limitation. It restricts the power to raise or

    lend money except in accordance with other statutory provisions relating to those matters. But

    this has no relevance to the present case. The police authority’s resolution does not involve

    borrowing or lending money.



    The duty

    3.1      The duty of the police authority: Section 6(1) of the Police Act 1996 (re-enacting s.4 of

    the Police Act 1964 as amended1):

             “Every police authority ... shall secure the maintenance o f an efficient and

             effective police force for its area.”


            1 Section 4 of the 1964 Act operated in conjunction with the common law principle that
    whatever is fairly incidental to those things which the Legislature has authorized ought not unless
    expressly prohibited to be held as ultra vires: A-G-v- Great Eastern Railway Co, (1879-80) 5 Applicant
    Cas, 473. This is the principle which became enshrined in section U 1(1) of the 1972 Act.

Discharge of this statutory duty is a function of the authority within the meaning of section

 111(1) above. The scope of the duty under section 6(1) is not restricted to fulfilment of the

 objectives provided for by sub-sections (2) and (3). The matters there mentioned are not

 exhaustive of the objectives which the police authority may promote in discharge of the section

 6(1) duty.



 3.2     In R -v- Derbyshire Police Authority, ex p. Wilson (unreported, 20 July 1989), the scope

 of section 6, (then section 4 of the 1964 Act) was said to define the duty of the police authority

 and the purposes for which the authority may spend the money provided, namely to secure the

 maintenance of an adequate and efficient police force: Ralph Gibson L.J., (pp.4-5).



 3.3     Adapting Lord Templeman’s speech in Hazell -v- Hammersmith L.B.C.:

 “Accordingly a local authority can do anything which is calculated to facilitate or is conducive

 or incidental to the local authority’s function of [securing the maintenance o f an efficient and

 effective police force fo r its area],” (ibid. page 29F).



 3.4     A police authority is entitled to be guided by Home Office advice in determining the

 scope of its duty to secure the ‘maintenance of an efficient and effective police force5, (see R -v-

 Derbyshire Police Authority, exp. W'z/.scw(unreported, 20 July 1989), per Ralph Gibson L.J. 6-7).

 Home Office circulars 77/1987 and 4/1998 have both stressed the importance o f police officers

 being able to carry out their duties in the confidence that their police authority will support them

 if they act in good faith and exercise their judgment reasonably. With reference to the scope of

 the power under section 111(1) of the 1972 Act, paragraph 5 of Circular 4/1988 states:

        "... It could be argued that to allow payment to be made to officers (either former
       or serving) involved in criminal proceedings would in some way facilitate or be

       conducive to the police authority’s broad functions. For example, failure to

       provide financial assistance could adversely affect the morale of the force if

       officers had to meet their own costs after an acquittal.”

It is important to note that payment of costs after an acquittal is given by way of example only.

The principle at issue is as to the provision of financial assistance in general. Paragraph 6 states:

       “It is for individual police authorities to decide in the particular circumstances of

        a case and on the basis of legal advice whether to make financial assistance

        available to officers in Criminal Proceedings.”

The original decision of the police authority was correct in principle and well within the proper

exercise of a discretion under Section 6 of the 1996 Act. The proposed payments were rightly

judged to be calculated to facilitate, to be conducive to, and to be incidental to, the discharge of

the functions arising from section 6.



Section 88 - Liability fo r wrongful acts o f constables

4.1    Section 88 of the Police Act 1996 (re-enacting section 48 of the Police Act 1964) does

not determine or affect the scope of the section 6 duty with respect to funding the defence of

criminal charges brought against individual officers.



4.2     The section exists simply to extend the common law doctrine of vicarious liability for tort

to the relationship between the chief constable and his officers: (the original statutory provision

reversed the decision in Fisher -v- Oldham Corporation [1930] 2 K.B. 364), and to make

consequential provisions as to the payment of damages and costs by the police authority which

would otherwise fall upon the chief constable by operation of sub-section (1). Sub-sections (2)

                                                  4
and costs, which is the usual position of a vicariously liable employer, From the standpoint of

the parliamentary draftsman, sub-sections (2) and (4) are made necessary by what goes before.



4.3        Sub-section (2) imposes a duty to indemnify the chief constable in respect of damages

as well as costs. This is on the premise that he is liable only as a joint tortfeasor by operation of

sub-section (1).



4.4        Sub-section (4) becomes necessary to accomplish two objectives which would not arise

by necessary implication if it did not exist. First, it makes clear that the police authority may

relieve the principal tortfeasor of liability. But secondly, and importantly, it has effect that the

authority may make a payment in respect of damages as well as costs. This establishes an

important principle which would not necessarily be derived from the terms of section 111(1) of

the Local Government Act 1972 if that were the only statutory authority for such a payment.

Having provided authority for payment of damages, it is a natural and necessary next step to

associate that with express power to make payment in respect of costs.



4.5        There is nothing inherently contrary to ordinary canons of statutory construction m

parliament making an express provision for something which might arguably be derived by

 implication from another statutory provision, especially where to omit an express provision

 might, in the context of other express provisions, be mis-interpreted.



                                    on, sub-section (4) cannot be interpreted as demonstrating that
 4.6        On its proper construction,
                               to a police authority to fund a criminal defence.
 parliament has given no power to a

 4,7     Once the provisions of the section are understood in this way, the principle expressio

 unius can be seen to have no application to the true interpretation of the scope of the power under

 section 6. Section 88(4) is not to be interpreted as precluding financial assistance for non-tort

 claims. It is not, and cannot possibly have been intended to be, a provision circumscribing the

 authority’s powers in discharge of its wide-ranging statutory duty under section 6,



 Cases on Section 111(1)

 5.1     None of the cases justifies a conclusion that the section 111(1) power is limited by other

 provision or authority so as to preclude the police authority from deciding to authorise

 expenditure in what it perceives to be a proper discharge of its duty under section 6.



 5.2     Mazell -v- Hammersmith and Fulham L. B. C. (1992]2A.C. 1. Two main issues arose:

 first, whether swap transactions were within section 111(1) of the 1972 Act; second, whether an

 interim strategy o f damage limitation after it appeared the swaps might be ultra vires was within

 the sub-section. The swap transactions were held to have been ultra vires because they were not

 incidental to Ihe authority's borrowing fund,on “having regard to the p r o v is io n s „„<) limitation,

 of the Aet of 1972 regulating that taction " . (See Lord Templeman, p.31E.) This is a clear

example o f the general power of section 1 11(1) being circumscribed by other specific statutoiy

provisions, namely Schedule 13 of the 1972 Act, which Lord Templeman said (page 33H-34A):

“establishes a comprehensive code which defines and limits the powers of a local authority with

regard to its borrowing. The Schedule is in my view inconsistent with any incidental power to

enter into swap transactions.” Transactions under the interim strategy were struck down

they could only have been incidental to transactions which were themselves ultra vires.

 5.3    McCarthy & Stone (Developments) Ltd -v- Richmond Upon Thames London Borough

 Council [1992] 2 A.C. 48. The House of Lords held that pre-application planning advice was not

 a function within section 111 (1), and that to charge for such a service did not facilitate, nor was

 it conducive to or incidental to, functions of considering and determining planning applications.

 It followed that to charge for such a service could not be brought within the sub-section. Lord

 Lowry (page 75 A ) categorised such charges as “incidental to the incidental and not incidental to

 the discharge of the functions.”



 5.3     Credit Suisse -v- Waltham Forest L.B.C. [1997] Q.B. 362 [C.A.] Here the Court of

 Appeal struck down the authority’s guarantees to a bank in respect of loans to a company the

 authority had set up in breach of its statutory powers; similarly, an agreement to indemnify the

 company was ultra vires. Again, the basis of the successful challenge to the authority’s action

 was that it contravened other express statutory provisions. Neill L.J. said (374 C): "... where

 Parliament has made detailed provisions as to how certain statutory functions are to be carried

 out there is no scope for implying the existence of additional powers which lie wholly outside

the statutory code ” (It is important not to be misled by the immediately following reference in

his judgment to section 111(3): “Section 111(3) makes it clear (he power to enter into financial

obligations is subject to any statutory controls which may be imposed,” ‘Financial obligations’

refers to lending and borrowing only; there are no relevant statutory controls affecting the present

situation.) Credit Suisse -v-Allerdale Borough Council [1997] Q.B. 306 [C.A.J is to the same

effect in different circumstanccs.




5.4    Sutton L.B. C. -v- Morgan Grenfell & Co L td(1996) 29 H.L.R. 608. Here, guarantees and

indemnities were struck do™ because they were held not to be incidental to the authority’s

7.1    The Police Authority is not proposing to indemnify the Applicant in respect of any

penalty imposed by a criminal court.



7.2    Whatever the position in 1948, a resolution by a responsible public body to provide

funding of or towards the costs of a criminal defence is not contrary to contemporary public

policy or otherwise unlawful: see Home Office Circulars 1987 (paragraphs 3 and 4) and 1998

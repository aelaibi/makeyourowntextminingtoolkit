            At 8.30am on Saturday the                15th April     1989 I came on duty at Doncaster

            Police Station in order to work the football semi final at

            Hillsborough,         Along with other officers            I went to the car park

             opposite the Police Station where                I met with other members of my

            The sergeant and Inspector               in charge of my serial were to be met at

            Hi 1lsborough.

            At 8.45am I boarded a double decker bus and in convoy with other
                                                                           PAGE

vehicles set off for Hillsborough,

At 9.40am I attended in the North Stand of the Ground for parade and
                              N X /o h - tr
briefing and was met by Inspector Wardle who was to be in charge of

serial 44. F ollowing briefing the serial     consisting   in full of ten

police constables,    one police sergeant and Inspector Uiardle got         into a

transit van.                                                    „      n     .

At approximately    11am w e took up position on the main road running

through Oughtbridge.      Our task was to h e the stopping of all Transit

Vans,   minibuses and coaches carryiryg football   supporters       in order to

check for alcohol    related offencf^,   to seise any alcohol   found and

deal with any offences which ccmie to light as we thought necessary.

The first hour or so was      particularly quiet supporters then started to

pass through. Vehicles were stopped by officers and searched

passengers   in transits and minibuses were asked^to get out of the

vehi cles .< AI cohol was seized from some vehicji'es and disclaimers

signed,   all fans were    in jovial mood and caused no fuss when told they

would have to hand over the alcohol.      In total 28 mini buses/

transits were stopped and 12 coaches. Just under      100 bottles and cans

were seised the majority of vehicles only had three or four cans,             one

coach had over fifty.     A large number of empty cans were taken from the

vehicles the supporters knowing they would be seised once in the

Sheffield area.



At about 2.45^m the serial      left Oughtbridge to attend Clay Wheels

Traffic Divisyon for a cooked meal.

At 3.05pm w/ e n just being served with our meals we were told by

Inspector Wardle to leave them and go straight away to the Tryansit to

attend at the ground as fans were fighting on the pitch. Only the

Sergeant,^and Inspector had radios and were aware of what was being

said at the ground.    We attended at the Leppings Lane entrance where
                                                                                   PAGE         3
                                                                                   £>2746

other serials already were,                 were told by senior officer to form a

line across the entrance.          D ue    to the number of officers      present our

serial was split up. There was no officer near me with a radio and I

was unaware what was happening              inside the ground,      due to what had been

said earlier I assumed fans were fighting.



A middle aged man,       a Liverpool        supporter then walked past      infront of

me and the other officers asked us what we were doing out here when

people inside were being          crushed and dying. Two further fans

teenagers walked past saying similar things.



I then moved from the front of the entrance around the wall                   into the

yard behind the West Stand where              I was    confronted by the sight of

people    lying on the floor with o/ff i cers and g a t h e r       people attempting to

resuscitate t h e m . A senior officer asked XJna.% the exit from the tunnel

be kept    clear which seemed impossible to do due to the number of

frantic and h y s , U i u . f a n s .     Along/with two other officers f r/Sm my

serial,   Pc Zomitie r f i e]A and Pc F y i ce.   I went t hrough the t^tj/nel into         I

believe Pen 4. The middle a r e s of the pen was relatively empty of fans

and near to the perimeter fence were officers and fans struggling to

lift bodies out onto the pitch behind they^oal area. We went down to

the front and along with other o f f i c e r ^ carried a m a n , who had stopped

breathing back out through the tunne/.                The man was    laid out in

the yard and Pc Zommerfield attemp/ed to resuscitate him,                   he was   left

in charge of a nurse but appeared to be already dead.

The three of us then went back onto the terraces and stood in Pen 4

which had now been cleared of bodies.                 A large number of entangled

bodies were     laid by the goal area.          We continued to stand in the

terraces along with other officers whilst Liverpool                  suppporters

chanted at us,      threw coins at us and blamed us for the death of the

            fans. The fans started to pull down the advertisement boards which

            were       passed by us to the   pitch to use as stretchers.

            After some time we moved onto the pitch which was by now relatively

            clear of bodies. Fans were wandering around us and the odd one pointed

            the finger and put the blame onto us for supposedly causing what had

            happened. We were told to move to the centre of the pitch there

            appeared to be some concern about the Liverpool and Nottingham

            supporters       clashing.   I stayed in the centre of the pitch for some

            t i me .

            At about 5.15pm myself Pc Price and Pc Zommerfield left the ground to

            join the rest of our serial outside. We went back to the transit van

    •       where we patrolled the area.         All the fans   left the groundyfuietly and

            with no apparent       problems. Sometime after 6pm our seri^/T was stood

            down a n d we went to Clay Wheels Traffic Division f a r / r e f r e s hm e n t , and

            just after 7pm we boarded the bus to return to Doncaster.



            At 7.45pm we arrived at Doncaster Police Station where I booked in

            property,      the alcohol   seized, and at 8.00pm I went off duty.

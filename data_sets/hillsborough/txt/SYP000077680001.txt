                        All    was    quiet          and       first          arrivals             appeared             to       be       about       12.30pm

                    (1230)       -    1.00pm          (1300).                 On       occasions          I    spoke             with          stewards             on      the

                    North       Stand          lower       gangways                and       looked       out          onto          the       pitch       and        other

                    areas       of    the       ground.              I       saw       that       the    covered             cop          area       and       South          STand

                    I    discussed             with    stewards                   the       movement          of       fans          in    and       around           the         cop

                    At    2.30pm          (1430)       there             were          signs       of    increased                   activity             in     the        North

 I    discovered                   that             two       Officers          had        arrested                a    man       and       were       surrounded

 by    an    angry                crowd             of    other       men.            For       a       few    moments             the       scene          was

 frightening                      and       I       feared          the    worst,           but          I    think          that       I    heard          the       roar

 of    the       crowd             inside                the    ground          and        most          of    the       men       near       us       ran       towards

 the       stand          seating                   area.           The    two        Officers,                which          I    cannot          identify,

 walked          away             from          us       with       the    arrested                 man.

 Suddenly             I       heard             a    shouted          cry       from        one          of    the       Policemen                around          me,       a

 message          to          the       effect                that    we    were           required                on    the       pitch.              I    didn't          at

 that       time          know          or          understand             why.

 I    ran    up       to          the       gangway             *A'       and       looked              onto       the       pitch.           I    saw       that

 there       were             a    number                of    spectators                 and       Policemen                around          the       rear       and

 side       (South                Side)             of    the       Leppings              Lane          end    goal          area.           It    appeared

 that       all       Officers                      were       making       their           way          onto          the    pitch          and       I    followed.

 As    I    entered                the          pitch          over       the       stand           w^sll      I       tried       to       remain         with

 those       Officers                   of          my    Serial.           At        some          stageM              joined          other          Officers             in

 effecting                a       full          cordon          across          the        pitch          just          outside          the       18      yard        box.

             I    remained          there            for    a    while          and    w*as    then       instructed             by   a   Sergeant          to

             go    to    an\ccess                gate       in       front       of    the\ ^ p i r i g s        Lane       terraces          next     to

             the    North       S T aa mm tU .        This       was       an    access        gate       from       the    terraces          onto     th e

             pitch       and    was       the         size       of    a    door       inside        the    perimeter             fencing.

             There       were       a    lot         of    people,          spectators,              on    the       pitch       by    this    time.          My

             instructions               as       I    recall          were       to    prevent        people          from       leaving       that     area

             of    the    terracing                  to    gain       entry       onto        the    pitch.

             This       section         was          probably          less       than        half    full.           There       were       huge    areas

             of    empty       spaces.                                                                          s\

             a n n o u n c e i M m to t h e                effect          that       the     match       was    over       and       this    was    soon

             followed          by       the      exodus          of    Liverpool              fans    from       the       Leppings          Lane    end.

             At    this    joined             others            on    the       pitch.         I    spoke       with       Inspector          WOODWARD

             and    PS    McCALL          and         some       time       later       I     returned          to    the    seating          area     of

             the    North       Stand            where          I awaited             further        instructions.

             At    6.43pm       (1845)               I was       told       to    go    off        duty.

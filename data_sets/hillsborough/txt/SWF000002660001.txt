I,     MALCOLM      BAIN of
             will say as follows


I    was     born       on the                                  I am employed as



I     have    been a steward with Sheffield Wednesday Football                                       Club
for     at    least the last twelve years and all my time                                  has       been
spent in the West Stand.                      For this season I have been a gateman
at C gate. •


Before       the        start     of     each season an annual                meeting           of     the
stewards       is held at the club and representatives from the Fire
Brigade        and         Police        attend     to        give    talks        on      emergency
procedures.              They          also     show     us     how    to     use         the         fire
extinguishers.              Emphasis           is   also placed on the                  gates        being
manned       at all times and that only police and officials can                                        be
allowed       through.           Reference          is also made to the code                     to     be
announced          on    the     public         broadcast        system       to        announce        an
emergency evacuation.


This       season there have been a couple of evacuation                                  practices.
A     practice       was        held about three league                matches          before         the
semi-final arranged for the 15th April.


I     now turn to my involvement in the events that took place                                          on
15th April 1989 at Hillsborough.


I     arrived at the ground at 11.15 a.m. I had been working                                          that
morning       but had spoken to Stuart Thorpe at the previous                                        match
to     say that I would be a little late.                            He understood as I                was
working        and said there was no problem as we both knew that the
other        two men would be at the ground in plenty of time to take
up     their posts.             The other two gatemen that day were Ian Marsh
                                                - 2 -


and Richard Beadsley.                  Three gatemen are allocated to C gate.


On     my arrival at the ground, I went up to the snack bar at the
rear      or        top    of the West Stand and collected             my      stewards
jacket        from      Stuart Thorpe.          I went down onto C gate        and   the
other two were already there.                    The gate was unlocked.


The gates are always unlocked before any of the gatemen arrive.
We     all said to each other that it was very quiet.                       About    1.40
p.m.     we       were commenting to the police that the build                  up   was
very small.            We were outside C gate talking to the police.


The     police had a barrier by C gate which was at the back of                         C
gate     and at 90 degrees to C gate.                   There were two women police
officers          and     three policemen outside the gate.            An     Inspector
attended from time to time.


Behind        the turnstiles there were about a dozen police officers
including two women police officers.


There     were          about four or five more police officers more                 than
would        be    deployed for a league match.              I remember that I         did
not     recognise any of the police officers as they were not                          the
normal        faces       that         the stewards see at     football      matches     at
Hillsborough.              There        were also police outside the         turnstiles
although I have no idea as to the numbers.


We     kept       the     gate        open about 18 inches.     This saves us        from
constantly             opening         and shutting the gate.       Two stood outside
the     gate       and     one        behind.   By   about   2.15     p.m.,    we were
suffering          a     lot     of     hassle from supporters       trying    to    gain
access        through C gate without tickets.                Some of the supporters
were     trying          to give us money and at one point I              fetched      the
Inspector          who was inside C gate to have a word with one or two
of     the        supporters           who were abusive.     This Inspector is         the
Ground        Inspector          for the Leppings Lane end.          He hasa    beard.
I do not know his name but he is a regular face.

He     told me to shut the gate and not to open it accept for                                           the
police.             I also asked if Police horses could be used to                                     keep
supporters           away from the gate but he said that it could not be
done.           I        cannot remember whether I closed the gate                               as     the
three     gatemen take it in turn to do this.                               It rathers           depends
upon     who is closest to the gate at the time when the                                     decision
is made to open or shut it.                   The gate was fully closed.


At     about 2.45 p.m. to 2.50 p.m. I noticed that the                                     supporters
were     starting           to     climb over the turnstile huts.                         All         three
gatemen        did        not know what was happening outside                            although        we
were     aware           that a large crowd was gathering.                        We      could        hear
banging        against           the gate from the outside.                   It is        impossible
to open the gate from the outside.


I     should     mention           that     just     before 2          p.m.       eight      or        nine
Liverpool            stewards        arrived.         By    that           time     it    was         still
reasonably           quiet.         They were wearing steward's jackets.                                One
remained       with us and the others went elsewhere.                                  However, more
stewards       turned            up showing photo passes and I told them                               that
no more stewards would be admitted.


At     about        2.45     p.m.     to 2.50 p.m. I remember                      saying        to     the
police     that           I could not understand where all                        the      supporters
were     coming           from.      I     remember seeing             a    woman         crying        and
shouting            as      she     attempted        to    gain        access          through          the
turnstiles.               There     was     a terrible crush in                   front     of        those
turnstiles           although I was unable to gain a good view.                                  I could
hear screaming and shouting.


More     and     more supporters tried to climb over the roof of                                        the
trunstiles.              Many supporters came over and told us to opent the
gates.


The     Police ejected some of the supporters who had climbed over
the     roof of the turnstiles and did not have tickets, or                                           where
supporters           attempted        to     get through turnstiles and                      did        not
have     tickets.            The     gate    was opened           by       the     gatemen            about
                                                -   4 -


fifteen       to twenty times to eject supporters in this way.                          The
gate    was         opened about three fee to do this.               These       ejections
took    place         over     a     period of 20-30 minutes.          It    is     common
practice        for     Police           Officers to eject supporters        through      C
gate.        However,         if     the Police encounter      any     problems         (for
example       violence)            the     offending supporter is      taken       to   the
Police room in the North stand.


At     this time there were a large number of people milling about
behind        us.      Many were quite abusive and were shouting at                     the
Police and the stewards.


I     then     heard an order to open the gates.               I do not          know   who
gave the order.              All three gatemen including myself stood for a
second upon hearing the order not knowing what to do.                             At least
I     was not sure what I should do but the Police were in control
and almost instantaneously two Police Officers opened the gate.
We     moved away to ensure that we were not caught in the path of
those        about     to     come through.          The fans at the head          of    the
queue        fell     forward but then regained their feet                  and    carried
on.     Most of the           supporters headed towards the tunnel.


I     remember that the gate was opened very soon after a roar                            in
the crowd as the game was already underway.                     I believe this may
have     been        when     Peter Beardsley hit the crossbar.                  The    gate
remained            fully     open for some three to four minutes                 and   was
then fully closed.


I     cannot        remember        who closed the gate.      Nor can        I    remember
whether an order was given by the police to close the gate.


We     were     then        told to open the gate by a police               officer      but
only     about three feet.                 Police outside C gate were marshalling
supporters           through and checking their ticket.               We also checked
the tickets as they came through.


I     remember that a young lad came out and said that his stomach
was     on fire and that people were being crushed on the terrace.
                                               - 5 -


Someone       else      called out that somebody was dead.                   The         police
officers            beind the turnstiles disappeared.             After that it was
chaos.         I find       it difficult to remember what happened.                      A lot
of     people       were standing by the partition wall                  holding          their
chests.


I     remember        seeing     a    police officer giving         mouth         to      mouth
resuscitation           right outside the C gate.              Ambulance men arrived
and     one         tried to put a pipe into his mouth.                 I    remember the
ambulanceman           saying        that it was too late, the man               had      gone.
The     police        officer        took off his tunic and put             it     over     his
face.


A      number       of people were brought out sometimes on                       stretchers
and     laid         down in the lane outside C gate.              The      deputy         chief
steward,        Albert Marsh, told me that those people laid out were
dead.


I     moved     from C gate to B gate and directed some                      firemen        who
came     through        B gate.           I pointed them in the direction of                the
central        tunnel.         Sometime        later I was told that             there     were
thirteen dead.


I     also     remember        taking off my        jacket.      Stewards          including
myself        had     suffered        a    great   deal   of    abuse       by     Liverpool
supporters          milling about in the area behind the turnstyles and
the jackets provided an easy form of identification.


I     said     to a fellow steward, someone I know by his first                            name
only,                 that I would have to go home.              I was upset by what
I had seen.           I left at about 3.45 p.m./4.00 p.m.


At     last year's semi-final I was positioned in the seated                               area
or     West Stand.          I have seen the tunnel closed on two or                       three
occasions,          but only in relation to League games and also                          when
the     West stand including the terrace was divided between                               home
and     away        fans.    There are wooden doors to this tunnel and                       on
those        occasions I saw Police Officers shut the doors and stand
in     front     directing fans elsewhere.


When the West stand was divided between home and away fans, the
home      fans obtained entry to the ground through turnstiles 9-16
for      the     seated      area and the North West pen.    The        away fans
gained entry through turnstiles A-G and they were allocated the
remainder         of the terrace and a part of the seated            area. The
Police,         at least initially, kept the centre pens open but             not
the       South        West pen.   A barrier was put across the South        West
pen,           sometimes bothwere opened for away fans depending             upon
the       size of the crowd.         These occasions I have described        when
the      tunnel was closed, occurred before the partition wall                was
built.


For      this     season and the last two seasons the West           stand    has
been for away fans only.             For League games, the Police keep the
North West pen empty and the gate to the partition wall is shut
but      unlocked.        Usually a steward is deployed on the gate.          The
Police         also    put   up barriers near the snack     bar    to     prevent
access         to the South West pen.        I have not seen Police Officers
shut the doors to the central tunnel, but I have seen Police in
ftont of this tunnel and have also heard them say to supporters
that           the     pens were full and they have     then directed       those
supporters to the South West pen.


The       main        difference   between   this   years   and    last     years
semi-final            is that at this year's semi-final there was still a
large      crowd of people still trying to gain entry at about 2.55
p •in*


This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

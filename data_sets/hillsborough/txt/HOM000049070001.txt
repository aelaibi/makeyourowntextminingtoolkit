 1                                             Wednesday, 8th October,   19 97
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I am having a transcript made of
 3         this for my purposes, but obviously if you want a copy of
 4         it you can have it.        I think I have said to everybody that
 5         if there is anything further that you to want to say when
 6         you get home and     you       realise    there is something you have
 7         forgotten to say     you       then write to me.      I havebeen an
 8         advocate for a long time and I realise that one does not
 9         always remember the things one wants to say until
10         afterwards.
11              I have read your very clear letter.           How would you
12         like to deal with this?       Do you want to tell me more do or
13         you want me to ask you questions about what you say in
14         your letter?    How would you like to deal with it?
15   MR.   JONES:    A little   bit       of both     actually. I havemade some
16         further notes, they're in no particular order.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You not say what you want to say, I
18         may interrupt you for clarification as we go through but
19         otherwise will give you your head, so to speak?
20   MR.   JONES:    First of all, I would like to thank you for taking
21         the time to see us.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Not at all.
23   MR.   JONES:    I think you should        know a little bit about our
24         son, Gary.     He was 18.     This was his first away match.       We
25         were never happy for him to go but he wanted          to go and -we
26         thought it's bound be okay          but of course, as you know, it
27         wasn't.
28              I'll just carry on with these notes from when the
29         incident happened the way we were treated as a family by
30         the police on the night.        I know this is nothing to do
31         with new evidence but the letter from Jack Straw said:
32         "No matter of insignificance will be overlooked."
33              We actually identified Gary at 0230 in the morning,
34         so we were all in a state of shock.          Then we were
35         interrogated, that's the best way I can put it, by the
36         police asking various questions, for example, did he ha*ve


                                           2
 1         a ticket. In my view that's when, what I call, the cover
 2         up started.        They wanted to get their story right.     We
 3         were all in a state of shock.        What they should have done
 4         was to come and see us at a later date.
 5                  Gary actually arrived at the ground just after       2
 6         o'clock and he was seen, that is in a statement from a
 7                              so he was in the ground at 2.05.     He was
 8         actually taken from the terraces at 3.26.           This appears in
 9         Gary's file, I don't know if you have got a copy but you
           are very welcome--
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I have not got a copy at the moment
12         but I will certainly get hold of a copy.           Do you want to
13         let me have that?
14   MR.   JONES:     Yes, as long as    obviously if you could return it.
15         There are some photographs---
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I shall be getting the original
17         body file from the police, which should be the same as
18         this.      I will look at this now for the points you want to
19         make and then I can understand them.
20   MR.   JONES:     He was actually    taken off the pitch at 15.26.
21         There's a photograph of him being taken over the fence, a
22         long range photograph.        He was attended to on the pitch by
23         some firemen and at some stage a doctor.           That's all in
24         the file.      Then, if you could call it lucky, he was one of
25         the lucky few who was actually taken to hospital to
26         receive treatment.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         He was taken to the Northern
28         General?
29   MR.   JONES:      Yes.   He was revived briefly.   He didn't recover
30         consciousness and he actually died at 20 past 4, which
31         brings me on to the cut-off point       of 3.15.    How could he
32         be dead at 3.15 when he       was still alive so much later.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I think there has been a certain
34         amount of misunderstanding about this cut-off point.              What
35         the Coroner actually said was not that everybody was dead
36         at 3.15 but that they had received their injuries by 3.15,


                                           3
 1         he was well aware that some of them died later and I think
 2         everybody else was.     What he actually said, I have read,
 3         maybe you —     it is a long time ago now and one tends
 4         perhaps not to remember entirely accurately, but I have
 5         read the transcript of what he said.
 6   MRS. JONES:     We can remember everything very accurately.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I might be able to show it to you
 8         if need be, but I can assure you that what he said was
 9         that the people who did actually die had all received
10         their injuries by 3.15.
11   MRS. JONES:     An inquest is how, why and when, during all the
12         generic inquest Gary's name was never mentioned once,
13         apart from at the very end when they called all the names
14         out.     That was an inquest into his death no circumstances
15         were mentioned at all about Gary's death, he was just one
16         of a group of people.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Did you attend what they called the
18         mini-inquest?
19   MR.   JONES:    Yes, we did, we were the only family who took our
20         own solicitor with us because we had to prove certain
21         things, for example, the police made out he didn't have a
22         ticket and they made out that perhaps we were lying.        When
23         Gary got the ticket he was of it and he had it on the TV
24         ready so that everyone could see it and he used to keep as
25         souvenirs.     That upset us considerably.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      When you say the police made out
27         that he had not got a ticket what form did that take?
28   MRS. JONES:     That was a communication from our solicitor, our
29         solicitor came to see us and asked us could we prove that
30         Gary had a ticket.     Any matches Gary did attend at special
31         games he always kept a stub of his ticket, always.        We had
32         all his personal belongings returned to us and amongst
33         those belongings there was no stub of the ticket.       So we
34         would like to know, but we weren't able to ask, what
35         happened to the stub of that ticket.
36                Then when the mini-inquests were set up our solicitor


                                        4
 1         came along the night before we were due to go and said:
 2         "They are saying Gary did not have a ticket", implying
 3         that we had lied in our statement.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Did anybody say this at the
 5         mini-inquest?    Did anybody say at the mini-inquest that he
 6         had not got a ticket?
 7   MRS. JONES:    Nothing was mentioned because our solicitor them
 8         when he spoke to us and we confirmed that, yes, he did
 9         have a ticket we were then asked:        "Is there anyone els«
10         who can prove that he had a ticket?"        So we then had to
11         approach Gary's friend's father who actually saw Gary
12         going into the match with his ticket and he had to sign an
13         affidavit to say that Gary had a ticket.        There was just
14         no need whatsoever for the police actions in that.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It was very insensitive.
16   MRS. JONES:    We'd already signed —       on the night we told them
17         he had a ticket.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I entirely agree.
19   MR.   JONES:                     statement is in Gary's file
20         confirming that he saw him.        He was actually in Sheffield
21         round about 12.30.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I must say I think there was som«
23         insensitive behaviour.
24   MRS. JONES:    Another question we'd like asked is what happened
25         to his ticket?     We know he had it and we know he would
26         have kept it.    All his money, his keys, everything else
27         came back but no ticket.
28   MR.   BONE:    Ticket stub perhaps?
29   MRS. JONES:     That is what I'm saying, yes.
30   MR.   JONES:    He would have placed that in a safe place.
31   MRS. JONES:     He was in early so it wouldn't have been the case
32         that they were in such a rush that they just handed them
33         over.    He was there early.
34   MR.   BONE:    He would have gone through the turnstiles, the
35         ticket would have been in torn two and he'd keep the stub.
36   MRS. JONES:     That's right.


                                          5
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am afraid I am not going to be
 2        able to find the answer to       that problem now.
 3   MRS. JONES:     I am sure you can't but     we want to push     thepoint.
 4        The were questions we wanted asking and we were never
 5        allowed to ask these at the mini-inquest.        The only
 6        question our solicitor was       able to ask was about treatment
 7        Gary had received and they       then had to send out      forthe
 8        doctor from the hospital to come out because the statement
 9        the I think the Coroner made or the pathologist made at
10        the mini-inquest we weren't happy about so they then ha<i
11        to sent out for the doctor or certainly for the doctor to
12        make a further statement.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can I just perhaps say this; that
14        this question of people coming without tickets was a
15        matter which Lord Taylor went into in very great d e t a il .
16        There was lot of conflicting evidence about it.           The
17        police said that there were lot of people asking for
18        tickets and so on and so forth.
19   MRS. JONES:     That all happens all the time though.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Of course, I quite appreciate that.
21        There was also some evidence of people coming through
22        turnstiles doubling up and so on and so forth.           Lord
23        Taylor came to the conclusion that the number of people
24        who came in without tickets was small, I forget what
25        figure it was,    I think about 200.     That was his best
26        estimate based on the evidence at the time.
27             I have not been invited to consider any fresh
28        evidence in relation to that.        That to my mind is an issue
29        which does not need to be re-opened.        I accept his finding
30        and I think most other people would accept the finding
31        that there were number of people in the ground, got intc
32        the ground without tickets, that it was not in such
33        significant numbers to make a difference.        So so far as my
34        inquiry is concerned I do not think there is any point in
35        re-opening the issue of how many people came in without
36        tickets.     It is an impossible question to answer.        It was


                                       6
 1         difficult to answer in 1989, it is impossible to answer in
 2         1997.
 3                 As I have said, I have no fresh evidence about that,
 4         nobody has tendered any fresh evidence that there were —
 5         I do not see how there could be.       So I accept, as I accept
 6         a number of other findings of Lord Taylor, which relate
 7         particularly to what happened outside the ground at the
 8         turnstiles.
 9                 So if I could just tell you that.    I think this
10         question of people coming without tickets —        I understand
11         your concern, I understand your concern at the time of low
12         the matter was handled.      But the fact is that there has
13         been a lot of unhappy things happened in the wake of this
14         disaster, not least of the way it was handled.
15                 Can we go on with the next point you want to r a i s e.
16   MR.   JONES:     We attended the meeting on Monday and one of the
17         points you raised was about you thought that we received
18         compensation.     As a family who suffered a loss we are
19         actually offered by the insurance company involved the sum
20         of          |for Gary's pain and suffering and also the cost
21         of his ticket into the ground.       So we politely declined.
22         We were on a time-scale for that anyway, if we hadn't
23         taken it up by a certain date that went by the board.             So
24         we told them briefly that.
25                 The insurance company did pay for the funeral and
26         Gary's headstone.      So that is all the compensation that we
27         received.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Did you make a claim for
29         bereavement?
30   MR.   JONES:     We couldn't because Gary was just over 18.       Are
31         you referring to this, it was            |
                                                    ?
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes?
33   MR.   JONES:     No, we didn't because he was more than 18.       It nay
34         still be up to the age of 18, since Hillsborough that
35         figure has now been doubled to               So there was no
36         point in us making the claim because we wouldn't have got


                                         7
 1         anything, not that we wanted anything.      I thought I should
 2         make that point, that the insurance companies walked away
 3         very lightly in my opinion.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      So far as the death cases they
 5         undoubtedly did.    A lot of people think that compensation
 6         in respect of the death of somebody who is not the wage
 7         earner of the family, if I can put it like that, people
 8         who have no dependents, is very inadequate.      The problem
 9         about that is, as you are very well aware, no amount of
10         money can compensate for the loss of a --
11   MR.   JONES:   Absolutely.
12   MRS. JONES:    I think the point         is trying to make is that
13         we didn't receive compensation but that wasn't an issue
14         because we weren't looking for compensation, but he's
15         trying to put across you you were misinformed, when you
16         made your statement that on Monday that all the families
17         had been compensated.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Perhaps I was.   I am going to look
19         into the question of how much compensation was paid.           I
20         think, in fact, probably more substantial amounts have
21         been paid to the people who were not killed, the people
22         who suffered personal injury and made claims.      I do not
23         know what the total claim was.
24              The point that I wanted to make was that liability to
25         pay compensation was not disputed by the police.         The
26         amount of the claim obviously depended on the
27         circumstances of each particular case but there has never,
28         as far as   I am aware, been any   dispute that they were
29         liable to   pay. I am sure I am    right about that.     What is
30         the next point?
31   MR.   JONES:   We were a bit concerned at the fact that Dr.
32         Popper, an employee of Sheffield City Council, was allowed
33         to conduct the inquest.      We felt uncomfortable about this
34         because we felt that Sheffield City were paying Dr.
35         Popper's wages and that he would possibly be biased in         Ms
36         choice of   witnesses and inour    opinion that's what


                                         8
 1         happened regarding that.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Have you any views as to which
 3         witnesses he ought to have called and did not?
 4   MR.   JONES:      No, I haven't.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I am aware of this point about the
 6         video and Mr. Houldsworth,          I shall be seeing Mr.
 7         Houldsworth.
 8   MR.   JONES:     It all seemed to be heavily biased towards the
 9         establishment, for want of a better word.           As you know we
10         had one barrister against a battery of barristers provided
11         by everybody else and we had to fund that ourselves.           We
12         were offered three choices, a Rolls Royce, a medium car or
13         a Mini.     It actually turned to be something round the Mini
14         area.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Mr. King?
16   MR.   JONES:    Mr. King.   Who went on to greater things of course
17         and I'm a bit of a cynic and I think that probably helped
18         him in his career.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I have to say I have not read all
20         the evidence of the inquest but I have read a good deal of
21         Mr. King's cross-examination of Mr. Duckenfield and Mr.
22         Murray.     It did not seem to me that he was pulling his
23         punches.
24   MR.   JONES:     Possibly so but maybe it's his personality
25         sometimes, but I think Mr. Duckinfield's barrister was a
26         particularly good chap from Leeds, I can't remember his
27         name.     A very loud voice and really got his point in.
28         They seemed to get across to the jury.           It's all play­
29         acting at the end of the day, isn't it?
30   MISS JONES:      I went to the inquest only for one day and one of
31         the witnesses that was called he actually issued a safety
32         certificate for Hillsborough.          Every single question he
33         was asked he said,    "I'm sorry, I can't answer that
34         question.     I can't answer that question."        I just thought
35         it was just ridiculous, it was just a farce the whole
36         thing.


                                           9
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Did he not answer because he was
 2          warned by the Coroner not to do so because he might
 3          incriminate himself or he could not remember or what?
 4   MRS. JONES:      They were all warned by the Coroner that they
 5          didn't have to answer questions.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I noticed that; and also I
 7          particularly noticed with the two officers I have spoken
 8          to, probably two of the most important witnesses,
 9          Duckenfield and Murray, that although the Coroner kept on
10          telling them they did not have to answer the questions
11          they in fact did answer them.
12   MRS.   JONES: Some of them they did but       Mr. Popper also put
13          words into Mr. Duckenfield's mouth.        In one statement he
14          made to him at the end of Mr. Duckenfield's questioning
15          was,   "Do you think by your actions, Mr. Duckenfield, you
16          saved lives?"
17   MR.    JONES: He said,    "Yes."
18   MRS.   JONES: With a smug expression        on his face.   I mean   he
19          literally put those words into his mouth.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Whereabouts in his evidence was
21        that?
22   MRS. JONES:      That was at the very end because he stood up to
23          leave the witness box and Mr. Popper directed that
24          question at him.     There were representatives of 96
25          families sitting in that courtroom, well, not 96, perhaps
26          40, 50 sitting in that courtroom.       Now, how do you think
27          people would react to that?        How to you think the jury
28          would react to that?     We're not allowed to ask questions
29          and yet he is telling Mr. Duckenfield what he should
30          answer.   Does you   not think that is a biased opinion?
31                 It's not fresh evidence,     I know that because you have
32          all that there but we've got to put our point across, we
33          were not happy with the proceedings at the inquest one
34          little bit.     We didn't consider our son had an inquest
35          into how, why and    when he died and at the end of the day
36          he was one of our    most prized possessions and nothing          or


                                          10
 1         anything will ever replace him and we wanted answers and
 2         we, 8 years on, we still have no answers.       We still don't
 3         know how he died apart from he went to hospital and we
 4         were told by the doctor if he'd lived he would have been a
 5         cabbage.     I would have lived with a cabbage.
 6   MR.   JONES:     What we want is some justice and some peace of
 7         mind and we haven't had that.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Apart from prosecution of police
 9         officers concerned I am not quite sure how else we are
10         going to deal with thi s .   Do you think that there ought to
11         be another inquest so that the whole thing is gone into
12         again?
13   MR.   JONES:     I think that the inquest verdict should be changed
14         from accidental death to unlawful killing.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It would be impossible to do that
16         without having a fresh inquest.
17   MR.   JONES:     If we need a fresh inquest to bring that verdict
18         in based on--
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You think the whole thing should be
20         gone over again?
21   MR.   JONES:     I do indeed, not necessarily one every person, on
22         one person.     I don't know whether it's possible to apply
23         it to everyone else there.        There were some riders that I
24         seem to recall that Dr. Popper made to the Home Office.
25         What happened about that advice I don't know.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The verdict is clearly going to be
27         the same in each case so far as accidental death or
28         unlawful killing, is it not?
29   MR.   JONES:     In the outside world unlawful killing certainly
30         means a great deal more than accidental death.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Unlawful killing, in effect, in the
32         context of this case, in the context of most cases means
33         manslaughter.
34   MR.   JONES:     Okay, manslaughter then.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Accidental death, as I pointed out
36         on Monday, there is no verdict available to a coroner's


                                        11
 1          jury between accidental death and unlawful killing.          There
 2          is no negligence verdict available to a coroner's jury
 3          except in very specialised circumstances which do not
 4          apply here.      Some people think this is a fault in the law.
 5          Other people think, I have to say that I am one of them,
 6          this is perhaps irrelevant, that it is better to have
 7          questions of civil negligence determined by a High Court
 8          Judge than by a coroner and a coroner's jury.       This is why
 9          under the Act the coroner's jury and the coroner are not
10          entitled to make any finding on civil liability.
11                   Dr. Popper was entirely right in saying that a
12          verdict of accidental death does not mean that there is no
13          negligence on the part of other people and that the
14          police, the Club and possibly even the Sheffield City in
15          issuing the certificate were at fault.
16   MR.    JONES:     I hear what you are saying but in   the general
17          publi c 's eyes there is a difference between accidental
18          death and unlawful killing.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Of course, there is a great
20          difference.
21   MR.    JONES:     If that had appeared on the death   certificate,
22          which we never got, we would have probably been happy with
23          unlawful killing as against accidental death despite the
24          fact of what you have     just said.
25   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The point is that in order   to bring
26          in a verdict of unlawful killing it has to be tantamount
27          to a verdict of manslaughter.      There is all the difference
28          in the world, it is a question of degree, but there is all
29          the difference between civil liability for negligence and
30          criminal liability for manslaughter.
31   M R S . JONES: Can I ask you     what fresh evidence you are   going to
32          be looking at?      I mean, we know of the committee members
33          of the support group have produced evidence to you.          Are
34          you going to be looking at all this evidence?
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Of course.   One of the principal
36          areas which I am looking at is the question of video


                                         12
evidence.     I have had detailed submissions by leading
counsel about that, both in writing and orally.      That is
obviously a very important aspect of the case.      If the
submissions which Mr. Jones made to me are substantiated
then that is a very important question.     I have not
finished my investigation about that yet.     But that is
perhaps the most important aspect of it because it might
have a bearing on the question of manslaughter.
      The other aspects are the question of when people
died and the cut-off time and so on.     That is a more
difficult area in the context of re-opening the inquest
verdicts because I think it might be difficult to affect
the verdict of accidental death, whether somebody died at
3.15, 4 o'clock or 4.15.
      Another aspect of the matter which I am looking at,
whether or not it is strictly within the terms of
reference may be debatable but it is certainly something I
am looking at, is that a lot of families, I think you axe
included, have been unhappy at the discrepancies between
what appear now on the body files between various
witnesses and what was said in the summary of the inquest.
So far as I can I shall try and see if I can help about
t ha t.
      The problem is that while I can look at the
documentary evidence I am not at all sure that any further
oral examination of witnesses is likely to be of any
effect after this length of time.     That is the difficulty
about this.    I cannot see that many people will be able to
say more than,    "That that was my recollection at the time,
that's what I said.     I have no specific recollection no-w.
What I said in my statement was said to the best of my
knowledge and belief or I believed it to be true at the
time", and I am going to be faced with irreconcilable
problems.
      A very, very good example of that I had earlier this
morning where somebody said that they identified a picture


                            13
 1         of their son in the crowd outside the Gate C on a video
 2         still timed at 2.54.        It is quite plain it is taken after
 3         Gate C was opened and yet they think there are also
 4         photographs of him in pen 3 at 2.48, 6 to 8 minutes
 5         earlier.     It cannot both be right.     So that is the sort of
 6         problem that I am facing.
 7   MR.   JONES:     In our own case the timings more or less coincide
 8         with what the findings are, it's all in the file.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Are you reasonably content that
10         what is in the body file supported what the---
11   MR.   JONES:     Reasonably so.     There was one thing I had to
12         contact the Sheffield Police yesterday.        There was one
13         particular photograph that I had seen a print of I had
14         asked for a better one, it actually showed Gary in a
15         better profile.     Superintendent, I have forgotten his
16         name, said he'd look into it for me.        I must say I only
17         requested the body file a week ago, a week last Monday,
18         and this Superintendent I understand has recently been
19         brought in to sort things out.        We received it four days
20         later.
21   MR.   BONE:    That is Hepworth?
22   MR.   JONES:     That's it, yes.I do know      other people who had to
23         wait a long time.     Initially they wouldn't release any
24         photographs because obviously they were scared about legal
25         proceedings.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I think that the fact of my
27         appointment has actually concentrated their minds a little
28         and we have been bringing a certain amount of pressure to
29         bear upon them to release— -
30   MRS. JONES:      Can I just say.     The Coroner said —   well, he was
31         told by the police that the video,       which Mr. Houldsworth
32         now says was available, not available at       the time.     Ever
33         if there was no video available there was a police box in
34         the corner overlooking the Leppings Lane stand.         Anybody -
35         - we went in that box a few days afterwards, anybody in
36         that box who could not see down into those pens and see


                                          14
 1         that they were overcrowded must gave been either blind or
 2         drunk.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think that this is a very
 4         important point and it seems to me---
 5   MRS. JONES:  You didn't need video evidence I would say.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:  I agree.  I think that may well he
 7         a very important point.        It comes out loud and clear from
 8         the evidence that I have read, both of Lord Taylor's
 9         Inquiry and such limited evidence I have read in the
10         inquest so far, that the police had a perfectly good view
11         from the box.     The problem---
12   MR.   JONES:     Outstanding view.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The problem is that they did not,
14         they should have done, but did not appreciate what was
15         happening.     That is what they said.
16   MR.   BONE:     That's what they say.
17   MRS. JONES:      Exactly, that's what they said.
18   MR.   BONE:     They also had officers in front of the fence with
19         radios, who had an even view than the officers in the box.
20
21   MR.   JONES:      But the radios did notwork on the day.
22   MR.   BONE:     There those men were.
23   MRS. JONES:       Those in the box would have communication means
24         and they were in a position tosee what was going          on.   It
25         was just---
26   MR.   JONES:     The buck stopped at Duckenfield and he chickened
27         out on the day, didn't he.          Neglect of duty so far as I am
28         concerned.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think I am right in saying that
30         Lord Taylor said they did not appreciate that was going on
31         but they ought have to done.          That, of course, is the
32         foundation of the civil liability is whether or not it
33         also gives rise to criminal liability.
34                 Are there any other points you want to put to me, Nr.
35         Jones.
36   MR.   JONES:     No, that's all I have, thank you.


                                          15
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I hope you feel that this it has
 2         been a helpful meeting.
 3   MR.   JONES:   It is because it's the first time in eight years
 4         that we've seen anybody in authority.       We've always been,
 5         you probably know yourself, put to one side.       People just
 6         d o n 't accept what we say and apart from our immediate
 7         families and the ripple effect on this area, 96 people
 8         died, it took in thousands of people.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am sure.
10   MR.   JONES:   Unfortunately, there's still a blinkered view in
11         parts of the country that we're all hooligans up in this
12         part of the world.
13   MRS. JONES:    I think your statement Monday on didn't help the
14         situation either with people's opinion of us.       I listened
15         to a radio program later on that night with people ringing
16         in and they've still got the same opinion.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can just I say something about
18         that. I said it at the time, I regret that remark
19         obviously.   It never occurred to me that anybody would
20         take it seriously. But---
21   MRS. JONES:    I t 's a very sensitive issue though, I you think
22         you should have really been thinking before you said it.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I probably should have done.     I
24         regret very much that I said it.       But what is actually odd
25         about it is this that if it is suggested that I have made
26         up my mind that the cause of the problem outside Leppings
27         Lane is the late arrival of the fans and their disorderly
28         behaviour the contrary is the case.
29              I have come to the clear conclusion, as I told both
30         the legal representatives last week and I said again on
31         Monday, that Lord Taylor, who heard the evidence on this
32         very controversial, very difficult question, came to a
33         clear conclusion that it was the failure of the policing
34         operation that led to the loss of control and it was not
35         the behaviour of the fans, except to a very minor degree.
36              I   have not been invited to consider any fresh


                                       16
 1         evidence on that aspect      of the case at all.     I very much
 2         hope that I will not be      invited to consider any fresh
 3         evidence about it.     In those circumstances there is no
 4         reason for me to review that decision at all.          I accept
 5         it.   I have read the evidence of the Taylor Inquiry, there
 6         is ample evidence to support Lord Taylor's conclusions
 7         about that.
 8                  So far as I am concerned insofar as I have made up my
 9         mind at all on that issue I have made it up in favour of
10         the Liverpool supporters quite clearly.         The evidence
11         which I am beinq invited to consider relates to what
12         happened in the qround,      not what happened outside.       That
13         is a closed chapter so far as I am concerned.          So it is
           rather ironical that it should be suqqested, as I qather
15         it has been, that I have actually made up my mind aqainst
16         the Liverpool fans on that issue, nothinq could be further
17         from the truth.  I do not propose to review that aspect of
18         the case at all.
19               As I say, the only evidence I have been asked to look
20         at relates to what happened inside the qround and what
21         happened in relation to the         police's understandinq or
22         appreciation of the number of people        who were in    the pens
23         and what happened after the         disaster occurred in   relation
24         to who was alive, when and where people were traced and so
25         on,
26                  If 1 did not make that plain on Monday I want to make
27         it plain to you now because that is the position.            I think
28         that althouqh it was an unfortunate remark it is important
29         had you do appreciate that I am not qoinq back on Lord
30         Taylor's findinqs about that.         So that that aspect of the
31         matter, as I say, if I have made up my mind at all it           is
32         in favour of the Liverpool supporters and not aqainst
33         them.
34   MRS. JONES:      Pleased to hear it.
35   MR.   JONES:     We can confirm,   just to qo back to Taylor, the
36         delays.     On our way over to Sheffield, when we left


                                          17
 1         Liverpool about half past seven because we couldn't get
 2         through by telephone, there was a lot of roadworks on the
 3         Ml.      It's all with hindsight.    Of course, nowadays the
 4         games are delayed quarter of an hour, which is absolutely
 5         nothing.      It certainly wasn't the case on the day.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Certainly with hindsight it should
 7         have been delayed.      I think it was an unfortunate policy
 8         decision that they only decided to---
 9   MRS. JONES:      It wasn't delayed because it would cause a problem
IQ         if they came out of the ground any later it would cause a
11         problem to the police.      That was one of the reasons we
12         heard why it wasn't delayed because they wanted to clear
13         the police from the area as quickly as possible
14         afterwards.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Why should that be a problem for
16         the police it if is later?
17   MRS. JONES:      I don't know, probably because it was a
18         residential area and it would cause problems it they let
19         the people out of the game later by delaying the kick-off.

21   MR.   JONES:     On another matter, briefly, as you know, Liverpool
22         had one end and Nottingham Forest end.        Purely for the
23         logistics again of the police for ease of access it worked
24         in 88, it didn't work in 89.        A dreadful decision.    So to
25         some degree I think that the FA have something to answer
26         for.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think that may be right.      I think
28         that this comes out very clearly from Lord Taylor's
29         report. I think that it would be much sensible to have had
30         it in Manchester.
31   MR.   JONES:     It would have been.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       It was not a sensible decision.
33   MR.   JONES:     I myself have been to games long before fencing
34         was invented and you could actually walk round the qround,
35         any qround, without beinq crushed in the past.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      One of the terrible traqedies I


                                        18
      think about Hillsborough is that it was the sort of ethos
      of fear of hooliganism which instituted this terrible
      fencing business and it was the fencing which I made this
      a death trap.
MR.   JONES:   Absolutely.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Thank you very much indeed.     Do you
      want this back or can I keep this.
MR.   JONES:   We would have it back if you want to give back.
LORD JUSTICE STUART— SMITH:   I would like to keep it because I
      want to compare with the body file that the police h a v e .
MR.   JONES:   There are some photographs, apart from one I ha^e
      requested.   In actual fact by coincidence Trevor Hicks'
      daughter is on the same photograph.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Thank you very much indeed.

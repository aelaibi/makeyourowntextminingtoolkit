Dear Mr Wright

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

I refer to my telephone conversation with Mr Hayes this
morning when he indicated that you were shortly to attend a
meeting of the South Yorkshire Police Authority. He felt that
members of the Authority might raise questions relating to the
policing of Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th April 1989.
Mr Hayes was aware that certain matters of potential concern
had been revealed by evidence given to the Inquiry conducted
by Lord Justice Taylor and mentioned in his subsequent interim
report.
Whilst clearly the concern of the members may be quite proper
I am firmly of the view that it would be wrong to make any
comment at this stage upon the contents of the report. As you
know following the publication of this report the Director of
Public Prosecutions requested a full police investigation into
the possibility of criminal charges being brought.  That
Inquiry is continuing and is not expected to be completed
until the new year. The investigation is, of course, being
supervised by the Police Complaints Authority.

In my view, any public comment would be improper and could
prejudice not only the current investigation but also any
possible subsequent criminal proceedings.
I feel that any public comment should be reserved until after
either the conclusion of any criminal proceedings or the
Director's decision, if it be so, not to institute a
prosecution.

Yours faithfully




C J Cleugh
Head of Police Complaints Division

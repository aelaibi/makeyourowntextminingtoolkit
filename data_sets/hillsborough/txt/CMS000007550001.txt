    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - INTERIM REPORT

    The   Interim   Report  by   Lord  Justice   Taylor  makes   43
    recommendations, some of which have a direct affect on the Fire
    Service.

    We are confident                                that the Home Office will be considering the
    implications  of                                 those  recommendations affecting  our  Fire
    Service.

    There is one particular recomendation, No 10 (Page 58 of Report)
    that causes us some concern.    Whilst recognising the sense of
    providing cutting gear at grounds where perimeter fences are
    installed, the Union cannot agree that the equipment be used by
    Stewards, Police or Fire Brigades and more especially that its
    use be decided by a nominated Senior Police Officer.

    The Fire Brigades Union support the present Home Office guidance
    on the role of the Police and Fire Service at Road Traffic
    Accidents.   Using specialised cutting equipment e.g. thermal
    lances, needs expert training and protective clothing.

    I hope that you can use your good offices to agree with Chief
    Constables, the proper arrangements which would facilitate the
    Fire Service being designated and trained to use the cutting
    gear and any decision on its use would include the senior fire
    officer present.   We await your comments on this important
    matter.

    Yours sincerely




    DAVE MATTHEWS
    National Officer:                               Health and Safety

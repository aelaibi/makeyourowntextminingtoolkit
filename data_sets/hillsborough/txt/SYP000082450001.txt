vehicles        stopped        and    containing             fans    with        intoxicants.

current       vehicle         excise       licence.           I then        resumed           assisting        in the

stopping       and       searching         of    vehicles.



At    1443    hours ,       t hat    date,       I resumed mobile                  patrol       along       with       the     oth er

members       of    the     serial.

At    -1455 hours,           that    date,       we    attended          at C l a y w h e e 1 s Ln,         Sheffield.




At    1505    h ou r s ,    t hat    date,       a    call    for    assistance               was    received          from

Leppings       Ln      in    connection          with    a serious           public           order       situation.

Upon    our    arrival         at    the      Leppings        Ln    end     of     the    ground          I was    deployed

along    with       the     other     Officers          from       the    Serial         to    he I p f o r m a        c o r do n

across       the    en't r anee      to    the       ground.



I saw a       lar g e       crowd    of    f an s     numbering          several         h u n d r e d all    gathered

around       our    location.

I saw    that       many      of    them      were     drunk       and    that      many       of    them also          had       cans
                                                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                                                     S267 1

and      bottles        of a l c o h o l          in t h e i r      possession.



During       t h is     time       the       crowd       of    fan s      were      becoming             very ag i t a t e d         and

mounted         Officers           attempted             to m o v e       them away               from    the      gates .



On    our    approach             to    the       Leppings          Ln    end      of    the       ground?         I saw       larg e

quantities             of a l c o h o l       cans       and       other      containers              lining        the    route          to

the      ground and             large        numbers          of    f an s    walking             away    from      the    direction

of    the    ground.



A    short      t ime a f t e r         my a r r iv al         at     the     scene,          1 was       instructed            to    enter

through         the     gates          into       the    Leppings            Ln   end        of    the    ground.          Upon       my

arrival         at     the      large        concertina             gates         into       the    g ro u n d ,    I saw       that       the

I saw       two      injured           males       sitting          with      their          backs       against         the    ground

w a ll    and     then an          elderly          male       wa s      brought         from       inside         the    gates       and

placed       in the m i d d l e              of    the    road.           It w a s       obvious          to me      t hat      this       man

was      dead     at    t his      time.



I then       saw       three       more       deceased             males      brought             into    the      r oad a n d

numerous          injured          persons.              I com m e n c e d        to a d m i n i s t e r        first      aid       to

casualties             l ai d     in the          road    in       company wi t h             a female          officer,         identi'L

unknown         to me        at    t his      time.




I administered                  what     first          aid    I was         able       to    give,       which      consisted

mainly       of      placing           the    injured          into       the     three           quarter       p r one    position            o

clear       for      the     ambulance             service.              During         this       time    supporters            were
                                                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                                                         S2671

continualy              having          to    be m o v e d      from    the       road          to    keep      the       access         clear,.




A    group       of     doctors          were       at    the    scene       by       t his      time,         one       of w h o m      was

Scottish           and       g ave      instructions             to    both Poli ce                  and ambulance                 personnel

as    to w h o        w as    beyond          help       and who       was       to    be       conveyed            to    hospital

f i rs t .



An ambulance                 service          mini       bus a t t e n d e d      the        scene       and        I assisted            other

officers           and       supporters             to    get    the    walking             injured            onto       this      vehicle.

When     all       the       injured          had     been      removed          from       the       scene         I assisted            other

Officers           to    form a          c o r d o n between           the       bodies          of     the     deceased            and       the

crowd        who      were        now    leaving          the    ground.              Whilst          lea v i n g ,       the      crowd, w e r e

obviously             in a s t a t e          of    shock       and    many       of       them were            very abusiv e                 and

threatening              towards             the P o l i c e     Officers             in    the       cor don.

I can        say      that        whilst       assisting          the       injured             I could         smell         intoxicants

from     several             of    them       but     cannot      say       if    they were              drunk.




At    1700       hours,           that       date,       I rejoined          the       other          Officers            of S e r i a l       45

situations              arising          outside          the    ground.




Whilst        on      patrol         I saw many             groups      of       fans       shouting            abuse         as    we    passed

them and           I also          saw       large       numbers       of    fans          entering            or    leaving          shop s,

many     who       were       leaving           the      shops    were       carrying                lar g e    quantities               of

At    approximately                  1 S30      hou r s ,     that     date,          we    attended            at       C l a y w h e e 1 s Ln

HILLSBOROUGH: COSTS OF INQUIRIES BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE


Miss Ransford's note of 23 August enclosed a draft letter for me
to send to the Treasury, following South Yorkshire's acceptance
of the offer of special grant which Lord Ferrers put to them in
June.   We have spoken to the Treasury about the arrangements for
making an early payment of special grant during the Parliamentary
recess.   I now attach a copy of my letter to Mr Brook setting out
our proposals.

2. Sinpe Miss Ransford's note, South Yorkshire have sent a
second letter (dated 23 August) seeking confirmation as to the
scope of the payment in relation to the West Midlands
investigations.  As it happens, most of these points have been
Anticipated in the second draft letter attached to
Miss Ransford's note, which she proposed FI should send to South
Yorkshire.  I confirm that FD2 are content with the substance of
that draft letter (which will need some slight modification to
take account of South Yorkshire's second letter).  Once we have
Treasury agreement, FD2 will immediately get in touch with South
Yorkshire to inform them of the arrangements for payment and the
amounts concerned.

3. We have calculated the first special grant payment on the
basis of the account for £1,677,4 02 which West Midlands have
submitted for costs down to the end of June.   (Incidentally, I am
surprised that the additional costs appear to be so low compared
with earlier claims that the investigation was costing £2 million
a month initially: if the overall costs do turn out at the end of
the day to be significantly lower than we had been led to
believe, it would undermine the case for paying special grant,
which rested largelyon the claim that their magnitude threatened
the efficiency of the force.)  For the record, the calculations
are as follows:

                                    £
Total invoice                    1,677,402
Product of a penny rate          1.369.000
Difference                         308,402

51% police grant on £1,369,000               698,190
51% police grant on £308,402                 157.285
                                             855,475
39% special grant on £308,402                120.277
          total payment due                  975,752
Further invoices would attract grant at 90% until South
Yorkshire's own payments have reached £1,026,750 (3/4 penny
rate). By that stage the total costs would have amounted to
£4,927,000.  Thereafter the special grant would cover the entire
additional cost.

4.  In writing to South Yorkshire, it may be as well to point out
that we have been advised that the product of a penny rate is
£1,369,000 and that we estimate their liability to be £1,026,750
rather than the figure of £975,000 quoted in their letter of
23 August.

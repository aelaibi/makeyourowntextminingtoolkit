At the edge        of the      car       park of the T r a v e l l e r s       public house            there was a

to get back        in to rescue one of their friends who was                                   still     inside.

R e p e a t e d at te mp ts   to gain entry             into these         premises were made                 but no-

I then made my way to L e p p i n g s Ln w ith t h ey ^e st                    of my serial.           We

inside the ground.

T here were a large              number    of s uppo rt er s      still      trying     t o get     into the

game and were            c omplaining      thkt    tjarey were     being     kept out.         I

a s c e r t a i n e d that there had been some              crushing         inside and that the           rest

of the s upporters w o u l d be a l l o w e d           in as      soon as      possible.

* was a s ^ e d to form a car/lan with others                      to prevent         these s u p p or t er s

from going          into the g ro un d until         the s i t u a t i o n    inside eased.

A few mi nu te s         later an a m b u l a n c e a r r i v e d a nd at      the same time          I saw

two or three           people     being    carriejr out of the g ro un d a nd to the

ambulance.            This was     the f h i n t           that    there had been serious

problems          inside.      Lo ok in g at the colour           of these      people      I real is ed

they were d e a d .          At this      time a number        of s up po r te r s      came out of the

"You'd better get              in there quick        i t ’s t er r ib l e     bodies all       over    the

                         Prior      to    the      match       I was       in    charge           of   2    serials          policing             the       arrival

the    serials             at    Vere          Road          and       told          the       Sergeants               to        get       their        serials

I was       immediately                   instructed                   to    get       my          men    into         the        Mest_Stajnd_and

We    entered          the       ground,             to       the       best          of       my,recollection                          via      a    gate,

I made           my    way     to    the    front          of    the       crowd        which           was    tightly        packed,

they       looked         as    if       they    had       been       piled        on        top    of    one       another       like

bricks. \              I'm not      sure     how         many     there           were        probably           7 to      10,     The

faces        of        the b o di e s      that      I     could       see        were        purple          a n d m o 1 1 1ed , they

There        was       an officer           on       the      fence        kicking            at    it    and       I think       he    was

to    get        the     fence       open       so    that       we     could          get     the       dead       and    injured           out

onto       the, p i t c h .          I assisted               with      this       task        and       we    very       quickly

managed           to     force       an    opening.              Having           done        that       we    ^^TUjihd^ t he         t^rd^e s

that      officers/specatators                           also      carried             some        of    the    dead/injured                 back

up    towards            the    tunnel          entrance.




Once      the         bodies        had    been       cleared           I got          over        the    wall       and    onto       the

then       left       the          gym       and        as    I made         my    way       back       onto         the       pi.tch       1 was             -

             gymnasium         which      had     been made           into        a reception           area,            it    was       not     the

             case    that      relatives          or   friends         were        allowed         to    wander          freely          about

             the    temporary        mortuary,           even     in       the     very       early      stages.

             The    acoustics        of    the     gymnasium           building             were      such       that     sound          echoed

On 10 July 1989 I        was promoted to Chief Inspector^ and posted to duties

as Deputy     Sub-Divisional Commander, "Dl" Sub-Division,                        West Bar Green,

Sheffield.


Further to my statement of              15 May 1989 concerning my duties and actions

on Saturday 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough Football Grounds


I estimate     that my first attendance               in the gymnasium was           at ~2>.3Spm„

The     situation     there     was     disorganised      because     the     efforts        of     all

concerned, policemen           and civilian,         was to try     to save lives        and deal

with     the injured.           It     was clear      to me   that where          victims of        the

disaster were obviously dead, the attentions of everyone up to that time

had moved on to casualties where there was a chance of resucitation.


On     receiving directions           from    Detective Superintendent             HcKay to        take

charge     of the     situation        in the     first   section of        the     gym my        first

priority was to        clear the bodies from the area near                  to the doorway, so

that     unrestricted - access          could      be    given           to    persons    bringing     In

casualties, and         for medical       staff to attend                the Injured.          Secondly,

there were many people, both policemen and civilians, who by then had no

reason to      be In the        gym.     I had them cleared from                    that area because

they were      Impeding rescue efforts.                  Access and             egress was controlled

from that tine,         which would be about 3.40pm                      This was essential action

because of the sheer numbers of people who were already Involved.


My concerns        from that point        were to Impose proper                   organisation on the

necessary      duty     of ensuring       continuity          as     regards        evidence for      the

Coroner, protection            of property, and          formal Identification procedures.

I    assumed       these      responsibilities          on    the         authority      of    Detective

Superintendent         McKay,       confirmed at        about       4.05pm        by Detective     Chief

Superintendent Addis.                Part of     this control was to                allocate bodies a

personal       Identification          number; to       ensure       that        from    that point    an

individual police officer was made responsible for each body; and that a

search of the body was              carried out by those officers to attempt to make

a tentative Identification.


Circumstances were            such that a       very small number of                the deceased were

attended by friends or relatives, and the Information they gave was part

of the tentative identification process.                        However formal Identification

procedures were carried out later                 that evening, in the organised manner

which I described In my previous statement.


There     were a      large     number of       people In          the        gym most   of the    time,

particularly in the            early stages.        Many were             police officers, a large

proportion of         them being in plain clothes.                        This was because        In the

police     procedures         for   dealing       with       najor        disaster,      the    Criminal

Investigation         Department        role      is       to     deal     with      mortuary      and

identification arrangements.                   GID Officers who            had responded        to the

incident were deployed on these duties.                         In the routine match operation

local CID officers          had been deployed to crime                 prevention and detection

duties and many were casually             dressed, so to an outsider would not have

been immediately identifiable as policemen.


As well as        police officers assigned to each                 body, others were deployed
on dealing with        pe^ytnnal property of the deceased,                   cleaning the bodies

relativesA         It was     not the case that relatives or friends were allowed

to wander      freely about the         temporary mortuary, even in                  the very early

stages.


The     acoustics of        the gymnasium       building were            such that     sound echoed

arround     the     hall,    and there      was        a   background       of sound     which     was

unavoidable.         However apart from the confusion of the very early stages

everyone worked quietly and so              far as possible with due respect for the

dead.       This     particularly applied in               the evening when          relatives were

attending to identify the deceased.                        It was so quiet that the distress

of the    relatives* could be           heard by any            of the policenen        present and

caused considerable distress to them also.

                           I am        a    married        man       living        at    the        above          address           with     my       wife.        We   have

                            lived           here    for     fifty          one    years       so      are          used    to        having      a     large       amount

                           of        football        supporters                 around       on     s e m i — final             days.

                           At         the    rear    of     o ur     house        there        is     a       garage       area           containing          twenty

                            seven           rented        garages.              I am    the       secretary               f or       the    garages          and

                            responsible               to    the       council          for     them.               The    main        entrance          to    the    garage

                            area        is    off    Leppings              Ln    and,    on       match            days,        my    wife       and    me    have       to

                            stand           around        the    garages          because           we        have       problems           with       supporters

                            using           the    area     to       urinate       in.

                            On        Saturday        15th       April          1989     (150489),                 the    day        of    the    tragedy,          my wife

             because                  we         heard          a         loud          cneer          from        tne       ground.               It    was    between             £.55       pm

             of           supporters                   running                     down       Leppings                 Ln    from       the        direction          of       tne

              railway                  station                 towards                  the       football              ground.               It    was       if a    late          train

              had          arrived,                   I would                  say       approximately                        over      a    thousand           of    them          came

              past.                 There             was        just              a    mass           of    them,          all     running             past.        I saw          a    lot

              of          Liverpool                   scarves                  and          hats        and       presumed           that          the    whole       crowa             were

              Liverpool                         supporters.                            They       were        n ot       being        escorted            by a n y      police             and

                  I noticed                     that        tne           Police             Officers              who        had     been         standing          on E s k d a . s

              Rd          and        Leppings                  Ln         had          now     disappeared.

              After               this           crowd               had           passed         we        went       back        i nt o     the       house    and       switched

                  the          television                      on     and           saw       what          was     happening                at    the     ground.             We       then

                  went          outside                to       s ee           if      we     could          help        and       invited          people        in w h o          were

                  obviously                      very          distressed                     and       allowed              them       to    use       the     telephone.

                  Further                  to        the       above,               on T u e s d a y              13th       April        1989          (180489),          I

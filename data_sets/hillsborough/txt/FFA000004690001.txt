1 enclose a set of documents which(7 _      J has found
relating to matters discussed arising’out of the
semi-final between Spurs and Wolves in 1981. Perhaps we
could discuss ’ '’    sm/ matters are relevant for
inclusion int<           _(long-form) statement. None
of the committees seemed to have discussed Hillsborough
1981,

I also take this opportunity to anclose an extract from
a research paper from the Sir Norman Chester Centre for
Football Research, University of Leicester, July 1988.
You should find the views expressed on football and
football hooliganism on Merseyside interesting.

Your sincerely

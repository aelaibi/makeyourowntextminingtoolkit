              request received from the West Midlands Police,                   I interviewed

              Peter Edward SMITH at Hamrnerton Road Police Station, Sheffield,                       in the

              presence of his           'friend’,                                                   .   The

              The interview was formally conducted and full details were

              contemporaneously recorded by me on four pages of notes.                      The

Midlands Police Discipline Na            tlining the complaints made by a

Mr Stephen Paul HENDRY of             , Liverpool.   A copy was served upon

PC SMITH to enable him to accurately verify the contents.           At 2.50 pm

(1450) the same date,     I read out fully the West Midlands Police

LACKLEY of              Liverpool.
                        Liver pool    A copy was served upon PC SMITH

to enable him to accurately verify the contents.         PC SMITH

signed the orginal of each notice which I retained.           They were

also signed by                                   The interview was completed

at 3.03 pm (1503)     on Monday 30 October   1989 (301089).



All   replies were   contemporaneously recorded within the record of

interview which,     together with the two West Midlands Police Discipline

Notices,   is now produced and identified by means of a signed label

attached thereto.     At the conclusion of the interview,       it was apparent

that PC SMITH was shocked and somewhat distressed.         He assured me that

this was not connected with my approach but was due to the contents

of the notices which I had served upon him.          Immediately after the

interview,   PC SMITH was allowed to consult     privately with the Force

Deputy Welfare Officer,

Dear Mr Kelly,

                        Hillsborough

                    When the announcement of today's
tragic events was made at half-time at Old Trafford,
I immediately recalled the situation in 1970 when
Manchester United met Leeds United in the semi-final
of the P.A.Cup at the same venue.
                    With a friend and his son who was
fourteen at the time, we were in our place behind a
barrier at about 1.0pm in the area where today's
disaster occured.
                    The crowd continued to grow to   such
proportions that the situation became     serious asthe
consequent pressure increased. At about 2.30pm we had
to struggle to force our way out and we left the
ground without seeing a ball played.
                    On that occasion there was a total
absence of stewards and the evidence of a police
presence inside the ground was minimal.
                    When we reached the exit, we saw
supporters   being admitted without tickets, some
handing cash over at the turnstiles with no super­
vision at those points.
                    I wrote to the then Secretary of
Sheffield Wednesday F.C. and the local Police
Authority concerning the events which, fortunately
did not have the disastrous results which occured today
although the occasion was volatile with the potential
ingredients for a serious incident.

                  I heard your reference to the
possible consideration of taking the semi-finals away
from league grounds because of the 'restricted Capacity'
they offer.
                    One witness, speaking on the radio
about today’s events made a point of the lack of
stewards (1970?).
                    Only adequate policing and strict
marshalling by a large number of steards together with
a more equitable allocation of tickets to the competing
clubs can reduce the chances of such grave incidents
occuxdng.
                    These precautions cost money - a lot
of it. What is that consideration to be compared with
the avoidable loss of ninety-odd lives and the distress
and suffering of the survivors and those who mourn.

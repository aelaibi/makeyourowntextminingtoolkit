Dear Graham

HILLSBOROUGH - POLICE PTSD CLAIMS

I understand   that                                                      you have taken on responsibility for
supervision of these                                                     claims following the retirement of Peter
Hayes.

The present position with the proceedings is that after a period
of inactivity on the part of the solicitors acting for the
officers, the matter has come before a High Court Judge who has
set a time table for the actions to proceed to trial.  The Judge
directed that the lead Plaintiffs' actions be heard in Sheffield
in the week commencing 27th March 1995.

The Judge also made a number of detailed directions for the
preparatory stages up to trial, for example with regard to
witness and medical evidence.

The policy to date has been not to take any steps to speed up the
litigation whilst at the same time not appearing to be
obstructive towards the Plaintiffs' solicitors. The aim has been
to allow the time elapsing after the expiry of the limitation
period to accumulate to deter any further claims being made in a
"copy cat" manner.   The policy has been successful to date as a
significant proportion of the actions initially brought have now
been discontinued.

However, the time has now come when firm decisions are going to
have to be made as to which, if any, claims are going to be
settled and which claims should form the lead trials to be heard
next March.

                                                        25 July 1994

   Further, we need to decide what expert and witness evidence is
   required and how that evidence is to be presented.

   It is therefore proposed     that we set up aconference with
   Counsel, Richard Payne, to discuss the forward progress of the
   litigation with the insurers and possibly a medical expert.

  Before that is done, I need your assistance with regard to some
  Interrogatories which have been raised by the Plaintiffs and for
  which an Order has been made by the Judge for Replies to be
  provided by an appropriate officer in the form of an Affidavit.

  I enclose a copy of the full Interrogatories served by the
  Plaintiff but please note that the only questions that need to be
  answered are numbers 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13.     On the rest of the
  Interrogatories, the Judge agreed with our submissions that they
  were oppressive and should not be answered.

   Dealing firstly with question 8, document number 13 6 is Standing
   Order   6E  : "Stress Management,      Reactions to Potentially
   Traumatic Incidents (July    1988)".    I enclose   a copy of the
   document for your convenience. Please would you therefore kindly
   confirm whether the procedures referred to in this document were
   in operation at the time of the Hillsborough tragedy.

  The rest of the questions to       be answered relate to document
  number 140 which is an extract     from the South Yorkshire Police
  Major Incident Manual, section     10 entitled "Welfare, Moral and
  Stress", a copy of which is also   enclosed for your convenience.

   Please would you kindly confirm of what large document section 10
   is part of (I assume this is the Major Incident Manual) , when
   the document came into being and to whom it was circulated and
   when.

   I would then refer you to paragraph 3(1) which states that the
   force welfare officer should be called to attend a major
   incident.  Please would you confirm whether there was a welfare
   officer in attendance at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April
   1989.

  I should be grateful if you would kindly confirm the position
  with regard to these questions at your earliest convenience.
  Once I have your replies, then I shall draft an appropriate
  Affidavit which I can then return to you to be sworn or to be
  forwarded to another appropriate officer. Unfortunately time is
  limited in that answers need to be supplied by the end of this
  month.

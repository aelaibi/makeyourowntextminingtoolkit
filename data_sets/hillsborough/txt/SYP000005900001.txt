    On    the      morning             of S a t u r d a y       15 A p r i l      1 98 9      (150489),            me,     Tommy         and

    Steven         got         a       lift    from S te ve n' s          da d d o w n        to     the      pick       up point,         which

    We    boarded               the       co ach ,      which      I think was               a 52       seater       a n d we    set o f f            at

    about         10.45am           ( 1045).            I d o n ’t k n o w w h i c h          route we             took,       I w a s n ’t

    really         paying           attention.              We     stopped        of f       at     pub      in fluddfe^sVie 1 d , I

    (1230).             We     each had          three       bottles        of Pi Is               l a ger    and boarded             the          coach

    again         at    about          1.4 5 p m     (1345).            I think        there         were      a     f e w car       lo a d s       of

    other         L iverpool            fans       at    t he    pub.

    On    th e     journey             to S h e f f i e l d      I noticed          other          fans       travelling             by       coach

    and      car.           I didn't           see      anybody         drinking         alcohol             o n the      journey.

    We    a r r i v e d at          our     parking         place       outside          a    pub w h i c h         I think          is       called

    The      Gate,          at a b o u t       2.4Qpm       ( 1440).           I t ’s a b o u t         half       a mile       or       so    from

    the      ground.              We all        got      off     the     coach and w a l k e d w it h what                       was          quite

    a    crowd         of    people         already         making        their        way        towards          the    ground.              I saw

    a    couple         of     police          officers          walking         with        the     crowd,         but    I w a s n ’t a w a r e

    of a n y       great          police        presence           on    the w a y       or       any     police         giving

    directions.                   We    knew       the w a y      anyway         because           w e ’d all        been       to       the       secni

    final         at    the        same       ground       last

    I didn't            see        any drunkenness               or     behavioural                problems          on    the w a y           to     the

    We    got      to       the     ground w hich was                   on our         left        hand      s i d e at a b o u t 2 . 5 0 pm

    (1450).             As     s o o n as       I turned           into    t he        entrance            I wasamazed               to       see     a

    great         mass       of     people         just     standing           in the         entrance,             being       held          up    by

    two m o u n t e d          police          officers.              I saw      the     two       horses          part    and       let
through        a    crowd       of a b o u t           200     people         i nt o a        clearing        behind         them w hi ch

was    in f r o n t       of     the        turnstiles.                 These        people         just    ran    towards          a set

of    four     or    f i ve     turnstiles.

There       was     no    orderly            queue        and      no     organisation               and    1 could          see    people

were     very       distressed               and       could       hear       people          shouting        that      they

were     being       crushed.                I w a s n ’t a w a r e           of a n y        other     police         officers           or

stewards           o u tside      the        turnstiles.                  Tommy       and Steve            had m a n a g e d       to     get

through        and       I could            see    t h e m at        the      b ack of        the    crowd.

Time     was       getting        on        by n o w a n d         people were                getting       impatient             andwere

pushing        and       jostling            all       the     time.          At     this       point      one    or    two       lads

crawled        under       the       horses            and     ran      towards          th e    turnstiles,            then       some

ran a r o u n d      them and               then       it w a s      as    if      the     crowd       decided         t h e y ’d h a d

enough       and     just       rushed            past       the     horses.             I got       swallowed          up    in    it a n d

had    to go w i t h           the      crowd,          there        was      nothing           I could       do a b o u t        it.

I found myself                 n e xt       to D e r e k       R I C H A R D S , about           twenty       five      feet       from

the    turnstiles.                I could              see     Steven and            Tommy about              four      or    five        feet

to m y      left.         I tried            to m a k e        my way         over       to     them    but      just     couldn't

move.        The     whole        crowd was               pushing          f o r w a r d a n d as          they    did       this       Steve

and Tommy           drifted          off         together          to     the      left       and    I was       taken       to    th e

right.

At    this     po int      I was            really        beginning             to    think         things       were     quite

serious.            I was       being             rushed and              I could          see      other     people         were       as

well.        There       was      a barrier               at    the       right       of      the    turnstile          in f r o n t         of

me    w hi c h was       about          6    or    8    feet       a w a y.     I think          there      was    a    large       exit

gate     on the          right,         but       t his      was     cl os ed.        People         were       beingcrushed                   up

against        t his     barrier             and       so w a s      I.

I w as      trying       to     get         to    the     turnstile             to    escape         the    crush a nd            the

crowd was           st ill      pushing            from        behind,          people          seemed      to    be    s peedily

flowing        through          the         turnstile, although                       obviously            it w a s     a scramble

to    get    through           the      gap.           I soon        found myself                in f r o n t     of    the

turnstile.                There       was       a girl          about      sixteen years                   old     just     to      the     left

of    th e     turnstile,             crushed             up agai ns t          the w a l l .          She       seemed       to     be     in a

b a d way,         screaming.                  I managed           to    put     my     hands         up a g a i n s t      the w a l l ,

one    either           side     of    the           turnstile          and     block        anybody         else       getting

through.             This       allowed           her      to    du ck     under        me     and     through          the

turnstile.                I could          see       an    imprint         of    the     bri c k w o r k         down     her       face.

I was        then       through        the        turnstile             in a fla s h .            Although            I had my

t i c k e t in m y         hand       1 w a s n ’t a s k e d            for     it.       It    seemed           to me      that       th e

feed      of    the       turnstile             was       permanently            do wn,        because           it w a s     very         f ree

flowing.             There       was       a    steward sitting                  in the         turnstile             box.          When      I

got    through            to    the    clearing             on t he       other         s ide,        things        were      fairly

calm and           I could move                 freely.            I checked my watch and                           saw     that       it was

st il l      two     or    three       minutes             to    kick     off.          I looked around                   and       saw     two

or    t hree       police        officers             talking.             I didn't            se e    any       s t e w a r d s-      I

looked ahead               and       saw a        tunnel         in fr o n t .          I thought            that       was      the       only

approach           to     the    terraces.                 I didn't           se e    any      signs        directing            fans       to

any    other         viewing          point          and    no     police        officers             or    stewards          were

visible         to      direct        f an s      either.

So    I. m a d e     my way          into       the       entrance        of     the     tunnel            and    there       was      a wall

of    people         waiting          to       .30   through.            I was        aware       of       people       joining            the

from      behind          me a n d     my arms             were     trapped           in f r o n t         of me.         Then

suddenly           there was           this          massive surge from behind and I was carried

and    down        onto        the    terracing.                 I had a b s o l u t e l y            no    c o n t r o 1 of w h e r e            I

was    going         and       I didn't           stop      unt il       I was        about       12 f e et         from      th e     front

I could         see       one    or    two        people         in f r o n t        climbing          over       the     fencing.                I

was    stuck         in one          place        for a         few m i n u t e s       and     I then           noticed         t ha t

so    o ver    to     my      right     hand       side.           I decided                I had       to       try     to    get to          it,

so    started         to      tr y a n d    move        t ha t     way.           1 w a s h a v i n g to p u s h m y                  way       ov er

in t h a t     direction,             but       I was     getting            closer          to       it.        I got        to w i t h i n

about      two      or     three      feet       but     then       I got         my    left          arm     trapped          b e h i n d me

and    somebody            had    their         arm across             my    neck,          w h i c h was         forcing            my       head

backwards.               I was       trying        to    pull      rny a r m        back         and     in d o i n g         that        I

ended     up     in a s ort           of    crouching              position.                At    t hi s      point         people

started        clambering             over       the     top       of me.           Then         somebody             got     their           hand

or arm,        sort       of     under      my     chin and            pulled          me    up.        As       th at      happened            I

put m y a r m         out      forward and a               police           woman       t ook         hold       of    it     a n d he        1ped

behind        me a n d        found myself              slumped         on       the    goal          net.

After     a few secon ds               there        someone            in u n i f o r m          h e l p e d me        up     off      th e     net

ribs    over        and asked          if       I was     hurting            anywhere             else.

                                                                                                                                          He

pointing         at      me    saying       "Die        you      bastard,           die"

A St.     Johns          Ambulance          woman        said       I would            be    taken          to    hospital             and      she

         see     them and            eventually             I heard          someone        calling           my    name.           It w a s          Derek

         RICHARDS           and      he w a s      o ver     at    the       partition        fencing.                I went            o ve r

         to     him and         then we went                back     onto      the    pitch w her e                there       were          l o ad s       of

         people        standing.              We     spent        twenty minutes              searching               for      Steve          and

         Tommy        but      c o u l d n ’t f i n d       them and went             back         to    the       co ach .         On       th e w a y

         back        someone         c a l l e d me     over       to    their       house         and    said        I could            use       the

         phone        if    I wanted,           so     I r an g      home.          This     would        be a b o u t         4 . 1 5 pm        (1615)

         or     so.    We w a i t e d       for      half     an     h our     or m o r e     and        everybody             returned               to

         the     coach         except       Steve       and       Tommy.

         We     decided         to go       back       to    the     pub a n d       t ry    to     r in g     the       emergency

         number,           but w e      couldn't            get    through.           I ra ng           home and          I eventually

         heard        that      Tomriiy h a d        rung     h is      step-dad,           but     there was             still          no      n ews

         from S t e v e .

         About        7cm      (1900)       I still          h a d n ’t b e e n a b l e       to        get    any       n ew s     about

         Steve,        the      emergency            number        had       been    continually               engaged            and        then       I

         had     to    r e t u r n on       the      coach.

         At     no    t im e    during        t ha t    time       did       I see    anybody who                  appeared             drunk,          nor

         was     anybody          fighting.             Quite        the      reverse,        e ve r yb o dy was               trying            to

             was    just    mass   p a ni c    and       confusion       from    everyone.

             Last    year    everything          seemed         so   calm.      There      were     stewards       and     police

             o^fjficers w e l l    outside         the     ground       and    it w a s    far     more   organised.

             There    were    orderly         queues       to    the    turnstiles.           There       seemed    to    be    far

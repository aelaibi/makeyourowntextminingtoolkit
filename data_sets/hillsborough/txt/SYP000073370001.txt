           I live at the above address with my wife        who was formerly MRS

                     and who has a son                       who lives at Hillsborough.

           On the afternoon of Saturday 15                      1989 (150489)         I went to the

           Friendship Hotel Public House, Manchester Road, St ock br idg e.

           This     is the main road which leads straight to Hillsborough and is

           about 6 miles from Sheffiled Wednesday Football Club.

           At 1pm <1300 that date I got to the Friendship Public House and I went

           into the bar and I also went into the snooker room at the rear of

           the pub.

           There     is two other rooms at the Friendship,               the lounge and tap room.

           As I was at the pub,         there were a lot of Liverpool                supporters    in the

           bar and snooker room.          They were in there when I got there at 1pm

           <1300).
                                                                       PAGE       2
                                                                       S 17 62

I would estimate that there were thirty to fourty Liverpool supporters

in there.

I know they were Liverpool    supporters because of their accents and

some had Liverpool hats and scarves on.

A lot of them were playing snooker and cards.       Most of them were

drinking al c o h o l , lager and bitters in pints and half pints.

They were boisterous but there was no chanting,      shouting or

fighting.    I didn't hear any swearing either.

They were just having a good time.      I'd heard that the police had been

in the pub about the parking of vehicles but I never saw them.

The age group of the supporters varied between 20 and 30 years.           I

believe they were all male.

They would all have had more than one alcoholic drink although I
                                                                                      s

obviously wasn't watching    individual drinking.

All the supporters started to leave the pub between 2.15pm         <1415) and

2.30pm   <1430) and I thought to myself they were leaving     it late to get

to the ground.

I would estimate that the journey from the Friendship pub to Sheffield

Wednesday ground in a car if the road was clear would be about 20

mi nut es■

They left the pub in cars and 1 also saw some go in two mini buses one

was white colour.     I can't remember the colour of the other mini       bus.

They all filtered out and I stayed in the snooker room.       I did not see

any other supporters unsteady through drink.

There was no fighting and no damage in the pub.

The   licensee of the Friendship Hotel was not working    in the Hotel        I

believe he was ill.

It was his staff who were looking after the pub.

I left there at about 3pm    <1500).   The pub was still open.       I believe

he opens till 4pm <1600)    on Saturdays.

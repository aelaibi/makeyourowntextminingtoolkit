LINK BETWEEN TAYLOR INQUIRY AND WEST MIDLANDS POLICE INQUIRY


At the request of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire the
West Midlands police will gather evidence on the planning and
operational decisions of the South Yorkshire police.  The
material they assemble will be made available to
Lord Justice Taylor, who will have the help and advice of his
police assessor, the Chief Constable of Lancashire.  The
evidence which the West Midlands police gather will also be
available to the coroner and for the internal purposes of the
South Yorkshire police.

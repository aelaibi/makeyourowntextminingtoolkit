                Du r i n g   the      incident      I cannot          remember    any    bre a k d o w n     In radiq

                t ra s m 1 s 5 1 o Tis fau t whe n        on the       pitch    I was    probably obi i v i o u s           to

                transmissions             because      of the         urgent    task at       hand.



                I went       off duty at 7 „ 0 0 pm             (1900)    the    same    date.



               Whi l s t     on the       pitch during           the    early    stages and afte r w a r d s            o utside         the

               Lapping        Lane      end of      the    ground,       I and    other       officers        were

                subjected            to a b u s e , rnainly verbal,            from    the Liverpool            fans.        E v e ryone

               of them seemed to agree wit h the fact                             that    they had not             been a l l o c a t e s

                the    parts         of the    gr o u n d w h i c h     would    have a f f o r d e d      them a g r e a t e r

                number       of tickets.             This may           be so,    but I believe             N o t t i n g h a m Forest

               sold all           their a l l o c a t i o n and         could nave possibly             sold more.,              I die

               not     hear any         reports      or    see any evidence              of   theirs crushing          at

               turns t i l e s        to get    into      trie g r o u n d even though,          with the a l l o c a t i o n of

               tickets,           they should        have       been greater          in numbers,,            The N o t t i n g h a m

               fans      appea r e d      to get     to the       ground       earlier    and    take       their      seats      and

                places       on the terraces              far    sooner    than the Liverpool                 fans.

Thank you for your letter o f 16 August, a d d ressed to the Home Secretary, e x p r e s s i n g
your supp o r t for the C h i e f Co ns t a b l e o f South Y o r k s h i r e and his force following
the trag e d y of H i l l s b o r ou g h and enquiry about the financial arr a n g e m e n t s of the
p o l i c i n g of football matches.        I have been asked to reply.

The on l y s t a t u t o r y power to charge for police services is provided in sect i o n 15
of the P o lice Act 1964, under w h i c h a C h i e f Officer o f Police ma y p r o v i d e on
request special services at a ny place w i t h i n his                    p o l i c e area, sub j e c t to the payment
to the police a u t h o r i t y o f such charges as they m ay determine.                      "Special police
services" are s e rvices w h i c h w ould not n o r m a l l y be provided in p u r s u a n c e o f the
g eneral duty o f the police to p reserve law and order.                           If the organ i s e r s of, for
example, major s p o r t i n g events, need p o lice off i ce r s inside the g r ound to m aintain
order, a g re e m e n t is u s u a l l y reached wi t h the organi s e r s on the n u mber o f police
needed and they are charged for as a special police service.                               The costs of officers
d e ployed out s i d e the ground, for crowd and traffic control, are borne in the
normal w a y by the police authority.                This is because the courts h a v e ruled that
"special services" are services provided by the p o l i c e outs i d e the scope of their
normal obli g a t i o n s and that a police a u t h o ri t y cannot p r operly charge for services
w h i c h the police are nor m a l ly expected to provide.                   These include p r e s e r v i n g the
peace, p r e v en t i n g and d e t e c t i n g crime, and c o n t r o l l i n g traffic.

We have in the past c onsidered the possi b i li t y of c h a n g i n g the law, to require the
o rganisers o f s p o r t i n g or other events wh i c h attr a c t large crowds not o n l y to meet
the cost of pr o v i d i n g police o f ficers w i t h i n the  grounds, but also to meet, or at
least contribute, to the costs o f those employed               on crowd and traf f i c control
in the area.    T here w o u l d be c o n s iderable difficulties.      For example, one d ifficulty
would be to d i s t i n g u i s h between normal police duties and the extra duties caused by
the event in question, or to ap p o r t i o n liability w h er e a number of events we r e being
held in the same area.

It has been the p olicy of s u c c e s s i v e Gove r nm e n t s that charges for special police
services should cover the full economic cost o f those services.                 This remains our
view.  It is for the C h i e f Officer o f Police, in c o n s u ltation wi t h the organisers,
to decide ho w ma n y of ficers shou l d be d eployed inside a sports ground or at an open
air event (such as a pop festival) and for each police a u t h o r i ty to d e te rmine what
charge should be made to the o rganisers o f an event to recover the cost of those
services.

Y ou also m e n t i o n e d the media refer to the sho r t a g e o f m en and r e s ources in the
police.   This is not the case.          We all r e c o gnise the first class job our police do
in the face of the i n c r e a s i n g pressures and n ew demands we place upon them.           For its

Thank you for your letter of 19 April concerning the tragedy at Hillsborough Football
Ground. It was good of you to write and your support is much appreciated by myself
and my Force at this sad time.

It has been a most difficult time, but one thing that has undoubtedly helped me has
been the messages of support I have received from my Chief Constable colleagues
who, probably better than anyone else, can appreciate the pressures created by a
horrific occurrence of this type.

I have read with interest your comments about the behaviour of Liverpool supporters
at a football match in your Force area and I feel this sort of information may be of
interest to Geoffrey Dear who, as you know, is conducting the police enquiry into the
disaster. Because your letter is personal, I do not feel it proper to forward it to
Geoffrey, but I would be obliged if you could perhaps pass on to him directly the
details of what happened on that occasion.

 Now that the initial melee over the events last Saturday has
 subsided a little, I felt it necessary for all sorts of
 reasons, to write a letter of support for you and your Force.

No-one -in their right mind can put on one side the nature and
extent of the tragedy with 96 people losing their lives. That
is the outcome of the dreadful events, and I have every
sympathy with the bereaved, with all of those who had to deal
with the traumatic events on Saturday, and with all of those
who will be feeling shock and stress in these days after the
events, particularly your Police Officers.

What seems to have been disregarded, at least until this
morning’s newspapers, is that the cause of the fatalities
undoubtedly was an influx of spectators, many of whom did not
have tickets but were determined at all costs to gain access
to the ground.  I sympathise with the Officer, who faced that
with impossible odds and the threat to life and limb outside
the ground, coming to the decision he did.

It’s a little time ago when Watford were in the First
Division: we had an all ticket game for a visit by Liverpool.
Great emphasis was made on local television, radio, and in the
newspapers in the Merseyside area, that those without tickets
would not be admitted to the Watford ground.  In the event,
around 2,000 Liverpool supporters arrived outside the ground
without tickets, created a considerable public order problem,
and were attempting blackmail on my Officers at the time by
indicating that they would cause a great deal of trouble in
the centre of Watford (not far away) if they did not gain
admission to the ground.  It was an impossible situation and
only resolved by consulting with the Watford Club to take most
if         of them, into the ground.  I am sure others in the

country have had similar experiences, and not only with
Liverpool Football Club, but I offer the anecdote for what it
is worth.
Again, I offer you my sincere sympathy in what will be a most
trying time, with acrimony and recrimination quite
unjustifiably being heaped on the Police, but I do think it
important for you to know that your friends do support you.

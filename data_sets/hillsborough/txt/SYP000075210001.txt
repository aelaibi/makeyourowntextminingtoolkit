got     a ticket              to     sell.         I d i d n ’t get          one,     because          e v e r y b o d y wa s          asking.




Eventually              we      sat     on a w a ll,           in L e p p i n g s     Ln,      when     a    crowd          of    fans          who

I think          had       just       got       off     a train        came      down      the    road,          when    one       of       them,

a    lad    of a b o u t           twenty                  around       to     the    b ac k     of    us a n d wa s             asking          if

anyone          wanted          to    buy a ticket.                  I turned around                  and    spoke       to       him and

he a s k e d £ 3 0            for     the       ticket.         I eventually               paid £ 2 5 . 0 0        for       it,       I t h in k

he     had about              four      to      sell     all    together.             The      ticket        I brought             was          for

the ^ e p p i n g s           Ln     standing,           face     v a 1ue £ 6 . 0 0        for    entrance             B.




As     s o o n as       I had         got m y         ticket      we all         walked        down     towards             the    ground

and     I eventually                  got       outside        the     turnstiles           at    about          2.30       pm.        I went

through          the m a i n          perimeter            gates       and     straight          away       all    you       could          see

w as    a mass          of      p eople,         there        were     hundreds           outside        trying         to       get       in.

No     one wa s         in a n y        sort       of    queue       at all,         no    one w a s a t t e m p t i n g           to queue

Once     ws w e r e         in s i d e     the    wrought          i r on    gates         it w a s     a    crush,          because

more     and      more       people         were       filling        up b e h i n d me.              At     this       point        it was

getting          difficult            to    breathe          because         of    the      crush,          and    it was          getting

hot.       I felt           uncomfortable               and    frightened and                    it w a s      difficult             to    keep

on y o u r       f ee t a n d        I then       tried       to     get     b a ck     outside         the w r o u g h t          i ron

gates,        but      I couldn't            I wa s        j ust     being        taken with            the       crowd.




At    about       this       time        I saw        two/mounted Police                    officers          who were             by     the

fence      n ea r      to    the R i v e r N j ^ m ,          there         were      people       shouting             at    them        to    do

something           because           people          were    getting         hurt.           I saw them            put       their

horses        across         the      entrance          way    by     the m a i n          gates      to     try a n d        stop        the

people        pushing,           but       the    horses       themselves               were      getting          pushed          back.

Also     at      this       t i me    I turned/around and                     saw       that      the       two w r o u g h t        iro n

gates     had       now been             shut /o        stop anyone               e ls e    getting          in.




Whilst        we w e r e       getting           to    the    ground         I hadn't            seen anyone             fighting              or

i n v o 1v e d    in a n y       disorder             everyone        appeared             in g o o d       spirits.




After      the w r o u g h t          ir ons      gates       had     b e e n shut,           I think          t ha t    they may

have     been       opened again                 because       I saw         people         running          down,       a n d at         this

point,        the      crowd were            pushed across                  past      the     turnstiles            to       the     r i ght

hand     side,         as y o u       look at          them.         It was        then       I saw a          l a rge       s ide      gate

o p e n wid e,         I d i d n ’t see           t h is     g ate    or a / y        other       actually          opened           by a n y

one    but as we w e n t                 through        the    gate^r        [ saw         one P o l i c e m a n a n d a S t e w a r d

standing          by    it.



Once     this       gate       had       been     opened       it d i d       e ase        the    crush outside,                   which

had    gradually             got w o r s e        o ve r     the     period        of      half    an h o u r .          I walked

through          the    open         gate    although           I could have                now    got       through          the

Also     whilst        I was       in the           crush        outside          I saw     people           climbing          ove y       the

top     of    the     turnstiles             a n d a f e n c e , but              t his    w as    because          of    the      bad

crush,        there     was       no w h e r e          else     for       people     to    go.




Once     I had        got     through         the        g ate      there was         no     one to       t a k e n rny t i c k e t

o ff    me,    which        I s t i ll       have        and        it's    a full        one-     There       were       no

stewards         giving         dijy^ctions              and     the      only Policemen                I saw were          the        two

by     the    turnsti^j^s^ t e l l i n g                people       to     get    down     off        the    top.




When     I had        got     through         the        g ate       into    the     ground, I r e alized                 t h at    I      had

lost     contact        w ith my         friends              and    I stood        l o o k i n g for        them     I waited             a

couple        of m i n u t e s     and       then        I made        my w ay      toward         the       terraces.             I made

for a t u n n e l        in the         centre           of    the     sta n d ,    I c o u l d n ’t see            the    pitch

through        it,     j us t     the    backs           of    heads,        so    I presumed            t ha t w a s      the w a y           to

go     because        other       people        had          started        going     down.            I d i d n ’t see         any

signs        at all     telling          us w e h e r e         we     could       go.

                                        v       /
I walked         down       the    t u n r e i , I was              aware     of a        lot     of    other       people

follwing         me    in.        As    I go t          to    the    end     I was        aware        I was       being- forced

down     at a n a n g l e         but    o n ce         I had       reached        the     end     it w a s        alright.            I

then     decided        I would          try a n d            get    back     up the        t un n e l ,      but     it wa s

impossible,            because          I was           getting        pushed       from        be hi nd.




When     I had        reached          the    end        of    the     tunnel       it w a s       about       3    pm    (1 5 00 hr s.)




I have        indicated           on    the a t t a c h e d          grid where            I started           standing            in the

pen     by the m a r k          1 and also               where       I ended        up     in the        pen       by m a r k    2.

This     grid        I n ow     produce         as       a exhibit           marked

What    had       hap p e n e d was           that      when        I decided           to    try a n d        get/t>ack       up       the

tunnel,        1 was        aware        that         one    of     our    players           h a d hit        pne c r o s s b a r ,

although          I couldn't             see a n d          the w h o l e       crowd        j us t p u s h e d      f o r w a rd a n d

the    crush        started.             I was         only       pushed a           couple        of s t e p s      forward.




It was        only a matter                 of     seconds          later       when     there          was    a big      surge         and

everyone          w as     pushed        f o r w a r d a g a i n a n d as             indicated           on the        g r i d was

where       I ended         up.




At    the     t ime      it f e lt       as      if    I was        in m i d a i r       because          I d i d n ’t feel             my

feet    on the           g ro u n d ,    and       I d i d n ’t m o v e         my    lags.




All    I can sa y            is    t ha t     t h at    the       only     reason        for       this       big    surge     was

everyone          trying          to    get      in to see w h a t              was     going       on    inside,         on the

pitch.




Once    I had         been        pushed         down       the     terrace,          I was        kept       there     by    the       crush

for a b o u t       twenty minutes,                    I was        just       struggling           to    k e e p my      head      up       to

breathe        my arms            were      up a g a i n s t        my    chest       and     t h at wa s        how    I was       stuc k.




Whilst        I was        in the        p e n , which            I now        know     is P e n 3,           I d i d n ’t see          a

barrier        break        or     know       if      I wa s      even     by     it,    because          there        were    so m a n y

peo p i e .




After       the     twenty m i n u t e s , I think                       I w as      pushed around and                  ended       up

facing        the     tu n n e l ,      and      there       appeared           to    be a      lot m o r e         room,     so    I

pushed my way                back       up the         terrace           and    back     out       of    the     t unn el.




I didn't          actually witness                     any     of    the       deaths        but    I r e c a l 1 people            ly i n g

in the       tunnel.            All      I wanted           to do was            get      s o me    air.




When    I got          out    of    the       tunnel        I sat a g a i n s t           a wall        and saw     people         lying

on    the    ground with                people         around          them     trying       to     revive       them.




I sat       there       for a w h i l e           and     1 then          got    up a n d w a n d e r e d        around       to   try

and    find any           of m y m a t e s .            I couldn't              find      them,      so    I went    and       sat      on

a wall       outside          where         we    had a rr an g e d           to m e e t     if we        got    split    up.          No

one    came       so    I made my way                  b ack     to     the     car,      where      eventually          I m e t _____

and    his       cousin and             his      f ri e n d .




When    I saw          t h e m at       the      car                    ousin       had    said      he    thought       he    had

seen    Martin,           that's         Martin         W ild e ,       l ying      on    the      pitch,       and may       h av e

been    killed,          although             he w a s n ' t       sure.




After       we    found       this       out we         decided           to go      looking         at    the    hospitals            for

Les    and Martin.                 We    eventually              found Les           i n on e      of     them,    I can't

remember          which.           It w a s       about         te n    o'clock          (£200 hrs) w h e n we f o u n d Les.



The    other       two       had    by t h e n         go ne     looking         for      Martin        around     the    other

Hospitals.




We    then       l,eft S h e f f i e l d a n d          came       h ome      and    it w a s n ' t       until    the    n e xt       day

when    I found           out      t ha t     Martin        h ad       b e e n k i l l e d at      the     ground.        I would

d e s c r ibe M a r t i n as            white,         28 y e a r s old, 5 ' 7 tall,                    slim     build,       with

shoulder          length        black         hair,       he w a s        w earing        a b lu e      denim     jacket       and

jeans       and     trainers.

             I c a n ’t say      if    I received            the                          in or       outside      the    ground,




             All    I can a d d               at a       factor       in the       deaths       was    the   to t a l    lack    of

             Also    I believe         there       was    not      enough     crowd       cogarol         outside       the    ground

             by    the    Police      or S t e w a r d s ,    but     I can       only/say       t h at    after    the       disaster,

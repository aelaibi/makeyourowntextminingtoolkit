              I am a married man and I live at the above address with my wife

              and we have        lived here for sevef/years.
                                                                /
              On Saturday 15th April               1989,/ I was in the house just pottering about

              not doing anything specific.                 I was listening to Radio Sheffield,       when

              at approximately ten past three in the afternoon the announcer made a

              request for any off duty Police officers first aiders or Doctors or

              Nurses to make their way to the Sheffield Wednesday football                       ground at

              Hillsborough,         because there had been an Appeal for help there. The

              announcer did not state what had happened there.

              I immediately arranged for a lift and my neighbour took me to the

              ground and left me there.

              1* went into the ground through the gate in Penistone Road which is

              nearest the North stand.
                                                                           PAGE    2
                                                                           S2047

      'ghbour dropped,      me off at the island, Penistone Road at Leppings

       m d as I walked along Penistone Road towards the ground I saw 2

         of between,    four and six Liverpool    fans. They all appeared

       and aggressive,      they were all   in their late teens.   I d i d n ’t

nume     any of them drinking at the time.

The youths were walking away from the ground I d o n ’t know whether they

had been in at all. They were shouting, at all other passers by

they were trying to provoke people. As I passed them I could smell the

alcohol on them. This would have been about twenty past three.

When I entered the ground I asked a Policeman where the Police              room

was because thats where the radio announcer told us to go. He

directed me to it in the north stand and a Sergeant in there just

     1 me to go onto the pitch and do what I could.

     it onto the pitch with a St Johns ambulance man.        I am trained in

     , aid and I was trained by the Red cross in 1966 and I have kept

it up since then.      I used to be                                and I used to

use the First Aid then.         I am actually trained as a Red cross

i nst ruc tor .

The first person I came across to deal with was a white man about

twenty two years old. He was dead but we tried for five minutes to

Revive him because we d i d n ’t know how long he had been dead.         I started

  /the cardiac massage and the St Johns man did the mouth to mouth and

  ter a couple of minutes we swapped over. We d i d n ’t manager to revive

the man I c a n’t remember whether he remained on the pitch for a

while or was removed straight away.         I believe he was removed because       I

w o u l d n ’t have left him.

I ’m afraid the following       circumstances may not be in the right order

of events because everything became a bit of a blur.

I could tell that the strain of the incident was beginning to tell of                  j
the St Johns man he told me that that was the fourth person he had

                   known to die.

                   I believe during the whole time I was there I dealt with between

                   thirty and forty people varying from people who died to people who

      ID^          were   in shock.    I would say I dealt with about ten people who died,

5l>6j£cT           two I managed to revive and the rest I treated for crush injuries

                   sprains and strains.

                   shoulder length hair,     she would have been aged betwen 11 to 14 years

      {            old and weighed between approx imate ly 7 or 8 stone.       I d o n ’t know what

TO        £j£\/j\/£clothing she was wearing but I know it was red.

      ^       _    The girl was dead when I started mouth to mouth resuscitation and

                   cardiac massage could I not find a pulse.         I did this for 3 to 4

                   minutes when the girl gave a small     cough.     I again felt for a pulse

                   and ■found a Slight one.     I looked around for someone to take her off

£Vi & > < £ - the pitch but there w a s n ’t anyone.          I felt her pulse again and it    was

                   marginally stronger so I lifted her up and carried her to the kop           end

                   of the       pitch into the entrance by the North Stand she was placed

                   straight     into an awaiting ambulance.     I do not know whether she has

                   lived or died.      There was no one with her when I helped her,     she never

                   spoke.The second person I managed to revive was a white male aged

      ^            between 17 and 19 years,     he had very dark brown collar length hair,

                   which was straggly,     he would have weighed between 12 to 13 stone.

                   There was no one with him I think he was wearing jeans and a light

                   shirt.      When I got to him he was lying on the pitch 25 to 30 feet       from

                   the West Stand and forty or fifty from the North Stand,        he was not

                   breathing and I could not find a pulse.         A nurse assisted me with    him.

                   The nurse gave cardiac massage and I gave mouth to mouth resuscitation.

                   He had a few scratches on his face,        I ripped his shirt opena nd his

                   torso was visibly bruised,     I would say he had a minimum of two or

                   three cracked ribs or more.
                                                                        PAGE      4
                                                                        S2047

We revived him for a couple of minutes and then the nurse found a

pulse    in the lads neck.    The lad was then stretchered off by an

ambulanceman and a Policewoman,       he did not regain consciousness but

his heart was beating when he was stretchered off.

The ten people I tried to revive which were apparently dead,          ie had no

pulse or heartbeat and who did not regain consciousness even after I

practised cardiac massage on all of them and mouth to mouth

resuscitation were a mixture of people.         They were all white, 3 were

women aged between 18 and 27 years.         2 or 3 were men between 40 and 60

years and 2 or 3 were youths aged between 20 and 28 years.           I can only

describe one of them more fully,       he was a man aged between SO and 55

years he had black hair and a portly build.         I d o n ’t know why I

specifically remember him.

To the best of my knowledge all of these people were stretchered off.

Approximately thirty people I dealt with were for crush injuries and

shock,    strains or sprains.     I ’m afraid I c a n ’t describe any of these

people,    except for one white girl aged about eight years who was         in

shock and had lost her father somewhere        in the ground.    I took her to

a police officer who looked after her.

I must have dealt with people from about 3.30pm (1530) until about

quarter past six.     The    pitch was actually cleared of physically

injured people by about four o ’clock so myself and a first aid man

walked around the pitch area to see if there was anyone who needed

further help.     There w a s n ’t so we went back to the Police Room area

where we met up with some other red cross people and we walked around

the ground in the enclosed area and passageways under the seating

areas to see if there were      people there who neded medical treatment.

We passed about 20 people       in small groups who were obviously in shock

and looking for friends and relatives.         We directed where ever they

wanted to go but d i d n ’t treat anyone.     When we reached the back of the
                                                                     PAGE    :
                                                                     S2047

West Stand by the turnstiles on the perimeter road,       there were dead

bodies layed out.     I would say there were about twelve,    they were

being over seen by Police Officers.

We walked around the ground 3 more times but d i d n ’t find anyone to

attend to so I went back to the gymnasium to sign of with the Deputy

Chief Ambulanceman.     I made my way to Claywheels Road and caught a bus

home then,    this would have been about 6.15pm (1815).

On my way out of the ground through the same gate I entered I found a

youth who was in a terrible state of shock,     he had a couple of people

with him but he said he was looking for his brother I made him sit on

a wall and asked a police officer to keep an eye on him because        I

could see that he was in a very bad state of shock.        I left him with

the police officer watching him and his friends with him.

I arrived home about seven o ’clock thoroughly drained and physically

exhausted.

I must add that when I went     inti) the/p6lice Room on my way around the

ground I spoke to an Inspector Rcnolnson, this was just after I had

been round the ground witlV^theN^ed Cross.     He                people

around him.     He was trying to organise/^ Ccj/uftltyJj&freau or point of

contract where people could be directeo->to hospitals and onto mini

buses which were taking people to the hospitals.       I told the Police

Officer who I had left the shocked youth with that Mr Robinson was B

organising a contact    point and to send people asking for whereabouts

of injured people to him.

Different    instances from the day keep n4currin*j to me.    One is the

sight of bodies piled on top of one aX/ther/j^n the West Stand Pens 3

and 4, they all appeared to be delady     IThs^'pile would have been about

two feet high from the pitch levelythat/ I could see from standing on

the pitch.

Another thing that I keep seeing     in my mind is all the layed out
                                                                        PAGE     6.
                                                                        S2047

bodies in the gymnasium and the West Stand end.        There must have been

about sixty in the gymnasium and twenty at the West Stand end.

The other thing I keep remembering and seeing       is the young girl       I

revived and carried off the pitch although I cannot visualise her face.

In my opinion the perimeter fencing on the West Stand contributed to

alot of the deaths.     I believe deaths still would have occurred even

if the fences h a d n ’t been there but the number would have been lower

because   people would have been able to escape onto the pitch.         I

cannot comment on the causes of the deaths possibly it was the amount

of Liver pool fans arriving so late and trying to get in.

In niy opinion,   the Police Of fi cars inside the ground were ma gn if ic ent

they did everything humanly'po/sible to^help people.         I can only

praise them be cause al ^Kough^hey^atll /looked in a terrible state of

shock they all ga^/e^/^verythi ng the^/could^to helping people .      Everyone

I saw helping on the pitch did eve^*4rmng       possible to help.

I would say that the incident occurred through a combination of

different ci rcuinstances.    I would say that there was no co-ordination

and it was badly organised because unless people were directly

involved on the pitch,    they d i d n ’t know what was happening although

this obviously d i d n ’t cause it.

         Although from a personal     point of view I would like to put all this

         behind I would be willing     if required to give evidence at the

         enqui r y .

         I would just like to add that on page 8 where          I have said in my

         opinion the incident occurred owning to a cominbaiton of

         circumstances,   I don't mean that these circumstances were the bad co­

         ordination or organisation it was just everybody dealing with the

         incident was so confused and shocked,         everyone just dealt with what

         they saw to deal with and there was no visible or ganisat io n, mainly

         because of the time factor and the speed in which people had to act.

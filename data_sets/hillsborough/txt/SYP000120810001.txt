            between Nottingham                         Forest       and    Liverpool.              My    s er i a l    c o m m a n d e r was

            Inspector            Millett           and       I was    informed          that       I w as     in      charge      of      se ri a l

            32*     which        entailed              the    supervision          of L i v e r p o o l       supporters              attending

            t he    game        from Penistone                 Road North*

            My     se r i a l    was        on    static       points       between          the    roundabout            at    the       bottom

            officers            on m y       serial          were    PC    3087    Keenan,          PC    1 96 8 T a m s ,      PC     831

            points         supervising                 the    supporters.

            My     detail        took        up    patrol       at    this    l o c a t i o n at         approximately                1 1 . 15am

            (1115).             At    this        time       there    was    a slow          trickle        of     supporters             making

            their         way    to     the       ground.           They    were       well    behaved           and    in g o o d        h umour.

            H o w e v e r , several               of    them    were       asking       where       the     nearest          pub wa s        that

            was     open.            I ca n       remember          a group       of    approximately                 eight     youths        who

            were      walking           to       the    ground,       return       past       me    because           they     h ad    been       told

            that      a    pub       further           up H a l i f a x    Road    was       open.        Everitu^iiv as               the    game

                                                                                                                                            R442

drew        closer         the      amount          of    pedestrians                  making       their        way       to    the       ground

increased.                 Again         they were             in g o o d        humour          and were         causing             no

probiems.

I can        remember            coaches            approaching                the      ground and              I was       present            with

PC     Olney         a n d PC E d w a r d s           when         they       were      directed           to C l a y w h e e 1s L a n e

f or    parking.              These           buses       were        checked           by PC       0 1 ney      to    verify          they

were        Liverpool            supporters               and,       again,,           these      too      were       in g o o d       humour.

Eventually               somewhere             between             1 .4 3     (1345)         and 2.00pm           (1400)           the

C l a y w h e e 1s Lane             was       full       and       coaches        were        then        directed          along

Penistone              Road North              to H a l i f a x          Road      for       parking.            I can          remember

saying           to m y s e l f ,        as    it     got      after          2,00pm         ( 1 400),      t h at     the       supporters

'are        going        to    be    rushing             to    get       to    the      ground'.            I can          remember            a

coach        being         directed            to H a l i f a x          Road     as     late       as     2.40pm          ( 1440).            At

this        t i me     the     supporters                were       in      large       numbers,           most       of    them        running

towards           the      ground,            some       drinking             from      b e er    cans      and       I thought             to

myself,            'fancy        having          to      have       a drink            like      t hi s    and    leaving             it so

late        to    get      into      th e      ground’.               Although           a    lot    of     the       crowd        ran      past

me,     they were              not       causing          any       public         order         problems,            but       .just s e e m e d

to     be    in a        rush       to    get       to    the       ground         before         kick-off.                I was       amazed

to     find       so m a n y        people          arriving             so    late      and      one      of m y      recollections

w as    of a         car      pulling          up     on P e n i s t o n e        Road        North        at    the       Piazahut            with

five        occupants,              obviously             Liverpool              supporters,               intending             to a b a n d o n

their        vehicle          and        rush       to    the       game.          I advised              them    to       park       t h e ir

vehicle           properly           on H a l i f a x          R o ad ,       t h is    was      about      2.50pm          (1450)          and      I

was     greeted            with      angry          shouts          of      frustration             from        the    occupants.

At     this       t im e      I can       remember             hearing,           on     the      radio,         of    some        trouble

inside           the     ground          and     I can         recollect               liaising           with    Inspector                Millett

on     the P e n i s t o n e         Road North                roundabout               and asking              whether          or    not         our

serial           should make              hi s      way       to    the       ground.            I had      no    idea what                sort      of

trouble           wa s     occurring.                 Inspector               Millett         was    then        informed             t h at       all

serials         should         make          their     way      to     the       ground and             I can          recollect                g o i ng

up P e n i s t o n e      Road          North       and      informing            my     serial         of       this.

We     attended          at    the L e p p i n g s           Lane      end       of    the       ground where                 I saw a

large        group       of    police           officers,             some       on    horses          and a small                group          of

supporters              who    were          venting         their       feelings            at    not       being           allowed            to

get     into      the     ground.

I can        remember          a     call       was    made        for      an am b u l a n c e ,           on    the        radio,         and       I

thought         that      some          serious        public          disorder             was    occurring                 inside         the

ground.           We     were        originally              told      to     form a         cordon around                    the      gates          to

t he    entrance          to       Leppings           Lane      end      of      the     ground,            at    th e       time      I

c o u l d n ’t u n d e r s t a n d           this     and     shortly afterwards                        we       were        told      to       go

into     the      ground.

A s we       entered          t he      ground,        at     the      rear       of L e p p i n g s         Lane        stand,            I saw

bodies         l a id    on t h e         floor       immediately                behind          the    st a nd ,        a    lot      of       t h es e

were     being          tended          to    by    police         officers,             but      I got          the     impression

t hat    some      were        already             d e ad.      I walked              through          the       gates        into

Leppings          Lane        terrace           where        I saw a          l a r ge      number          of y o u t h s        on       the

playing         area      and        everything              seemed         to    be     in a      st a t e       of     chaos.

I can        recollect             an     ambulance           behind          the      goal       mouth,          but        I ca n n o t

recollect           if    that          was     there        when      I first attended.                          1 then          saw       bodies

at     the     si de     of    th e       wall      n ex t    to      the m e t a l         fen c e,        these        appeared               to be

two a n d       three         deep        and      were      b lu e    and       1 got       the       horrible              smell         of

vomi t a nd a l e o h o 1.

I can        remember          being          in a m o m e n t a r y          state         of    shock          at    t h is     sc en e ,          but

wa s    then      called           to     give      artificial              resuscitation                   on a n       elderly            man

at     this     time      I can           remember           a supporter               at    the       back       of me         saying

" Get    him       to       breathe” .                  I d o n ’t k n o w         why,       but       I told        my     colleague               that

we     should          try again.                   I    knew        he w a s      dead,       but       I seemed            to w a n t        to     be

trying        to       do    something.                    I    then       left     him       on the          ground and               went      to

t he    fence          at    the     front.                I    can     remember             a supporter              trying           to    rip      the

fence        away and           I    assisted                  in t r y i n g      to    pull       the       fence        away        with      him.

Eventually              there        was        sufficient                 room a nd          I a s s i s t e d in o t h e r o f f i c e r s

passing           the       dead     foodies a n d                injured          people          through           the     gap       in the

fence.

I was        feeling           sick        at       the        time.

Eventually              when        al l    the          bodie s        had     been         passed          through         I    went       back

through           the       gate     and        to       the      rear       of L e p p i n g s         Lane       where         I saw

approximately                  twelve           dead           bodies        laid       on    the       ground        with        clothing

over     their          heads.             I was           told       by a n       Inspector             who       I d o n ’t know,              to

form a        cordon           to    prevent               people          from     examining                the     bodies.            I then

remember           talking           to a n             injured man who                  was       at    the       side      of       the    wall,

o n hi s      back,          complaining                   of     back       and    stomach             injuries.                1 p l a c e d my

jacket        over          him and         spoke              with     him and          tried          to    keep     him        conscious.

He     was    eventually                 taken           by a m b u l a n c e       and       I think           he w o u l d          have     been

okay.

I can t h e n           remember            being              told     to    go    to       the    b a ck      of    Leppings              L a ne

stand        where          I formed            a       cordon        so     that       Liverpool             supporters               leaving

the     stand          could        be     ushered              through         one      gate       out       of     view        of    the

bodies.            I    c an    still           hear           the    chants        of       being       called        a murderer               by-

several           of    the     supporters                     leaving        the       ground.              I d i d n ’t k n o w           how to

respond           but       felt     quite              a n g r y as       I did        not    know what              ha d       happened.

Eventually              when        the     crowds              dispersed           what       wa s      left        of m y       serial        was

returned           to       the N o r t h           stand         for      a debrief.

Eventually              I    retired            from           d u t y at 8 . 0 0 p m         (HOOO)          at .Mexborough.

Having        now       had     time        to          think        about      it,      I am       not       surprised               about     the

build        up    of       supporters                  outside         the     Leppings            Lane       st an d .          It w a s       clear

             to me       that    people          were      arriving        too     late     for    the    game a n d were

             rushing       past       me    as    late       as 2 . 5 0 p m    <1450)       to    get    to    th e   ground.Some

             of    them    seemed          hell     bent      on    getting        to     the   g r o u n d as   quick       as   possible

             and    on    reflection             t h at    seemed     to      be   th e    only    thing      on t h e i r   minds      at

             that    time.        I ca n         say      t h at   they were        not     shouting          and a lt hough       in a

             rush w ere         not    disorderly.

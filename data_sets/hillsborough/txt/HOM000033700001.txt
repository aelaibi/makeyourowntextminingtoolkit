Thank you for your letter of 9 October about Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith's
reported com m ent during his recent visit to Liverpool.

I am sorry tha t you were upset by the Judge's comment to Mr Phil Hammond.
The Judge has said on the record th a t he deeply regrets this remark, which he
made o ff-th e -cu ff and w ith o u t any intention to offend or for it to be taken
seriously. He has made it clear that the behaviour of the fans is not the subject
of the Inquiry.

The terms of reference w hich I have given Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith for the
Scrutiny will allow him to establish conclusively whether any material evidence
was overlooked in the consideration of the causes of the disaster or the
consideration of criminal or other proceedings. The Judge will also be able to
recommend any other action which should be taken in the public interest. I am
confident that the terms of reference w ill allow him to carry out a full scrutiny of
the evidence w hich has been subm itted by the families and others.

As you know, the Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of
those w ho died and listening to their concerns. He has said th a t he found these
meetings fru itfu l and constructive, and that they will help him to w rite his report.

I am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will produce a thorough report in
which the families and the public can have confidence.

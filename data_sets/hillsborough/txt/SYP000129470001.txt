Minutes of Site Meeting No. 7 held on Tuesday 25 September 1979.


                       Present:
                               Mr. E. England                                               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                               Mr.
                                                                                            Hallamshire Builders Ltd.
                               Mr.
                               Mr.                           Strange                        Eastwood & Partners.

7.1                    Previous Minutes
                               Mr.                                            said that the minutes of the previous meeting
                       had not been received until just before the meeting.                                                          Acceptance
                       of these was deferred until the next meeting.
                               Mr. England questioned the completion date for the Spion
                       Kop staircase recorded as "the end of September” (6.5d).                                                            It
                       was agreed that this should read "before the end of October” .

7.2                    Absence of Peter Ward Engineering’s Representative
                               Mr.                                            reported that due to illness Mr
                       would probably not be attending the meeting.However Mr.
                       was expected.
                              All those present were annoyed that Peter Ward Engineering
                       were not represented when most of the outstanding items to be
                       discussed involved their work.
                              Disapproval was registered of their general disregard for
                       keeping to agreed delivery and completion dates.                                                         Mr. England
                       complained that critical items of work were being done hurriedly
                       on Saturday mornings rather than be complete by the previous




                                                                            Registered in England - No. 1134531
                                                                  SHEET   2

      Friday evening.     This practice was inconvenient to the club
      and was to be discouraged.     Mr. Strange said that he would
      write a letter of complaint to Mr.         on these lines

7.3   Progress
           Mr.              reported progress on the items given below.
      a) New exit at East end of South Stand open seating
           No further work had to be done by Peter Ward Engineering
      though only a few hours work remained to complete this section.
      b) New Emergency Exits at the bottotn of Spion Kop
           Although an improvement had been made to the appearance
      and line of the top members and the efficiency of the gate
      fastening it was agreed that further work was necessary on
      the gate nearest to the North Stand to improve the bolt
      alignment.
      c) North Stand Barriers
           A drawing had been received by Hallamshire Builders showing
      the fixing details for the barriers.     Copies had been sent to
      Ward Engineering.     Mr. Strange agreed that an intermediate
      horizontal tube was missing from the drawing.     This would be
      added and the revision issued.
      d) New Escapes from West Stand
           The South end staircase was being painted. However certain
      members had not been primed by Peter Ward Engineering and this
      was delaying the work.    The gable brickwork would be completed
      during the meeting leaving the handrail to be fixed by Peter
      Ward Engineering.
           Mr. England confirmed that the sheet of mesh had not been
      welded onto the far side of the North end gate.     This section
      was not therefore complete, which was contrary to the statement
      made at the previous meeting.
      e) New Gate from South side of Spion Kop
           The security angles and barbed wire discussed at the
      last meeting had not been fixed.     Keeps for the additional
      bolts had also to be provided.     Work by Hallamshire Builders
      Ltd was complete.
                                                                     SHEET   3

      f) Alterations to gates at bottom of West end terrace
           The damaged frame had been repaired but the gate was
      still binding at the head.     Mr. Strange said this was not
      acceptable and was to be rectified by Peter Ward Engineering.
      g) Remedial Work to Areas of Damaged Terracing
           The remedial work on Spion Kop would be completed by
      the end of the day.
           A rebate had been left, as agreed,    in the steps adjacent
      to the inspection cover beneath the North end of the West Stand.
      h) Repairs to Concrete Members in South Stand
           Approximately 2 5% of this work was done and the whole
      would be complete in three weeks,    including decorating.
      Mr. England agreed that the repaired areas should be painted
      by Hallamshire Builders Ltd.     Mr. Strange instructed Mr.
      to apply a primer to all areas followed by either two coats
      of emulsion or one alkyd gloss and undercoat to match the
      existing.
           Mr.              said that on close inspection many more
      areas of concrete than shown on the drawing were spalled or
      cracked.    Mr. Strange said that in general the areas and
      lengths marked on the drawings were to be treated though other
      particularly bad sections should also be repaired.     The intention
      was not to repair every crack and spalled area in this exercise.
      Mr. England accepted that considering the age of the structure
      regular maintenance was inevitable and if a maintenance schedule
      was undertaken over the next few years this should satisfy the
      requirements of the S.Y.C.C.
      j) Alterations and Strengthening Staircases in South Stand
           No steelwork had been delivered by Peter Ward Engineering.
      Hallamshire Builders Ltd could not therefore complete their work,
      k) Spion Kop Staircase
           The two bottom flights and landing plus most of the second
      landing had been excavated.     Formwork for the first flight was
      fixed and the first concrete would be poured on Wednesday
      26 September.     Mr. Strange agreed to give instructions later
      in the afternoon if any cable ducts were required to be cast
                                                                     SHEET   4

      under the staircase.     The ducts would be straight lengths
      of 75mm or 100mm bore P.V.C. pipes.
           Mr. Eagle suggested that a triangular landing be
      provided at the bottom of the flight to avoid a diminishing
      riser.   Mr. Strange said this seemed sensible and would give
      it consideration when the flight had been cast.

7.4   Information required by the Contractor
           With the exception of the position of possible cable
      ducts under the staircase Mr.              confirmed that there
      was no other outstanding information required critical to the
      progress of the works.

7.5   Next Meeting
           The next site meeting will be held on Tuesday 9 October
      at 10.30.

Dear Mr
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
                     Phase II Contract
     All those involved with this contract are becoming
increasingly angry with your attitude towards the work at
Hillsborough. At the site meeting held last Tuesday general
dissatisfaction was expressed that you were not represented
when most of the discussion involved your work.
     It is evident reading through previous minutes that you
are disregarding agreed delivery dates for materials and
completion of work.
     Looking through the labour returns your workmen are
on site for only one, two or occasionally three days a week
and more often than not essential work is being left until
Saturday morning before a Jiome game. This is most inconvenient
to the Club and all efforts are to be made to have such work
completed by the previous Friday evening. An improvement in
attendance would be much appreciated within the next few days
to finish the outstanding work outlined to you by John Strange
last Tuesday afternoon.
     These items involve only a few hours work but it is most
annoying that they were not finished together with the majority
of the steelwork.
     You must now make every effort to complete your part of the
contract as quickly a nd efficiently as possible leaving the
Main Contractor sufficient time in which to do the painting so
that all concerned are away from site no later than the end of
October.


                      Yours sincerely,




                 signed in Dr. Eastwoods absence

      Difficulties wit* existing site levels and the loose nature of
the fill which made it difficult to found retaining walls on it,
have forced changes la the arrangement of the staircase leading
froa the top of the Spion Kop.
      Once these difficulties were realised the Contractor bad to be
instructed lasedlately to eoatiaae with excavation to eelt the nee
arramgeaent. Otherwise we would have been faeed with additional
eoets for delays.
      We now enclose three copies of our drawing iilo/49 showing the
revised layout, and would be pleased to have four comments as soon
as possible.
      It is aot easy to visualise the work from the plaa oa the
drawing because of the steep embankment and we suggest that your
representative sight care to sake a visit to site to see the
excavation in progress, la the next few days the positions of the
landings and flights should be clearly dlseerbable.

6 .1          Previous Minutes
                     The minutes of meeting No. 5, held on 21 August were
              accepted as a true record of the proceedings.


6 .2          Progress by Nominated Sub-Contractor
                     Mr Ward reported progress on the items given below.
               (a)   New exit at East end of South Stand open seating
                     To complete this section a short length of handrail
              required fixing.                                 It was agreed that where the new mesh had
              been added to the fence this should be welded to each
              existing vertical bar.                                         A steel flat was then to be welded
              over the top edge of the mesh to prevent spectators pulling
              it away from the verticals.



                                                                Registered in England - No. 1134531

     (b)       New Emergency Exits at the bottom of Spion Kop
               An inspection of these exits had been made before the
     meeting.       It was agreed       that the     gates were not acceptable
     in there present condition.               The   gates and frames were to be
     made true and square and the R.H.S. above the gates was to be
     made level.          Mr Strange    said that the bolts were to operate
     smoothly.       Mr         isaid that new       keeps would be provided.
     Where two small pieces of mesh had been inserted adjacent to
     the gates it was agreed to replace these with one piece to
     improve the appearance.
               M r a d d e d    that the existing top angles along the
f    fence were not truly horizontal and the new posts had not
     been cast in to the corresponding levels.                 To improve the
     lines a cap plate would be welded to the posts and the R.H.S.
     above the gate relevelled to be square with the gate.

           i                ~              ■

     (c)       North Stand Barriers
               One barrier had been made and delivered to site.             This
     was now in position,         though not fixed, and awaited inspection
     to check sight lines.             Mr Strange requested that the seats be
     replaced after the inspection.


     (d)       New Escapes from West Stand
               Erection of the staircase would start on
     Wednesday 12 September and be complete by Friday 14 September.
     Mr                   said the steelwork would be painted immediately
     afterwards.          Mr England requested that the panic bolt on
     the new gate be omitted and normal bolts fitted.                 The
     West Stand emergency gates would be manned by stewards during
     home g a m e s .
               The escape on the North side was complete.


     (e)       New Gate from South side of Spion Kop
               The frames had been delivered and fixed together with the
     timber gate.          Mr England requested that protection be added
                                                                       SHEET   3 .

       above the gate to prevent intruders climbing over the wall
       from the new concrete landing.      It was agreed that raking
       angles would be welded to the door head channel and three
       strands of barbed wire fixed across the angles.
             Mr Strange also agreed that hooks and eyes be
       fastened to the wall to    secure   the gates when open
       and to the addition of a pair of bolts at the top of the
       gates.


       (f)   Alterations to gates at bottom of West end terrace
             These were complete with the exception of one frame
       which was to be taken off site for remedial work.         This had
       been damaged during installation of the extended gate.
       Mr Strange asked Mr Ward to inspect all the gates to
       ensure that they fitted and bolted properly.


6 .3   Remedial Work by Nominated Sub-Contractor
             Mr        said he would personally attend to any necessary
       remedial work beginning on Wednesday 12 September.         Mr Strange
       said that he would then inspect all the steelwork after
       Mr         had completed the remedial work.


6.4    Labour Returns
             Mr             handed to Mr Strange the labour returns for
       the previous two weeks.     They showed that over the period the
       labour strength had been maintained at an average of twenty.
       Peter Ward Engineering had been present on site five days with
       an average of two men.


6 .5   Progress by Main Contractor
             Mr             reported progress on the remaining items
       which did not involve work by the Nominated Sub-Contractor,
       (a)   South Escape from West Stand
             Mr             said that it had been agreed with Dr Eastwood
       the previous week to omit the end panels of side sheeting and
                                                                    SHEET   4 .



EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




     to continue the brickwork up to the line of the existing
     sheeting rail.    The foundations for the frames were complete.
     The frames had been installed and the existing ground slab
     broken up and re-laid to provide the required 2.1 m headroom.


     (b)   Remedial Work to Areas of Damaged Terracing
           The steps beneath the North end of the West Stand had
     been broken out and re-cast to give horizontal treads.        Breaking
     out and recasting the poorly finished steps on Spion Kop continued
     together with replacing the isolated damaged lengths towards
     the top of Spion Kop.     All this work would be amplete by
     25 September.


     (c)   Repairs to Concrete Members in South Stand
           This work would commence on Wednesday 12 September.


     (d)   Spion Kop Staircase
           The revised lines and levels had been set out and
     agreed the previous week.     Site clearance progressed to suit
     the different plan shape of the staircase.     Mr Strange said he
     wpuld issue a revised drawing on Wednesday 12 September but
     would telephone Mr              after the meeting with the new
     levels and flight dimensions.     This would enable excavation
     to proceed.
           Mr Stange explained to Mr England that because the
     existing levels of the embankment were resulting in high and
     expensive retaining walls it had been decided to re-route
     the staircase.    There would now be more excavation but the
     cost of this would be off-set by the     reduction   in the
     lengths of retaining walls.     A net saving on the cost of the
     staircase would probably be made.
           Mr             said that providing the revised information
     was given promptly the staircase would be complete by the end
     of September.    Mr Strange asked Mr            to extract the
     quantities for the reinforcing mesh from the drawings.        It
                                                                      SHEET



EASTWOOD £r PARTNERS




       was not the intention to issue a schedule for the mesh.    The
       size of the mesh was not to be changed from the A252 originally
       specified.
            Mr Strange confirmed that the handrail posts would not be
       cast in foundation blocks but in pockets formed in local
       thickenings of the slab.


6.6    Alterations and Strengthening Staircases in South Stand
            Mr         confirmed that the material was ready for this
       work and would be delivered to site.     Work would start on
       Monday 17 September.


6 .7   Information Required by Contractor
            Mr           requested that all information for the
       Spion Kop staircase be forwarded as soon as possible.
       Mr        said that he would also want this information for
       preparation of the handrails and posts.
            Mr Strange said he would issue instruction to
       Hallamshire Builders Ltd regarding the North Stand barriers
       after discussions with S.Y.C.C. and possible load tests.
            Mr              confirmed that there was no other
       outstanding information required critical to the progress
       of the works.


6.8    Next Meeting
            The next site meeting will be held on     Tuesday 25 September
       at 10.30.

The Secretary,                                        13 September 1979
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd,,

Sheffield,
S6 1SW.

Dear Eric,
                Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
     The letter from the County Council dated 21 August
sets out a very reasonable time-table for the certification
procedure.   The work in the South stand should be completed
in October and Hallamshire Builders are due to finish the
outside work before then.
     The electrical scheme will be a little tight. Theextra
requirements for emergency lighting which were added in July
have squeezed the budget but we hope to manage within it using
our latest proposals to make use of the existing batteries after
shedding some of the load from the South stand.    We expect
to start the electrical work in October with about a one month
programme.
     If a meeting were to be arranged in the first half of
November, the only outstanding work at that time should be the
lighting.   An inspection could be made prior to the meeting
and any contentions points discussed in the meeting.    Might
I suggest 7, 9 ar 12 November as possible dates?

                                   Yours sineerely,

             Dear Bill,

   <         You will perhaps recall me mentioning the proposed extension
             to our Development Fund Office at the Penistone Road end of
             our ground that backs in to the bottom of Spion Kop just
             beyond the Hillsborough Suite.

             I am enclosing a plan of the proposed alteration, drawn up
             by Mr. j    so that you can comfirm that the new building
             will not contravene any exits in relation to the Safety
             of Sports Ground Act.

             Yours sincerely,




             Secretary..

M a r Eric,
                        Alteratioas to Pools Office

    Please accept our apologies for not commenting sooner on the
subject of the Pools Office.     This was a job John Strange did not
manage to do before he went on holiday.     We hope the delay has not
caused you any embarrassment.
    We have roughly set out the corner of the new building and
find that the     exit width between the existing precast concrete wall
at the bottom of the Splon Kop bank is reduced to just over 3 metres
    This reduction does not affect the calculations for dispersing
spectators.   The critical width on this particular route is the
1.7m at the far end of the Hillsborough Suite.
    However, 1# possible, the small timber cabin used for the
sale of lottery tickets should be re-sited away from the corner of
the new building to give an uninterrupted exit to the gates on
Penistone Road.


                                    Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                                                                                                                ■   "        \ r i *■■*■■■ : '

Draft of a Possible Letter from Mr. E. England to Sandall Woffindin Ltd .



Dear Sirs,
               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
      As indicated by Eastwood & Partners we have pleasure in
accepting your tender dated 28 August for the various works
of fireproofing in the South stand in the sum of £16,929.75
but as modified in your letter dated 6 September by the
omission of the ventilation work and the use of door blanks
instead of purpose made one hour fire check doors.


                                  Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr. England,
                 Report on Tenders for the Upgrading of
                 Internal Partitions to Provide a Nominal
                     One Hour Fire Resistance
      Tenders have been received from all four firms who were
invited to tender.     These were opened by me on Tuesday, 28
August, in the presence of John Strange.        The total tender
sums given in the documents were as follows
      Sandall Woffindin Ltd.              £
      Hallworth Builders Ltd.
      Foottit & Whatley Ltd.
      Hallamshire Builders Ltd.
      The arithmetic in the two lowest tenders has been checked.
Errors in multiplication were revealed in the document returned
by Hallworth Builders Ltd.     Their revised tender sum becomes
£|         , .                                                       ■
      All tenders include a contingency       of £   ,
      Messrs. Sandall Woffindin Ltd. are offering to complete
the work in six weeks.     The remaining three firms have
offered to do the v & x k in ten weeks.
      Hallworth Builders have slightly lower rates for the
various classes of labour working on dayworks but not sufficient
as to make any material difference to the margin between their
tender and that of Sandall Woffindin,
       Sandall Woffindin's tender is, of course,considerably
above the estimate which we gave you in May because in July
the South Yorkshire County Council came back with very
considerably Increased demands concerning the areas of wall
and glazing which had to be fireproofed.       However, the tenders
are also distorted by four ducted ventilators which in the
Sandall Woffindin tender account for almost El        I,   These
ventilators were twice reguested by Fire Officer Jones during
inspections but are not included in the written requirements
from South Yorkshire County Council.      I have discussed the
matter with the Chairman this afternoon and he agrees that we
may omit these ventilators and substitute four simple vent axia
fans and await the reaction of the County Council.
      The tenders are also heavily weighted by the need for
26 fireproof doors costing over £|        .   After the documents
were sent out to the tenderers I informally approached the
City Building Surveyor's department to see whether they would
accept 'door blanks' in place of the standard fire doors.
I pointed out that as the fireproofing of the walls does not
now strictly satisfy the fire regulations, it would not
be unreasonable to have a small relaxation on the doors.       This
was agreed and we asked Sandall Woffindin to reprice the doors
using blanks and this has resulted in a further reduction of
£l
 — — — !•    The overall position therefore is that approximately
£       [
        w ould be expended which is probably more than we have
available.     We have had slight savings on the first two contracts
compared with our original estimate but this has not been
sufficient to fully offset the increases associated with the
extra fire resistance requirements.      I think that the overspending
is likely to be approximately £____
      We have now almost finalised the design of the new
emergency lighting system and have made good progress in assessing
the upgrading which may be required to the existing system.
Here again extra requirements    were added between the evening
inspection in May and the w r i t t m specification which we
received in July.(in particular emergency lighting to be taken
to the external gates instead of just in the stands and
staircases).    However we are hopeful that we can contain
these extra requirements within our original estimate although
this cannot be guaranteed for the moment.       It does depend
on the County Council being prepared to accept a half hour
life for the emergency lighting (as was obtained in the test
in May).rather than the three hours requirement which was
intimated in July.    I am writing to the County Council on
this matter.
       The Chairman gave his approval for the acceptance of
Sandall Woffindin's tender.     We have today asked them to
prepare to start on site as s o m as possible and to try to
adhere too the six weeks programme intimated in their tender.
       Attached is a copy of their tender and also their letter
of 6 September detailing the savings by omitting the ventilation
work and the use of the door blanks.      We have also included
a draft of a letter which you might use in accepting their
tender.

Dear Sirs,.' :
                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                          Phase 11 Contract
      Further to your letter dated 20 August 1979, we write to
confirm the verbal instructions given for the additional work listed
below. The remaining items, we find, are either shown on revised
drawings, have been the subject of earlier correspondence, or described
in the Bill of Quantities and therefore subject to remeasurement.
      1) New Exit at last end of South Stand open seating
      a) Please extend the top concrete landing to give a level
finished surface matching into the eMsting slab.
      b) Please lower the existing manhole cover and frame on the
top labding to match into the level of the new slab.
      c) Please extend the existing drainage channel from the seated
terrace beneath the new landing.
      d) Please extend two lengths of handrail shown on drawing 1610/23
at the bottom of the existing flight of steps. This is necessary
because the post as shown is located over a manhole cover. The spans
of the handrails on this flight are to be approximately equal. The
position of the centre post is to be adjusted accordingly.
      2) North Stand Precast 8tep Units
         Please increase the depth of bedding beneath the new units
to bring the treads level with the existing.
    Where additional excavation and breaking out has been
essential the quantities should be measured, recorded and
agreed at the tine of the work. These records should then
be promptly forwarded for our consideration.




                          Yours faithfully,

         W© write to inform you that it took three members of our
staff 45 minutes to carry the testing rig from the back of the
North Stand and assemble it on the North East Corner ready for use.
Perhaps you will reconsider the times shown on your daywork sheet
No. 3.
         Enclosed are the two copies of daywork sheets 1-3 which
should have accompanied our letter dated 20 August.

                           Mr. E. England                                                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd,

                           Mr. J. Strange

  5.1                Previous Minutes
                           The minutes of meeting No. 4, held on 7 August were accepted
                     as a true record of the proceedings.

 5.2                 Progress by Nominated Sub-Contractor                                                                                       ^
                           Mr. Ward reported-progress on the critical, items given
                     below.

                     a)    New exit at East end of South Stand open seating
                           All materials were on site.                                            More men would be on site after
                     lunch time and the whole of the work would be complete by 3.00 p.m.
                     Work to be done included replacing the original mesh panels on
                     top of the fence, inserting more new vertical bars in the fence
                     to supplement the existing, welding on the new handrails, making
                     and inserting a new mesh panel at the front of the exit and
                     placing mesh over the fence on the Spion Kop side.                                                          It was
                     agreed that the new mesh should be at least 150mm below the
                     top of the new landing and trimmed to a neat line.


                                                                      Registered in England - No. 1134531
                                                                      SHEET    2



EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




            Mr. England said that these items were not to be painted
       until Wednesday 22 August.

       b)   New Emergency Exits at the bottom of Spion Kop
            These were almost complete and would be finished during
       the afternoon.     Mr. Strange said that one gate was out of
       true.     This was to be corrected.   Dr. Eastwood added that the
       existing mesh adjacent to the new posts had, in some instances
       been cut too short.      To make up the deficiency in length a
       small angle had been welded to fill the gap.          This was not
       acceptable as a permanent feature.      The mesh was to be made
       secure for the evening home game.       Later the angles and mesh
       were to be removed and a new sheet of mesh inserted between the
       existing and new gate posts.

       c)   North Stand Barriers
            Mr. Strange explained that discussions had been held with
       S.Y.C.C.    and it had been agreed that one barrier should be
       modified and installed to check sight lines.          The new barrier
       would not have return ends and all the members would be in one
       plane.     Mr, Ward was requested to take away the nine barriers
       delivered.     A drawing of the new barrier would be issued after
       the meeting.

       d)   New Escapes from West Stand
            The gate would be hung and the small mesh panel and short
       length of handrail would be replaced by 3.00 p.m. to complete the
       North exit.
            Mr. Strange said that, contrary to the Specification, the
       holes in the cantilever frame base plates for the South exit
       had been burnt out.     The resulting holes were untidy and grossly
       oversized.     The frames were to be returned to the workshop and
       new base plates fitted ready for erection on Friday 24 August.
            Dr. Eastwood asked if all the work would be completed ready
       for the    home   game on Saturday 25 August.   Mr.        [said this
       would not be possible.      All the materials had been received but
       not all fabrication had been completed.
                                                                      SHEET       3

            It was therefore agreed that Hallamshire Builders would
       cast the bases and bolts, to the new levels, on Thursday
       23 August and make the excavations safe before Saturday.             The
       steelwork would then be erected on Monday 27 and Tuesday 28
       August.

 5.3   New Gate from South side of Spion Kop
            Mr.               said that he wanted the steel frame for the
       exit as soon as possible.          Work on the gate would begin on
       Monday 10 Septemebr and be completed before the next home game
       on 22 September.       Mr.         agreed to deliver the frame on
       Wednesday 29 August.

 5.4   Alterations to gates at bottom of West end terrace

            Mr.               asked Mr.         to be prepared to extend the
       existing gates on Friday 24 August.          The perimeter walls would
       be demolished on Thursday 23 August and the landings cast the
       following day.

 5.5   Progress by Main Contractor
            Mr.               reported progress on the remaining items
       which did not involve work by the Nominated Sub-Contractor.

       a)   Remedial Work to Areas of Damaged Terracing
            This work was now complete.         Mr. Strange said that he was
       not prepared to accept the newly cast terracing where the edges
       of steps were out of line and the specified arrises had not been
       provided.   Rendering with "Reebafill" or a similar material would
       only be accepted if this gave a matching appearance.          Cutting
       out defective work would have to be done between home games.

       b)   Alterations to Exit from North side of Spion Kop
            Although this section of work had been made safe it was
       not complete.    Mr.                 said that additional breaking out
       of the retaining wall foundations had delayed the work.
       Dr. Eastwood said that the ramp profile was not acceptable.
       The ramp was to be extended to give a constant slope.          The
                                                                      SHEET   4



EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




        exposed sides of the retaining wall were to be rendered and
        the exposed fill beneath the precast units adjacent to the
        gangway was to be raked out and replaced with at least 100 mm
        of concrete.

        c)     New Precast Concrete Step Units in North Stand
               All the new step units had now been fixed and the work
        completed ready for inspection.

 5.6    Labour Returns
                Mr.              handed to Dr. Eastwood the labour returns
        for the previous week.         They showed that over the period the
        labour strength had increased to an average of twenty one.
        Peter Ward Engineering were on site on Sunday 19 August.

 5.7    Completion
               Mr,               said that all items with the exception of
        the staircase at the back of Spion Kop should be complete by
        mid-September.         This was agreed by Mr.        The staircase,
        according to the programme should be complete by the end of
        September.         Dr. Eastwood expressed concern that work was not
        on programme and emphasised that all the work must be finished
        by the end of September.         Mr. England added his disapproval,
        saying some items listed as critical, ie, those to be completed
        by 11 August, were still not done and it appeared would not be
        finished before the next home game.

 5 .8   Additional Home Game
               The second round League Cup match against Manchester City
        would take place on Tuesday 28 August. KO. 7.30.

  For the attention of M r.

  Dear Sirs,

  Re: New Crush Barriers - S .W .F .C . Hillsborough

  Further to your letter to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners dated 3rd August 1979
  and subsequently passed on to ourselves, we would comment as follows:-

   Ref: your letter, item 5 :
             After the delivery in June of the three provisional angle brackets for
             the type " J" & "L" Barrier Posts, it was found that the 2 N o. holes in the
             vertical leg of the brackets ( 22mm diameter as per drawing) would not
             give sufficient clearance io take the resin anchor bolts. By arrangement
             between ourselves, M r.             of Eastwood & Partners and M r.
             it was agreed that 24mm diameter clearance holes be drilled. These
             three provisional brackets were taken away, redrilled and fixed.
              Following successful testing of the the provisional 3 N o . barrios, the
              balance of the brackets were delivered to site to complete the barriers.
              These had again been drilled as per drawing, i.e . 22mm diameter.
             We therefore cannot accept any extra cost for re-drilling the brackets
             other than the first 3 N o .                                            J
   Item 7:
             We have no records or information to substantiate any of this additional
             cost and would request a detailed breakdown of the work before we can
             accept either a ll, or any part, of the cost.
                                                                                                      «

Dear Sirs,
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
              Phase II Contract
     As discussed during today's site meeting we have pleasure
in enclosing two copies of our drawing 1610/48 showing the
latest details of the barriers for the North Stand.
     Would you please remove from site the nine barriers already
manufactured and fabricate just one as shown on the drawing.       The
basic sizes have been maintained so you can re-use the material.
     Please deliver the fixing angles and base plates loose to
provide some tolerance in case holes have to be moved away from
existing reinforcement in the precast concrete units.


                                  Youtp sincerely

Tarmac Regional Construction Ltd.,                     20 August 1979
Upper Wortley Road,
Rotherham,
S61 2RF.


Dear Sir s,
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
              New Crush Barriers and Handrails
    Last week we inspected the various sections of work.
Listed below are items requiring your prompt attention.


(a) Steps at the bottom of ramp from Spion Kop
    1)    The post bases cast in the flight nearest the
          Hillsborough Suite have honeycombed arrises.
    2)    The new treads cast on the long flight of steps
          are uneven.      In places there is a lip of concrete
          towards the back of some treads where the wet concrete
          has not been trowelled flush with the underside o£
          the suspended riser foxmwork.
    3)    On the same flight, the top row of post bases have
          been left with untidy edges and arrises.      There is
          seme honeycombing and in one case the newly formed
          riser does not line true with the existing.

(la) Spion Kop and West End Terracing
          Comments on this work are general.      You must inspect
    each base and attend to all honeycombing, uneven treads,
   untidy and wavy arrises and risers that do not line true
   with the existing.
(c) Painting
          Though the painting has not been completed on all
   sections we remind you that all grout and concrete splashes
   were to be removed from the steelwork before applying any
   further paint.    Painting the steelwork, except those items
   affected by remedial work being done by Shaw Engineering
   Ltd., should not be unnecessarily delayed.        The priming
   paint used has only a certain life and a few weeks after
   application rust will begin to show through on exposed
   steelwork.

(d) North-West Corner Barriers
    1)   There is a nut missing o n e one of the bolts fixing
          the angle to the terrace.      This is to be found on
          the front barrier nearest the West Stand.
    2)   Why have steel packs been added between the post base
          plates and the concrete?      If these have to remain
          then grout must be poured under the base plate to
          fill the gap.
    3)   Several of the nuts have been found to be loose.
          These should be spanner tight.

Dear Sirs,
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
                Phase II Contract
     Following receipt of your daywork sheets, 1 - 3 ,   handed to
John Strange last Wednesday we consider the number of hours
recorded for the Jobs excessive.
     Emptying the contents of the hut should have taken three
men no longer than one hour.    It is not uncommon for the whole
contents of a domestic property to be removed in less than
twelve man hours.
     We consider that trimming the formwork of the risers should
have taken no longer than three man hours with say a
further two hours for loading and transporting.
     In the next few days we will be testing more barriers at
the ground.   The rig will be carried back on to Spion Kop by
three members of our staff.    The time taken for this operation
will be recorded and compared against the four hours shown on
your daywork sheets.

Dear.Mr.I

I km sorry once again to have to draw your attention to
damage that is happening at Hillsborough.

The turnstile wall nearest to Door *0* on rtmir.tone Road
 has been knocked out of line,' and the steel fencing at
 the entrance to the tunnel in the sane area has also
 been daraaged, presumably in both casQL. by a vehicle;
 and I have to report the loss of a bolt, strange as
 it may seeia, frora the Bolton Gates leading to the
Uncovered seating at Penistone Road end.

I aia also very disturbed at the programs of work
on the ground. It was initially prorsdsed for the
11th August and then put back to Tuesday, 21st
August, which is our first hone League match as
you are well aware. Very little progress has been
made during this week, and it is absolutely essential
that all the work on Spion Kop, North Stand and West
Stand xjjat is in progress be completed not later than
lunchtirae on Tuesday.

Yours sincerely,




Secretary.                              Eastwood & Pa

Dear Sirs,
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                      Phase II Contract
     Once again we write to express our concern about the lack
ofprogress and your failure to complete work on programs*.
     As you are fully aware the Contract Completion date for the
critical Items was 11 August. At the tine of writing none of these
items have been completed and at the present rate of progress it is
unlikely that all will lie finished before the next horn satch on
21 August.
     We insist that all these items are completed, to our
satisfaction, by $.00 p.m. on 21 August and the areas left clean
and tidy.
     An above average crowd is expected at the first hose league
game and we are not prepared to accept the ground in the untidy
condition that you forced upon us last Saturday. Every effort must
be aade by you and your sub-contractor to complete ths work ready
and fit for use by next Tuesday.

                                    Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .
                        Upgrading of Internal Partitions to Provide
                                a Nominal one Hour Fire Resistance.

                   Further to the discussions during the visit to site with
Mr. Strange on Monday 13 August we write to confirm the following
items raised either by yourself or by a representative of one of the
other contractors preparing tender prices for the work.


                   1)    Cabins and materials may be placed and stored at the
rear of the North Stand.                                                       Access to this area is from Penistone Road.

                   2)    The ground will be open between 08.00 to 17.00.                                                          Access can
be gained outside these hours and at weekends by prior arrangements
with the ground staff.

                   3)    Water and electricity will be provided free of charge
though the contractor is to allow for transformers, and all necessary
wiring and maintenance.

                   4)    Plaster may be mixed adjacent to the areas being skimmed
providing all splashes and dirt are cleaned up l55£B&e each match.




                                                                   Registered in England -   No. 1134531
                                                                               SHEET   2
i




       EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS



               5)    Your attention is drawn to the fact that another contractor
      will be working in the South Stand repairing some of the reinforced
      concrete frame members.

               6)   Two keys are   to be supplied with each lock pattern.      However,
      identical locks may be       supplied using the same key,   for example, on all
      cushion store doors.

               7)   It is the intention that a completed wall has a flush surface.
      It may therefore be necessary to cut strips of baseboard to cover
      existing frames before skimming over with plaster.          The cutting of the
      baseboard and providing metal edging or corner laths for the plaster
      are to be included in the jippropriate rates.

               8)   Existing conduits, pipes and wiring are to be surface mounted
      onto the newly plastered surfaces and then painted over.          The exception
      to      this is on wall W18 where the pipe running along    the top of   the cill
      is      to be boxed in with 19 mm baseboard.

               9)   Please increase the quantity of the mild steel angle, Item 3
      page 48 to 13.0 m and allow for rebating the timber joists at both ends,
      Item 4 page 48.

              10)   Please add to page 48 an item for extending the conduit and
      wiring and re-fixing two existing bulk head light fittings mounted on the
      wall.     The fittings will be lowered 300 mm to bring them below the new
      ceiling level in the cushion stores.       There is one fitting in each
    (
    ^ ^:ushion store.

              11)   Please add to page 41 an item for removing and taking to tip
      an existing electrically operated fan mounted in the glazing.

              12)   Items 1 and 8 , page 40 together with Item 1 page 41 are to
      include for the removal of the small timber louvre above the opening
      light.

              13)   Please add an item for wall W18, page 43 for unfastening the
      length of conduit and wiring and re-fixing on completion.

              14)   Please add an item for wall 17, page 43, for removing and
      replacing an existing 2 . 0 m long timber shelf.

                           Mr.                                                        )

  4.1                  Previous Minites
                           The minutes of meeting No. 2, held on 24 July were accepted
                       as a true record of the proceedings.                                                      The minutes of meeting
                       No. 3 held on 31 July were read and approved as a true record
                       of the meeting.

  4.2                  Delivery of Structural Steelwork
                           Mr. Malthouse said that despite earlier assurances from
                       Peter Ward Engineering the following items of steelwork had
                       not been delivered.
                           a) Gates and frames for the new exists at the bottom of
                       Spion Kop.
                           b) Barriers for the North Stand exists.
                           Dr. Eastwood expressed severe displeasure that items
                       critical to the progress of the work had not beea supplied
                       and also that Mr,                                             had not attended the meeting.                    He
                       asked Mr. Strange to arrange a special meeting with Mr.
                       during the afternoon to discuss progress and the delivery of
                       the outstanding items.

     4.3    Progress
               Mr.              reported progress on the critical items
            given below.

             a) New exit at East end of South Stand open seating
               The handrail posts had been cast into the new concrete
            landing.     The remaining posts, to be cast into small concrete
            blocks, had been delivered but not to the correct length.
            Longer posts were being provided by Peter Ward Engineering.
            Mr. Malthouse confirmed that this section of work would be
            completed by 11 August with the exception of the painting.

             b) Remedial Work to Areas of Damaged Terracing
               All excavation was complete.     The concrete work would be
            complete by the end of Friday 10 August.

             c) New Emergency Exits at the bottom of Spion Kop
               The gate frames had not been delivered.      Providing these
            were on site and fixed by Wednesday 8 August, the landings
            would be cast and complete by Friday 10 August.      Mr. Strange
            emphasised that these gates and adjacent fencing were to be
            complete before the ground opened to the public on Saturday
            11 August.

             d) New Precast Concrete Step Units and Barriers in North Stand
               Two flights of steps had been fixed.      Seven more flights
            remained but would be complete by the end of Thursday 9 August.
            The barriers had not been delivered.     Dr. Eastwood said that
            the barriers must be supplied immediately to enable Hallamshire
            Builders Ltd to fix them and cast the surrounding landings.

             e) New Escapes from West Stand
               Both cantilever slabs had been cast, the South end on
            Wednesday 1 August, the North end on Monday 6 August.      The
            gate, frames and mesh panels were now awaited from
            Engineering.

             f) Alterations to Exit from North side of Spion Kop
               This work had not been started.     Mr.            said that
            it was doubtful that this work could now be completed by 11 August,
            It was therefore agreed to begin the excavation on 13 August
            and have the new concrete cast by 18 August.
                                                                     SHEET   3.

 4.4    Labour Returns
           Mr.              handed to Mr. Strange the labour returns
        for the previous week. They showed that over the period the
        labour strength had averaged fifteen not including specialist
        sub-contractors staff.

 4.5    Programme
           Mr.               also handed to Mr. Strange a copy of the
        programme, extended to include the remaining work in the
        contract.      The programme indicated completion of the last
        item, the staircase at the rear of Spion Kop towards the end
        of September.      Mr. Strange said that he would comment formally
        on the programme within the next few days.

 4.6    Information Required by Contractor
           M r . a s k e d         for a decision to be made on the
        refixing of the fence at the new exit adjacent to the South
        stand open seating.      Mr. Strange said that he would discuss
        this detail with Mr. Ward in the afternoon.      Mr.
        confirmed that there was no other outstanding information
        required critical to the programme of the works.

 4.7    Next Meeting
           The next site meeting will be held on Tuesday 21 August
        at 10.30.

Dear Sirs,
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                      Phaee IX Contract
        Thank you for the copy of your programme received on
7 August for the work to be completed after 11 August.
        You will appreciate that all the remaining work has
to be phased in with the league fixtures.     A list of the
home games is enclosed for reference.
        The timber exit door from the South side of Spion
Kop will have to be started and completed between games.       It
will not be acceptable to leave the opening Insecure during
a match.
        Before each match you must clear away all debris, tools,
equipment etc. and make safe any excavations and construction
work.
        Would you please add to your programme the three additional
exist at Leppings Lane end, shown on our drawing 1610/47.
A copy of the revised programme should then be forwarded to us
and a copy sent directly to Mr. England.


                                    Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,
                     Safety of Sppots Grounds Act 1975
                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .
                     Certificate of Ground Safety
       Further to yesterday's telephone conversation with
Mr. Shenlff we have pleasure in enclosing a sketch showing
the proposed alterations to the landings and barriers in the
North Stand.
       We have found that the arrangement previously discussed
and agreed obscures the vision of too many spectators and
severely restricts access to one row for It to be acceptable.
It is now the intention to install a much simpler barrier, with
no returns and with the top of the rail 900mm above the landing.
       You will of course appreciate the urgency attached to

Dear Sirs,
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd*
                       Phaee II Contract
       We have re-opened discussions with the South Yorkshire
County Council in order to resolve the detail difficulties
with the barriers and landings on the North stand.
       Would you therefore suspend work on these exits until
further notice, which should be towards the end of this week.


                                Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,
                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .
                             Phase II Contract
       We have today inspected various sections of the work.
Listed below are items requiring yocr prompt attention.


(a)    North Stand
             A total of 29 defective precast units are to be
       removed and replaced with new.      These have been marked
       with white chalk.     A total of 56 require further work
       in an attempt to bring them up to an acceptable standard.
       We offer you the opportunity of rubbing down and grinding
       these units to improve the finish but if this proves
       unsuccessful then they must also be replaced.


(b)    West Terracing
             All the areas repaired with Keebafill are to be
       ground to remove lipping, runs and unevenness.       The
       finished lines and levels are to match those of the
      ( adjacent existing terrace steps.


(c)    Spion Kop Terracing
             All areas exhibiting honey combing, a waist less than
75mm, nosings out of line by more than tom are to be
broken out and replaced.       The nosings on most of the
steps cast to date are not acceptable.       The treads in
several places are uneven and grout has been allowed
to run over previously cast and existing steps.       Unless
these faults can be rectified to give a satisfactory
appearance we will have no alternative but to insist
on the removal of all poorly constructed steps.


West Stand        North Exit
1)   Both ends of the soffit are to be cleaned back to
      give a neat line where cast against the existing
      concrete.      The timbers cast in at the North end
      are to be removed.
2)   The existing parapet wall has been crudely cut         back
      on the front face.       The untidy vertical lip on the
      newly cast upstand as it returns towards the papapet
      wall is to be removed.
3)   The top of the existing column just below the soffit
      of the new slab is to be hacked out to sound concrete
      to remove all sawdust, and grout runs and the
      concrete made good.       The corners of the column
      damaged during demolition are also to be repaired.
4)    The 2nd and 3rd handrail posts from the North end
      are not vertical about the E/W axis.       These must
      be rectified so that the handrail is truly straight
      and the edge of the handrail sits over the front
      face of the posts.
5)    The finish to the top face of the upstand is poor.
      This is to be brought up to an acceptable standard.
6)    The small areas of honeycombing and grout loss on
      the vertical faces of the upstand are to be hacked
      out and made good to match the surrounding concrete.
7)    The existing walls, both parapet and gable are to
      be made good and the exposed faces rendered with
      Reebafill to protect the projecting reinforcement.
      The brickwork panel on the North gable may be
       finished by block bonding in half bricks,
8)    The mesh panel on the short return, South end, has
      not been welded in square between the posts.
9)    The first handrail post from the North end is
      not vertical and the mesh panels on either side
      do not fit true to shape.
10)   Either the concrete upstand has not been cast
      sufficiently high, or the base plates have been
      incorrectly positioned, but there is a gap between
      the top of the upstand and the underside of the
      base plate.    This is not acceptable.   Demolition
      of the complete upstand may have to be considered.
11)   The base plate on the post at the South end, nearest
      the parapet wall is to be trimmed back or the
      upstand re-cast to match the detail on the South exit.
12)   All protruding welds on posts and handrails are to
      be ground flush.

West Stand - South Exit
1)    The existing parapet and gable walls are to be rendered
      with Reebafill.
2)   The same comments as the previous items 3, 5 and 10 also
      apply to this exit,
3)   The North end of the soffit is to be cleaned back to
      give a neat line where cast against the existing
      concrete.
4)   The soffit is to be made good around the base plate
      of the post at the South end.
5)   The thin concrete skin over the posts is to be cleaned
      off.   A true vertical line is to be left where the
      upstand concrete meets the posts.
The mesh panel on the short return and the 2nd
panel fream the south end do not fit true between
the posts.
The handrail posts are not vertical about the E/W
axis.   Again this is not acceptable and must be
rectified.

Dear Sir,
                Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                 Certificate of Ground Safety
        We have now studied your various comments written on
the prints of our drawings collected from Mr. Sherrif's
office on 2 August.   These were the subject of your letter
dated 6 August.
        Two copies of our revised drawings 1610/24A, 32C, 33C, 42,
37A, 38B, and 47 are enclosed together with one copy of the
calculations for the steel staircase and cantilever slabs on the
West Stand.
        Referring to your note added to the print of drawing
1610/31, representative sections of the pitch perimeter fence
have been tested at the Spion Kap end.   Sente of these
tests were witnessed either by Mr.          or a member of his
staff.   We find that providing the lower horizontal angle is
restrained somewhere near mid-span the existing arrangement will
safely withstand the 6.0kN/m teat load.   It has been discovered
that the base plate on the vertical frame leg has a single
holding down bolt in the centre.   Clearly these were fixed
first and then the post site welded to the plate over the
projecting bolt head.
        Also enclosed are duplicate copies of our drawings
1610/3A, 8C, 9B, 4IB, 44, 45 and 46 together with a copy
of relevant pages, 26-29, 36-48 and 50-55 from our tender
document for'the. upgrading of the internal partitions to
provide a nominal one hour fire resistance.
        The work is due to commence on 3 September 1979.
Your early comments would therefore be welcomed.

                                 Yours faithfully,

                  H w Crush Barriers and Handrails
        Thank you for your letter dated $ August.
        We suspect that your application to Messrs. Tarmac didn't
reach them until after they had forwarded their application to us.
Bonce the discrepancy In the figures,but as this is to your
advantage you should not become unduly concerned.
        The limits and percentage of retention are those given
in the X.C.B. Conditions of Contract i.e. 5% of the Total Tender
Sum.   Payment of retention money will be in accordance wlthCClause
60(5).   It does state in our invitation to tender to you that
the X.C.S. Conditions of Contract apply.

                                  Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr.

Dear Sirs,
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
             New Crush Barriers and Handrails
        Please find enclosed a copy of a letter dated 3 August
from Shaw Engineering Ltd. giving details of extra costs.
        Would you please comment on the costs given against
items 5 and 8 which we consider excessive.
        We understand that Mr.           instructed Messrs.
Shaw to increase the bolt hole size in the first three.     Could
you confirm that this instruction was given before the second
batch of angles had been manufactured?    We believe it was.
        Item 7, we assume, refers to work done by the welder
on site to assist your staff with the gpection and
placing of the posts and handrails.    If this was the casts.
Item 7 should not be charged as an extra to the contract.
Again your comments would be welcomed.

Dear Eric,
     We have received a letter from South Yorkshire
County Council a copy of which is enclosed. As you will
see we have only in the last week received confirmation
of their various requirements. Even now they have not been
absolutely specific on the fire protection and sets of
drawings are being sent back to them so that we may have
final approval.
     I note that there is a® mention in their letter
of a copy having come to you and clearly you should have
one on your file. Also I enclose copies of this
correspondence for the Chairman and Hr.
     Bearing in mind that the Working Party has taken
several months to reach its decisions, they will not be
able to blame the Club for the fact that not all the work
is completed before the start of the season.

                             Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr,

Dear ft1.       ■
?               StofiltM Wednesday loottell Club Ltd.
                 aesedlal Work to Iicistlng Barriers
    We have pleasure la enclosing two copies of our droving*
1610/1 I 2 showing the location of the various items of reaedial
work required after completion of tbe load testing,
    411 b o w tubes «ire to be sealed at the ends with San plates.
Slagle spans shall lie provided with 76.1ram diameter x 5ra» C.B.8. and
double or iKsltlple spans shall be provided with dO.SaH diameter x 5ma
C.H.S. Would you please measure and cut to suit oa site tbe materials
for all this remedial work.
    All new nuts installed are to be spot welded, after our
inspection of tbe vo*k, to prevent spectators dismantling tbe barriers.
    To overeoae tbe difficulties encountered when welding new tubes
on to existing corroded rails would you please Incorporate a C.B.S.
sleeve say aoOsn long either inside or outside tbe tubes. Tbe sleeve
and tubes are to be welded one to tbe other »nd any gap equalised and
completely filled with weld.
    When sleeves are added to the outside of tbe tubes a new and
larger clip will be required. There nay be instances where the
existing tube Is so badly corroded along its length that any welding
is impossible. If this proves to be the case we will probably consider
the replaceaent of the whole rail.
     Where end cap* are indicated a C.H.S. sleeve, 1SOa»
loag* 1* to be eeliled over tbe end of tbe existing rail.
Tbe sleeve may have to be longer in instances where the
existing rail is badly corroded. Tbs sleeve should be
sealed st the opes end. Again a new larger 0 U 9 will be
required to fit over the sleeve.
     The new gusset pistes are to be aade from torn thick
piste.

Dear Eric,

              Present:

                     Mr. E. England                                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                     Mr.
                                                                   Hallamshire Builders L t d . ,

                     Mr. J. Strange                                Eastwood & Partners.


3.1           Previous Minutes
                     Due to postal delays approval of the previous minutes was
              reserved until the next meeting.


3.2           Programme
                     Mr.                                       referring to Eastwood & Partners letter
              dated 26 July, said that a completed programme for the critical
              work had been produced.                              A copy of this was handed to Mr. England.
                     A further copy would be sent to Mr. Strange after the
              meeting.          Mr. Strange requested that the programme be extended to
              include the work which would not be substantially complete by
              11 August.
3.3           Progress
                     Mr.                                 reported progress on the critical items
              given below.

     a.) New exit at East end of South Stand open seating
            The timber hut had been removed from its original
     position.    Mr.            said that all the equipment found
     inside the hut had also been moved with the hut and the electrical
     supply disconnected.
            Mr. England requested that providing exit widths were not
     reduced consideration should be given to reposition the hut
     opposite the new gate opening onto the car park.
            Mr.             said that the riser dimensions shown on
     drawing 23A did not agree with site measurements.      Mr. Strange
      agreed to look at this detail after the meeting.     He also
      confirmed that the last    handrail post adjacent to the precast
      perimeter wall could be    moved and cast in with the new landing.
     The concrete was to be poured later that day.

      b) Remedial Work to Areas of Damaged Terracing
            The nosings of damaged steps at Leppings Lane end were
      complete.
            All the breaking out of areas of terracing would be
      complete by the end of 31 July.     Approximately one quarter of
      the area to be replaced had been concreted.
            Mr.             said that the areas broken out exceeding
      the quantities in the Bill by nearly 40m2.     Mr. Strange explained
      that it had become necessary to break out more of the old
      terracing than expected.    It had been found that though looking
     sound on the surface the terracing around the excavations made for
      the new barrier foundations had subsequently disturbed the very
      thin existing construction.
            Mr.             said that Messrs. Tarmac had still been
     using the tunnel exit at the North end of the Spion Kop on
     28 July.     This had delayed work by Hallamshire Builders Ltd.
     Mr. Strange refused to accept this as a reason for delay.          He
     replied that Messrs. Tarmac had cleared the area ready for
     Hallamshire Builders Ltd on 19 July.      The reason Messrs. Tarmac
     continued to use the tunnel for access was that Hallamshire Builders
     had not started work in that area.
                                                                   SHEET   3.

       c) New Emergency Exits at the bottom of Spion Kop
                The concrete work and gate frames would be completed
       by Friday 3 August.     Mr. Strange confirmed that slightly wider
       gates than shown on the drawings would be acceptable and a top
       cross member may be included to tie the frame legs together.
       The gates would be fitted before 11 August.
                                 £
       d) New Precast Concrete Stp Units and Barriers in North Stand
                All drilling was now complete and one row of units had
       been bedded.     The barriers had yet to be fixed but Mr.
       said these would be delivered on Thursday 2 August.

       e ) New Escapes from West Stand
                Demolition had not been completed though the formwork
       had been erected and reinforcement fixing was about to commence.
       The slab at the South end would be concreted by Friday 3 August
       and the North end by Saturday 4 August.
                Mr. Malthouse asked Mr. Strange if he would check, after
       the meeting, lengths of the parapet units that had been broken
       out against the dimensions shown on the drawings.      Mr. Strange
       agreed to this.

       f) Alterations to Exit from North side of Spion Kop
                Mr.           said this would be done after finishing
       the work at the bottom of Spion Kop.     The work would be complete
       by 11 August.


 3.4   Labour Returns
                Mr.           handed to Mr. Strange the labour returns
       for the previous week.     They shewed an increase of labour to a
       maximum of seventeen, not including specialist sub-contractors
       staff.


 3.5   Delivery of Reinforcement
                Mr.           confirmed that all reinforcement critical
       to the completion of the works had been delivered.


 3.6   Delivery of Structural Steelwork
                Mr.      ^ aid that all the items in the previous minutes
       would be delivered by Friday 3 August.
                                                                      SHEET      4.

 3.7   Concrete
                Mr.             reported that difficulties had been
       encountered on Saturday 28 July when pouring the first section
       of terracing on Spion Kop.        Due to the warm weather the concrete
       could not be placed quickly enough before applying the specified
       finish.        A good proportion of the 3^ m3 of concrete delivered
       had had to be discarded.        Mr. Strange said that if it was
       proving difficult to place the concrete within the specified
       time limits then smaller quantities should be delivered.          The
       British Standard also allowed a + 25mm tolerance on the measured
       slump.     A 50mm slump concrete could therefore reach 7 5mm without
       being rejected.
                Mr. Strange reported that inspection before the meeting
       revealed that the concrete in question was not being properly
       cured. Mr.                 agreed to cure the concrete for seven days as
       specified.        Mr. Strange said he would have no strong objections
       to the use of a curing agent if this was offered as an alternative
       method.


 3.8   Information Required by Contractor
                Mr.              confirmed that there was no outstanding
       information required critical to the works though he wished to

 For the attention of Mr.J.Strange.
 Dear Sirs,
                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd*
                    Hew Crash Barriers and Handrails.
          As discussed with you some time ago, we submitted our 1st
 Application, Interim Payment, to Tarmac Regional Construction, on the
 basis of 15% of Vaiua-Hnn, our invoice No.1263, dated 13th July 1979,
 in the sum of £           V.A.T. not applicable, refers.    We now
 enclose copy of          ontractors payment certificate received from
 Tarmac from which you will see we have been paid 3lightly in excess of
 the invoice we rendered, and also that there has been a 5% retention
 (increase) deducted.
          We have referred to our Form of Sub-Contract, with Tarmac
 Construction Ltd., dated 24th May 1979, and can find no reference to
 any Percentage of Retention conditions. We should therefore be glad of
 your comments and advice.
                                                Yours faithfully,
                                      GEORGE SHAW ENGINEERING (SHEFFIELD) LTD.,




                                                   Director.

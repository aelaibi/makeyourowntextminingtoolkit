HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY: MEETING WITH LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH
ON THURSDAY 11 DECEMBER

The Home Secretary m et Lord Justice S tuart-S m ith on Thursday 11 December
to discuss the H illsborough Scrutiny. You, Chris Bone and m y se lf w ere also
present.

2.       Lord Ju s tice S tu a rt-S m ith said th a t he had w ritte n m o s t o f the report w ith
a fe w loose-ends to tid y up. The judge said th a t the fam ilies w a n te d to su b m it
more material. The judge said th a t he w as happy to receive the material b u t he
did not th in k it w a s going to be sign ifica nt. M r Bone said th e y w ere claim ing it
w o u ld have a bearing on the video evidence o f the disaster.

3.      The fa m ilie s' law ye r w as tryin g to do a com parison o f the findings fro m
th e Taylor enquiry w ith the findings o f the inquest. The judge said th a t this
w ou ld be d iffic u lt because there w ere no actual findings fro m the inquest.

4.      The judge said th a t he expected to subm it his report in early January, firs t
or second w eek. He had sum m arised the fresh evidence fro m M r H o ld sw o rth
and Dr W alker. He w as planning to e xh ib it this as an appendix to the report. He
w as not proposing to e xh ib it any other material. The judge said th a t m o st o f the
sta tem e n ts w ere from the fa m ily s u p p o rt group and the records o f inte rvie w s
w ith them w ere m ainly transcribed. He had also had a long m eeting w ith the
coroner w h ic h had been very helpful, a m eeting w ith the chief constable w here
he to o k a long-hand note and Tim King, counsel fo r the fam ilies o f th e Taylor
inquiry. He did not w a n t the latter m eeting to be disclosed. He said it had been
confidential.

5.     The Home Secretary quoted to the judge w h a t he had said in the House
a bout publishing the evidence th a t the judge had looked at. This w as in
paragraph 5 o f Peter Edm undson's original note o f 9 December. The
Home Secretary said th a t he had hoped th a t m ost o f the evidence w o u ld be

1594cs
published and only th a t w h ic h related to the crim inal/disciplinary proceedings
should be excluded. The Home Secretary said he regarded the conversation
w ith King as confidential b ut he fe lt th a t the other material should be made
public in principle. Perhaps it could be published to the House o f C om m ons
Library.

6.        You said th a t there w as a possibility th a t the judge could d raw a
d is tin ctio n betw een w ritte n subm issions and transcripts o f meetings. And th a t
you hoped th a t w ritte n subm issions and evidence should easily be published.

7.     The Home S ecretary said th a t the best w a y to look at publication of
evidence w as to go th ro u gh the schedule o f the report. You agreed to ta lk to
Chris Bone about this. The Home Secretary said th a t fro m his point o f v ie w
there w o u ld be pressure to publish as much as possible.

8.     The judge said th a t there w ere no questions arising from the Salmon
Rules.

9. The key concern w as the w a y th a t the police sta tem e n ts had been taken.
They had been asked to w rite o u t their recollections o f the events. This m eant
th a t th e ir sta tem e n ts included co m m e n t as w ell as fa cts. The judge said th a t
the T a ylor inquiry had k n o w n about the statem ents. The solicitors had advised
the police to cu t the s ta te m e n ts to the fa cts only. H ow ever, th e y w e n t to o far.
The judge said th a t he did n o t see the amending o f the sta tem e n ts w o u ld lead to
crim inal or disciplinary proceedings against the police. The judge said th a t he
fe lt th a t the fam ilies already kn e w about the tam pering w ith the statem ents.
M r Bone said th a t the fam ilies w ere aware, im plying th a t th e y had not been
before th is inquiry. M r O w en asked the judge if he w as going to pass co m m e n t
on th a t police practice. The judge said he w as going to w rite th a t it w as not
inappropriate fo r the s ta te m e n ts to be changed as the inquiry team knew .
H ow e ve r, w h a t w as c u t o u t w e n t beyond ju s t co m m e n t and w e n t to factual
m atters w h ic h should not have been removed. The judge implied th a t Taylor
had made findings as if the original statem ents had been left. The judge said
th a t his firs t concern had been th a t the police had changed the statem ents
them selves, b ut th is w as n ot the case as th e y had been advised by solicitors.

10.     Given th a t th is is n ot publicly kn o w n , it w ill undo u b te dly a ttra c t a great
deal o f media a tte n tio n . The judge is not proposing to make any
recom m endations to proceed w ith discipline or criminal proceedings. The
fam ilies w ill be ve ry upset a bout the findings of th is report. I w ou ld be grateful
if you could liaise w ith CD to provide a media handling plan fo r early January,
once you have received a copy o f the report.

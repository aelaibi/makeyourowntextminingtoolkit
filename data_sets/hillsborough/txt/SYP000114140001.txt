 S-.MP-          and       attitude      of    all       fans       was    good.          We    were       there    until       approximately

                 2.45pm        when    we     were       transferred              to    the     football          ground,       where     we       were

                 We     had    just    got     ourselves             a    drink        when     we    were       told    to    leave     it    and

    never        seen         this         s o r t of    trouble            before.

    It wa s         horrific,             th e     Liverpool               fans      were        crushing and                  k i 1 1 i ng       the i r

    there        wa s     no     way      they        could move                particularly               at    the        front.

    Obviously             the       fences        were         solid        and      the     two      gates          at     either             s id e    of

    A ll      our    serial worked                   like       trojans.             What        each       individual                   officer             did

    specifically                 I can't         fully          say.            Other      than       to    immediately                   get      the

^   tw o      gates        open and          get       the      f a ns     out.

    Initially             I went          to     the     right          hand      gate       looking            towards             Lappings             Lane

    end.         I wa s        stood       just         inside          the      gate      with       one       leg       on    the           steps      and

    on e      leg    on       the    fence        dividing              the      centre       and      rig ht         terraces.                   I was

    pulling          and        lifting          fans        up a n d       o v er     the    fence         from          the       severe

    crushing             at    t h is     co r n e r .

    After        a while            and    in t he           p a ni c      I was       pulled         to    the       floor          a drop             of

    about        three         feet       by a d e s p e r a t e            fan.        I managed               to    get       up a n d          get        out

    onto       the       pitch       having          assisted              the    fan who          had      pulled             me    down and

    whom       I ha d         fallen       on.          I think            he    hurt      his     back.             I had          by    now         been

    replaced             by a n o t h e r        police         officer           doing       the      same          job.           I then went

    to a s s i s t        at     the      other        g a te    at        the    left       hand      side          of     the      goal.              In

    particular                S g t^Jjjfrvar d , P C ’s H o o s o n                  and Akred were                   there          possibly

    others          but       they      were      the        o n es     I bring         to    mind.

alofost          impossible               to     pull         them       out.         Fans       in s h e e r      panic          made       the

 ituation              a l m o st       imj30S_g_ib 1 e for                  th e    Police.           Some       were        obviously

drunk           and    very        abusive.               Some          were        lashing       out       and    hitting             us.       Some

had        to    be    forcibly            dragged             away,          whilst        the       good      f a ns    took         them      off

us     behind          the       goals         and       sorted          them        out.

These           were     the       fans        who       were       hindering              us    trying         to get         fans        out.

I remember               thinking              that,          th a t     many        bodies       were         pulled         out      that      it

was        difficult             to     find        a    patch          of    green        grass       behind          the     g oa l      to    lay

t he       bodies        d o wn.          Other          officers             there        at    th i s     p o i nt     t o ok     over        from

us     once          w e ’d put         them        down       giving           mouth       to m o u t h        etc,      etc.

Doing           what     I have           described,                was       done        until       the      terrace         in        the c e n t r e

was        relieved           of      pressure,               have       received           help from             the     emergency

services.               A     couple           of       the    front          fences        were       open.           How,       I don't          know,

Some        Liverpool              fans        were       hysterial                 and    difficult            probably

understandably                     so     but       it d i d n ' t           help     the       situation.

E-Iventually            by       the      time          most       of    the        bodies       were       either        taken          away      or

being           seen     to      on     the      pitch         by       other        officers          and      volunteers,               we     were

as     a    serial          led a w a y          to      behind          the        stand       near      the     gym.

We     then          had a       hot      drink          and       eventually              taken       to C l a y w h e e l s - L a n e          and

taken           back    to 131,           going          off       duty       at     6.30pm       that         day.

In     conclusion                I would            like       to       say     that       I h a ve       never        seen       such       pa n i c

by     football             supporters                  in m y      life       -     some       had    had      beer,         some       fought

with        us a n d        some        f an s      like       other          police        officers            deserve           a medal          for
                                                                                                                               PAGE

             the       way      they    helped      under        such    a horrific       and       distressing         situation.

             The       f a ns    behind      the    goal     were       their    own worse          enemies     crushing

             forward            so    blatantly         ir res pons'i b l y .

           ■ T was        terribly          d i s t r e s s e d at   what      I saw and       it    hurt    like    bloody     bell

             to    See       children,         girls,       boys,       m e n a n d vornen d i e i n g      in f r o n t    of me.

             without            being     able     to    do a n y t h i n g    that    would    immediately          relieve         the

             s i t u a t i on ..

             All       our      serial     were     very      upset      and    showed    emotion        in t h e i r      own w ays.

             I physically broke                    down when         I got      home    and    sa w my w i f e      and     daughter

             and       I'm      not    ashamed      of     it.

             The       memory         of w h a t   I had      seen will         stay with       me    for    the    rest     of m y

             life.

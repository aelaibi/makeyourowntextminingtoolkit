a mass of          people,      We j oined       in the     crowd and once        in there        I was

being     crushed.         I could not move my arms.                  I was just being            pushed

a bout    I had to go W here              I was being       p u s h e d . 'Nst was w or se      than

s tewards      outside      the ground.            I saw pebble       climbing over           the w alls to

get    into the ground.              I w oul d think        that   twv    weire g e tt in g out of the

crush rather          than getting           into the g ro un d      ridegally.                     _

Eventually         I was    pushed up to the              turn st il e ano\| got        in t hr o ug h the

Once     inside     the    g round       I did not see any signs telling me w here                       to go,

All    I did see wa'5sjright in front of me w here                       steps    going       up into the

s ta nd so     I went      up tm^t w a y .

As    I had e ntered the           g r t m nd I had h ea rd the w hi st le         go for        the k i c k

off.

Once     I got up into the stayed I could see                      people    stan di ng       in the

aisles.        I went      to where        the   rsjw my seat was        in (about        six    rows from

the    front)’X vThere was               someone    siting      in my s e a t .    I could see

looking t owards T^he pitch in the pens d i r e c t l y below there were people
                On
climbing tMjer the frtMpt fence on to the pitch.         My first r ea ct io n was

that     there w e r e s t r o u b l e    in the    pens.

P eo pl e were      being     pb^led up in to the             stand.      Some    of them were           crying

others were ga sp in g           forNbreath.          T h ey were     saying     that     they were       being

crashed and          people were dying.              As    I looked    into the     pen b elow          I could

see juSHv how         crushed      people were.            There were a lot of people                  on the

pitch now aS^           people     still      climbing      on to the     pitch.        I could also see

in the      pitch tfts^t people were               lying    on the    g round and were           being

g iven m o ut h to m o ur n and heart m a s s a g e .              I could see a bout 3 or 4

people      on the      pitch who were not moving.                   I did not know for             certain

              but    I thought         that    they were           dead.    I could see         people trying          to    pull

              d own tfTe-^Pront fence.                 I could also         see    people on the        pitch carrying

              fans     off an a o x e r t i s i n g     hoardings.

              I. e ve nt u a l l y    left           ground about          160Q hrs       (16Q0)   after     the

              announcement           that     the game had been a band on ed .                  At this     time   people

              had s topped           climbing       over   the fences a nd the             pens below were         quite

              empty.          I left the ground and went                   back   to the Mini        bus.     I was about

              the    last to get there.                 We then set off home.                  It was   not until           I got

              back to                    that       I found out ex ac tl y how m an y              people    had died.

              I did not see a n y t hi ng at the m a t c h that                     I w ou ld    consider     to be a

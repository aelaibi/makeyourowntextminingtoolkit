HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


Thank you for your letter of 26 October about which we spoke. As
I made clear on the 'phone, I am quite happy for you to have
access to the model made for the public inquiry in Sheffield, and
happy for you to photograph it for showing during your programme.
Of course, you will need to contact Dr Nicholson to make the
arrangements for access, and will need to comply with any
conditions which he might lay down.

   Dear Mr Whalley

   Further to my telephone conversation with Kate Humphries this
   morning, I am writing to ask if we may obtain copies of the
   plans and elevations of Sheffield Wednesday football ground
   which were drawn up for the public inquiry.

   We are making a documentary about the Hillsborough disaster and
   the plans would greatly assist our graphic designer in his
   illustrations of the lay-out of the ground.

   I should be grateful if your office could contact me in our
   London office on the telephone number below (extension 2386) and
   let me know if this is possible.

   Thank you for your help.

   Yours sincerely
       /

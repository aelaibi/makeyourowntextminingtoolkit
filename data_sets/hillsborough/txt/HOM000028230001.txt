INCIDENT AT AYRESOME PARK, 9 DECEMBER

Lord Justice Taylor has asked me to thank Mr Ord for his letter
of 13 December with a copy of Chief Superintendent Tasker's
report and a video of the incident at Ayresome Park on 9
December.

Lord Justice Taylor    intends to make a reference to this incident
in his Final Report,    which he is currently preparing.  He has
briefly set out the    facts of the incident from the evidence he
has seen, which are    in the paragraph below

     "The following facts are clear.   Leeds supporters had been
     allocated, as a standing area, a wedge-shaped pen "D" at the
     south east corner of the ground.   It was flanked by a narrow
     sterile area on each side.   There was a broad gangway
     running from top to bottom of pen "D". The perimeter
     fencing at the front of the pen was topped with spikes.
     There was nofa single gate to the pitch.    The only way out
     for those at the front was by a gate at each side into the
     sterile area and thence through another gate to the pitch.
     Those gates were closed during the match.    The capacity of
     the pen in accordance in-<iaoeraQ»oc with my interim
     recommendation, was 2108.   Leeds supporters were admitted to
     the pen, families with very young children being put at the
     front.  The gangway was not kept clear.    Some Leeds
     supporters managed to get tickets for the opposite home end
     of the ground causing apprehension of trouble.    A number of
     them were taken out and moved in to pen "D" from the pitch
     side.  Other Leeds fans with tickets for the wrong end were
     also allowed in to pen "D" from the back.    Shortly after the
     match started, there was distress among those at the front
     of the pen.  After two surges down part of the pen where
     there were no barriers from front to back, the police had to
     assist in getting spectators, especially children, out of
     the pen.   This was done principally over the fencing
     although the side gates were opened and shut a number of
     times.   In the event, 14 people had to be treated for minor
     injuries in the ambulance room.   Five spectators, three of
     them children aged 10, 11 and 12, were taken to hospital
     with chest injuries, lacerations and bruising."

As I mentioned to your secretary, I should be very grateful to
have your comments on this paragraph as soon as possible.

                Superintendent Tasker's report and a video of the
                incident at Ayresome Park on Saturday last.

                       Since I spoke to you on Monday, Mr. Smith,
                the Assistant Chief Constable (Operations), and Chief
                Superintendent Tasker have had discussions with the
                Club; have met with those responsible for the Safety
                Certificate; and will, this afternoon, visit the
                ground to discuss what changes may be necessary.

                      There are two significant developments so far:
               First, in any future all ticket match the Club will
               not relocate anyone who finds himself in a hostile
               part of the ground, especially when he has been
               devious or mischievous in securing a ticket.  Second,
               we think we have discovered the cause of the surge.

                         As you will appreciate, parts of football
               grounds can undergo structural change or modification
               over the years.     Block 'D ' at Ayresome Park has,
               even during the time I have been here, been reduced
               in size, had its shape altered and has had built into
               it corridors intended primarily for use by police.
               We have now discovered there is a depressed passageway
               which runs part way down the area.      In the old design
               it probably ran down the middle of the enclosure
               and probably from an entrance, so that it divided
               what was then a big standing area.      I have shown where
               it runs now and you will see that is where the surging
               occu r r e d .


                                                           continued
                          2




       -As I said on the phone, I will let you know
of any constructional changes at the ground after
this week's deliberations.

       I hope this information   is helpful.

                  Yours sincerely,




               Deputy Chief Constable

From:



                                 On Saturday 9th December 1989 I carried out a full briefing
                            or Sector Commanders in the Lecture Theatre at 11 am when details
                            of the Operation Order were fully outlined and contingencies for
                            dealing with visitors without tickets was discussed. In short
                            visitors without tickets were not to be allowed inside the ground
                            but to remain supervised outside within the sterile area.

                                 I arrived aL Lhe ground at 12.30 pm and conmenced duties from
                            the conmand cabin. I also issued a Police pocket set to the Club
                            Secretary and discussed actual arrangements. The gates were opened
                            at 1.26 pm.                                       °           r

                                Frcm the Ccmnand Cabin it was evident that my resources inside
                           the ground were depleted especially supervision of Block 'C'
                           because extra resources had been re deployed to Crathome to assist
                           with the reception of visiting coaches. However, at this time I was
                           satisitied that the Policing operation was in accord with the
                           requirements of the Taylor Report.

                                At approximately 1.30 pm I.received information that the
                           visiting coaches were delayed arriving at Crathome and that this
                           be affected         m6an ^     ^   planned cortvoy arrangements would

                           2pm the first convoy of 15 coaches arrived outside the ground i n ^ ^
                           Ayresome Park Road. These would not fit into the sterile area
                           ouLside Bloc c D and resources outside that area of the ground were
                            ully co.nmitted protecting visitors from home fans in the Clive Road
                           aL^cl     .

                          u i     aPProximately 2.15pm Inspector HARDCASTLE in charge of the
                          Holgate End reported he had a group of Leeds United fans inside the
                          Hoigate End having purchased tickets for that enclosure and that
                          their presence was likely to provoke disorder. In view of his
                          concern and the numbers involved and the fact that I had limited
                          resources at the time I allowed these Leeds supporters to be re -
                          in^otal t 0        °k 'D '    1 estiniate that this group would be 40


                               Shortly afterwards I saw a further group of Leeds supporters
                          approximately 30 in number being escorted by Stewards along the
                          cinder track towards Block 'D', these were directed to Block 'B'.

                               About this time Inspector HARDCASTLE reported that he had ■
                          identified other groups of Leeds United supporters inside the
                                 fu      had aPProached Police Officers stating that they
                         were in the wrong enclosure.                                   y

S.O. R ef                                                              Date

From:



                             I instructed that any further Leeds United fans identified in the
                            Holgate End must remain there and notified Chief Inspector DALE
                            to relay that instruction to Police Officers and Stewards in the
                            Holgate End. By this time it was becoming increasingly obvious
                            that a considerable number of Leeds United fans had been able to
                            purchase tickets for the Holgate End. I contacted the Club
                            Secretary Mr HUGHES and discussed the matter with him pointing out
                            that the Leeds United supporters in the Holgate End were a potential
                            source of disorder and I requested that I be allowed to re direct
                            Leeds supporters from the Holgate End into Block 'B'. After some
                            discussion he agreed. However, we both acknowledged that this was
                            an unsatisfactory arrangement because of the lack of segregation
                            facilities or other spectator requirements, especially lack of 1
                            toilets. Furthermore, confrontation with Middlesbrough supporters
                            was a distinct possibility.

                                At 2.30 pm a second convoy of 16 coaches arrived outside the
                           ground at a time when many home supporters were congregating at
                           the Clive Road junction and as the second convoy with Leeds United
                           supporters made their way along Ayresome Park Road across the
                           Clive Road junction they had to run the gauntlett of Middlesbrough
                            ans. Superintendent JONES was required to seek assistance from
                           Mounted Branch Officers to secure the situation and prevent disorder
                           between rival fans.

                                As kick-off time, 3 pm approached I continued to monitor Block
                               OI} the CCTV to ensure ground safety and at this time there was
                           no evidence of overcrowding or spectator stress and there was
                           adequate space on both sides of the terraces to cater for the Leeds
                           fans travelling to the ground on the remaining coaches although by
                           this time a number of spectators, especially families belonging to
                           the Leeds United Families Club were standing at the front of the
                           terrace reducing access along the front of Block 'D'. However, at
                           this time I had no means of knowing the exact number of spectators
                           occupying Block 'D'.

                                I was conscious that there was still a group of approximately
                           65 Leeds United supporters with Holgate End tickets waiting in the
                           sterile area outside Block 'D ' under the supervision of Inspector
                           WHITFIELD serial awaiting a decision as to whether they would be let
                           into the ground.

                                Meanwhile because of the congestion caused by Leeds fans
                           blocking the top of the stairway leading to Block 'D1, despite a
                           request frcm the Police Cabin to move forward, Leeds fans arriving
                           at this time were being led by Police Officers down the sterile
                           area between Blocks 'C' and 'D' and into Block 'D' by a gate
                           towards the front o£ Block 'D ' in the side railings, which was

                           there was rocm in Block 'D' terrace on both flanks but especially

Mr Yates



INCIDENT AT AYRESOME PARK, MIDDLESBROUGH 9 DECEMBER

I have seen Mr Whalley's note of 14 December and thought I
should complete the picture.

The incident at Middlesbrough, though relatively minor, gives
us some cause for concern for two reasons.      The first is that
the police have admitted, in a press statement, that they
transferred visiting supporters from the 'home' end of the
ground to the 'a w a y ' end so as to cause the 'a w a y ' end to
contain a larger number of spectators than its authorised
capacity.  Mr Goddard (F8 Division) has contacted the
Cleveland police and has asked for a report.

The second issue is that there seems reason to believe that
neither the crush barrier layout nor the calculation of crowd
capacity for this area of the Middlesbrough ground were in
accordance with the "Green Guide". Our technical adviser is
making his own calculation on the basis of plans and if he
confirms our suspicions he will visit the ground with a member
of my Division to discuss the position with the local
authority and the club.

Mr Derek Fatchett's Priority Written Question asking whether
the Secretary of State intends to ask for a report on crowd
safety at this match was answered yesterday in the
affirmative. But I do not think that anything would be gained
at this stage by indicating that we had reason to believe that
this ground was less safe than it should have been.

INCIDENT AT AYRESOME PARK, MIDDLESBROUGH, 9 DECEMBER


Today's Times (copy attached) has a piece by Martin Searby saying
that the Football Supporters' Association is asking Lord Justice
Taylor to visit the North East and hold an Inquiry into an
incident on 9 December at Ayresome Park football ground (when
Middlesbrough were at home to Leeds).  The article also says that
"initial responses from Lord Taylor's office (sic) to the request
for him to become involved are understood to be favourable".

2.   No request has so far reached Lord Justice Taylor from the
Football Supporters Association to hold an Inquiry into this
incident.  There has been no recent,contact of any kind with the
FSA, either from them to us or from us to them.

3.   On seeing the article this morning, I telephoned Peter
Jackson of Messrs Hill Dickinson, the solicitors for the FSA.    He
did not know anything about the article, but apologised for it
and undertook to make urgent inquiries.   His immediate reaction
was that there had been some impetuous or hot headed briefing.    I
also pointed out to him that, if that had been the case, the
briefing had extended to a further factual error - Lord Justice
Taylor made no recommendations about areas of the ground
considered unsafe for children.  Mr Willis has also telephoned
Martin Searby to set the record straight.

4.   When the original report of the incident appeared in
Monday's Times (copy attached) Lord Justice Taylor asked me to
seek a police comment on it.  I therefore spoke to Mr Ord, Deputy
Chief Constable of Cleveland, on 12 December and obtained an oral
report from him.  Mr Ord volunteered to send me a copy of the
police report on the incident, together with police video of it,
and I said that Lord Justice Taylor would find this helpful.

5.   Where incidents are occurring bearing upon Part II of his
Inquiry, I am making informal inquiries on behalf of Lord Justice
Taylor.   This has been done in relation to several football
grounds since the Inquiry started in April.   But that is all part
of the gathering of information for Part II of the Inquiry:   it
is not the same as holding a formal inquiry into a particular
incident.
6.   Lord Justice Taylor does not intend to respond favourably to
a request from the FSA, if they make one to him, to hold a formal
inquiry into the events at Middlesbrough.   His priority now is to
finish off his Report.  If the Home Secretary were to ask him to
investigate the incident, I think his response would be to ask
whether the facts of the case warranted it, bearing in mind the
inevitable delay in the production of the Final Report which
would result.  Ayresome Park has been visited by one of Lord
Justice Taylor's Assessors, Professor Maunder.   Lord Justice
Taylor did mention to me this morning that he could probably find
time to visit Ayresome Park over the Christmas holidays, part of
which he is spending in the North East.   But I told him that such
a visit, so soon after an incident of this kind, might well be
construed as the first step in a formal inquiry, and it would be
difficult to keep it at a low level.  He accepted the point.

    We    returned           to    Tankersley               intersection              at    approximately 2.10pm                        <1410)

    football          gr o u n d .

    We    came    across           a minor           r o ad a c c i d e n t      on    the       old A 616         n e ar    to     the

    using       this     route.

    We    then    travelled along                      the     Middlewood             Rd,       to L e p p i n g s    Ln,      then         to    the

    junction with                 the      A61.        Throughout             the     whole        of    t h is    journey,            we    h ad

    not    seen       standing             or    queueing          traffic          on a n y       of    these       r o a d s , right            up

    to    the    ground.

    Parked       vehicles            were        stretched          a     considerable               distance         along

    Middlewood           Rd,       and       the     occupants           were       all     in the        process           of m a k i n g

    their       way    in the           direction            of     the    ground.

Whilst           p a r k e d at         the      junction           with       the    A 6 1 , I was           a p p r o a c h e d by

    approximately                 f i ve     youths,          from Liverpool,                   sensibly          dressed and

    behaved,          w ho    stated            that     they       had    tickets           for th e         match,        but they         were

    in    the N o t t i n g h a m          Forrest          end     of    the       ground.         They were            told     to go      to

    the    Leppings           Ln     end,        and attempt             to    reason with               officials           there.

    They     stated          that       this       had      been     done,      and        that      they      had    been        refused

    entry.        Since           they were            by a p p e a r a n c e ,       neutral           fans,      they were            advised

    to    enter       the     Nottingham               Forrest          end,    and        to    keep     qu ie t .

At        approximately                 2.33pm         we    returned          to     the       traffic        lights        at     Leppings

    Ln,    and    remained              static         there       for a p p r o x i m a t e l y         five minutes,                 prior        to

    being       stood        down       for      meal       to B r i g h t s i d e     Ln.         During         this      short       period-,

    I witnessed              groups          of L i v e r p o o l       fans    approaching               the      ground,          singing,

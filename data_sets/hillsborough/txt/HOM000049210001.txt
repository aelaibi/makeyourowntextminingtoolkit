 Thank you for attending the meeting with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith at the Merseyside
 Maritime Museum on Wednesday 8 October.

 I attach a full transcript o f your discussion with the Judge. It mentions a solicitor by the
 name of Kevin ‘Julie’ - as I understand it (and please correct me if I am wrong) this was
 actually Kevin Doolev . I meant to phone the transcribers to make sure they got the name
 right, but I am afraid I simply forgot. Please accept my apologies for that - 1 expect that we
 can get a corrected transcript done if you would like one.

 You let us have three photographs of Paul at different times on the day. You told us that
 these were copies o f pictures which you still have. We were not planning to return them to
 you but we w ilfo f course do that if you ask us to. We will as the judge said (pages 11 and
  12 of the transcript) do what we can to sort out the mysterious timings on these photographs

Thank you for attending the meeting with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith at the Merseyside
Maritime Museum on Wednesday 8 October.

I attach a full transcript of your discussion with the Judge. You kindly gave us at the
meeting the papers you have had from the police about Gary. I confirm, as the Judge said at
the time, that we will return these to you after we have compared it with the material on
Gary’s body file.

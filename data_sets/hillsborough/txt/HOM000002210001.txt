  together with other members of the Merseyside Police Mounted

   S e r ir e a r it 176I4 THOMAS of the South Yorkshire Felice Mounted. ;We .
   had responsibility for the ISPINGS U S E end of .the ground, and r
   in^particular the turnstiles which were to

  -streets in             ^     ^   ^              about 1200hrs there were groups
   of youths, Liverpool supporters, in the area of the ground and .the
   surrounding streets, many of them drinking alcohol. There wer?.;..
   however n o -signs of disorder and the mood was-ppe* of good humour.

   bein# well -attended, but again with no signs .0^ disorder.                               .

     There is a -total of twenty three tmmstiles, with seven of them.: .
     providing acces to the TERRACE area, which I u n d e r s t a n d holds 10,000
     Louie            The layout of the front of the turnstile area is such that
      the *iteway 1eading into the confined(sectioned off) area is narrower
      than the distance across the actual turnstiles, thus creating a
      •funnel' leading to the turnstiles.
        1                                 From 1300hrs to about 11+OOhrs there was an
      intermittent flow of sv,,porters into tbe                        ^with no                  lf
           the turnstiles. The number of supporters in LEPPIKGS LANE itsell
      was increasing, but many of them were reluctant to go into the groun
       despite numerous request from us. and other Police Officers, hany
       Of t h e s e supporters were sitting on the pavement, an walls and grass
       verges, drinking, but again no disorder was taking place.
                                                                               over/

                                                               About 1l|00hrs we made a concerted effort to get
                                           supporters to go into the ground. Some did, but others chose to
                                          remain outside, and these people were moved away from the area of
                                           the turnstiles to allow easier access for those who wished to go
                                          into the ground.
                                                               About 1l|1$hrs a party of some 500 Liverpool supporters
                                          arraived at the ground, under escort from other Mounted Officers.
                                          ^These supporters entered the ground without problem, but shortly
                                          after the volume of people"began to increase around the turnstile
                                          area. I noticed that entry through the turnstiles was slow, in
                                          part due to the fact that supporters were being searched prior to
                                          entering the ground. At this point there were, to the best of my <

                                          crowd, because of the serious risk of injury to people in the crowd.
                                          The crush became so dense that it was now a physical impossibility
                                          to put horses back into the crowd.                I saw young children being

                                          the mounted officers the crowd would bot take heed and the crushing
                                          intensified. The mood of the crowd had now changed to one of panic,
                                          with some hostility. I began to feax for the lives of people in the
                                          crush, and felt that unless some drastic action were taken,: then

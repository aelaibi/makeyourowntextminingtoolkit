FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:   INSTRUCTION TO COMMITTEE
The draft of the text to be given to the Opposition Whips refers.
This was sent to Mr Watts and Mr Turney direct at the Fire
Service College who were generally content. It was agreed that I
would seek insertion of the words "if necessary" in line 2 of the
second paragraph after the word "give"; the word "directly" to
be suggested to the pen-ultimate line of paragraph 1 after the
word "enforce" (reflecting Legal Advisers comment); and more
accurately, perhaps, the words "Those Acts" should replace "The
1987 Act" at the beginning of the second sentence in line 3.
I cleared the main text with Private Office (as requested) and
conveyed the comments to Mr Kinghan DOE. He understood the "if
necessary" insertion but explained he would prefer to keep the
sentence as it stood so that it was no more complicated than at
present, and did not give rise to the need to provide further
explanation. Our point would, he said, be covered in the 2nd
Reading speech. As instructed, I did not press the point.
Parliamentary Counsel had recommended a change to the text of the
second sentence to read "... gives the Home Secretary power to
make orders modifying the Act which could, for example, include
provision requiring a local authority to include certain terms
and conditions in a safety certificate". Since Counsel drafting
the Bill is the same as the one who drafted the 1987 Act I felt I
should have no objection to thisl On reflection though, I think
it might have been better to have referred at the end of the
sentence to "classes of sports ground".

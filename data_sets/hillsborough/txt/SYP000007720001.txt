h eld up at a set            of traf f i c    l i g h t s by the sheer           volume   of traffic.

Due     to the      traffi c hold ups we did not ar r i v e at the Frog and Parrot

pub until          1.3Q pm    (1330).

I had a L e p p in gs Ln end ticket                for w h i c h    I paid six       p o u n d s , I bought

it direct         from A n f i e l d because       I am a season ticket              holder.

The re were         other L iv er p o o l    suppo r t e r s   in the      pub but there was         no

e x c e s si ve    d r i n k i n g and they were all well            behaved.        W h e n we   left the

pub to go to the             ground    1 saw some s u p p o r t e r s       drinking       from   cans but

again       it did not appear          to     be e x c essive and everyone was we 11

behaved.           We went    in the    car from the Frog and P a r r o t and                 parked the

car     in a s i de street        off M i d d l e w o o d R d .     We made        our    own way to the

g round and a rr i v e d outside             the gr o u n d at 2.45         pm    (-1445) but because         of

the     injuries      I received a have            difficulty         in remembering what           happened

a ft e r    I a rr iv ed at the ground.              I know       I went    into the L e p pings Ln end

w it h o u t     giving    in my ticket.         I stood       in pen three         directly      in line

wi th      the    right    hand goal    post but        I cannot       remember a n y t h i n g    else.      I

obviously          passed Out.



Two     of my friends         who were wit h me Paul               B R A D Y and Jo s e p h M c A R T H Y died

in the         disaster.      They were with me            in the g r o u n d but         I do not know

what       happened       to them because        I passed out.




I can say that where              1 was      standing was about            half way between the

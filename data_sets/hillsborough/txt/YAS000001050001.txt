           - BARNSLEY AMBULANCE STATION


Date:   20.4.89

Time:   1045-1115

Duty:   Day off


I was on my day off and was attending the match with a group of friends who
included________________ from my Station.

I was on the Notts Forrest end of the ground for about 1450. The game
kicked off. I noticed some time after that something was "going off" at
the other end. I made my way down from the Kop to the police and informed
them that I was from SYMAS, he said you would be needed to help, he opened
a gate and let me onto the field.

On getting a quarter of the way down the field I came across a person
laying on the floor with a man giving cardiac massage so I started mouth to
mouth, we had been doing it some time when a doctor came over and said
"don't do any more CPR with this patient he's dead - move on to someone
else".

We went further down and found another patient who I thought required CPR
this was started. The patient vomited which I inhaled, I cleared his
airway and turned him on his side and started to breath. A stretcher came
and took him away.

I then tended to several casualties who were laid all around. One patient
had a suspected dislocated shoulder and chest injuries. I noticed two
civilians running around with an ambulance type stretcher which I used, and
had the patient put on to and removed from the pitch.

On patient was hyperventilating, it took me several minutes to get him to
breath slowly. A male patient was so distressed that I had to spend time
calming him down, I handed him over to the police who took him to the
Casualty clearing point.

Gradually the field and stand became empty of casualties and as the last
few were removed, I finished treating casualties at approximately 1700.

I then made my own way home.

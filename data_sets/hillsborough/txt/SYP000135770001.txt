       Our Eef: VH/SEW
       Your Eef: HILLS/SOL/3.             20th September 1990

       Dear Sir,

       Hillsborough Disaster - Superintendent E. Marshall.

       Thank you for your letter of 19th September, which crossed with
       ours of 18th September.

       As we said in that letter, we appreciate the extent of your
       powers as regards the calling of evidence and the conduct of the
       inquest. We have no wish to challenge them.
&
       We are content to await the outcome of your deliberations and the
       representations which will be made to you by other interested
       parties.

        If it is your intention to refuse to be drawn into a further
        investigation into the alleged culpability of the police - my
        client in particular - and to refuse to allow representatives of
        the relatives to use the inquest as a platform for furthering
        their particular view of the matter to obtain support for
        private prosecutions, we shall have little or nothing to add to
        what is already known.

        If the relatives persist in trying to probe further into the
        control of the crowd before the match and the events which led to
        the opening of the gates, we should like to call Detective Chief
        Superintendent Foster of the West Midlands Police to produce the
        statements taken by his force relating to the pre-match conduct of
        supporters and then to call a selected number of the persons who
        gave those statements.______ a


        Yours faithfully
        VINCENT HALE & C

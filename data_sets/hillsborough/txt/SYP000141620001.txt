       A SHORT TIME BEFORE KICK OFF PENS 3 AND 4 WERE VERY CROWDED.
                                 /•
       PENS 1, 2, 6 AND 7 WERE HALF EMPTY.                SUPPORTERS SHOULD HAVE

       BEEN MOVED INTO THE PENS THAT WERE NOT FULL.                    SOMEBODY IN

       AUTHORITY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTING ANY MORE SUPPORTERS

       ENTERING THE TUNNEL LEADING TO 3 AND 4.                  THE FENCES ON THE

       AWAY TERRACE SERVE NO PURPOSE AS ONLY VISITING SUPPORTERS

       USE THIS TERRACE.         THE FENCES PREVENT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT

       ON THE TERRACE.        I HAVE STOOD ON THE TERRACE DURING A SHEFF

       WED - SHEFF UTD DERBY GAME.             IT WAS PACKED BUT THERE WERE NO

       FENCES OR PENS AND NO PROBLEMS.

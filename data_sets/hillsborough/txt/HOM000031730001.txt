    Thank you for your helpful letter of 17 July. I shall seek to publish as much
    documentary evidence considered by you during the course of the scrutiny as
    possible and I note that you will let me know if there are anydocumentswhich
    you consider it would not be in the public interest to publish.

    I am grateful to you for keeping me informed of the work you havealready been
    able to carry out on this scrutiny.

    May I take this opportunity to wish you a pleasant leave/




                                                        /




                                    JACK STRAW

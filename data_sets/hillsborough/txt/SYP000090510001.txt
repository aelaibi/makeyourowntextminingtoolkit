                I am Police C on stable                 of S o u th Y or kshire Police,            currently

                s ta io ne d at A tt er li ff e Police Station.

                On S a tu r da y   15th April     1989 150489        I was       engaged on u ni fo r m duty at

                the Fa S e mi - C u p F i n a 1 between Liverpool            and N o t t i n g h a m Forest F C .

                My duties were        such that      I was ^Pfrecting traf f i c at the j un c t i o n of

                Miruiia R&a d/with Burg gr ea ve          fad ,|J3hef f i e l d .    About 3pm      1500,      that

                d a t e , I was    called    into the Hi 1 lsborough F o o t b a l 1 S t a d i u m to deal

                wi th a P ublic Order         situation.

                I e nt er ed the ground and went             onto    the    pitch between the S pion Hop and

                the N or th S t a n d .     I be came aware      of Liverpool          supporters       on the    pitch

                and w ith other O ff icers          I began to usher             the fans    back towards        the

                L e pp in gs Lane    end of the g r o u n d .       I than,       with other Officers,           stood

                in a cordon whi ch f ormed along              the    half way       line on the       pitch.
                                                                                                                    PAGE                2
                                                                                                                    S3477

             After a short while              it became      obvious      that    something more           serious was

             oc curring      down the L ep pings Lane end,                as    people      carrying      injured or

             dead fans       on stretchers          passed through the            cordon towards           the Spion

             Hop end.                                                      ^

             Myself,       together wit h PC Alison                                  works at Atter cl if f e

             Police Station,             then m o ve d away from the            cordon and down           towards       the

             L e pp i n g s Lane    end.     As we did this            I saw some      p>rf)pie s truggling           to

             carry a person an ^ / h o a r d i n g , so            I then too4? haldAsf             the hoarding,           as

             did Alison,       and nsflaed carry the               perswyar dowrr^ra IfcwrSpion Kop end of

             the    pitch.     The       person on the hoarding a pp ea re d                lifeless and was

             motionle ss.          He    looked    like    he might      have been dead.            His    face w a s n ’t

             covered.        I did       place my helmet         on his    chest as we           carried him but one

             of the other          people     carrying      him grab be d my helmet and threw                    it away.

             I helped       carry this       person on the hoarding               to the      corner      of the      pitch

             near    to the S pion Kop and N orth Stand.                       Other   bodies       had been      placed

             on the ground          in this area,          so we      put the hoarding           down and      returned

             to the Leppings Lane              end.       We stood      in another       cordon of Police and                   I

             later       rejoined my serial           and wal ke d on patrol           from the ground to the

             C ity Centre.          I had no further            dealings with ajny injured or dead

             people that       day.                                              y      ,    .

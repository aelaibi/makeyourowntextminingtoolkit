1                                             Tuesday, 7th October,   19 97
2    iORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I have read your letter to me of
 3          1st August, which I think sets out pretty comprehensively
 4          the matters that you want to deal with?
 5   MRS. ROBINSON:      Yes.
 6    ORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       First of all, is the question of
.7          the video tapes?
 8   MRS. ROBINSON:      Yes.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I have got this question well in
10          mind and I am investigating it.     There are a lot of
11          conflicting rumours and allegations and so on about these
12          tapes.   You say in the last sentence or two of that first
13          paragraph:    "During the inquest senior officers of the
14          South Yorkshire Police stated categorically that the
15          camera that captured this footage was defective and
16          therefore the video evidence from the camera was extremely
17          poor quality." Can you be a bit more specific about that?
18          Who are you referring to?
19   MRS. ROBINSON:      It was during the inquest itself when the
20          Coroner -- when actually the jury get asking was there any
21          more film footage that they wanted to see and tree times
22          the Coroner said to know, them I don't know the name of
23          the police officer on the stand at the time, but three
24          times the Coroner said that this video evidence was not
25          available and three times they did asked for this and
26          three times they were denied it.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I follow that.   What you say is:
28          "The senior officers stated categorically that the camera
29          that captured this footage was defective and therefore the
30          video evidence from the camera was extremely poor."         That
31          is not what the Coroner said, that is what the police
32          officers said.      I just wondered who you were referring to?

34   MR.    ROBINSON:    It was during that the time the Coroner was
35          asking police officers was there any extra additional
36          video footage.      We don't know the names of the police


                                          2
 1          officers but it should be transcribed.
2     ORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       It was Mr. Bichard who said:      "Yes,
 3          there was."     He didn't know what happened to it?
 4   MRS. ROBINSON:       I understood they also said anything that was
 5          available from that camera was such poor quality,      I
 6          remembered the Coroner saying,:      "It's just a waste of
 7          time showing it to you.     There's nothing of any
 8          significance that you will see.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       It is Mr. Bichard you are talking
10          about, is it?
11   MRS.   ROBINSON:     Yes, he was the one.
12   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Mr. Bichard was not a very senior
13          police officer, he was a Police Constable.      I thought
14          perhaps you might have been referring to more senior
15          police officers?
16   MRS.   ROBINSON:     I think it was actually Bichard, that might
17          have been an error on our part.
18   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That clears that point up    anyway.
19          "On this basis the Coroner ruled that this evidence was
20          not shown to the jury during the inquests."      I can trace
21          what the Coroner said about so unless you happen to have a
22          reference for that?
23   MRS. ROBINSON:       No, I haven't, we haven't got references really
24          for anything.     It's just general matters.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Then your arguments are that the
26          evidence was deliberately withheld and so on.        As I say,
27          those are matters which are clearly very important which I
28          am going to look into.
29               I think that Mr. Houldsworth comes under that
30          heading. The question of selection of evidence.        I do not
31          I think have got any questions on that, I do not know
32          whether you want to say any more about that?
33   MRS. ROBINSON:       I am just a little concerned, I noticed
34          yesterday every time you mentioned the word "evidence" the
35          word "fresh" preceded it.     What exactly does "fresh
36          evidence" mean?


                                          3
 1    ORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I tried to explain this yesterday.
2         There are two necessary ingredients really; the first is
 3        that the evidence was not something which was considered
 4        either at Lord Taylor's    Inquiry or at the inquest.
 5   MRS. ROBINSON:   The word "considered" does that mean that the
 6        Coroner looked at it or he decided it wasn't necessary to
 7        show it to the jury?
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It rather depends how important it
 9        is.   I think it probably would mean by Lord Taylor or by
10        the jury.
11   MRS. ROBINSON:   I am more concerned with the inquest, I must
12        say, rather than Lord Taylor's Inquiry.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: If evidence was considered at Lord
14        Taylor's Inquiry then, to use a rather pompous expression,
15        it was in the public domain, therefore everybody knew
16        about it.   Whether or not it was put before the jury is
17        perhaps another matter.     But I think if the evidence was
18        not put before either Lord Taylor or the Coroner's jury-
19        then I have to consider the significance of that evidence.
20
21              I think I tried to explain to you yesterday that
22        there were 50,000 people at the ground and probably most
23        people saw a bit of something and there were a lot of
24        other people involved in the disaster.     Nobody would
25        expect every one of those people to be called as a
26        witness.
27   MRS. ROBINSON:   I am talking about a key witness.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The question which I have to decide
29        whether Mr. Houldsworth was a key witness if so why his
30        evidence was not given and what effects that evidence
31        might have on the verdict of the jury.     Those are
32        questions that I have to ask and answer.
33   MRS. ROBINSON:   I would have thought that if the Coroner's
34        words were that the pivotal evidence of the whole case
35         rested on whether or not the police could see what was
36         going on then Mr. Houldsworth's evidence was the key to


                                        4
 1         the whole inquest.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Possibly, but the problem is that
 3         the police could see perfectly well out of the window.
 4   MRS. ROBINSON:      Yes, we know that.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       So what they could or could not see
 6         on the video does not really add very much.
 7   MR.   ROBINSON:     In my opinion it did actually add things
 8         because the quality of the video evidence which is
 9         actually shown, in the sense that the camera could pan in
10         and pan out, could clearly show the distress of the fans
11         there, this is the point that we said time and time again.
12
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I follow that.    I do not know want
14         to argue with you but I do want you to just consider the
15         point that the difficulty about the video evidence is that
16         the police were looking out of the window, they repeatedly
17         said they were looking at the terraces, this, that and the
18         other.     They say they could see, obviously, because it was
19         under their eyes, that there were a lot of people there.
20         They said they did not appreciate they were full to
21         bursting.
22              It is not that they could not see but they did not
23         appreciate.
24   MRS. ROBINSON:      I see what y o u 're saying.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That is the point.    They did not
26         say I do not think, but I am waiting for further
27         submissions on this from Mr. Jones, they did not say, as I
28         read it, we could not see what the condition was in these
29         pens because camera 5, which is the relevant one, was not
30         working.     They did not say that at all.      They did say that
31         if we had noticed anything wrong we could have zoomed in
32         with either that camera or one of the other cameras.         I
33         think Mr. Bichard said he did not think it would help but
34         it might have helped but the problem was they did not
35         appreciate what was going on, so, therefore, they did not
36         zoom the camera in on that particular place.


                                          5
 1   MRS. ROBINSON:   The senior officers who are supposed to be well
 2        versed in crowd control, is that not a damning statement
 3        of their own incompetence?
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   I think that is one of the reasons
 5        why Lord Taylor criticised them so heavily, and why they
 6        have, in effect, not disputed liability.       I do not think
 7        there is any question about that.      I am not holding up any
 8        brief for the South Yorkshire police, I think they ought
 9        to have appreciated there was a serious problem.       They
10        ought to have appreciated that when they opened the gates
11        a majority of people would go down the tunnel.
12             The question and the critical question, really, is
13        whether that amounts to manslaughter.      Manslaughter on the
14        part of Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murray, those are the two
15        people who---
16   MRS. ROBINSON:   The word recklessness, does that constitute it?
17
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   Yes, it does, but I am afraid that
19        whatever I may think about whether or not there should
20        have been a trial for manslaughter I think that you must
21        understand that I can only recommend a reconsideration of
22        that question if there is fresh evidence, and it is said
23        that the video matter is fresh evidence, actually says
24        either,   "Well, you knew, not only ought you to have known,
25        but you knew."
26             Let us take a rather crude example.       Supposing Mr.
27        Duckenfield was overheard saying,      "Well, those pens are
28        jam-packed, my goodness me, if we have any more people in
29        there", let us say at 2.50,      "there's going to be trouble",
30        that would be an admission that he knew that they were
31        full to bursting and supposing he also was overheard to
32        say when the gates were opened,      "Well, my goodness me,
33        those people are all going into pen 4 or pen 3."       I take
34        that as a rather extreme case but do you see the problem?
35   MRS. ROBINSON:   Mm.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am explaining it to you because


                                       6
 1        I know that, if I may say so, you are an intelligent woman
2         and you understand the problems.      At least I think you do.
 3        That is the sort of evidence I am looking for.
 4                I am going to look at his video evidence very
 5        carefully because I have submissions,       I have very powerful
 6        submissions made to me by Mr. Jones and if they stand up
 7        then it is an important question.      If they do not stand
 8        up, and I have got to look at them very, very carefully,
 9        then there may not be anything      in this point.     I hope you
10        will try and understand what I      am saying.
11   MRS. ROBINSON:     Yes, I do appreciate what you are saying.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can we move on.     The cut-off time,
13        3.15.     You say evidence was only admissible in the inquest
14        up until this time but the Coroner deemed that every one
15        of the 95 victims had died or were brain dead by this
16        time. That is not actually quite what he did say.         What he
17        did say was that they had all received their injuries by
18        that time.     He was well aware,    as everybody else,   that
19        some people died after that time.      I do not think anybody
20        was under any misapprehension about that, were they?
21   MRS. ROBINSON:     No, but I think it's totally inappropriate when
22        the whole point of an inquest is to determine how, when
23        where.     The "when", he is saying he would not take any
24        evidence after 3.15.     If somebody dies at ten to four how
25        could you have an inquest on somebody who's not dead at
26        that time that your looking at it?       He's looking at 3.15
27        and the inquest clearly states how, when and where.
28                The "when" as far as I'm concerned that inquest is
29        totally invalid because it does not fit into those three
30        things.     The "when" is obviously wrong.       The "how" is
31        very, very debatable because a lot of them questioned the
32        fact that it was not traumatic asphyxiation that they all
33        died of.
34                The summaries we received on our children, as far as
35        I'm concerned it's meaningless because I don't think they
36        know what happened to my son.       They just made up a summary


                                        7
       to suit the occasion.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can I stop you there for a moment.
       Have you received a copy of the body file?
MRS. ROBINSON:      No, I haven't asked for one because I would
       find it too distressing to read.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Would you like me to look at it?
MRS.   ROBINSON:     Yes, I wouldn't mind that because   we really
       don't have    any evidence at all finding---
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Have you seen the summary?     Have
       you had the summary?
MRS.ROBINSON:       Yes.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What I will try and look and see
       whether the statement on the body files support what is
       said in the,summary.    A number of submissions have been
       made to me in the last 2 days to the effect that there are
       discrepancies, there is confusion and people do not know.
MRS.   ROBINSON:     I did not think that would have much bearing
       on--
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think that you are right, with
       respect.
MRS. ROBINSON:       That's why I didn't want to go and waste my
       time going into all that.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       If I may respectfully say so I
       think you are right about that.
MRS. ROBINSON:       Because it's not going to make any difference.
       The way I look at it, as far as I'm concerned the inquest
       was invalid, I've not had an inquest on my son and I think
       I'm entitled to and I should be entitled to ask the
       questions I want to ask and as an individual---
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What are the questions you want to
       ask?
MRS. ROBINSON:       Well, basically about the role of the police
       because as far as I'm concerned they failed in their duty
       of care to my son on that day and they are totally
       responsible.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Did you make any claim for
 1         compensation in respect of your son's death?
 2   MRS. ROBINSON:      No.
 3   MR.   ROBINSON:     It was a statutory--
 4   MRS. ROBINSON:      Just a statutory whatever.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      For bereavement?
 6   MRS. ROBINSON:            ]or something.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I know it seems derisory almost
 8         but---
 9   MRS. ROBINSON:      It helped pay some of the expenses we had with
10         the barrister at the inquest, that's the way I look at it.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not think it would be
12         particularly helpful if I gave you a lecture on the law of
13         liability in relation to death because a lot of people
14         think that the compensation which is payable under the
15         statute is inadequate.     On the other hand, what is
16         adequate for the loss of a son?
17   MRS. ROBINSON:      I was never interested in that side of it, I
18         was more interested in those responsible on the day who
19         failed in their duty, clearly failed in their duty, they
20         should be brought before a criminal court and that is
21         really what I feel and until that happens none of us will
22         rest.     As far as I'm concerned I've not had an inquest on
23         my son.
24                 Also I question the Coroner's role because he was
25         employed by the City Council and they were one of the
26         bodies that were being held partly responsible, so it was
27         clearly a conflict of interest that he should have sat in
28         that court.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not think he is employed by
30         them.
31   MRS. ROBINSON:      They paid his wages.   He negotiated his wages
32         with them, so--
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      This was a point which was raised
34         in the Divisional Court, if it was not it ought to have
35         been.
36   MRS. ROBINSON:      I just feel as though everything has been swept


                                        9
 1         away and as far as I'm concerned, I'm a lay person, but
 2         that inquest was invalid and it does not stand.      I do not
 3         hold a death certificate for my son, they asked us to send
 4         Â£2 and receive a death certificate from Sheffield City
 5         Council with accidental death on it and I would not do
 6         that.    As far as I'm concerned his death was not an
 7         accident.
 8   MR.   ROBINSON:     Just picking up from that, about the 3.15
 9         cut-off time, there is fresh evidence come forward from
10         Dr. Ed Walker that basically bears out the fact that at
11         3.15 â€”    what Popper was basically saying at 3.15 people
12         had either died or they would not have been able to
13         recover from their injuries.      That is not borne out in
14         medical evidence to suggest that that is indeed the case.
15         That was a statement that was made that was never really I
16         d o n 't think.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What the Coroner said was that by
18         3.15 those who died had received their injuries, they did
19         not receive any further injuries thereafter.      As far as I
20         am aware that is correct.     He did not say that they were
21         all dead by 3.15 because it was perfectly obvious that
22         they were not.     It was also perfectly obvious that a
23         number of people who were taken to hospital recovered.
24   MRS. ROBINSON:      But a lot more would have recovered had they
25         been sent to hospital, my son didn't even get taken to
26         hospital.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That may or may not be so, I do not
28         know.
29   MRS. ROBINSON:      I mean, it is unforgivable that they were never
30         taken to hospital.      How can they justify â€”   how many did
31         go into hospital?
32   MR.   BONE:    14, I think.
33   MRS. ROBINSON:      14 out of 95, it's now 96.   It's a grave
34         matter.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       If they were actually certified
36         dead before the question of sending them to hospital


                                        10
 1          arises there is no point in sending a dead person to
2           hospital, is there?
 3   MRS. ROBINSON:     Who certified them dead?      I mean there is so
 4          such strange evidence.     The main thing, another main point
 5          I had, they realised what had happened quite soon and why
 6          did they not put a disaster plan into action?       As far as
 7          I'm concerned the reason they didn't was because they
 8          wanted to cover up their failings.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Who?
10   MRS. ROBINSON:     The police.    They wanted to cover up, they
11          realised they had lost control, they had made a complete
12          hash of it and they thought if we bring a disaster plan in
13          now, press the button, whatever sets it into motion, that
14          will immediately focus and people would have seen what
15          happened.   Instead of which the police went behind closed
16          doors, the families, who were looking for their loved
17          ones, they got to the gymnasium and even though they knew
18          their children were in there they were told,       "They are not
19          here, go and try all the different hospitals."
20   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I know there was    a desperate amount
21          of confusion.
22   MRS. ROBINSON:     As far as I'm concerned the police did that
23          because they were busy getting together and forming their
24          own little plan,   "We'll have to say that this happened,
25          that happened, we'll say they were all drunk and they were
26          all this and we'll concentrate on that and that will take
27          the focus off us", and that is, in my mind, exactly what
28          happened.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       On the day?
30   MRS.   ROBINSON:   On the day, yes.
31   MR.    ROBINSON:   It's interesting that it was      Duckenfield who
32          started this whole thing off by basically saying from the
33          word go it was fans who â€”        he was the senior police
34          officer who started this, to me, tissue of lies.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That was a disgraceful---
36   MRS. ROBINSON:     He should take the can, he was the man in


                                         11
 1         charge on the day.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      There is a great deal of force, if
 3         I may say so, in what you say about that.       It was a
 4         disgraceful thing to have said and I think it has remained
 5         to haunt Mr. Duckenfield for the rest of his life?
 6   MRS. ROBINSON:     I hope it does.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am sure you do, but when we are
 8         summing-up criminal cases to a jury we have to tell juries
 9         that simply because somebody tells a lie does not mean
10         that they are guilty of the offence with which they are
11         charged. In other words, in a murder case simply because
12         somebody has told a lie does not mean that they are a
13         murderer.
14   MRS. ROBINSON:     No, but it usually means that you can't take
15         much notice of the rest of their evidence.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not think anybody did take
17         much notice of the evidence of Mr. Duckenfield.
18   MRS. ROBINSON:     No, he was like a robot, he'd been programmed I
19         think.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Lord Taylor was highly critical of
21         him.     I have read some of the cross-examination of Mr.
22         Duckenfield at the inquest and it can only be described as
23         evasive, mind you, he was asked the same question time and
24         time again and I think he even I might well have been
25         evasive towards the end.
26   MRS. ROBINSON:     Another small point, well, it is not a small
27         point, it is quite a big point really.     The West Midlands
28         Police who did all the investigating with regards to the
29         Hillsborough.     They were at the same time being
30         investigated by South Yorkshire Police for fraud.          Doesn't
31         that â€”    you know â€”   isn't that ridiculous?
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not know what fraud they were
33         being investigated for.
34   MR.   ROBINSON:     The point being that there was one police force
35         investigating another police force.
36   MRS. ROBINSON:      They were both investigating each other.


                                          12
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       This always happens,   I am afraid.
2    MR.   ROBINSON:   There's got to be a conflict of interest there.
 3         This I think in terms of your enquiring y o u 're asking if
 4         there is significant evidence and we actually think that
 5         there is a conflict of interest where one force is
 6         investigating another.
 7   MRS. ROBINSON:    They could have picked another force who
 8         weren't being investigated.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Maybe they could, but the fact is
10         that nobody else can carry out an investigation such as
11         this except another police force.
12   MRS. ROBINSON:    Why choose the one that---
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I do not know.
14   MRS. ROBINSON:    Doesn't that smell basically.      I mean all along
15         the line it is as if we'll do this---
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Can you tell me a little bit more
17         about this investigation of the West Midlands Police?           Who
18         was being investigated?
19   MRS. ROBINSON:    Apparently the West Midlands Police were being
20         investigated by the South Yorkshire Police for fraud at
21         the time.
22   MR.   BONE:    It must have been some officers rather than the
23         force?
24   MRS. ROBINSON:     Yes, but I mean they were---
25   MR.   ROBINSON:    It was a major investigation.
26   MRS. ROBINSON:     It   was a major investigation and in fact there
27         was a big department closed down because of it.        It was
28         quite a major     thing.    So it stands to senseoneis going
29         to say to the other:       Look, we'll out that bit of evidence
30         if you leave that out for us and so we'll balance it up so
31         we can all make it all neat and tidy.
32   MR.   BONE:    Was this department closed down the Serious Crime
33         Squad?
34   MRS. ROBINSON:     I don't know exactly.
35   MR.   ROBINSON:    It's basically just the general point that
36         there's got to have been a conflict there.        It doesn't


                                          13
 1        happen in any other part of society where if somebody is
 2        investigating somebody it's normally independent, it's an
 3        ombudsman, it not the same organisation that does it.
 4        It's got to be a clear conflict of interest, as indeed the
 5        Coroner appointed by the Sheffield City Council there's
 6        got be conflict of interest.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I suppose they could have appointed
 8        the Devon and Cornwall Police but it would not have been
 9        very convenient.
10   MRS. ROBINSON:     Not convenient but it might have been a bit
11        more fair
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I take your point, I may have to
13        look into what this investigation was.     I think I should
14        perhaps remind you of something which Lord Taylor said
15        that he was â€”     have we got his report here:   "I should
16        like to thank all those who have made it possible for the
17        oral hearing to take place so soon after the events and
18        for evidence to be efficiently presented and tested so as
19        to give a full and fair account of what happened in all
20        its aspects without in the irrelevancy or duplication.
21             I pay tribute to the particularly to the West
22        Midlands Police for their speed and dedication in
23        gathering the evidence and to all those responsible for
24        processing it.
25             The most eloquent tribute to the fairness and
26        thoroughness of the police investigation came from the
27        Secretary of the Football Supporters Association.      He said
28        that there had been an initial anxiety in Liverpool as
29        whether that investigation would be fair and objective.
30        His Association therefore collected 200 witness statements
31        themselves.     Having heard the opening statement of Counsel
32        to Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered by the police
33        he found it accorded entirely with his Association's
34        evidence and initial anxiety was wholly dispelled."
35             I have read the passage in the Taylor Inquiry where
36        counsel, Mr. Jackson, for the Football Association


                                       14
 1        Supporters in terms said that.       Nobody that I have come
 2        across so far has criticised Lord Taylor's Inquiry in any
 3        shape or form and that is a pretty eloquent tribute to
 4        what he regarded as the fairness of the investigation.
 5             I am going to need a bit more than just supposition
 6        to go behind that.
 7   MRS. ROBINSON:    I appreciate what you're saying.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     So far I have had one or two
 9        suggestions that particular witnesses were prevailed upon
10        to change their testament.        Those obviously are things
11        that I will look into but I really do not think that I can
12        just take on board a blanket suggestion in the light of
13        that, which was much closer to the time.        The idea that I
14        can now sustain or anybody can sustain an argument that
15        the West Midlands Police were deliberately suppressing
16        evidence, were not putting a fair picture before either
17        Lord Taylor or the inquest.
18   MRS. ROBINSON:    The problem is nobody will ever know that.         It
19        is what we feel.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I cannot just go on feelings,       I am
21        afraid.
22   MRS. ROBINSON:    I can understand that.      Going back to Lord
23        Taylor's report.     I mean I think everybody, we were
24        obviously quite pleased when that came out, we thought
25        we're on our way to get a bit of justice.        Yet obviously
26        at the inquest it was not related to at all.        Then, of
27        course, we get an accidental death verdict, which I think
28        was the only verdict the jury, given the evidence put
29        before them, could bring in, particularly with the
30        Coroners summing-up.
31             But that to me does not sit right with the police
32        being blamed by Taylor.     He did put quite an apportion of
33        blame to them.     I understand the Coroner got round it by
34        saying:     "I am not saying that accidental death means
35        there was no blame whatsoever."        But really to call it an
36        accident, an accident is when you slip on a banana skin.


                                       15
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    This is a question really which
2         goes much wider than ray Scrutiny.     A lot of people do
 3        think, and Professor Scraton is one of them, that there
 4        ought to be verdict that an inquest jury can bring in
 5        between unlawful killing and accidental death.          On the
 6        other hand, and if I may say so I myself I think am of
 7        this school of thought, that questions or civil liability
 8        are much better left to a civil court.       I have a great
 9        deal of experience of sitting as a civil judge, I have
10        dealt with hundreds of cases of fatal accident cases and,
11        frankly, I think most people would prefer to have a High
12        Court judge or a judge deal with those problems than a
13        coroner and a jury.
14   MRS. ROBINSON:     But we just didn't have the option, did we?
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     This goes back to the question of
16        the civil case.     I tried to point out to you yesterday
17        that in effect the police admitted liability for civil
18        negligence in the civil proceedings and that is--
19   MRS. ROBINSON:     They have admitted liability, is that what you
20        are saying?
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I have not seen a formal admission
22        of liability but what they did was to accept full
23        liability, they did not contest liability in any of these
24        cases.   What they did do was to seek contribution from the
25        other people who were criticised by Lord Taylor, they were
26        perfectly entitled to do that.       They never said:    "We are
27        not liable."
28   MRS. ROBINSON:     But they never said:    "We are liable" at the
29        same time.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     But they accepted liability.
31   MRS. ROBINSON:     It's just like in a car crash when you get two
32        different insurance companies, one pays out without
33        accepting liability.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     No, it is not.
35   MRS. ROBINSON:     Is it not like that?
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     No, it is not like that at all.        It


                                       16
 1         is like a pedestrian who is on a pedestrian crossing who
 2         gets run over       and suffers very seriousinjuries and the
 3         insurance company for the       motorist say:     "What is your
 4         claim here?     We are not contesting liability"       or they
 5         actually settle the case on a full liability basis or they
 6         go to court and they do not contest liability.          The only
 7         contest is as to the quantum of damages.          That is what it
 8         is.   To me it does not make a ha'penny of difference
 9         whether somebody gives a formal admission of liability or
10         whether they say liability is not contested.          It is
11         precisely the same thing.
12   MR.   ROBINSON:     It    still seems to be at the    moment the police
13         have never basically apologized.          I don't actually think
14         they've ever admitted liability.         The Taylor report, the
15         main conclusion is, the main reason for the disaster was
16         failure of police control and yet during the inquest, and
17         this is one of our major points of concern, we weren't
18         ever asked â€”       we weren't able to cross-examine some of the
19         key witnesses.      We weren't able to ask what the criteria
20         Dr. Popper gave on the selection of witnesses, which to us
21         was the biggest--
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Nobody is ever allowed to do that,
23         the question of selection of witnesses is a matter for the
24         discretion of the Coroner.          Unless it can be shown that he
25         has not exercised his discretion properly, and that would
26         involve an application to the Divisional Court, there is
27         nothing that can be done about it.          There was an
28         application to the Divisional Court, this point was not
29         raised, and so far as I know he may have called a whole
30         lot of irrelevant and unnecessary police officers, I think
31         he probably did, but      he certainly called the keys
32         witnesses, he called      all these policemen.
33   MR.   ROBINSON:     He didn't   call â€”     he talked about evidence he
34         called about pivotal      evidence, just going back tothat,
35         but he didn't call.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        He talked about what?


                                          17
 1   MR.    ROBINSON:    In his summing-up and during the times of the -
 2          - on a few days of the inquest he kept saying to the jury
 3          during the summing-up:     "The pivotal evidence on this
 4          whole case rests on the video footage that was available
 5          to the police in the police control room."
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I do not think he did say that.
 7   MR.    ROBINSON:    He mentioned the fact that the cameras played a
 8          pivotal part of the evidence that the jury needed to---
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       If he did say that I shall look
10          again at what he did say.     I do not believe he did say
11          that.    He said:   â€œThe critical question was whether the
12          police appreciated how full the pens were at the time that
13          they opened the gates."     I agree that is a critical
14          question.     I do not want to go back over this because we
15          discussed this are earlier.
16                  I think we are running a bit out of time.    Is there
17          anything else that you want to say?
18   MRS. ROBINSON:       I just want you to mention, I know you have
19          said a lot of it is fresh evidence and you can't really do
20          anything about this, that or the other which is not fresh
21          evidence.     But in this letter from Jack Straw I've noticed
22          he says, I will just read the paragraph:       "I have decided
23          in the all the circumstances that there should be an
24          independent Scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
25          significance..."    "No   matter of significance" does not say
26          evidence, it says "no     matter of significance".   I think
27          that basically---
28   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can I just have a look at that?
29   MRS.   ROBINSON:     Yes, I think that   means any concerns we have
30          may be voiced to you.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       He has sent a copy of my terms of
32          reference.     I have to abide by my terms of reference.
33   MRS. ROBINSON:       I think I'll have to write to Jack Straw.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I have to say to you, Mrs.
35          Robinson, that I have actually gone quite a long way
36          outside my terms of reference because a lot of the


                                         18
 1        families are concerned with the last hour or so of their,
 2        a few minutes even, their son's life.       As you I think
 3        appreciate, that actually       has got no bearing on the
 4        inquest.
 5             On the other hand, I fully appreciate their desire to
 6        know that, if I can help them about that I shall try and
 7        do so.     But it is not going affect, I am afraid they do
 8        not grasp this, but I do not think it is going to affect a
 9        fresh inquest.
10             Thank you very much for coming.       If there is anything
11        you feel when you go home that you needed to say and have
12        not then by all means write to me.
13   MRS. ROBINSON:    We will do that.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Thank you very much indeed.

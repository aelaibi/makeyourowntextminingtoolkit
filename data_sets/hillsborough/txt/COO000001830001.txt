          EC AID FOR HILLSBOROUGH

          1.   Thank you for your letter of 1 3 June. Alan Kingston's letter
          of 1 4 June is timely in allowing us to take forward allocation of
          the EC money.   I note this will be handled through you.

          2. I recalled that we had left open the question of who should
          lead. But I am content to submit a Prime Ministerial letter to
          thank M Delors for the Commission, money^ unless you now wish to do
          so in the light of Alan's letter.

          3.   I am copying this to Tony Budd and UKRep.

           Dear Mr Dorries

           Hillsborough Disaster

           Thank you for the copy of the transcript relating to Adam Edward
           Spearritt.

           May I also please have a copy of the transcript for the morning of
           1 8 April 1 9 9 0 . My notes of that morning are not complete but I
           believe that there was reference made to the case summaries and the
           status as evidence of the summaries (and possibly the documents
           referred to in them).

           Yours sincerely

         Dear Mr & Mrs Spearitt

         HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

         Further to my letter of the 10 August 1992 I have now received replies to the
         further enquiries that I was making.

         Unfortunately the situation has not changed at all.  The makers of the
         statements involved remain unwilling for them to be released and no form of
         compromise seems possible.

         As I have previously explained to you it is not within my power to release
         these statements to you and I am advised that anyapplication to the High
         Court to prohibit me from releasing the statements would most probably be
         successful.

         I am very sorry that I have not been able to help as much as you would have
         wished.


         Yours sincerely

        Dear Mr Dorries

        HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

        Thank you for your letter of 2 July in which you sought advice
        on the release of documents relating to the Hillsborough
        inquest.

        While ultimately this is a matter for you to decide, we take
        the view that as the statements made by members of the South
        Yorkshire Ambulance Service were not admitted at the inquest
        under rule 37 of the Coroners Rules 1984, they do not fall
        within rule 57. In the case of R v Hammersmith coroner ex
        parte Peach [1980] 2WLR496 the view was taken that police
        statements which were passed to the coroner for his
        information but not admitted as documentary evidence at the
        inquest were police property and that the coroner could not
        hand them over to the relatives without a breach of confidence
        or trust. This case appears to be analogous and we consider
        that the ambulance staff statements are the property of the
        South Yorkshire Ambulance Service and that if you copy them to
        Mrs Spearitt without the consent of the Ambulance Service, you
        are likely to incur breach of confidence or trust.



                                                     Yours sincerely

Dear Sir,

Inquest Statements

I refer to recent correspondence   in the above matter.  I would
draw your attention to my letter   of 4th June wherein I requested
copies of all witness statements   relating to Adam's death and
referred to in the West Midlands   Police Summary of Evidence viz:-

P.C. Stephen Harratt




I look forward to receiving the above mentioned statements.


Yours faithfully




E. Spearitt

             Mr & Mrs E Spearitt




             Dear Mr & Mrs Spearitt

             HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

             Further to our recent telephone conversation I am writing to advise you of
             the up to date situation on your request for sight of various statements.

             You are aware of the case of R v Hammersmith Coroner (exp Blair Peach) which
             makes it clear that statements given to a Coroner by the Police for the
             purpose of an Inquest remain in the ownership of the Police.  The Coroner has
             no power to let other parties have sight of these documents unless they
             subsequently fall under Rule 57 of The Coroners’ Rules. Rule 57 entitles an
             interested party to obtain from the Coroner a copy of "any document put in
             evidence at an Inquest".  This would normally mean a statement which was read
             out to the Court as an agreed piece of evidence in the absence of the person
             who made the statement.

r    ‘\
             The power to release the statements requested therefore lies with the South
             Yorkshire Police and not with me. The Police have taken the view that they
             should not release statements without the consent of the statement maker.   I
             gather that in the vast majority of cases this permission has been given and
             thus legal difficulties have been avoided. Unfortunately the situation has
             not been so straight forward in A d a m’s case.

             Dealing with each of the requests in turn:-

               a)   The statements   of former                                 do not fall
                    within Rule 57   but he has now given his consent for the release of the
                    statements and   these should have been posted to you last Friday direct
                    from the South   Yorkshire Police.

               b)   In the main the statements of Pc Harratt do not fall within Rule 57.
                    This Officer gave oral evidence at the Inquest and it is quite plain
                    •therefore that Rule 57 cannot apply. However, Pc Harratt’s statement
                    of the 4 October 1989 was put to him on a number of occasions during
                    his evidence and I take the view that either this statement was an
                    exhibit or that it should fall within Rule 57. Accordingly I enclose a
                    copy of that statement. Unfortunately it will not be of very much use
                    to you as this was the third statement taken from the Officer, the main
                    factual evidence being contained in the two earlier documents.

                                                                              Cont/d....

    APSAAU
                                            - 2 -


           At the present time Pc Harratt has not given his consent for the
           release of the other documents but I have to-day approached the Police
           again and asked that a Senior Officer speaks with Pc Harratt to see if
           there is any prospect of him giving consent.  I will let you know the
           result of this immediately it is communicated to me.

      c)   The statements of Ambulance Personnel do not come within Rule 57. Each
           of the three people involved have refused permission for the release of
           their statements.  I understand that this is a policy decision by all
           members of the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service rather
           than in any way related just to Adam’s case.   I have asked that this
           decision be re-considered but without success.  I am not at all hopeful
           that any different result can be achieved but I have now been invited
           to speak again with the Solicitor representing the Ambulance Service
           and I will do this in the next two or three days.  I am not sure if any
           form of compromise can be worked out but as I am very sympathetic to
           your request I will certainly make efforts on your behalf.

    I will continue with the various points mentioned above and will write to you
    again within the next ten days.


    Yours sincerely

         My clients: South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service

         When we last spoke, you asked me to speak to the three people whose
         statements you are considering releasing. I have not spoken to them
         but I understand that             of SYMAS has spoken to them once
         again and they have confirmed their objection to the release of the
         statements.

         I look forward to hearing from you when you heard from the Home
         Office.

          Dear Mr Dorries

          Hillsborough Inquests - Adam Edward Spearritt
          My clients: South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service

          Thank you              for    sending             me       copies             of         the        transcripts     which                I
          requested.

          I have been through the transcripts and considered rule 57 of The
          Coroners Rules.

          It seems to me that rule 57 relates to documents produced by, or put
          to, witnesses in the course of their giving evidence.      The three
          statements which you have been asked to supply copies of do not come
          into that category.

          The case summaries contain matters which seem to have been taken
          from the statements but they do not expressly refer to the
          statements themselves.

          The status of the summaries themselves was dealt with by Dr Popper
          on 18 April 1990. I would refer you to the paragraph which starts
          at E on page 16 and finishes at A on page 17 of the transcripts for
          that day (unfortunately the transcript has 2 numbering systems; the
          pages are also numbered 13 and 14). That paragraph makes it clear
          that all of the evidence to be given by the Presenting Officer was
          hearsay. At no time did the Presenting Officer who dealt with the
          inquest of Adam Edward Spearritt produce the SYMAS statements, nor
          were they put to him.

Continuation    2


Date    22 June 1992


        I should also add that the statements themselves were actually
        produced for the Hillsboroguh Inquiry and not for the inquests. I
        enclose copies of consent forms signed by the 3 individuals
        concerned in May 1989 which authorised the release of the statements
        to the police in connection with the Hillsborough Inquiry.

        In all the circumstances I suggest that it is not appropriate to
        release copies of the statements without the consent of the 3
        individuals who made those statements;   my understanding is that
        they object to the release of the statements.

        I shall be away from the office until 29 June;      perhaps we could
        speak upon my return.

        In any event I should be grateful if you could confirm that you will
        not release copies of the statements without giving reasonable
        notice of your intention to do so, in order that there is an
        opportunity for my clients to seek an order preventing this.

        Yours sincerely

                        RELEASE OF DOCUMENTATION




Following the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989 the West Midlands
Police were asked to investigate on behalf of the Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire. West Midlands Police took a considerable number of
statements, such statements obviously intended to be used for the
criminal inquiry, Lord Justice Taylor’s public inquiry and the inquest.

Members of the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYMAS)
who had been involved in the disaster made statements to a legal firm
instructed by SYMAS rather than to police officers.  These statements
were apparently handed over with the statement-maker giving SYMAS a
consent form for the use of the statement in Lord Justice Taylor’s
inquiry only.

Before, during and after the inquest relatives of many of the victims
wrote to the South Yorkshire Police asking for copies of statements from
policemen, ambulancemen or members of the public who had been involved
with their particular relative.   Typically these would be the statements
of police officers who first found the deceased and who perhaps
attempted resuscitation before transporting them to the gymnasium which
was used as a temporary mortuary.   In some instances SYMAS personnel
were involved because the deceased had been resuscitated by them and/or
rushed to hospital.

H M Coroner for South Yorkshire (West) at that time was Dr S L Popper, I
was only appointed upon his retirement in November 1991.

Following the report of Lord Justice Taylor Dr Popper decided to hold
 "mini inquests" on each of the deceased to assist the relatives in
finding out the circumstances of the individual deaths.   The Taylor
Report had of course only dealt with the disaster as a whole.   Bearing
in mind the scale of the paperwork Dr Popper apparently considered it
impracticable to call individual witnesses or deal with their statements
as documentary evidence. He decided therefore to deal with the basic
factual evidence (effectively the who/where/when set out in The
Coroner’s Rules but not the "how") by hearing from an individual
presenting officer in each case.   This officer was a West Midlands
police officer who had dealt with the identification enquiries and each
gave heresay evidence based on the statements of the various The
witnesses, witness statements might have been referred to by name and
in individual some instances short passages were read out but in the
main there appears to have been simply a summary of the facts contained
within those statements.

Following the inquest the South Yorkshire Police refused to release any
statements until all possibility of criminal or disciplinary proceedings
had been removed.  This has now of course happened and the request for
statements has been renewed.  The police have taken the view that they

will only release statements with the consent of the maker but in most
instances that has been forthcoming.   This office has been asked for
statements by a small number of the relatives but   no real dispute has
arisen because in each case all parties concerned have been quite happy
to see the documents released.

It should be emphasised that in many cases the relatives involved have
suffered for some three years or more without a detailed or precise
knowledge of the events surrounding the death.   In my view their wish to
have sight of the statements involved is perfectly understandable for
two reasons.  Firstly, there is a natural concern to know the
circumstances surrounding the death of a loved one and secondly a
certain degree of mistrust of the establishment in South Yorkshire has
arisen and relatives wish to be assured that the deceased had died
immediately and was not left unattended or improperly cared for to die
needlessly.

A problem now arises because Mrs Spearitt has asked for sight of four
statements relating to the death of her son, Adam. One statement is
from a serving South Yorkshire Police Officer who (almost uniquely) has
refused consent for his statement to be released.  This does not cause a
problem as far as I am concerned because this officer (again unusually)
gave evidence in person at the inquest and I do not believe it can be
suggested in any way that his statement would come within Rule 57.

The remaining three witnesses are SYMAS personnel and in each case they
do not consent to release of their statements.   The South Yorkshire
Police have therefore refused to give Mrs Spearittcopies of the
documents and she has written to me.

I am very tempted to release the statements to Mrs Spearitt on the basis
that whilst they may not in the strictest sense come within Rule 57, the
Hillsborough inquest was a very unusual situation necessitating
procedures being adopted to deal with situations envisaged by The
Coroner’s Rules. Had Adam Spearitt died in isolation there is no doubt
that either Mrs Spearitt would have heard the witnesses in person or
that their statements would have been dealt with in such a way that Rule
57 certainly did apply.  It seems to me therefore that it is unfair upon
Mrs Spearitt to deny her what would otherwise have been her right.

I have one caution on this point of view.  One of the SYMAS personnel
involved is a senior officer and the majority of his statement relates
to his dealings with the disaster as a whole.  This gives room for some
mischief and I do not lose sight of the fact that relatives of six of
the deceased (not including Mrs Spearitt) are seeking to have the
inquest re-opened.

I have been very open in my views on this to the Chief Executive at
SYMAS and our disagreement is perfectly amicable.  I invited SYMAS to
take legal advice which they have done and the reply from Messrs Dibb

Lupton & Co is at Annex C.

In short they resist the release of the statements but do not take the
argument very much further.  It is indicated that if I intend to release
the documents that an order may be sought to prevent me doing so. I am
most certainly prepared to give the Ambulance Service proper notice and
have written to them accordingly.

I would be grateful of your views as to the efficacy of releasing these
statements notwithstanding the objection of the statement maker.

Dear Sir,

Inquest Statements

I lost my beloved son Adam at Hillsborough.  I have attempted,
through my solicitor, to obtain all witness statements relating to
Adam's death and referred to in the West Midlands Police Summary
of Evidence at the inquest. My solicitor has recently informed me
that he has received a letter from Chief Superintendent Brian L.
Mole, South Yorkshire Police (Complaints and Discipline) stating
that the statements cannot be released. Firstly, I am astonished
that requests for witness statements are being vetted by the
Complaints and Discipline Department of South Yorkshire Police.
More importantly, it seems bizarre in the extreme that one of the
parties responsible for the Hillsborough tragedy apparently has
the final say as to wheth©^ or not statemontc of thosa p«oole who
witnessed Adam's death can be released.

I understand that certain families have obtained relevant_witness
statements through your office. I therefore have a legitimate
expectation that the statements I have requested will also be
released. Having been denied a proper inquest in the truest sense
of the word I hope that you now see fit to release the relevant
documentation to me in accordance with the spirit of Rule 57.

Yours faithfully




E . Spearitt

   NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                    Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.
3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.
     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                    Cause of death
     care/self-neglect').

  b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
    infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
    of the following forms be adopted:
     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).

     C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
     induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.

  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
    complete the remainder of the form.

           Our Ref: Hills/Sol/4/SLP/JT                                             17th September 1990

o          Dear Sirs,

           Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


           If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
           of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
           on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
           due course.

           I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
           evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
           coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
           inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

           Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
           under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
           witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
           this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

           Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
           to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
           appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
           consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

           May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
           attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

           I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
           names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
           to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

           I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
                                                    will assume you have no names to
           submit.

           Yours faithfully,

Mrs. 33. Spearltt,




Dear Mrs. Spearitt,

Thank you for your letter of the 15th of March. The point
about mentioning the resumption of the Inquests is of course
that you will very soon have in your possession the information
that you requre regarding the alcohol. X am sorry that I have
not made that entirely clear to you.

I can only repeat that I am obviously very sorry that the
viewing arrangements at the Medico Legal Centre distressed you#

Yours sincerely,




S.L.Popper,

Mra. E. Spearitt,




Osar Mrs. Spearitt,

Thank you for your letter of the 28th of February. You will
no doubt have learned from your solicitors that 1 am proposing
to start resuming the Inquest into the deaths of various people,
including your son, who died at Hillsborough, starting about
idle 13th of April.

I am not yet in a position to tell you the date when your
particular Inquest will be heard.

I note what you say regarding the viewing arrangements at
the Medico Legal Centre and X am obviously sorry that this
caused you distress. X am not entirely dear why you were
tillable to put your arms sound your son, as you obviously
longed to do, when hie body was taken baok to Liverpool by
your undertakers and presumably was placed in their Chapel
of Best.

Yours sincerely.




S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

91.    We duly revised the drawing of the proposed scheme.                                           On
19th April                           1985 Mr Strange wrote            to Mr.      Chester enclosing

drawing No. 6705/3 (pages 113-115).                                   As will be seen from such
drawing              we              accurately      reflected    Mrs.              suggestion       for
numbers of turnstiles, and we included necessary alterations to
proposed walls and fences to ensure segregation and channelling

of supporters.


92.      On 20th April 1985 Mr Strange had a telephone conversation
with Mr. Chester who indicated that he was still not satisfied
that the number of proposed turnstiles was right.                                               He was
still having discussions with his colleagues at the Club (page

 116).


 93.     On                  25th           April    1985    there       was   another     telephone
 conversation between Mr grange and Mr. Chester (page 117).
 By then Mr. Chester had returned a copy of drawing No. 6705/3
 with    v   a   r   i   o   u   s    manuscript markings of his own.                   We cannot now

 find in our files that particular copy.                                          We believe that it
                                                                                            to revise
 will have been used by our draughtsman,
 the negative of drawing 6705/3 to produce drawing 6705/4 (it
 will be seen that the .ignature and date are identical in both
 drawing.).                             In all probability th. marked up copy received

 from        Mr.                 Cheater       was    then destroyed.               Mr- Chester
 suggested                           that    there    should     be   an   area    in   front   of    the
  turnstile,                         to be used by visiting supporters separate                      from
  those              areas             leading       to   th. turnstiles       to be used by home
  supporters.                          He wished to have gates enclosing this area.                       He
  also proposed four banks of three turnstiles together with a

                                                            - 39 -
gate which he suggested might be used to let spectators into

the ground at all ticket matches.                    It will be seen on Mr
Strange's      note    that    the   latter wrote      -disaster-    in   square
brackets      against     this     suggestion.          The   square   brackets
indicate that this was Mr Strange's reaction to that particular

suggestion.        I should also explain that as I am Chairman of the
firm and also Director in overall charge of work done on behalf
of the Club, Mr Strange's notes of telephone conversations are
all     placed    before me.       They have the dual         function both of
recording what had been discussed and incorporating, always in
square brackets, Mr Strange's comments/views where appropriate
in order that I shall be aware of these before he and I come to
have our         own discussions.          Inthe circumstances Mr         Strange
 did    not      indicate     to   Mr.   Chester his    personal    view of the
 proposal        that a gate should be           used to permit entry to the
 ground for all-ticket marches.               If anybody was to communicate

 those views,         then it was for me to do so.                 Moreover,   the
 moment was not appropriate because we were still working on our
 proposals.        Anyway we knew that once a scheme had been agreed
 in principle with the Club it would have to be submitted to the
 Working Party, a process which indeed we had already begun,
 I have indicated,            on 9th April       1985 by sending our drawing

 6705/2 to S. W. C. C.


  94.    Following th. conversation with Mr. Chester on 25th April
  1985 we sent to him new drawing No. 6705/4 on 26th April 1985
  (pages      118-119).        On 1st May 1985 Mr. Chester telephoned to
  ask tor our “guess-              of the likely cost of implementing th.

  sch.me in its th.n form (pag. 120).                  This was for th. purp

including that which failed and tho.e which deformed .lightly
on    15th April       1989,     met the requirement, of the 1986 Guide
(which a. X have indicated remain unaltered from tho.e of the

1976 Guide).


PERIMETER AND RADIAL FBHCB&
(a) Perimeter Fences
41.      The perimeter fence, were already in                        po.ition when the
firm     wa.first instructed             in 1978.         1 am not sure when they
were     erected,       but     it     was     probably    soon          after   th.   Ibrox

disaster.         Th. f.nces are at the east and west ends of the
ground only.           There are no perimeter fences in front of the
 north    or    south stand,           which have relatively low reinforced

 concrete walls.


 42.     By the provisions of paragraph 7.9.3                       of the 1976 Guide,
 because       spectators       could        lean   on   the    perimeter        f.nces,    w.

 deemed     th.m     to    be        crush    barriers    and       so    they   had   to   be
 strengthened.            The perimeter fence at th. front of the west
 terrace was a v.rtical wir. mesh fence about 2. 7 metres high.
 It was strengthened in 1979 both by the provision of bracing
 against the existing perimeter concrete wall and the anchoring
 of th. wall itself with inclined steel stays fixed to concrete
 block foundations.              This work was required and approved by the
  working      party      as    set    out in the list of matters                  requiring
                        June 1979 by S. Y. C. C. at paragraph G. 1
  attention prepared in June       j

     (page 45).



                                               - 16 -
43.    At    some       later     date    the    Club     arranged        for    cranked
extensions to be fitted onto the top of the perimeter fence
leaning towards           the spectators at an angle of 45                      with the
steel mesh cut so as to leave spikes sticking out of the top.
The firm was not asked to advise on this change and we were not
involved in its design or installation.                    I believe that it was
installed          at   the    request    of    the     Police,    but     I    have    no

documentary evidence of this.


 (b) Radial Pences
44.    By the early 1980's it was becoming a common practice to
try to separate visiting supporters and home supporter..                                The

Club were keen for such a .eparation and I believe that such
 view was shared fully by the Police.                      I wrote to S. Y. C. C. on
 2nd September 1981 (pages 69-70) to say that I had been asked
 by    the    Club to arrange            for the installation of two radial
 f.nces in the west terrace.                These two fences are marked 1 and
 2 on plan 8945/1A.              The relevant provisions in the 1976 Guide

 are found at paragraph 7. 6.


 45.    There were advantages perceived by th. Club in installing
 radial      fences.          It meant that they could have both home and
 visiting supporters in th. west terrace but that they could be
  segregated.           It would also assi.t th. Voile, in crowd control.
  As indicat.d in my l . t f r to S.Y.C.C. dated 2nd September 1981
  (page      69)    gates were proposed at th. rear of each fence to
  allow      access      for    policing       during    matches     as    well    a.    for
  maintenance.           I pointed out in the letter that the gates would
  be left open, but fastened back, to connect the areas during a

                                            - 17 -
gam. if adjacent area, were to be occupied by .upporter. of the
.am. team.         Approval for th. installation of the two radial
fence, wa. given by S. Y. C. C. in their letter of 14th September
1981 (page. 76-77).         The approval wa. .object to th. condition
(paragraph I.e. at pag. 76) that th. gate, at th. r.ar of th.

fences should be under Police control.


46.      The    installation    wort      wa.   carried      out   by   a    fir.   of
Contractor.,       Bl.ssvale,       in    October      and   November    1981.      In
place, th. crush barrier. pa..ed through the radial fence, and
                                                         about

              --- ----- between Hr Strange and Mr
 thi.,    a. recorded in the memorandum of 4th November 1981 (page
 79)       There wa.      further        discussion between them            about the

 relevant barrier, on 13th November 1981 (page «>•                          The Police
 wanted tho.e barrier, which pa...d through the radial fence,
 removed becau.e otherwi.e .pectator. might use them to climb
 over     the    radial   fence..         Neither th. Club,        nor Mr Strange
 wished th. barrier, to be removed because to do so might have
 affected .afety.         If the relevant barrier, had been removed, an
  uninterrupted        -channel-     would      have    been   created      along   the

  radial fence fro. th. top of th. t.rrace down to th. p.rim.ter

    47.     The next discussion between Mr Strange and M r ________ took
    place following the match on 17th November 1981 (page 82).                                 The
    Chief       Cone table        had ...n th.          barrier,     in po.ition           and wa.
    content       that       they    .hould remain because there                  had been      no
    problem,       at the match.              It wa.,       therefore,        agreed that the
    barrier, would remain in po.ition pawing through th. radial

    fences as they are today.


    48.     I    wrote       to     S. T. C. C.   on    14th December         1981    (page    83)
    updating them on progre..                     regarding the installation of the

    radial       fence,       and .ecurity gate..               S. T. C. C.   replied on 20th
    January 1982 (page. 84-85).                    That letter recorded doubt, .till
    being voiced by th. Police concerning th. crush barrier, which

    passed        through         the    radial     fences.         I    therefor,     wrote     to
     S.Y.C.C. on 26th January 1982 (pages 86-88) with my views as to
     why I felt that the relevant barriers                         should not be terminated

     short of th. radial fence.                        I pointed out th. aspect, of safety
     and s e g r e g a t i o n which were involved and felt that what had been
     done        was     a    -reasonable          compromise           between      the    various

     interests-.             These matters were discussed at a meeting of the
     working party held on 4th February 1982 (pages 89-91).                                  It was
     agreed at that meeting that it was preferable from a safety
     point of view to retain the crush barriers which passed through

     the radial fences.


      49.       Th. installation of               two further radial fences in th. west
      terrace       were      considered           in 1985.         These were       part of     th.
      reorganisation of the west terrace which I shall refer to in



                                                       - 19 -
.or* detail later in .y statement.                     For the .on.nt,     I shall

concentrate on the radial fences.


50.     I wrote to th* Club on 2nd April 1985 enclosing the fir.' s
drawing No 6705/2 which provided for one further radial fence
adjacent to one of the existing radial fences to create an
obvious       corridor of -no mans'          land-     (pages 107-108).       (This
further       fence is     numbered       3 on drawing So.        8945/1A).        The
drawing wa. forwarded to S.Y.C.C. on 9th April 1985 (pages 109-
110)     with        a request     that    th. working      party      consider    th.
proposals       at    an   .arly          dat.. A    copy   of   th.    drawing    was
 forward.d by th. Club to th. Polic.                 Th. Polic. response was        to
 suggest » c.ntral          f.nc. to divide th. middle s.ction of th.
 west t.rraca,        rath.r than to cr.at. th. -no .an. land-.                   This
 is r.cord.d in .y l.tt.r to th. Club of 19th April 1985 (pag.s
 113-115).        Th.r. wttr. various discussions b.tw..n Mr Strang,
 and    Mr Ch.st.r concerning the location of a further rad a

 f.nc. a. r.cord.d in th. ...oranda of 20th April 1985 and 25th

 April 1985 (pages          116-117).


  51.    S.Y.C.C.      provided     their comments in their letter of 2nd

 May     1985 (pages 123-125).             The Police suggestion of a radial
  f.nc. to ..parat. th. cntral ar.a of th. t.rrac. was acc.pt.d,
  but     a   diff.r.nt     location       for   th.    fourth   radial    f.nc.    was

fences.       Th« outcome of this meeting was recorded in my letter

of     17th    June      1985    to     the    Club     (pages       138-139).        Chief
Superintendent           Moseley      was     favourably       disposed      towards    the
creation of a -corridor- of -no mans' land- with a gate to the
pitch,      following the experience of his officers at the recent

match between the Club and Liverpool P. C.                          Th. corridor would
provide an easy access                for the Police to the pen. on either
side, via the gates at the rear of the radial fences.                                I wrote
to the Police on 25th June 1985 about these proposals (page
142).         Mr   Strange      then received a telephone                   call    from the
Police on 27th June 1985 (page 144) in which there was further
discussion         about the       radial      fences     necessary to create the
corridor -no mans' land- and also a central radial fence in the
west       terrace.        I    added       a manuscript       note    to Mr Strange's
 memorandum of the telephone call agreeing that a central fence
 should be installed for the time being, provided that it did
 not       make    the    packing       of    spectators       in     the    west    terrace

 "impossible".


 52.       Application         for planning          consent   was    made by a letter
 dated 5th July 1985               (pages 145-148).            Detailed drawings were
 submitted to S.Y.C.C.                on 25th July 1985 (pages 153-154).                  Th.
 relevant drawing, ar. numbered 6705/6 and 17.                               The proposal,
 were       agreed by S.Y.C.C.               in their letter of             30th July    1985

     (page.   155-156),        .ubject to the addition of extra gate..                         I
 wrote to S.Y.C.C. on l.t August 1985 (page. 157-158) to clarify
     th. po.ition regarding th. extra gate, becau.. I wa. unclear
     what SYCC required. Th.r. wa. a meeting of th. working Party at
     th.   ground on 7th Augu.t               1985    (pag..    160-162) which among.t
other matters discussed the extra gates.            The positions of the
extra gates were duly clarified and agreed and I confirmed the
position to the Club in my letter dated 15th August 1985 (pages
163-165).       The    two   extra   radial    fences    were   subsequently

installed that summer.



(c)     Gates
53.,    There are seven gates through the perimeter fenee of the
west Terraee.         These are shown on drawing 11424/2.           when the
firm was appointed Hos. 1,       2,   4 and 6 were certainly already in
place and have not been modified in the meantime other than by
th. addition of a quick release bolt so as to ensure that th.
gates could be opened quickly and easily in emergency even if
the gate is subjected to the same pressure as a crush barrier.
 (This    type of bolt is fitted to all gates in the perimeter

 fence at this ground).


 54.     We also believe that No. 5 is also an original gate (pre-
 1978) but when the access corridor was created by installing an
 additional radial fence in 1985, steps were added on the inside

 to provide easier access for the Police.


 55.     Th. origin of gate 7 is not known.             It is not recorded a.

 being in place in our drawings of the ground in 1978.                We have
 not been able to find in our file, any record of it being
 constructed under our control.           There is a possibility that it
  has    been th.r. sine. before w. became th. Club's consulting
  engineers,    but w. think it more likely that it was constructed
  on the Club's instructions sometime between 1980 and 1988.

know that it was in place in 1988, because when we ordered the
quick release bolts for the gates in 1988 (to which I refer in
paragraph 61) it was discovered that we had ordered one less

than was required.         An extra one had to be made.


56.     The gate number 3 was             constructed under our control in
1985.       Itwas specifically requested by the Police,                     and was
approved    by    the licensing authority before installation.                   It
was made tomatch gate No.               4, which was in the other half           of

the old central pen.

 58.    The width of gates in the perimeter fences had been the
 subject of discussion on various occasions between                         1978 and
 1985.      The Police and the fire service both have an interest
 in this matter.           From the Polic. point of view, they are most

 likely to       need th.      gates      to get onto th. terrace to quell
 unruly behaviour.             various senior officers have said over the
 years that the gates should not be too wide because that would
 make it easy for troublemakers to spill out onto the pitch if
 the Police open the gate to get into the terrace.                           The fire
  service are naturally mindful of th. possibility that th. gates
  may    have    to   b.   used     for       evacuation   of    the terrace   in an
                                              - 23 -
emergency.            Hence,   at Br.mall Lane ground where there i. a
.tand part of which ha. some timber in it. conduction,                                   th.
gate,     from    th. t.rrace        in front have been made wider than
normal, .o a. to a..i.t rapid .vacuation of .pectator. onto the

pitch.


59.     It should b. remembered that at all relevant time.,                              the
1976 Guide,           which contain, no recommendation a. to width of
gate,     in perimeter         fence.,   wa.     in fore.             The    1986 Guide
.ugge.t. at paragraph 215 that .uch gate, .hould b. a minimum
of 1100mm wid..              The size of th. gate, in th. perimeter fence
at Hillsborough wa. of cours. approv.d by th. Working Party.
A. indicat.d,          the Police in particular have .aid that they do

 not     want    gate,      which   ar. too wid.           because of       the    ri.k of
 .p.ctator. rushing onto the pitch at times when the gates may
 be opened by th. Polic. to gain acc... to th. t.rrace.                                   for
 crowd control purpo.e..                 All gate. hav. been di.cuwed with
 the     Police       and   Fire    Service    at    least    once a    year.             The
 Sheffield Wednesday Football club ha. alway. willingly provided
 what.ver gate, have been requeued by the licensing authority.
 W.      a.     th.     Club-,      engineer,       have    prepared        drawing,      and
 specification, to give what we under.tood wa. b.ing requested,
  and th.        drawings      have then been submitted to the licensing
  authority.            The drawing, hav. been considered by the working
  party,        including      Police    and    Fire       Service,    and        have    been
  approved.            Th. Club hav. then had th. gate. con.truct.d, and

  installed under our supervision.

60.     Aithough th* gate* *r. not marked, th.y are very obvious.
They cannot be operated fro- th. inside.              They are designed to
be under the control of the Police. Therefore, they can only be
operated from the pitch side.              Once the gate has been opened by

the Police its position is obvious.


61.     I personally had a concern about the ability to open the
gates with pressure of spectators against them (they originally
had simple bolts).            Of my own initiative in 1987 I designed a
■quick release           mechanism-.   The design can be seen from the
drawings prepared by Mr Strange in August 1987 (pages 190-191).
This     design was        forwarded to SCC on 19th August 1987        (page
 189).      They replied on 15th October 1987 suggesting that a
 prototype be manufactured and fitted to on. of the gates for
 testing purpos...          This was done and a meeting wa. held on 25th
 February 1988 with SCC and th. Polic. to see the prototype in
 operation.         The prototype was approved and installed in all
 gates     on th. perimeter fence.             We hav. r.c.ntly tested th.

 opening      of    gate    No.   3 with a test     load   applied to it   of
 6kN/metre.          It could be opened with the arm extended so as not

 to be in line with the gate when it suddenly opened.

Dear Sirs,

As requested by your U tte r dated 16th July, I have w ritten a confirmatory
l e t t e r to the Club regarding tha s te e l sheeting and n « - s l i p s ^ f a c e o f
the timber dec* to the South Stand u p p e r seated area (copy attached for
your information)■
I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval
have bean made by tha Club in respect of (i) re-organisation of fsnces
and turnstiles and alterations to toilet facilities at the rear of the
West Stand, Lappings Lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
Spion Kop Terrace.
The Officer Working Party considered and gave ifftwjl ^
rear of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in May but, other than
brief mentions by the Club or yourselves at routine
possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
of such proposals have been considered to date.
As on previous occasions, I am assuming that you will
detailed plans, specifications and caiculations for Safety of ^orts^ounds
Act approval (bearing in mind tha General Safety Certificate requirement
to oive the County Council at least 21 days notice of any proposed
alterations or extensions at the Ground) should
the proposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

(«)    Plan No. 6705/14A - so long u increased thickness is achieved
by steep slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped” arrangements
to give foothold, the proposals are sa tisfa c to ry but the possible need to
take measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attea*«u>8 to
climb over w ill have to be borne in mu&d;
(h)       Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences la s t year, the
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush b a rrie rs nuabered 5, 8 and 22) to
e ith e r have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or rad ia l b a rn e r(s ) to overcome
p o ssib le la te r a l crushing hazard when large crowds are present;
( i)   Plan No. 6705/17 - for both se cu rity access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;
( j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my le tte r of 2nd Hay,
1985, i t i s essen tial that a l l the new gates are fu lly supervised by
Stewards, who must be f i t , able and properly trained.

the way you suggest
(c) and (d)
       We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
walls. The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
vulnerable area and the vails are braced by the door fraae.
Studding is not at all suitable in tens of strength or
durability, and would probably invite vandal isa.
(e)    The refreshaent area is under the aost westerly
staircase up to the north west corner terrace. There will
be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.
(f)    The handrail is to be at a height of 12S0na (4*1")
above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
step.
Cg)    The stepping of the lace of the wall is achieved by 45*
chaafers which will not fora good footholds.
(h)    Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.
Ci)   As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.
(j)   Your eoaaent regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
taken care of by Mr. Chester.

       It will be auch easier for pour Working tarty to
appreciate irhat is intended when they see the works under
construction. There will also be an opportunity to see
the aetal decking of the South stand.

The Club pointed out th a t the new to i le t f a c i lit ie s would not be completely

Otar Dick,
      Many        for your note of 12 August enclosing the
copy of David Vaughan's note of the seating &•**        ^round
on 7 August.   A copy of my letter to David Vaughan was sent
to you     sans day so that our letters have crossed in the
post.
      You will see that X have taken up very strongly the
suggestion by I            that the workmanship in the brickwork
was poor     would lead to weakness. It is unfortunate that
David Vaughan did not record that X had complataly refuted
what
WAMIW            said.
                 v e««•  David
                         rnwmm» now racognisas
                                     —  ^      that this was a
mistake but ik putting the matter right by circulating a copy
of sy letter.
      Turning to the setters on the second page**
"It was agreed"
My comments on the points you have in mind ar* as follows •-
(b)     This refers to the existing gat# between the naw 2m wide
        gap formed by the radial fance which will be used for
        police access only.    You will notice from the wording
        of David* s minute that I persuaded tham that steps eould

be used.    I have interpreted   this as being *ro“
th* in* id* only which seana that we will not loee
any of your adv*rtislQ9 spac*. We have added th*
provision of aoa* timber *t*p* on th* in*id* to
th* work being carri*d by Gl**»on.

Th* other radial fence forsing th* wall viaitora
pen haa l*ft a length of terrace without a dir*ct
acc*aa on to th* pitch. Thar* la of cours* a gat*
at th* top of th* t*rrac* connecting into th* n*xt
p*n and w* had hoped that th* polic* would accept^
that aa an ad*quat* seana of exit in esorgsncy.
Bow*v*r at th* seeting th*y sad* th* point w r y
atrongly that if soseon* had to b* got out of th* p*n
which haa no gat* or if th*r* waa misbehaviour th*
polic* would only b* abl* to g*t in via th* neighbouring
pen, paaaing up th* t*rrac* through th* gate at th*
 back and then down again in the Isolated pen. They
 conaidered this unacceptable.   I think that thia
 particular ites can be paid for out of the contingency
 aus and auggeat that it be add*d to Glaeaon'a work.

 You will r*call that whan you and I went round with
 Superintendent John Freeman h* points out that th*
 advertising hoardings on the parapet of the aeating
 area of the Meat stand were sl^ly hook* over th*
 parapet wall and so®e of th* hooks had been bent.
 Me agreed that a fixing would b* provided. H* had
 apparently reported thi* to David Vaughan so th*
 sattar n t raised again. It ia clearly a good point
 becaua* any hooligane in th* »*at*d area could easily
 drop an advertising board on to people below.    I have
  in sind that th* hoarding* can be fixed by a runner
 of tisber and again subject to your approval, this
  can be carried out as part of the present works.
                          \ f>4-
(•)   This Is a vary minor matter which can be dealt with
      naxt year.

Cf)   You will probably know that the baaea of th* steel columns
      behind the Heat atand have bean queried year by year
      by              who haa requeated £hat exoavations be
      carried out to enaure hhat the ateel la not mating
           *

      below ground level*    By chance Gleeaona had exposed
      one of the columns and I was intereated to see that it haa
      not auffered badly.    However I have pointed out that the
      columna do notcarry any load.     They fora part of the
      previous structure and were chopped down to that level
      when the new concrete atand waa built for the World
      Cup.   They merely form a frame within which the brick
      wall ia built. There ia therefore no cauae for concern.
      At the next meeting in February I will try to get thia
      item deleted from the Hat.


      Quite a number of items have now been added at Police
requeat. in addition there la the coat of the new gas main
and also unexpected coata in connection with the electricity
supply to the new refreshment area in the North Heat corner.
I am asking John Strange to check on all th#a# items to see
whether they can be accommodated within th# contingency axsa
which we Included in Gleeaona contract. X^aa^n holiday but
John                        naxt week.

                      Your a alncerely.

       Dr. Eastwood reported th a t the sheeting of the enlarged Spioo Kop at
       the rear and side* would r e m it ia the stru c tu re being v irtu a lly
       sealed. In rep ly to queries -froa the County F ire Service, he eonfiraed
       th a t no storage would'be allowed under th e ' stru c tu re and that checks
       fo r any accumulations of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular b asis.

       (ii)   Climbing of the-Inner Steel Fraae
       As regards the p o ssib lity of unruly spectator* cliabing the inner steel
       fraae of the new s tru c tu re , Dr. Eastwood reported th a t the bottoa booa j
       member was now to be o n itte d . The re su lta n t height of ove£ 10 feet
       would aake i t very d if f ic u lt for spectators to cliab the structure.
       ( i i i ) Mew. Step and B arrier Layout
       Drawing No. 6648/56 was circulated and considered. This related to the
       new step and b a rrie r layout on the Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood reported
       in p a rtic u la r on the discussions which he had had with the Planning
       Authority as to the height of an in teta ed ia te or a low second r a il to
       the b a rrie rs where the drop to the gangway below could be over one aetre
       in places. Be sought the Officer Working P a rty 's views* and the a e rits
       of the options were considered.
                                                                                     •

       IT WAS AGREED th a t, in the view of the O fficer Working Party, the best
       option for a second r a i l in the areas described was a low toe r a il at
       a height of soae 200 m
B.    - F a c ilitie s fo r the Disabled
To i l lu s tr a t e th at the fig u res originally quoted to provide f a c ilitie s for the
disabled a t the foot of the Spion lop (nearest to the North Stand) were not
u n r e a lis tic , Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender figures
(opened on Monday) fo r the enlarged, roofed Spion lo p . Be s t i l l considered
th a t any such proposals would involve the loss of up to 1,000 of the extra
5,000 spectator places which would be provided by th* enlarged Spion Kop.
Other areas of the Stadiua had also been considered and in v estigated, but
none could provide as larg e a f l a t , easily accessible area as th a t in front of
th* North Stand, which had been successfully used fo r so long without any aajor
problems. Dp to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area. The only
major drawback he saw was th a t when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
could be blown onto the d isab led , despite the can tilev er roof of the North
Stand extending v ir tu a lly to the p itch . For th is reason, the Club were w illing
to roof an area fro a approximately the le tte r "0" on the re su lts board to the
end of the Stand (n earest to the Spion Kop) with a s u b s t a n t i a l r o o f . including
armoured glass where th ere a ig h t be a v is ib ility problem, provided th at this
was supported by .the O fficer Working Party.
W hilst accepting much of what Dr. Eastwood said, the O fficer Working Party
(and the Police rep rese n tativ es in particular) s t i l l p a s s e d some concern as
to whether making s«mi-peraan*nt f a c ilitie s for the disabled in fro n t of the
N orth Stand was the appropriate and correct thing to do.
Th* Building Authority confirmed th a t, a fte r fu rth er investigations,, i t was
considered th a t the disabled f a c ilitie s requirement* of the Building
R egulations 1985 did not appear to s tr ic tly apply to th* roofing of the
enlarged Spion Kop.

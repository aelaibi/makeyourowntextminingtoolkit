10-30 am - 11.00 am

11.00 am




As per the Operational Order,           I deployed my serial to a position adjacent to

the Police Ground Control           Box,    between the South and West Stands.               At this

point the ground was empty and all appeared to be in order.                        Radio tests were

in progress.




11.25 am




I noticed     approximately     12-15 people        on    the Spion K o p , indicating that         the

turnstiles        may be    open. The      remainder      of   the    ground    appeared    empty    of

supporters.        At this timemy serial was deployed via Ground Control to assist

in policing       the turnstiles      at Penistone Road North.                This was in response to

a   request        by Inspector Booth        who    had     insufficient       officers    to   cover

turnstiles      'L', 'M', and 'N'.      (Turnstiles        'O' were not in use, as these only

gave   access    to   the   North   Stand     and    this      area   being    allocated   solely    to

Liverpool supporters,        it was contrary to the principles of crowd segregation

to have    them queueing alongside Nottingham fans who were seeking entry onto

the Spion Kop).
During      the period of policing                these       turnstiles,       many a Liverpool          supporter

came   to    the      Penistone      Road       North    End    and     when    faced with      the   closure       of

turnstiles        'O', made enquiries             regarding access              to the North Stand.           These

supporters        came    in      very    small     groups,       but    at    regular       intervals.       In    my

opinion they had travelled by car.




Many supporters were in possession of cans which contained intoxicants.                                        They

comprised        mainly      of   Nottingham        supporters          (mostly      male,    but   females    were

included)        and in the 18 to 30 age group.                       I was suprised to find that some

were   not        aware    of     the     Control       of     Alcohol     at    Designated Sports          Ground

Legislation.           Numerous          cans    containing        intoxicants,         were    discarded      into

plastic bin liners kept by Police Officers at the turnstiles.




Other items confiscated or discarded, included a bulb horn and flag poles.




At 2.45 pm that afternoon, I arrested a 48 year old, Nottingham supporter for

the offence of 'attempting to enter a designated sports ground whilst drunk'.

He   was    in    a   very     drunken      state       and     required       the   physical support of           his

friends.         He was attempting to enter the Spion Kop via turnstile 'N'.




I escorted this man to the police                       room and noticed him holding out his                 ticket

to public view; before any action                       could be taken someone came from behind and

exchanged his ticket for a £10.00 note.




At   2.50    pm we       arrived     at    the    Police       room and myself and my prisoner were

photographed.          He was then placed in the holding room pending documentation.




At approximately 2.55 m he was subjected to documentation and then returned
to the holding room.




At approximately 3-00 pm I entered the gymnasium at Hillsborough to commence

the necessary paperwork relating to the arrest.                                   I was aware that two other

persons        had    been    arrested       by members         of my Serial        for similar offences at

that location.




At    approximately           3-05    pm   Chief    Inspector Sumner              entered       the    gymnasium         and

informed me that there was some trouble at the Lepping Lane end of the ground

and     that    he     re-deployed         the     rest    of    my   Serial       to    that     area.          He    also

requested other officers in the gym to go to the Leppings Lane end.




I immediately entered the perimeter track via the entrance between the Spion

Kop and North Stand and made my way along the perimeter track (in front of

the   North      Stand)       towards        the   Leppings      Lane      end.      The    game       was       still   in

progress        and    I     recall    the     crowd      roaring     in    response       to    a     near      miss    by

Liverpool at Spion Kop goal.                     I seem to recall Liverpoool winning a corner as

a result,       but I cannot be certain.                   As I neared the halfway line I saw some

supporters on the playing area in the penalty box at the Leppings Lane goal.

Some supporters were climbing over the perimeter security fence at this point

and may others were              congregating on the track.                   At this moment the players

had started to leave the field.                      The radio messages were totally incoherent.

In the absence of any other information, I believed that a pitch invasion was

about to occur,            but I had no idea for what reason.                           The crowd in the other

parts    of the ground were                very    orderly and the only              trouble          appeared        to be

behind the Leppings Lane goal.




On reaching the Leppings Lane end and standing on the track in front of the




                                                                                                             /
                                                           -5-


North Stand, I still could not see the cause of the trouble.                                    The only police

action which seemed obvious to me was to form an open cordon across the touch

line    from     the     North       West    corner      flag    towards     the   goal   mouth.         I ordered

officers to form this cordon to which they complied.




As    I neared        the goal mouth I saw that                   the emergency gate           in the perimeter

fencing        was    open     and    Police      officers        were    attempting      to    pull     Liverpool

supporters through and onto the track.                           (This gate was the one immediately to

the left of the goal, as viewed when facing the West Stand).




Some supporters were lying on the grass just off the playing area, some were

in tears, some were vomitting, whilst others just appeared shocked and dazed.

Shouts    and        screams    could       be   heard    from     the    supporters      in the   Central      pen

area.




I approached the perimeter fencing near to this emergency gate and on looking

into the crowd I saw a pile of people at the front of the crowd.                                         They were

lying     on    the     terracing       near      to     the     perimeter    wall     and     several    of   them

appeared to be dead.                  Bodies were lying at all angles,                 some were completely

buried by other bodies on the top of them.                               Most of those visible were blue

in the face and lips, eyes fixed and staring, their hands and arms were ivory

colour.        Traces        of vomit were visible around their noses and mouths.                              They

appeared inconsistent with life.




The    crowd     behind were          hysterical,        those     in direct       contact with        the bodies

were    still        under    crowd    pressure        from behind.         The only means         of relieving

pressure was          by assisting persons               to scale the fence or to squeeze                  through

the gate; both these means being hampered by the presence of dead bodies.
At this point I took possession of a loud hailer (I don't know who from) and

shouted       instructions        into the crowd for calm.                 I also pleaded for those at

the back to stop pushing.                 I was aware that other officers were attempting to

remove part of the perimeter fence behind the goal.




After    a     short    while     the    pressure     had eased       in   the    crowd    enabling      several

police officers to enter the terracing to untangle the bodies.                                    I instructed

numerous officers to enter this area and be observant for any persons in the

pile who may still be alive and to give them priority.




I was joined by Chief Superintendent Nesbit and Superintendent Greenwood (to

whom I handed          the   loud      hailer).      I then assisted         at    the    emergency gate by

causing the other officers present to form a tunnel                               thereby endeavouring to

keep    the    exit     clear     of    persons      and   to   facilitate        the    passage    of    bodies

through the gate.            A human       chain had developed whereby bodies were handled

onto the playing area.




St   Johns Ambulance         officers       were     attempting       to   revive     the bodies,        as were

many    other    persons     including        fans    and Police       Officers.         Many were       clearly

dead and needed to be moved from view.                          I asked some supporters to collect

advertising       boards     for    use    as stretchers.          The     radio was      faint    amidst    the

noise    in    the     ground.      I could only presume              the gymnasium        to be used       as a

temporary mortuary,          so I therefore instructed supporters and Police Officers

to form stretcher teams and take bodies in that direction.




I was aware       that an Ambulance had stopped behind the Leppings Lane goal and

that    dead    and     injured     persons    were    lying     in   that    area.       I instructed one




                                                                                               7
                                                      -7-


willing      supporter      to    unhook      the   goal     net,    as    it   was    obstructing   rescue

operations.




I did not hear messages passed by radio or via the PA System and the crowd on

the Spion Kop could not as a whole, have been fully aware of the situation at

the opposite       end of     the ground.           Those being stretchered out who were dead

were    covered    by coats       and carried on advert boards which for ease of carry

were held by up to some 12 to 14 people.




It   was    not   unreasonable         for   the    Nottingham       supporters       to   be unaware    that

people were dead.         The long wait caused some of the Nottingham supporters on

the Spion Kop to jeer and chant.                    Liverpool supporters on the pitch, some of

whom were      in grief at the loss of friends and relations,                          reacted angrily to

this and some ran towards the Spion Lop with arms raised and fists clenched.

Some    seeing     others        running,      simply       joined    in    the       advance,   which   was

immedately dispersed             by Police Officers.            As    a result a cordon was formed

across the centre line of the pitch.




The dead and injured were slowly being cleared from the pitch but the terrace

was now clear, save for those uninjured.                      Shoes, coats, keys and money lying

on the terrace was guarded by other Liverpool fans, most of whom were still

hysterical.        From   the     outset      of the rescue operation,                these   fans had been

blaming police for the disaster and comments such as "MURDERING BASTARDS" and

"WHY DID YOU OPEN THOSE BLOODY GATES" and "IT'S YOUR FAULT" could be heard.




Emotions were extremely high and in the eyes of some supporters,                                 the police

were clearly to blame.              One supporter was so angered by the police that with

tears      streaming   down      his   face    he    took    hold    of my      shoulders     in a violent




                                                                                                 7

manner and called me the chief of killers.                   His colleague restrained him.           I

did not witness any other attack on police.                    Many fans vented anger at the

press who they said had done nothing to 'help' but had just taken photographs

of the dying.        Any person in possession of a camera was an immediate target.




Several members        of the Hillsborough catering            staff had come onto the field

and were        distributing    cups    of water to rescuers and supporters.            They were

greeted     with abuse      by some fans who made           reference   to the fact     that water

would not restore life in their friends.




There     was     outrage     and    a scuffle   on   the   Leppings    Lane terrace,   when   one

Liverpool fan tried to collect money from the property behind the injured or

dead.




At     various     points    during the    rescue,      I   had   attempted to   contact    ground

control via radio, but the radio traffic was such that I was unsuccessful in

making    contact.      In     the     early   stages   I   had   attempted to   contact   control

asking for         the evacuation procedure to be adopted at the rear of the central

pen.     I was unable to hear any response to my call.




Eventually the announcement was given that the match was to be abandoned and

the crowd was asked to remain in situ for a few minutes.                     The crowd, however,

began to leave.         I took my Serial to the Leppings Lane gates on the outside

of the ground until the terraces inside were empty.                     I then ordered my serial

to perform mobile           patrol on    the routes     leading from      the ground and joined

them in this duty.          Radio contact had been re-established.




At approximately 6 .30 pm we were directed                  to the Northern General Hospital
where a disturbance        was   in progress   involving Liverpool       supporters.      On my

arrival I ascertained         from some of the fans that the press had been intruding

upon those     in grief.      The press had been asked to remain in           a holding area

and were under the directions of the Health Authority, Press Officer.                       Some

had   become     over   enthusiastic    and   had   taken matters    into    their own hands.

All parties including         the Press Officer were advised.




At    7-15   pro roy Serial   gave   assistance     to   'Dl' Sub-Division    but   no   serious

incidents occurred.




At 8-30 pm Serial 21 went off duty, being no longer required by Force Control

and Ground Operation

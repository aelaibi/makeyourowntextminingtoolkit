            I am a qualified d oc to r, my qualifications are MSChB.                    I qualified in

            July 1983 at Sheffield.

           At the present time I am working at the Jessop Hospital                      for women in

           Sheffield and have been since the 1st September this year                         (1989).

            Prior to that I had been working at the Northern General Hospital.On

            Saturday 15th April     1989 (150489),    i was working on the gynaecology

            department at the NGH.       This department is situated just

            across the courtyard to the entrance to the casualty (A&E).                         I

            remember that     I was dealing with a pat i ent when I heard a lot of

            police/ambulance sirens I became aware that something was happening in

            casualty so once     I had finished with my patient        I made my way across

            to casualty I c a n ’t be sure about the time but I think it was

            around 3.30 (15300/4 pm (1600).
                                                                               PAGE    2
                                                                               S3425

  As I walked through the ambulance entrance a man was brought            in on a

  tr o11ey I presume by an ambulanceman and the person with the patient

  stated that they had attempted to resuscitate the man I made

  examination of the patient and as a result         certified him d e a d .    The

  man had fixed dilated pupils,     he was cyanosed,.      There were no pulses

  palpable and no heart sounds or breath sounds on auscultation of the

  chest.

  The man with                       where he should take him and Mr Jim

  j_________                        he ent ranee/r e ce pt ion area directed that

  he be taken to the orthopaedic     plaster room.      I had no further

  dealings with this patient.

                           is a white m a l e, aged approximately forty to

                            uite heavily built.      I recall that he had an

-j/ airway inserted in his mouth and I believe he had a beard.           To the

  best of my recollection he was wearing the following           clothing an

  anorak, a jumper , a t shirt and a vest.         I ca n’t describe the clothing

  any better than that.

  I was then instructed by Mr WARDRGPE to go to the dirty theatre to see

  if I could assist there.      Upon arrival   I saw three or four patients on

  trolleys.     They all appeared                                                 a

                                               \
  patient a man who I now know is Anthony BLftND■         There was some one

  with the patient but I      could n’t tell you who he was.      I made an

  initial assessment and      saw thatthe patient was unconscious but

  breathing spontaneously.      There was a casualty card relating to the

  patient,     by his side and I saw that someone had recorded his blood

  pressure and pulse as       'normal.3 I then examined him from head to foot.

  I asked the person who      was with him exactly what had happened but he

  was unable to assist apart from saying that the patient had come from

  Hillsborough and he thought that a stand had collapsed.            At that stage

  there was no mention of crush injuries.
                                                                                        PAGE    3
                                                                                        S3425

         I treated the patient and then sent him for x ray.                I reviewed the k

         ray -films and then transferred the patient to ward 60.               The treatment

         given to this     patient along with my observations were recorded on the

         casualty record and I can produce this if necessary.

         I then dealt with a number of other patients from Hillsborough and to

         the best of my knowledge none of these people died.                I finished in

         casualty at approximately 6.30 pm (1830) and returned to my own

         department.      Today,    Thursday 21st September      1989 (210989),   I was shown

         a photograph print number 92 (Ref               ) (Exh No           ) by WPS

         APPLETON of the West Midlands Police and although I cannot say for

         definate that he is the man I certified dead he looks similar.

         I recall seeing the following medical staff             in   &   E on the afternoon

            and have been a life long L iverpool Football Team Fan

             However due to the travelling distance involved from                               to Liverpool

             this is only the second match I have ever attended.                           Even if they

             played a local match I still w o u l d n ’t go in fear of any possible

             Myself my brother                 and                         planned to go to HILLSBOROUGH

             to see Liverpool Play, when they got through the quarter finals.

             I have some family in Liverpool my father orginally came from

             Liverpool, and my cousin there was going to get us some tickets for

             the match.

             However my cousin coul dn’t get us any tickets for the match.                            So in

the morning of the match Saturday 15th April           1989 at about 5 o * clock

in the morning the three of us me          and           set off towards

Sheffield in         car.

We planned to arrive at Sheffield early and to see if anyone wanted to

•sell their tickets to us.

We arrived at Sheffield at about 9.30am,         and       parked his car on a

road on a small Industrial Estate just off Penistone Road N o r t h .         On

our way to Sheffield we had experienced no difficulty in the

movement of the traffic,     mainly due to us been so early on our arrival

to the ground.     On route to the Ground we stopped on a Service

Station on the M1 and purchased some soft drinks.

After we had parked up we walked around the ground looking for someone

to sell us some tickets.

I have been shown a diagram of Hillsborough and from that diagram I

can say I was approached by a person selling tickets outside the

turnstiles to the Nottingham Forest side area of the ground.

Initially the first man who came to us and asked us if we "wanted to

buy any tickets'1 he wanted thirty five pounds each for a ticket for

the Liverpool side of the ground,      he was offering tickets for both

sides of the ground.

This man who had a Liverpool acc e nt, was d ressed in expensive casual

w^a r , and appeared to me to be one of a gang of five in all^walking

along PENISTONE Road selling tickets..

The price was too much for us so we refused and walked on looking for

a cheaper one.     As we were walking along we were approached by a

different man still from the same gang of five and he offered us some

tickets for the ground at twenty five pounds each.

This man was just over five foot t a l l , scruffy in appearance,, around

30 years old, shoulder      length greasy black hair a n d appeared to be

growing a beard,    he had a very strong Liverpool accent.
                                                                       PAGE
                                                                       51946

He offered us some tickets for the Nottingham Forest side of the

ground at twenty pounds each,    even though he knew we were Liverpool

fans.     We paid him seventy five pounds and had three Liverpool      side

tickets off him at twenty five pounds each.

He gave us three tickets from a brown envelope,    and I would estimate

he had about another two hundred tickets    in this envelope.       I ’m not

sure whether they were all Liverpool tickets,    or if he had another

ticket envelope for Nottingham Forest tickets.

When we had arrived in Sheffield and parked up there was Police

presence on the streets but obviously this was in small numbers

because we were so early.

There were very few other supporters outside the ground at this time

and they were all behaving properly infact we stopped and talked to

some to pass the time.

We arrived at the entrance to the ground at about    11 3 0 a m .   There was

a lot of Police presence outside the gates to the entrance to the

ground at this time.
                                 \\y
There were no queues at the turnstiles/simply because we had arrived

so early and there weren't many other supporters about at this time,

and therefore no need for any queues.

We entered one of the turnstiles shown on map as A-G however I d o n ’t

know exactly which one.     We gave our tickets to the stewards at the

turnstiles he tore his part of the ticket off and gave us our parts to

retain.

Once we walked through the turnstile I saw about four Police Officers

one of them stopped me and searched me, and the other searched



When we went past them I saw about five stewards they directed us

towards the tunnel    I had no difficulty in finding my entry point to

the ground.
                                                                                PAGE         4
                                                                                SI 946
When we were entering the ground through the turnstiles               I didn't see

any unauthorised entry to the ground been made,           o o y k n y gates open.
                                       \   u
We then walked along the tunnel to the ter races/and as stated earlier

due to the time we had no problem walking along the tunnel.

There was no Police presence inside the tunnel,           simply because it

wasn't needed at that time,      but on entering the terraces I could see

that there were Police Officers scatered ground the terraces.

At this time we just walked around Pe.n        A   on the Map and looked for the

best viewing point.     At this time there were about         10 other supporters

scattered around pen 4, they were all behaving themselves.

At about 2 pm w e decided that we would stand on point 1 on grid on

questionnaire,   because this gave us the best view point to the match.

It was about ten foot away from the tunnel just to the left of th e

fence.

From the time we had entered the ground to the time we found this view

point I saw numerous fans climbing over the fence at the rear of the

standing area marked 6 and 7 on the map near to the CC TV Unit.                     I

would think I in all saw about twenty people doing this.

Apart from this there w a s n ’t really any other unusual things

happening,   apart from the fact that as more and more fans coming

through the tunnel there was a lot off pushing going on.                 As a result

of this pushing I was at times been pushed five feet forwards,                  and

therefore further away from the tunnel and my initial viewing point.

This   pushing started just after two o'clock,         I h a d n ’t seen anybody

drunk inside the ground,     but I could smell alcohol,          the smell was

quite strong and as more people entered the terraces              it got s t r o n g e r .

At about 2.45 pm we had been pushed half way down the stand, at it was

at this time I was standing there talking to               and           waiting for

the players to come on when there was this big c r u . s i \ . / ^

The crush felt as though somebody pushes a person in front                  ofthem and
                                                                         PAGE         5
                                                                         S 1946

they in return push the person in front of them.          This wave

effect went on from the right at the back of the stand to the front of

the stand.

During this wave everybody in the stand <Pen 4) were been crushed

together and then pushed forward.      During the crush I initially had

dif f i cul ty in keeping rny feet on the ground,    because it was so sudden.

When the crush started I saw that I was been pushed down the Pen a long

with other people standing by me.       I could see that we were heading

towards a set of two crash barriers, which appeared to me to be level

with each other, and having a gap the same length as the barriers
                                                                                          !
between them.

I was trying to miss these two barriers and was aiming to go through

the gap in between them.     H o w e v e r a n d m a n a g e d   to go through

this gap but because my movement was controlled by people around me,              I

was pushed towards the barrier.

I ended up been    forced against a barrier.        This barrier was the very

last barrier dos^n the Pen, and was the second barrier in from t he

.dividing fence/between Pens 3 and 4.

On coming    into contact with the barrier I was immediately by the force

of the crush bent forward over the barrier.

My thighs and hips came directly into contact with the barrier and I

could feel the pressure been exerted upon them and it was at this time

that I honestly    thought I was going todie, my feet were raised

from the ground    about two inches.

I couldn't straighten myself because of all the pressure been exerted

from behind me.    Everyone near to me was pushed against this ba r ri er ,

and were stuck between the barrier and the people behind us.During the

initial   pushing and shoving I was pushed down the ground,         towards the

middle of the length down the Pen,      from the Tunnel to the

fence leading onto the pitch.

During this pushing    I was moving diagonally down the ground further

away from the dividing fence.

It was a this time that I saw an elderfe/lv man was about five foot four

inches tall h e was very thin grey ginger h a i r .   He was wearing a light

coloured casual jacket and was wearing some light brown trouser which

must have come from a suit because they were very smart in appearance.

I have since seen a photograph of this man in the papers on tme write
        -------------------------            r Q u c h k l ’o
up about Hillsborough and know him to be John Anderson(/b2 y/ars of

a g e , and also to have died during the crush.

This man was standing a couple of people away from me, and stood there

for at least twenty minutes.

When the big crush came I could see that this man was been pushed down

the pen with me, and because of the movement of the ctj*fsh he was

moving down the pen diagonally away from the middle fence towards me.

When I was eventually pushed against the barrier this man who was next

to me on my right side was also pushed again^A the bar ri er .




The barrier    caught him at the bottom of his ribs and in the middle of

his stomach.    I saw his coinplext ion change, and he went really white

and then started to change to blue.



                                                      I don't know if is

feet were still on the floor.

He w a s n ’t bent over as much as me, and in fact I kept on looking up at

him, he appeared to me at this time to have coffipletly have gone.

His eyes were wide open, and appeared to me to be staring forward.

His face appeared to be under immence pressure.

    Through the immense pressure been exerted upon us, he was turned

    completely turned anticlockwise whilst he was upright and ended up

    facing the crowd with his back now forced against the crowd.

    When we had been initially pushed against this barrier,        I remember

    looking over at this m a n who appeared to be dead,     I saw that he was

M   wearing a big round faced watch with gold hands on/it and appeared to

    have a gold bracelet.   He was wearing    it on hi s / left wrist.

    I could see the time on this watch on Just qq / b ten to th<e_e _and from

    that   I would estimate that the crush begaq /t quarter to three.

    When he had been turned around with his back against the barrier         I

    would say he stayed in that position for about three minutes,

                                             and on this he went over the

    barrier backwar

    On going over the barrier he   d i d n ’t fall onto the floor but what was

    pushed over peoples heads to   the front fence of pen 4 and then o v er

    the fence onto the pitch.

    At this time I also heard other noises of bones breaking I could hear

    crying out for help, and this was usually accompanied by the noise of

    bones breaking.

    I think the only reason why I d i d n ’t die in impact with this barrier

    was because I bore most of the pressure of my thighs and this old man

    bore most of the pressure on   his stomach.

    When the old man had been pushed forward over      peoples/heads I saw

    about five other bodies been pushed over by ev eryon^ towards the front,

    About three of these definitely appeared to be         td, there faces were

                                                                         S194&

blue and their bodies and arms and legs appeared to be eompletly

lifeless.                                        ,

Two of the five passed over were girls ?<~'*they didn't to me appear to be

dead in fact appeared to have fainted.

I on remembering back to the start of the crush can recall that when

everyone went forward people at the front started shouting "Get back

Get back" but we couldn't.

I also remember that when the old man came into collision with the

barrier,     someone started shouting "A DEAD MAN" or this "MANS DEAD".

After about twenty minutes after the crush had began,        the crush

started to ease off a n d m a n a g e d   to push me up, and once I was

straightened up I went under the barrier to get away from it before

another crush might occur.

As I was going under the barrier another       crush took plcfrte, and my arm

got caught between the barrier and the person who X o d k my place behind

the barrier.

       managed to free my arm and then helped me stand up because I had

difficulty instanding up because I hadn't stood on my legs when I was

over the barrier.

When the crush occured and I was bent over the barrier with this old

man I can remember looking down the Pen and see/n a teenager about 15

years of age trying to climb over the fence ^        the front of Pen 4 onto_

the P i t c h .

A Police Officer the other s i d / of the fence pushed this youth back

into the crowd.      The Police j/fficer was shouting "Calm Down Calm D o w n ”

and telling them not to panic.       I honestly do not think he realised at

this time the serious nature of what was happening.

Eventually when the Police realised what was happening they were

standing on the fences helping people over the fence into safety onto

the Pitch.

I remember seen a gate been opened at the front of the Pens I can't

remember        if it was in Pen 3 or 4.

When I was standing up with                      fter the crush I looked over into

Pen 3 and saw that it was mo re c rowded in the re than Fen 4.                I could

see fans at the front of Pen 3 climbing over the J P en ce            leading onto

the jiitch.

I saw on the pitch un i f o r m e / Police Officers performing mouth to mouth.

and chest compressions

I saw the fence at. thg/ front of Pen 4 leading onto the pitch had by no

Qome down.           I didn't see actually how it came down.

At this time because the crowd had begun to ease off I saw about two

dead bodies lying in the P e n .           These two bodies were lying close to

each other about ten feet down from the back wall of the terrace and

about ten feet away from the middle dividing fence.                 They were facing

do w n w a r d s .   I can't describe them apart from the fact that they

appeared to be males.

By now the three of us, me                 and        and got back together,   and

people were drifting away from              the Pen towards the tun ne1, we

followed.            It was about quarter past four by now.

The tu n n e 1 was really dark compared to the terraces and walking back

through it we were having to walk over things mainly property shoes,

bags etc,        but not bodies.

On leaving the tunnel           I saw that a lot of people we having mouth to

mouth and chest compressions done by the Police and the ambulance

p e op le .

By now I was in agony,           I had a    lot of pain around my waist line     where

I had been crushed I couldn't walk                properly or straighten. We went

through a set of big blue gates.

I saw that the Police had made a cordon around the inured and de^d

b o d i e s , I went     into this cordon and sat with the people there.

         I didn't see the match at all,      I didn't even see the players been

         announced or coming onto the pitch.      All   I can remember   is that at the

         beginning    it was like fresh air but towards the kick off,     the pen

         started to smell    like the insides of a pub and I could taste the smell

         of the alcohol    in the atmosphere.

    Dear Madam

    OUR CLIENT :BERN
                                                                                                                                                                       1 1
    We act on behalf of Mr Bernard Murray. He has received a summons dated 26 June
    1998 which required him to appear in Bootle Magistrates’ Court on 17 July 1998.
    There are three matters alleged against him. They are the same three matters numbers
    one to three on the summons against David Duckenfield which we know has been
    provided to you by a letter from Winkworth and Pemberton of 1 July 1998.

    This firm acted on behalf of Mr Bernard Murray at the Coroner’s Inquest. However,
    we were not instructed in relation to the scrutiny carried out by Lord Justice Stuart
    Smith. As such we came into this case literally within the last few days.

    We have been provided with a copy of the letter of 1 July 1998 from Winkworth and
    Pemberton to you and we would say at this stage that we fully associate ourselves
    with the matters set out therein. We would anticipate that we will very quickly be
    setting out our own representations at length.

    Yours faithfully

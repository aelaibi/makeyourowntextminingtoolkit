Abt)u| 1515 hours we were able to                              consider        resuming           from this      location

dyt to the          st re et now being                 clear of supporters.

Inspector T o w n e n d then              informed us that                   the     radio was         containing

me ss ag es     of an incident                inside      the    g ro un d     requiring an a m bu la nc e to

be    broughtytfnto the                pitch.         We were         then    informed by PC Goss                that all

availabljp'staff              had to      proceed to the                ground.

Our    sarial       then      p roceeded          to the       g ro u nd entering              via the    large    gates

a d j acent     to t u r ns t il e s 77 to 88.                  It was        there        that    I saw an

^fibulanee,         parked        in the       corner      close        to the S pion Kop,               I saw that

two    persons were              d e po si te d       beside    them at this               location who had their

faces      covered and were               ob vi ou sl y        dead.

We    received          i ns tr uc t io n s    from      Inspector T o w n e n d to go                 into the

walkway        besides        this      location and a tt e mp t               to prevent Forest                fans

seeing       the d e c ea s ed         persons.

I was      then a p p r o a c h e d      by two Forest                fans with a medical                b ac kg ro un d

who    offered          their     a s s i s t a n c e , I then         liaised wit h PS S he rr at t              who

went     for    further          information.             PS S h e r ra t t         returned almost

im me di at el y and          s h ou te d for all          of our        serial        and any med ic s          to come

N o rt h S ta nd and          the Kop stand.

It was at this              time       that    1' saw     large itiumbers of L iv erpool                    fans and

the    e m er ge nc y      s er vices     carrying         from the           pitch        persons who were

either      dead or badly               injured-          They were           being        carried out

a dv e rt i s e m e n t   h oa rd in g    boards.

being         brought                   t h r o ug h    it who were    requiring         assistance. This     cordon

remained                        in p os ition until an a n n o u n c e m e n t .was made            that    the gam© was

to be abandoned.

W it h       Inspector T o w n e n d we then                       left the gr ou nd and            returned to

Clayhwheels                         Lane and there we v i si te d each bus and                      informed the

driv e r s                 of the e m e r g e n c y t elephone           number.

L i v er p o o l                 fans    returning        to this     location were           on the whole        very

s ub du e d but a number                           of    them were      venting         their anger      towards    the

police            officers                 present       with me.

Gradually                        the    buses     began to d is perse           and we     continued to get

en quiries                       from w o r r i e d     supporters.        We gave        them the e me r ge n cy number

a nd     indicated                      them to the           location of nearby telephones.

E v e n t u a l l y we                  were     left with        appros;imate 1y four           buses at this

location                        so we    returned        to C la yw h ee l s    Police     garage   for s t an db y duties.

I took no further                             part      in this    incident.

On Saturday 15th April 1989, I was on duty in company
w ith o th er o f f ice rs ,in vo lve d in duties at the F.A.Semi final
football     ma tch at the Hi llsborough football stadium, between
Liverpool F.C. & Not tin gh am Forest F C .                             *"
1 was part of serial 34, under the supervision of PS 2248
SHERRATT•
At 10am, we all at tended a briefing in the grounds North stand
area.                                                          '
At H a m serials 34 &35 were briefed by our commander InspectorT
TOWNEND.

At 1 1 . 1 5 a m we all took up our positions on Claywheels Lane,l
was a llo c a t e d the duty of recording the details of all the
buses wh i c h were parking in this location.
Each bus that arrived was met by officers in our two serials
they we r e di re cte d to drive to the end of this particular
road and there turn around and return         to parek alongside
our serials.
An o f f i c e r from our serial greeted each coach and they were
all di re c t e d to wards the football stadium.

These buses c o nt ain ed a wide cross section inages of Liverpool
su pp orters and I can state that from this section of supporters
whilst they w ere in this location they appeared to be well
behaved and in good spirits.
At 1 345 hr s C l a y w h e e l s lane was completely full of supporters
buses, I re corded a total of 52 buses and 2 min i buses at this
location.

At 1 4. 25hrs we w er e further deployed to the junction of
Claywheels lane wi t h Penistone Road north.
We posi ti one d out si de a public house named the GATE, and our
duties w ere d e f i n e d as supervising the arriving fans who were
walking down H a l i f a x Road towards us.
We were ins tru ct ed to form a filter lane of officers and to
infrom the s upp orters that all alcoholic drinks wo uld be left
at this location                                        *
From this p osi t i o n you can see a good distance up this Halifax
Road and as far as the eye could see I saw that there was
a continous flow of Liverpool supporters in groups approx.
10 a breast on both sides of the carriageway..
The majority of these were males in the lower age bracket,
it was very ap par ent 't o me that a large amount of alcohl
had been con s u m e d by the vast majority of these men.
Alarge n u m b e r r of them were still drinking on their way to
their way towards the ground and a large n u mbe r of them were
halted and aske d to leave thier intoxicants at this location.
Some of them left their drinks others insisted on consuming
them at this location.

 Gererally they w er e all of good b e h a v i o u r ,they w e r e dru nk
 but not incap abl e or disorderly.
 rom roe and the o the r officers taking up this pos i t i o n tne
 thing that b e c a m e roost appparent to roe other than t rheir
 drunken states was h o w late thousands of them had left xt
 to go to get into the ground.                                       .f 4 c a n t
 This heavy mas s of persons continued        without any sx gni xi c

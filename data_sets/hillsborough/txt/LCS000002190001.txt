                                     Thank you for your letter of June 9th regarding the proposed
Vice Chairman:
                                     evaluation of work done since the Hillsborough disaster.

                                     I have discussed this at length with Cruse's Chairman and at

                                     the meeting of the Disasters Working Party last Thursday.
* j i r Sigmund Sternberg            Regretfully I have to report that neither Cruse nor the
KCSG JP FSCA                         members of the Working Party feel able to offer to undertake
Director:
                                     the task proposed. The reason in both cases is the unavailability
Derek Nuttall                        of sufficient time on the part of those best qualified to
                                     assist with the evaluation. Several people with experience

                                     such evaluations are and whilst the importance and value of
Information Officer:
                                     doing it are recognised it is not going to be possible to
Wendy Wilson                         offer the kind of help as I originally thought.
                                     The Working Party and our Chairman and myself have however

                                     positive in the way of other suggestions.

                                     the possibility of enlisting some help from those sources. The
                                     two mentioned particularly were Kings Cross and Zeebrugge. The
                                     best person to contact for Kings Cross is Mr K Dixon, Director,

                                     The second suggestion is the possible employment of an individual
 Sir Paul Dean m p                   worker to head the evaluation. If this is something you feel

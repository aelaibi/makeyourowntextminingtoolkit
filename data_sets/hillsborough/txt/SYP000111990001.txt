               SATURDAY,           15 A P R I L     1989



               On     this    date      I was       not      on d u t y w i t h       the    Road Traffic                  contingent           but

               was        working     directly          with      ’F*    Division           from    the      football             ground.

                I came       on    d u t y at 0 7 . 3 0         reporting        to    the G y m n a s i u m a n d w a s               shown       on

               Chief        Superintendent                *F*    Division,        in     liaison with                    Inspector       Sewell

                *F*       Division,      who      was      co-ordinating              various       admin,               operations.

               My     duties       included         receiving           personnel           carriers/vans                  at    the    g r o u n d as

               the        various     serials        following           briefing,           organising                  stand-by       serials

               a n d meal         reliefs      etc.          It wa s     intended           that    I operate                  between       the

               football           ground      and    the        Road Traffic          Garage        at C l a y w h e e l s         L a ne .

               A     little       before      3.00      pm      I was    actually           supervising                  the    area    around

C o n t r o l ’ asked         for     either       2 or 3 s e r i a l s              to     be   deployed             from      the

gymnasium area                onto       the    ’track*           to a s s i s t       officers           there         and

immediately             a number          of    officers            left       the     gymnasium              in    response            —

although         I had a           pocket       radio        and was           monitoring              transmissions,                   this

message       had       not       been    directed           to     me    and    I h a d no            part        in d i r e c t i n g

those    officers,                although         I had       heard       the       request           acknowledged.

Shortly after                that     ’G r o u n d C o n t r o l ’ a s k e d           for all          available             serials

to a t t e n d     on       the    ’t r a c k ’ f r o m      the     g ym n as iu m and               t hat    was      acknowledged

and    indeed          every       available          serial         was       despatched.                I remained               in

control       of       the    area       outside         the      gymnasium and                  the    entrance             from

Penistone          Road       North       to    that      a r ea.

During       these          proceedings            I heard          various          transmissions                  on my       pocket

radio    which was                obviously         busy       but       I had       not     noticed           any      problems

with    the      radio.            One    sequence           of     transmissions                 which        I cannot            with

certainty          place          into    the      order       of    proceedings                 other        than      to    say       that

I believe          they       were       c l ose    to    the       time       t hat      all     available             serials             were

despatched             to    the     ’t r a c k ’ are a .           One    message           toldcontrol                  that      2 to 3

thousand         fans        had a pp e ar e d        outside            the    Leppings              Lane     turnstiles.                   A

further       message             then    said      t ha t     they were             (the        crowd)        trying         to    b r eak

down    the      large        gate       and    that      people          were       being        c r u s h e d at        the      front.

Someone       asked          for    p e r m i s s i on to         open     the       gate        to    relieve          the     pressure

and    I believe             that     this      was      reJPused J b ^ co n t r o l .                 Within         a short           space

of    time    there          was    a further            frantic          m§,||agie to            the     effect          that      peo p l e

were    being          killed       at    the      front       of    the       crush        outside           the      said

turnstiles             and    again       permission was                  asked        to    open        the       l a rge    gate.

There    was       a    pause       of    some      seconds          before          a message            came         back     f rom

ground       control          and     I believe           Sergeant             Goddard           was     the       voice      on    the

radio,       ’A u t h o r i t y     has     been given              to    open       the     gate,        open        the     gate*

I am    not      clear        on    the    sequence            of    events          following            this,         the     r adio           was

                           INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND
                             SHEFFIELD ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989



           GERALD SCARFE, INSPECTOR, BARNSLEY ROAD TRAFFIC SECTION.
                             TELE:                      WORK EXT 3257 VIA *B1'




           On this date I was not on duty with the Road Traffic contingent but
           was working directly with 'F' Division from the football ground


           I came on duty at 07*30 reporting to the Gymnasium and was shown on the
           Operational Order as Transportation Officer responsible to the Chief
           Superintendent, 'F' Division, in liaison with Inspector Sewell, 'F'
           Division, who was co-ordinating various admin operations.


           My duties included receiving personnel carriers/vans at the ground as
           they arrived from the various divisions, organizing parking for all of those
           vehicles including coaches, re-allocating vehicles to the various serials
           following briefing, organizing stand-by serials and meal reliefs etc etc.
           It was intended that I operate between the football ground and the "oad
           Traffic Garage at Claywheels Lane.


           I had carried out this duty the previous year and had been asked if I
           weis available to do it this year.


           A little before 3.00p.m. I was actually supervising the area around the
           mobile catering vehicle at the side of the gymnasium when 'Ground Control'
           asked for either 2 or 3 serials to be deplyoed from the gymnasium area
           onto the track' to assist officers there and immediately a number of
           officers left the gymnasium in response - although I had a pocket radio
           and was monitoring transmissions, this message had not been directed to
           me and I had no part in directing those officers, although I had heard the
           request acknowledged.


           Shortly after that 'Ground Control' asked for all available serials to
           attend on the 'track' from the gymnasium and that was acknowledged and
           indeed every available serial was despatched.    I remained in control of
           the area outside the gymnasium and the entrance from Penistone Road North
           to that area.
During these proceedings I heard various transmissions on ray pocket
radio which was obviously busy but I had not noticed any problems with
the radio.   One sequence of transmissions which I cannot with certainty
place into the order of proceedings other than to say that I believe they
were close to the time that all available serials were despatched to the
’track' area.    One message told control that 2 to 3 thousand fans had
appeared outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles.     A further message then
said that they were (the crowd) trying to break down the large gate and
that people were being crushed at the front.      Someone asked for permission
to open the gate to relieve the pressure and I believe that this was
refused by control*    Within a short space of time there was a further
frantic message to the effect that people were being killed at the front
of the crush outside the said turnstiles and again permission was asked
to open the large gate.    There was a pause of some seconds before a
message came back from ground control, and I believe Sergeant Goddard
was the voice on the radio, 'Authority has been given to open the gate,
open the gate.' (or words similar).


I am not clear on the sequence of events following this, the radio was
extremely busy, it was apparent that there was some sort of serious
disruption, someone asking for an ambulance, and the St John's Ambulance
travelling from the gymnasium area onto the ’track'.     At no time did I
see the playing area or the terraces but stayed within my area of
responsibility - the gymnasium yard/parking area.


Shortly, injured and dead people were being carried from the playing area
into the gymnasium yard area and I then realised just how serious the
situation was.    I started to direct persons carrying dead to one side to
separate them from the injured but living but within 'seconds' the area
was littered with bodies and injured people.     Someone then decided to
use the gymnasium for placing the bodies and I assisted in directing
'bearers' to the appropriate place.


Ambulances and other emergency vehicles started to arrive and so I
organized control of the entrance to the area so that ambulances could
leave as and when they were loaded and were not blocked in.     I also
organized police motorcycle escorts to the various hospitals as required,
arranged police personnel carriers to convey persons with less serious
injuries, eg. broken arms etc, to hospital, again under escort.
In this frantic period I assisted in moving bodies about in the gymnasium
yard but I could not identify which ones.    I also assisted in loading
critically injured people into ambulances.   Whislt carrying out these
tasks I sustained an accidental back injury/strain which is requiring
medical attention although it has not caused me to refrain from duty.


Prior to the incident the stewards in my area had been most co-operative
and I had not experienced any difficulty whatso ever with them.


I had seen football fans coming out of an 'off-licence' at the junction of
Penistone Road North and Vere Road with great amounts of drink and sitting
around on Penistone Road North drinking same.   I do not know which fans
they were but imagine that they would be Notts fans.


The remainder of my duty was taken up with receiving relatives, organizing
transport for them to said from Hammerton Road Police Station etc. etc.

were       dead          and    inured        lying            around         that         area         that    is     why    I had

originally                organised           the      area          inside         the      gymnasium          entrance           gate.           1

walked          down       to    Gate      "O’ and                 told     the      crew        that    they    would        better

using       the          other     entrance*                   I then         entered            Gate    *0*    and     went       to     an

Ambulance                Service       Range        Rover            whuTt^was              parked       against        the       ’K o p ’

wall.           I    told       the     officer           with        that        vehibif          what    I had        arranged           with

returned             to    the     other       gate.                I cannot           recall       what       other        vehicles,            if

any,       were          parked        inside        Gate           ’O'.

obstructing                the     entrance. . Eventually                              I had       an    orderly        queue

ND   OF   REPORT
                 INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND

                   SHEFFIELD, SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989



Gerald SCARFE, Inspector, Barnsley Road Traffic Section.
             Tele:                          WORK - Ext 3257 via 'Bl'



Further to my account of 28 April 1989:


At a time around 3.00p.m. emergency vehicles started to arrive
at the Penistone  Road North side of the football ground
and the first of   these were to the best of my recollection
Police vehicles.  In order to afford access to the urgently
needed ambulances I instructed that police vehicles be moved
from inside the entrance to the gymnasium yard.    I remember
that Sergeant 1636 Lightfoot, 'C' Road Traffic, arrived
in a Range Rover   and parked that on the central reservation
on Penistone Road North and he cameto me. There was a
large police van that had been used for carrying equipment
and 'no parking' cones before the match - this vehicle was
parked in the yard and I suggested to Sgt Lightfoot that
perhaps we could put 'the dead' into that out of sight and
away from the injured survivors and indeed we opened the
back of the vehicle to make sure that it was empty, but
by the time we had done that there appeared to be dozens
of dead and injured lying about the area close to the gymnasium
and so I had to abandon that idea.                 ^

Ambulances started to arrive and were directed/into the
yard area through the gymnasium entrance gate. I walked
out onto Penistone Road North to check that the road was
clear for other ambulances to arrive and I saw an ambulance
attempting to enter Gate 'O' and I realised that with all
the activity inside that gate the ambulance would have difficulty
- the were people carrying injured etc from the pitch up
into the area just inside Gate 'O' and there were dead and
injured lying around that area - that is why I had originally
organised the area inside the gymnasium entrance gate.
I walked down to Gate 'O' and told the crew that they would
better using the other entrance.  I then entered Gate'O'
and went to an Ambulance Service Range Rover which was parked
against the 'kop' wall.  I told the officer with that vehicle
what I had arranged with regards to the other gate for access
of his vehicles.  I then returned to the other gate.           HaaJA,
u > u r frftts                                         £***<. 'o*.
As ambulances started to arrive in numbers I had to organise
them into some sort of order - whilst some crews were tending
to the injured other ambulances were arriving and blocking
the first ambulances in, indeed on at least two occasions
crews had gone off with the ambulance ignition keys and
we were unable to get loaded ambulances out. Another ambulance
was left on Penistone Road North obstructing the entrance.
Eventually I had an orderly queue operating with ambulances
queing on Penistone Road North and in one side of the gate
leaving room for loaded ambulances and police vans to exit
on the other side of the gate.

Sgt Lightfoot had suggested that some 'walking wounded'
might be carried in police personnel carriers and we organised
that together with police motorcycle escorts to hospital.

I also instructed that Penistone Road North should be closed
at its junction with Leppings Lane/Herries Road to assist
emergency vehicles - a motorcyclist did this for me.

I also had the central reservation cleared of police vehicles
so that ambulances could also cross over onto opposite carriageways.



Everything possible was done to assist ambulances arriving
and departing from the early moments to well into the night,
but this had to be via the gymnasium entrance gate - there was
no way that they could have operated via Gate 'O', the area
instde was too restricted and congested.

              INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND

                 SHEFFIELD ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989



GERALD SCARFE, INSPECTOR, BARNSLEY ROAD TRAFFIC SECTION.

      TELE:                        WORK - EXT 3257 via »B1*



In relation to the F.A. Semi-final of Sunday 12 April 1987 between
Leeds United and Coventry City, I attended a briefing at 8.15a.m.
and then took up supervisory duties on Sector 13 ~ the 'triangle1
formed by Penistone Road North, Leppings Lane and Vere Road.

The operation on this day was the same as on. other first team games
in relation to that area in that the top and bottom of each road
leading between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North was closed off
using a number of barriers and these„were then manned by constables
and supervisory sergeants. The reason for the barriers was to prevent
football fans from using those particular side streets for parking
cars or passing from one end of the football ground to the other thus
reducing nuisance for the residents. The barriers were manned from
a time immediately after the 8.15a.m. briefing continually' through the
football match and until officers were stood down after dispersal of
the fans at the conclusion of the game.

The officers manning these barriers were not there to vet or check
fans moving towards the football ground but merely to prevent fains
causing nuisance to the residents of the side streets. The only
checking carried out was if a resident or bone fide person wishing
access to premises in a side street approached a barrier either with
a vehicle or on foot and the barriers would then be moved to allow them
in.

I do not remember there being at any time a police cordon with barriers
across Leppings Lane and to the best of my recollections traffic was
flowing up and down Leppings Lane throughout my period of duty in that
area. My responsibilities did not extend to the area immediately outside
the Leppings Lane turnstiles and so I cannot comment on procedures in
that area but only as far as the junction with Vere Road - some 3 0 - 4 0
yards from the turnstiles area.

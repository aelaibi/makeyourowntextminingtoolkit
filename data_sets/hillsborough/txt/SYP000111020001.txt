    Whilst         with       the C o m m u n i c a t i o n s           staff      at    the      caravan       I took         possession

    "of a M o t o r o l a          personal             radio,      tuned        to C h a n n e l       25.     Whilst         at    the

    caravan         I heard             radio m es sa ge s              from S up e ri nt e nd e nt            Marshall           asking

    for     a gate        to       be     opened.            My    recollection               is of      three       such      requests^

    increasing            in u r g e n c y .             Other      than     the        last      request       I heard           which        had

    a    reference            to     "get       someone           off    their      arse",          I cannot         re c a l l     the

    detail         of    h is      messages             or   the    response            to    them      from    other        officers.




    At     E .50    p.m.        I left          the      caravan and went                    to   the    ground        by    car.         As    I

    made     the        journey           I was         unaware         of a n y    incident            inside       the     ground.

    Because         of    difficulty                parking         I d i d not e n t e r the g r o u n d unt il

    approximately                  3.15       p.m.



    The     gam e       had     stopped.                I entered          the     ground         from Penistone               Road,

    between         the       North Stand and                     the    S p i o n Cop.           My    immediate           impression

    was     that        there        had      been a         pitch       invasion            from      the    West     Stand.         Police

    deployment            seemed           to      be    preventing           people          in the N o r t h         and South

    stands         from       coming          into       contact         with      people         on the       pitch.          Police

    were     also        deployed             across         the    half-way            line      wich appeared              to     be a

    preventive            measure             to    deter         people      on    the       pitch moving             across        from

    the     West        Stand        to    the      S p i o n Cop.          I saw        people         being     taken        from       the

    ground,         between             the     N o r t h S t a n d a n d S p i o n Cop,                on    stretchers,            with

    Police         Officers             and     civilians           sharing         the       carrying.           From       the     c or n e r

    of     the     ground          I was        at,      I did      not     get     any       impression          of    t he      nature        of

    th e    incident            as      it w a s        finally         revealed.



    After        3/4 minutes               I walked           on the        perimeter              track      in f r o n t     of    the

    S p i o n Cop,        through             the       players         tunnel      and       into      the P o l i c e      Control

    Room     at     the       Leppings             Lane      end    on the         South          Stand.       From      t h at     position

     I saw       considerable                 Police         activity         on the          perimeter          track       and     playing

E N D OF        REPORT
                       HILLSBOROUGH - 15TH APRIL 1989

                    DAVID BENJAMIN PARKER - SUPERINTENDENT

        HEADQUARTERS COMMUNICATIONS & COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT



On Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced work at Headquarters at 9.00 a.m. and
worked in the Department until approximately 1.30 p.m. I was responsible  for
members  of the department who were      deployed on communications duties in
connection with the F.A. Cup Semi-final.

At various times through the morning I visited the Force Operations     Room   to
keep   abreast   of   developments   which   may have   affected my     area   of
responsibility.  There was nothing which required my attention.

At 1.30 p.m. I paid a final visit to Force Operations Room and then left
Headquarters  in my own car to visit the Communications Caravan and emergency
Stonefield Communications Vehicle which were  located adjacent to the Owl
Public House at Hillfoot Bridge, Penistone Road, Sheffield.  I arrived at the
caravan at approximately 2.00 p.m.

Whilst with the Communications staff at the caravan I took possession of a
Motorola personal   radio, tuned to Channel 25.  Whilst at the caravan I heard
radio messages from Superintendent Marshall asking for a gate  to be    opened.
My  recollection is of three such requests, increasing in urgency.  Other than
the last request I heard which had a reference to "get someone of their   arse"
I cannot recall the detail of his messages or the response to them from other
officers.

At 2.50 p.m. I left the caravan and went to the ground by car.  As I made   the
journey I was unaware of any incident        inside  the  ground.   Because of
difficulty parking I did not enter the ground until approximately 3.15 p.m.

The game had stopped.   I entered the ground from Penistone Road,   between the
North Stand and the Spion Cop.       My immediate impression was that there had
been a pitch invasion from the West Stand.   Police  deployment   seemed to be
preventing people in the North and South stands from coming into contact with
people on the pitch.  Police were also deployed across the half-way line which
appeared to be a preventia§. measure to deter people on the pitch moving across
from the West Stand to the Spion Cop.   I saw people being taken from the
ground,  between the North Stand and Spion Cop, on stretchers, with police
officers and civilians sharing the carrying.   From the corner of the ground I
was  at I did not get any impression of the nature of the incident as it was
finally revealed.

After 3/4 minutes I walked on the perimeter track in front of the  Spion Cop,
through the players    tunnel and into the police control room at the Leppings
Lane end on the South Stand.  From that position I saw considerable police
activity on the perimeter track and playing area in front of the West Stand.
It was obvious that people had spilled over from the West Stand.    Some were
laid on the grass.     I could not see into the centre of the area of activity
which was behind the goal posts, because of the number of people.
     After only 1/2 minutes   in the control  room I left to telephone      Force
     Operations Room at the request of ACC/Ops to ensure that the Chief Constable
     had been informed of the events.

     When I returned to the control room the time would be approximately 3.30 p.m.
     I then heard a radio message from Chief Inspector Sumner that people were
     apparently dead and this was the first indication I had of the severity of the
     incident.    A small   section of the crowd in the West Stand adjacent to the
     Control Room were shouting and gesturing aggressively towards      the police
     Control Room.     People  in the top section of the West Stand were removing
     advertising hoardings and passing them forwards to the pitch where  they were
     used as stretchers.    People were being carried from the area of the incident
     on the makeshift stretchers.

     At approximately 3.35 p.m. I left the ground to go to Ecclesfield     Training
     Centre to assist with the setting up of the Casualty Bureau.

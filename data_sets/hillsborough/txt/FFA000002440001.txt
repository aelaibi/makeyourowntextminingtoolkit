Dear Mr.    Blom-Cooper,

     At this very emotional and stressful time for football The
Football Association has attempted to deal with all issues
relating to the Hillsborough tragedy in a sensitive way, foremost
in our thinking has always been the predicament of the bereaved
families.

     We have stated our intention that we wish The Football
Association Challenge Cup to continue but with a complete change
of emphasis in that the matches are played in the spirit of a
memorial to those who lost their lives, with The Football
Association not benefitting financially one penny.

     In that context I was somewhat dismayed at the headlines in
both The Sun and The Star on Wednesday 26th April.  The
impression was given that The Football Association was forcing
the hand of Liverpool and that we have taken a hard-hearted
approach.

      As Chairman of The Football Association I can assure you
that the impression given by these headlines is some way off the
mark.

     At this stage I am merely making my observations but I would
in turn be grateful for yours.


                                            Yours sincerely




                                            F. A. Millichip

    UVERPOOL
       UNDER              by ROB SHEPHERD
  BERT MILLICHIP last night gave
  Liverpool until the weekend to
  decide their FA Cup stance, or be
  excluded from the competition.
    The FA chairman took the tough line
  after the d u b deferred their decision
  about continuing with their semi-final
  against Nottingham Forest.
 Millichip said: “Liverpool have
 got to make a decision by the
 weekend otherwise the competi­
 tion will go ahead w ithout them.
   “We don’t feel we are putting
    assure on them or being Lnsensi-
     e. We haven’t taken this stance
    -htly. We have gone into it thor-
      hly with the number of people
'w acem ed.
   “Both Nottingham Forest and Ev­
 erton have said to us they want to
 go on. I can understand the views
 of those people who say it shouldn’t
 be played. Personally I want to see
 Liverpool play.”
   The FA’s hard line may be seen
 by many as far too insensitive with
 the funerals of the 95 who died at
 Hillsborough still going on.                                                     i-i                                                         'a
                       Meeting
     Liverpool asked for more time to
  consider their views after a three-
  hour meeting yesterday with FA
  chief executive Graham Kelly.
     But the fact that there was no
  negative answer suggests chairman
  John Smith is winning the day
  against Peter Robinson and Kenny
  Dalglish and that the semi-final
  could go ahead.
     Said Smith: “People are still very
    jtressed. We did a lot of heart
V Tching after those appalling
      nts and I hope people appreciate                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ■ :~HssJ£z3fm
 -rrfiy we all, including the manager,
  need a little more time.”
    Smith was in favour of proceed­
  ing as a tribute to the victims of
  Hillsborough. But chief executive
  Robinson backed manager Dalglish
  and players such as John Barnes,
  John Aldridge and Steve Nicol who
  do not want to play.
    Afterwards Glen Kirton, head of
  external affairs for the FA said:
  “We are sympathetic but logisti-
  cally we cannot wait much longer.
  We will need a decision one way or
  another by the weekend."                                                  BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS . . . Liverpool take down the fences at Anfield yesterday

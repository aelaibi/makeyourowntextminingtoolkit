Dear Mr Duke-Evans

Hillsborough Scrutiny: Adlington -v - Duckenfield and Murray

I refer to our exchange of correspondence in July (copies attached) and thank you for your
letter of 12th July. Unfortunately, the list to which you refer in the penultimate line of that
letter was not in fact enclosed and I should be most grateful if you would kindly provide me
with a copy as this will assist us in this matter which is now proceeding to trial.

Thank you for your assistance.

Yours sincerely

    Dear Sirs

    Hillsborough Scrutiny - Adlington -v- Duckenfield and Murray

    We act for Mr David Duckenfield, the former Chief Superintendent in charge at the
    Hillsborough Football Stadium when the disaster occurred in 1989. Mr Duckenfield faces
    criminal charges arising out of the Hillsborough disaster and is currently before the Leeds
    Magistrates Court for committal proceedings in respect of those criminal charges.

     The presiding magistrate, Mr Nigel Cadbury, has been referred to Lord Justice Stuart-
     Smith’s scrutiny conducted in 1997. Mr Cadbury has raised a query in relation to the
     material that was submitted to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and considered by him in
     considering his Scrutiny. We would be pleased to know as a matter of urgency, whether the
     Home Office has in its possession an index, inventory or list of material that was submitted
     to and/or considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

     As the committal proceedings are in the third day of a scheduled 2 week hearing, we would
     be pleased to hear from you as a matter of utmost urgency. Please contact Mr Jason Dowler
     of this office to discuss matters.

     Yours faithfully

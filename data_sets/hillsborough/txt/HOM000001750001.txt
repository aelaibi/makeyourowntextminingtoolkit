 I am a Detective Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police presently stationed

 at Police Headquarters.

 On         or          about            the       5      April             1989,             I   was          asked             if      I      would            perform                duty          in

  uniform                 on Saturday                       15 April                   1989        to cover                    the semi              final            football match

  between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forest Football Club.                                                                                                                        I was

     informed that insufficient uniform officers had volunteered for this duty.

     I agreed to work.

     At      8.00             am,          Saturday                 15       April            1989,            I       commenced                   duty           in        uniform.                      A

     briefing                 took place                    at       the West                 Bar Gymnasium and I,                                       together with other

     officers,                   commenced our designated duties                                                       at       the Midland Railway Station.

     The       task was to segregate                                        the rival supporters arriving at the Station and

     to       transfer                    these           supporters                     to       waiting               PSVs.                   Myself               and         my       serial,

     number               14         consisting                     of         another               Police                Sergeant                  and           seven             officers,

     together                    with              other             similar                  serials,                  were             allocated                     the           Liverpool

supporters.

The     PSV's were             loaded with       fans   and        then officers                      accompanied the vehicle

to the football ground.                       These officers were                         then to return with the PSV's

and continue until such time that all the supporters had been cleared from

the station.

At 2.20 pm there was no                       further information that any other supporters were

expected to arrive by train.                         It was then that Inspector D e w e s , the officer

in     charge,           stood       down    the remaining           serials                  at    the    railway          station.    I,

 together with members of my serial, boarded a PSV to travel to the football

 ground to continue our designated duties.

About 2.50 pm the PSV was travelling along Leppings Lane and I commented to

 an    officer           on    the    vehicle    that   in my            experience                  as    a policeman            and as a

 previous regular supporter of Sheffield Wednesday,                                                  that I had never seen as

 many people outside the ground at that time of d a y , obviously attempting to

 gain entry.               I could see densely populated circles of supporters trying to

 obtain    tickets              from ticket       touts.        I was sat on the lower deck of the PSV

 and the window was                    banged    at the side of me and a group of between twenty

 and thirty supporters were asking if we, the passengers on the PSV, had any

 tickets.           Once they saw the Police uniforms they dispersed.

 The     PSV    travelled              very    slowly   along            Leppings                  Lane    through          the   enormous

 deluge        of        people.        I would      estimate            that           there        were           about   3,000   people

 pushing and milling around the area closest to the entrance.

 The PSV eventually made                      its way onto Penistone Road where we alighted from

  the    vehicle              and    about    3.00   pm made           our        way          into       the       gymnasium     awaiting

  further instructions.                      We were immediately told by Inspector Sewell that we

  could be required to attend the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

           About 3.05 pm, myself and the serial were told to attend inside the ground

            at      the Leppings                      Lane          end.                   We made                our way                   to    the playing area and could

            see        the match                 in        progress.                              I     looked               towards              the       Leppings      Lane       end and

           could           see       supporters                    milling                        around             on       the           side       of    the      playing       area.      I

           then started to run to what I thought was crowd disorder.

          At       this         time I saw Superintendent                                                    Greenwood run onto the playing area and

           approach              the referee.                            I went                    immediately to the rear of the goal area at

           the Leppings Lane end and looked at the crowd.                                                                                         I then saw with horror and

          disbelief                 that         the       first                  three               or       four rows                    of supporters               within my view

          were dead.                       They        were still in an upright position packed into each                                                                             other,

          some         beyond              the          first                   few rows                   were           dying             as     pressure from              the     people

          behind continued.                             All            the dead were purple in colour and some had bulging

          eyes.             There           was        a considerable                                   amount              of vomit.                   I could         see     that some

         people            had        attempted                   to          protect                   the         persons                 in    front          as   their    arms were

         wrapped              around            them         and              crushed                   into           the         chest           of       the person        protected.

         Some were so small that you could only see their heads.

         I shouted to Superintendent Greenwood                                                                       that there were                         thirty or forty dead

         within            my      view         and        that               we           must           get         the         crowd           to    retreat         backwards       and

         obtain immediate medical                                               help,                 especially oxygen.                                Mr Greenwood commenced

         to use his personal                               radio                  and I immediately mounted advertising hoardings

         and       screamed                at     supporters                           to move                 backwards waving my arms                                  in a similar

        gesture.                 I could                   see space at the rear of the terrace and                                                                           the tunnel exi

         from          the         terrace                   just                   to my             right              appeared                  clear.             However,        other

        supporters were still running through the tunnel and pushing into the rear

        of       the        crowd.                I    saw            other                      officers              also           on         the    advertising           hoardings

        shouting and gesturing as myself.

Some           of    the       crowd    did       not    seem     to       care what                     was    happening       as     they were

spitting at us as we waved them to go back.

At      this         time       I saw    to my          left    a young               boy of between eleven and                             fifteen

years old about                   three rows            from the front.                         He was still alive and had his

 fingers on the steel mesh.                              He was turning purple and looking directly into

                          I was       totally       helpless          and         could            not        reach    the boy.         I jumped

 down          from       my    position          and    attempted              to       push           my     hands       through     the    metal

 fence in an attempt                     to pull him clear.                           It was futile.                       I spoke to him and

 told him to hang on and held his hands.

 Then          complete          panic       seemed       to    break          out         and          instead        of going       backwards,

 youths were rushing forward treading on the dead and dying and swinging on

 the           perimeter         fence        attempting           to         get         out           of     the    terrace.          One    such

 supporter stood on the boy and was swinging on the spiked fence in front of

 me.            Together         with    other          officers,          I was              obliged           to help        this    and    other

 supporters who were                      attempting            the same               escape             route.           Several    supporters

 were removed in this way, some received injuries on the spiked railings and

 others ripped clothing.

 At the first opportunity I looked for the boy but could not identify him in

 the           mass       of    bodies       at    my    feet.            I      think            at         this     time    the     advertising

 hoarding broke making the task to remove supporters more difficult.

 I turned and saw Mr Greenwood beckon to me.                                                            He said that he could not be

  heard             on    the radio       and      I attempted                to use mine                      with    similar       result.      No

  medical                team   or     oxygen      had     arrived            in        the         area        and    I    could     see    several

  officers removing supporters over the perimeter fence.                                                                   I had seen officers

  to my left attempting to open the steel escape gate to my left and by this

  time          I     think      it    was    open       and    persons               were              being       removed.        Mr Greenwood

asked          me    to       obtain       an    ambulance.               I ran            the           length of             the    field    to      the

entrance             way      between        the North Stand                   and the Spion Kop where I knew from

previous experience that an ambulance would be positioned.

Officers             at       that    end       of     the      ground       did         not         realise             the    enormity       of       the

situation and I shouted to an unknown Inspector that there was a desperate

need for manpower at the other end.                                          My main concern was the ambulance and

I eventually                  persuaded           an ambulance              driver              to drive             his vehicle down                   the

 narrow entrance way and onto the side of the playing area.                                                                          An advertising

 hoarding            had first         to be broken down                       before             the vehicle could be directed

 towards            the Leppings Lane end.                        Once       the ambulance reached the area I left

 the two ambulancemen to get on with their jobs of tending to the injured.

 I again ran to the perimeter fence as supporters were still swinging on the

 fence          in    an      attempt        to      remove       themselves                  from         the       terrace.           I     assisted

 supporters                over      but     could         see    that        there            were         no      officers           in    the       rear

 pulling people backwards where they should be.                                                           I spoke to Mr Greenwood who

 stated             that      he     could      not        be    heard       by       radio.                Almost           immediately           I    saw

 officers             climbing         over          the     dividing           fence            to       the       left       and    run    into       the

                          I   continued           my    task      of     removing                 supporters                 over     the    perimeter

 fence.              I     saw      officers         with        tears      running                down         their         face     working         with

 strength             that         I didn't          think was         possible.                         Some were physically lifting

  people from inside the terrace over the dividing fence to the left.                                                                           Others

  were         inside         the     terrace          extraditing              people             and      passing            them     to    officers

  inside -the gate.                    Supporters were                   still           trampling on the dead and injured

  and          jumping         onto    the      perimeter          fence.                I continued                     to drag       these       people

  over the t o p .

  A    supporter              then pulled me                 from behined and pointed to a man who was laid

  on the floor obviously distressed and shocked and screaming for his son.                                                                                    I

Continuation of statement of                            PAUL MORTON



went              to   the      man    who        was     in        a       very           high               state     of        hysteria      and    was

immediately                joined       by    a woman          who           said           she        was          a nurse.         I attempted         to

give him words of comfort about his son and left him with the nurse.

 I      assisted           in removing            several           persons                  from             the    terrace,        some      obviously

 dead.             Together with a man who said he was a doctor I gave heart massage to

 a man whilst                  the doctor gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.                                                            After a short

 time             the doctor          said    he was dead                 and moved                   to a           further        supporter         being

 cared for by police officers.

 At        this        time     I    saw     Chief      Superintendent                          Nesbit              working        frantically         with

 officers.                 Mr       Nesbit     was       grey       and            sweat            was        pouring           from   him.      Almost

 immediately                  a loud cry went             up and some Liverpool supporters on the pitch

 began to charge                     towards       the Nottingham Forest supporters at the other end.

 I grabbed two supporters who were about to run with the crowd.                                                                           One of them

 turned and punched me                         in the upper                     body.               I held him and could see                          there

 were             tears    in his       eyes.           He was           not violent                      any longer              and was      calmed by

 his friend.                  They both walked away from the pitch.

 Mr Nesbit                then shouted            to me to use my radio.                                        It was impossible               to speak

     to ground control.                      I changed my radio                             to channel 29,                       the one used in the

  morning whilst in 'Dl' Division.                                         I passed a message from Mr Nesbit that he

     required dogs and officers onto the pitch in front of the Nottingham Forest

     fans who were                  taunting the Liverpool supporters.                                               Mr Nesbit took immediate

     control and arranged                     a line of officers                            across             the pitch.            Chief Inspector

     Beal         also    assisted.           I      saw Detective                     Inspector Meek around this                               time and

     could see             he was       attempting             to       form a line of officers                                    across    the pitch.

     By these             very      positive       and     quick a c t i o n s , a possible                                      catastrophic      public

     disorder situation was averted.

        I saw the fire service were                                  in attendance                         and oxygen was being used where

         possible.                   Make        shift     stretchers                    had          been             made       from       the    advertising

        ‘ hoardings           and supporters and police officers were placing persons on these

         and moving them to the other end of the ground through the cordon of police

         officers.

         Several of the supporters                            on the pitch who had, with assistance,                                                  clambered

         over the perimeter                       fence had been drinking heavily and smelled strongly of

         intoxicants.                   I saw some of these supporters spitting and kicking officers

         who were in the process of attempting resuscitation.                                                                       Several approached me

         in anger and called me a murderer.                                            I attempted to calm them down.

         The announcement was then made that the match was to be abandoned.                                                                                A short

         time later Mr Nesbit directed part of the line of officers on the pitch to

         form        a     cordon           across       Penistone                Road           in        order         that          the   ambulances       with

         casualties                  could        obtain       a       clear            escape               route            and       to   segregate       rival

          supporters.                 Chief Inspector Beal, Detective Inspector Meek and myself went

          with these officers and formed the cordon as requested.

          Initially when I arrived at the Leppings                                                        Lane end I saw two officers from

          my serial,                 Police Constable                                               |and Police Constable 217^ Cutler,

          who were making                        their way         towards            the gate                  area of the fence.                    I did not

          see      these officers                   from my          serial until much later that night.                                               I did not

          see       any       other          officers       from my               serial               that            day,       although     I     did   contact

          Inspector Dewes by radio later that night.

          I saw at               this most           unforgettable                    incident                 several            officers,         most   of whom

          were         unknown              to    m e , working                with       total            commitment                  and   with    the   highest

          degree            of       professionalism.                          Ones        I      knew            were        Police         Constable      Steven

           Fairclough and Police Constable John Friend.

                                            (CJ Act, 1967, s.9:MC Act, 1980, s.102:                                               MC Rules, 1981, r.70)


        Continuation of statement of                                                        PAUL MORTON



        During                   the whole                           tragic              incident I may have been involved in other places

        than described but I cannot recollect anything further at this time.

        In           conclusion,                                I        would           just   like         to       say          that        words       cannot    express    my

         feelings                        at         the            time              when   I realised               there were                dead,       dying and injured.

        To say I felt inadequate                                                            and helpless are mere syllables which convey part

         of my thoughts.

         I        have                 had             severe                     feelings      of      self           doubt,              could       I   have     done   things

         differently, could I have done more, should I have done more, all these and

         other thoughts will never be forgotten.

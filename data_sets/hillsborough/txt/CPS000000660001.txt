Dear Sir

RE : HILLSBOROUGH - DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

I hope that we shall have spoken before you receive this letter. I was grateful for the
advices given to me in our telephone conversation on 20 August, and I noted and had
confirmed by the Stipendiary Magistrate that similar advices had been given by you
to the Clerk to the Justices.

Having regard to the indication given by you that it was probable that you would have
completed your review of the evidence in this case by 30 September, the proceedings
in the Magistrates’ Court have been adjourned until 30 October. That would give an
opportunity for the Director of Public Prosecution to make a decision upon the report
submitted by you.

Yours sincerely

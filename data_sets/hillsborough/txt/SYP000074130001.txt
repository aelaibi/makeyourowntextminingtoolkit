and    towards 3pm         (1500)       queues were          forming.        The a t m o s p h e r e    at his       time

was    lighthearted and             people were            orderly.      Quite a number             of fans

a bout       two at this        time.    Fans were          s e a r c h e d entering       the turn s t i l e s and

a number         of    items    including      empty milk            crates,        sticks    from flags,            pop

and    beer      cans were       confiscated.             I saw a man        selling       programmes          from an

open gate         near    to where       I was       standing.       He was         told fiy su p e r v i s o r y

Officers         to    close    the gate.      Whilst        fans were        entering        the      gates    in

large        numbers     1 could smell         intaxi cants           in the air', some             time      prior to

the    kick      off    two men     a p p r o a c h e d me wit h tickets, wanting                   to enter         the

ground.        One     of these     men was         under     the    influence of a l c o h o l , with

q lazed eyes,           he was     unsteady         on his    feet and        his      speech was        siitrrea.

'The man a c c o m p a n y i n g    him had been drinking                   but     to a muc h      lesser

degree,, Bot h men were              refused entry to the                   ground and they             became

argumen t a t i v e .     They were       -furnished wit h my               collar      number      and that of

PC C APES after           they stated         that     they wis h e d        to make a formal              complaint

agains t u s . They then stood at                     the    s ids of us f o r a sno rt t ime and

then      left    the area walk i n g         towards        the     city    centre as a large                number

of    fans     began queueing           to gain entry to the ground,,

At 3pm        (1500)     there     was a loud         roar    from the        crowd and the             game    had

obviously         started.       PC C A P E S and myself,            together with            the      rest    of our

         stood     near      to me and          I could hear            from his       personal          radio a lot of

         traffic       regarding          the       gates and      1     heard L e p p i n g s Ln m e n t i o n e d but

         the    pitch     I ran towards               the L a p pings Ln stand,                1 could see            people

         s p i lling    out    onto       the       pitch and a          number       of   fans being        lifted up

         towards       the    upper       level.        My first         i m p r e s s i o n was that     of a pitch

         invasion,        but as         1 got       closer      I could see          that     the      fans were

         completely          s q u a s h e d together          in the        pen and Police Officers                   were

         leaping       over    the fence             and a s s i s t i n g fans       out.     There were many               people

         wandering        over      the    pitch and           lying      on the      ground,

         went     to another         youth          nearby,      his    face was       bright        red,    he was         on his

         hands and knees             gasping          for    breath      but a p p e a r e d      to be     recovering.               At

         this     point      I still       had not          realised the           extreme        severeness          of the

         situation although                    1 realised          it was     pretty grave,          but at          some    point

         around     this      time a           fan w a n d e r i n g ar o u n d was shouting             that        there were

         people     dead at         the    fence,          I m oved     onto a n o t h e r     large man who was

         unconscious          and    p 1a ced him           in the      recovery       pos i 1 1 on,      1 loosened his

         clothing,        he began             to    come     round after what seemed                like a          few minutes.

         He    c o u l d n ’t speak       but       gave me an          okay sign. I m oved on,              showing         fans

         carrying       the hoardings               which      people        needed    e m e r g e n c y assi s t a n c e        as

         they were        coming         for    some       people who were            r e asonably well.              Then       I went

f e n e e a t t h is t im e .

At one        point       here a large          number       of tans     ran from the          terrac ed end

towards        the N o t t i n g h a m Forest          fans,    this a p p e a r e d    to be due to the

fact     that       the Notts          Forest     fans were      still     shouting                          n g , even

goading.           I was    informed          by an Inspector           to help form a line across                     the

mi d d l e    of the       pitch to stop fans                gaining access           to opposite          sides.

I was        told    to    remain       in position          for an unkn o w n        length of       time    feeling

totally        useless,          we were       eventually       told     to go,       in pairs and          inform

fans     that       they    could       leave     the ground.         At this        point    I was a p p r o a c h e d

by a man           looking       for    his    son who was        11 years          old,, Myself and a

Sergeant           tried    to find a number where                 he    could       ring,    as every t h i n g was

still        in a confused             state at       this    time.     We were       told that       no

Casualty Bureau              had been set             up yet and he was a d v i s e d to sit                 in the

s tand and wait             , he w o u l d      be    informed when        the       bureau    number was

available           and assisted.             I was    then    informed        to    leave    the    pitch arm

us that        we were       useless,          even hampering           what    little we were             trying      to

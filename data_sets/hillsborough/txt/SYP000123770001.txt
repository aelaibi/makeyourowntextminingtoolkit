 I D O N ’T REMEMBER

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 MY OWN ACCORD.


G18

 Q32

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53

®      YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IN GENERAL NO.       I JUST HAD TO TELL ONE POLICEMAN TO GIVE THE KISS OF LIFE TO

 SOMEONE. I WOULD NOT RECOGNISE THE POLICEMAN AGAIN.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1. THE FANS SHOULD HAVE REVERSED ENDS.

2. MORE ORGANISED DIRECTIONS OUTSIDE GROUND WITH MORE STEWARDS AND POLICE TO

 V     ECT PEOPLE.

 3. MORE TURNSTILES. BETTER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL

 ORGANISERS TO ENSURE NOT SO MANY FANS IN ONE AREA AND TO MAKE ANNOUNCEMENTS

 TO THE WAITING FANS AS TO WHAT IS HAPPENING AND TO DELAY KICK OFF WHEN STILL

 CROWDS WAITING TO COME IN.

 Q33

 j ^ Y G U HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ON THE POLICE’S BEHALF OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING.     THERE

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FIRST AID EQUIPMENT AND BETTER ESCAPE ROUTES.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE GATE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN OPENED TO ALLOW UNAUTHORISED ENTRY,     THE

 STADIUM WAS BADLY SIGNPOSTED.     LAST YEAR THE POLICE STOPPED US ON ROUTE AND

 CHECKED OUR TICKETS THEREFORE REDUCING THE FLOW OF PEOPLE.

Q-18

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE   INCIDENT

 WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE DIDN’T REALISE HOW SERIOUS THE SITUATION WAS QUICKLY ENOUGH AND TO

 BE HONEST NEITHER DID I. EVEN WHEN IT WAS OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE THAT PEOPLE WERE

 E ^ N G THE MAJORITY OF POLICE JUST STOOD FORMING A LOOSE CORDON ACROSS THE

 PITCH AS IF EXPECTING A PITCH INVASION. AT THIS POINT I FELT THEY SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN ORGANISING THE EVACUATION FROM THE TERRACE ONTO THE PITCH AND HELPING

 MORE WITH FIRST AID.

 QS4

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT   YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 A MAJOR FACTOR IN WHAT TOOK PLACE WAS A LACK OF POLICING AND STEWARDING OF

 FANS INSIDE THE GROUND AND A LACK OF THEIR PRESENCE AT KEY POINTS WITHIN THE

 qJpUND I.E. AT THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL TO STOP FANS GOING DOWN THERE WHEN THE

 PENS 3 AND 4 WERE FULL. ALSO THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN POSITIONED TO DIRECT THE

 FANS TO THE WINGS OF THE TERRACING. STEWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN POSITIONED AT

 EACH ACCESS GATE ON THE FENCING BOTH AT THE FRONT FENCE AND THE SEGREGATING

 PEN FENCES. THE GATES IN THE FENCING SHOULD BE MUCH WIDER TO FACILITATE A

 GREATER FLOW OF FANS.

 THE LAYOUT OF THE LEPPINGS LN END IS A NATURAL BOTTLENECK AND TOTALLY

 INADEQUATE TO COPE WITH FANS WHO WANT ENTRY TO 3   DIFFERENT SECTIONS   OF THE

 GROUND. THERE SOULD BE   MORE BANKS OF TURNSTILES. LIVERPOOL FANSREALISED        THAT

 THE NET IN THE GOAL AT THEIR END OF THE GROUND WAS HAMPERING RESCUE OPERATIONS

 AND REMOVED IT. NOTTINGHAM FOREST FANS ON SEEING THIS AND NOT UNDERSTANDING
                                                                             PAGE   9
                                                                             QSL233

 THE* REASON BEGAN TO CHANT "YOU’RE JUST A LOAD OF WANKERS." THE LIVERPOOL FANS

 REACTED ANGRILY AND STARTED TOWARDS THE FOREST END OF THE PITCH. AT THIS A

 LARGE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS WERE DEPLOYED ACROSS THE PITCH. WHY WEREN’T

 THEY USED SOONER IN A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE WAY. IT WAS ABOUT 1530 HRS (1530) WHEN

 THEY WERE USED.

 THE FIRE BRIGADE WITH CUTTING EQUIPMENT WERE TOO LATE.   IT SEEMED THE FANS WERE

 TAKING THE INITIATIVE FOR THE MAIN PART FOR THE RESCUE AND AID TO INJURED FANS

 THE TICKET ALLOCATION FOR THE GAME WAS WRONG. ACCOUNT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN

 AS TO THE NUMBER OF FANS TO BE ATTENDING THE GAME FOR EACH TEAM.

 THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM WAS BARELY AUDIBLE ON OCCASIONS. AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS

      E AT ABOUT 1430 HRS REQUESTING FANS TO MOVE SIDEWAYS AWAY FROM THE TUNNEL

 TO ALLOW ACCESS TO INCOMING FANS. THIS SHOWS THAT A PROBLEM HAD BEEN SPOTTED

 AT THAT TIME BUT STILL NO CONSTRUCTIVE PHYSICAL ACTION WAS TAKEN TO SORT THE

 PROBLEM OUT.

 AN ANNOUNCEMENT MAKING THE WHOLE CROWD AWARE THAT A SERIOUS INCIDENT HAD

 HAPPENED WOULD HAVE HELPED.   I BELIEVE THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DONE WITHOUT

 CAUSING FANS TO PANIC.

 COULDN'T LIFT THEIR ARMS.                 HELPED ALSO BUT A POLICEMAN PULLED HIM DOWN

 AND TOOK HOLD OF                 I THOUGHT HE WAS   GOING TO ARREST HIM. I PUSHED THE

 OFFICER AWAY HE DIDN’T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO.

 NO

 GS3

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

^ T E R THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 DISGUSTING.     THERE WAS NO MEDICAL FACILITIES PEOPLE HAD TO USE THE HOARDINGS

FOR STRETCHERS.        LENGTH OF TIME IT TOOK FOR AMBULANCES TO ARRIVE, PEOPLE

 DIDN’T KNOW WHERE TO TAKE THE INJURED.        THE AMBULANCE COULD HAVE DRIVEN ON THE

 GRASS, THERE SEEMED NO ONE IN CHARGE.        NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW WHO WAS, NOT EVEN

 THE POLICE.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 MY OPINION REGARDING THE SIZE OF THE CROWD.         THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION OUTSIDE

4 ) INSIDE THE GROUND.        WHY DIDN’T THE POLICE BOX SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.   WHY

 DIDN’T THE POLICE ON THE PITCH AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND TELL THEIR CONTROL WHAT

 WAS GOING ON.       WHAT   HAPPENEDTO THE LOUD SPEAKERS.

 I FEEL THAT LIVERPOOL WERE GIVEN THE WRONG/^ND OF THE STADIUM BY THE F.A. AND

 POLICE, OWING TO THE AMOUNT OF FANS LIVERPOOL HAVE COMPARED WITH NOTTS FOREST.

 THERE WAS A LACK OF ORGANISATION OUTSjbE THE GROUND AND I FEEL STRONGLY THAT

 THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELAYED.            INSIDE THE GROUND THE FENCES DIVIDING

 THE PENS SHOULD HAVE MORE A C C E s V ^ S l N T S .   THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER

      SECTIONS INSIDE THE GROUNDS.       I THINK THE FENCES INSIDE THE GROUND ON THE

Q14

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS:

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 I THOUGHT AT 1440 THERE WERE FAR TOO M A N Y ^ E O P L E IN PENS 3 & 4.   THERE

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF ANNOUNCEMENT TO TELL THE FANS WHAT WAS

 HAPPENING.

 Q5Q

^^T      TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 I ’M NOT SURE ABOUT 1645 HRS

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD,

 OWN ACCORD

 NO

 Q53   -

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.

 THERE SEEMED A COMPLETE LACK OF F I p    AID EXPERIENCE BY THE POLICE.

 COMPLETE LACK OF COMMUNICATIOW^Y THE POLICE ? THERE WERE NO POLICE PRESENT

 WHEN THE CRUSH HAPPENED OUTSIDE.


Q16

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

^DICIAL     INQUIRY?

 THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY PENS IN THE WEST STAND ALL THE SUPPORTERS AT THAT

 END SUPPORTED LIVERPOOL SO WHY DID THEY NEED TO BE PENNED IN.

 THE LIVERPOOL WERE GIVEN THE WRONG END IT WAS HOPELESS, TICKET ALLOCATION.

 THE POLICE & EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE VERY SLOW IN REACTING.

 THE TWO FENCES IN PEN FOUR WERE PULLED DOWN BUT ONLY ONE FENCE WAS PULLED

 DOWN IN PEN THREE.

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE POLICE OUTSIDE THE GROUND WHEN THE CRUSH WAS

 HAPPENING TO FILTER OR MONITER THE FANS THROUGH.

       MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

 THE TUNNEL SHOULD’VE BEEN CLOSED OFF AND THE FANS SHOWN TO THE SIDES.

 THERE SEEMED NO PRIORITY AS REGAREJJB^THE INJURED.

 I D O N ’T BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE FENCING.   I DON’T THINK THE POLICE/FANS,

 EMERGENCY SERVICES KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON.


Q'17

 POLICE WERE PUSHING FANS BACK INTO THE PENS WHO WERE TRYING TO ESCAPE.

 THE GATES LEADING TO THE FRONT ONTO THE PITCH SHOULD’VE BEEN OPENED

 EARLIER PRIOR TO THE KICK O F F .

 I ’M NOT SAYING ALL THE POLICE DID N’T HELP SOME OBVIOUSLY DID BUT MOST

 DIDN'-T SEEM TO BE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.

 MY MAIN CRITICISM IS THAT A TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT S H O U L D ’VE BEEN MADE TO TELL

 EVERYONE WHAT WAS GOING ON.    I'D LIKE TO SAY I WOULD LIKE TO BE CALLED TO

 GIVE EVIDENCE TO HELP MAKE SURE IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

 I WAS PRESENT WHEN MY SON WAS INTERVIEWED.

 JOSTLING TO GET TO THEIR PLACES.    I WAS SURPRISED THAT IT WAS THAT FULL 40

 MINUTES BEFORE THE GAME.   AT 2.30 (1430)   I COMMENTED HOW PACKED IT WAS WHEN

 THE SIDE PENS WERE SO EMPTY BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE DIFFICULT TO MOVE OU"l

 AND ROUND.   TEN MINUTES LATER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE.

 <344


 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,   IF SO, CAN YOU SAY WHAT TIME THIS

 HAPPENED?

 YES, AT ABOUT QUARTER TO 3 PM (1443) OR TEN TO 3 PM (1450) THE CRUSH HAD

 Jjj^CHED A STAGE BEYOND WHICH I WOULD CONSIDER AS NORMAL.   AT 5 TO 3 PM (1435)

 IT WAS EXCESSIVE AND AT ONE STAGE I GOT TURNED AROUND AND IT TOOK ME 3 OR 4

 MINUTES JUST TO TURN TO FACE THE PITCH AGAIN,   IT WAS THAT PACKED.

 Q45
 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,   IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT? (BRIEFLY)

 NO NOT REALLY, WE WERE MOVING AROUND BUT THERE WERE NOT ANY REAL SURGES.

 NO.     I SAW A 30 YEAR OLD WHITE MAN WEARING JEANS AND A JEANS JACKET, OF LARGE

 BUILD AND LONG DARK HARI AND A BEARD, WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN BY SOMEONE FROM ONE

 OF THE PENS AND PUT IN THE COURTYARD.          AS PEOPLE WERE WORKING ON HIM I SAW HIM

 DIE.

 G48

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,             IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 I HELPED TO CARRY PEOPLE OUT OF THE PEN 3 ALONG THE TUNNEL INTO THE COURTYARD

 BY THE TURNSTILES.     THE THREE MEN WERE DEAD I AM SURE BUT I THINK THAT THE

^jjUNG LAD WAS STILL ALIVE.     I SAW PEOPLE WHO WERE UNCONSCIOUS BEING PULLED OVER

 THE SIDE FENCES INTO THE OTHER PENS AND OVER THE FRONT FENCE ONTO THE PITCH.


Q17

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE LACK OF CONTROL OF THE CROWD TO PREVENT PEOPLE GOING INTO PENS 3 AND 4

 OBVIOUSLY HELPED TO CAUSE THE SITUATION.          I REMEMBER LOOKING UP AT OFFICERS

 IN THE WEST STAND WHO WERE LOOKING DOWN INTO THE PENS AS PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING

^      THAT IT WAS TOO FUL.   THIS WAS AT 10 TO 3 PM (1450) AND THE OFFICERS DID

 NOT APPEAR TO BE AT ALL CONCERNED.

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 3.25 PM (1535)

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 I LEFT BECAUSE I WANTED TO PHONE MY WIFE.           MY TWO FRIENDS LEFT WITH ME.

G52

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

ONLY A LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER WHO CAME OUT OF THE GROUND AND WENT UP TO A POLICE

SERGEANT IN LEPPINGS LN AND GAVE HIM SOME VERBAL ABUSE AND GOT ARRESTED,         IN

MY OPINION THE BLOKE WAS MORE UPSET THAN AGRESSIVE.

G53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

I FEEL THAT WHEN THE FRONT GATE WAS OPENED JUST BEFORE THE MATCH WAS STOPPED

EVERYONE AIMED FOR THE GATE WHICH INCREASED THE PRESSURE NEAR TO THE GATE AND

 AUSED THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN CAUSED TO PASS OUT AND COLLAPSED WERE BEING
CAi

  AMPLED UNDERFOOT,

AT QUARTER PAST 3 PM (1515) I CARRIED MY FIRST BODY OUT ALONG THE TUNNEL FROM

PEN 3, I SAW SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS IN THE TUNNEL BUT NO BODIES.

MY OVERALL IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS WERE DOING THEIR

BEST BUT THAT THERE WAS NO LEADERSHIP.        I SAW A LARGE NUMBER OF OFFICERS

WALKING FURTHER DOWN THE PITCH IN NO HURRY WHEN PEOPLE WERE DYING AT OUR END.

G54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

0 E R E WAS INSUFFICIENT CONTROL OF PEOPLE GOING INTO A LIMITED CAPACITY AREA.

WITH HINDSIGHT I FEEL THAT THE SIZE OF THE AREA OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES IS FAR

TOO SMALL FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE NEEDING TO GO THROUGH,        IT IS BADLY DESIGNED

AND A BOTTLENECK.     I THINK THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN SELECTION OF PEOPLE FURTHER

AWAY FROM THE GROUND THEN THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO MANY PEOPLE MILLING

AROUND BY THE ENTRANCE TO THE GROUND.

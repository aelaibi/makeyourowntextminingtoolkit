    While        I was            walking        to      the       Ground        I saw          no    incidence                of    disorderly

    conduct           by      any       of    the     fans         in     the    area.




    As    I wal k e d down L e p p i n g s                     LN towards                 the G r o u n d         entrance,             I was awar

    of others walking                         towards          the G r o u n d as well                      1 could see there were

    two m o u n t e d Police                   o f f icers           outside                    entrance             to the Ground,                    who

    were     ushering a p p r o a c h i n g                    fans          opr the road and into the area

    i m m e d i a t e 1y          in    front       of       the     i y r nstiles.




    As    I turned                into       this     area,          I saw       what          I would          call       a    mass      of      peopl

    in    front          of       me    in    this       collecting              area.              Most     of      these          people        were

    f a c i ng      towards             the    t u r n s t i I e s , a 11 h o u g h             there        were       some         m a k i ng    t h e ir

    way    away          from          the    turnstiles.                    I would           estimate           that         there      were

    hundreds             of       people       in     this         mass.         There          were       no     o r g a n 1sed        q u e u e s , ana

    people          were          milling        around            towards           the       turnstiles.                 The       crowd        of

    people          in     this         area     was         contained           within             the     perimeter               fencing        and

    gates        of      the       Ground,          and       did       not     spill          out    into        the      street.

Together          with          my        brother,              I joined             the       back       of    this          mass       of    people.

Quite       soon       I was              swallowed                up     in    this       mass       of       people          as    others          came          x

behind,           I was           jostled                and       pushed           as    I tried          to       make       my    way       towards

the     turnstiles,,                      I did          not       feel        any       anxiety          or    distress             at       this       time

as    being       in a          big         crowd         is       something              that       I have          frequently

experienced                at     football                matches.                  My    brother          and       I    became          separated                :i.

the     crowd,             I continued                    to       make        my    own       way    towards             the       turnstiles.




It    is    not      the        first          time           that       I have           been       in    a    disorganised                   crowd          at

football          match,              outside             the       turnstile              areas.              At    this       time          I. w a s

unaware         of    what            had      happened                 to     my    brother,             other          than       we    had       become

After       two      or     three            minutes               of    joining           the       crowd,          two       mounted           Police

was     occurring.                    I could             not       say        if    these       were          the       same       two       mounted

officers          I had          already                 seen       outside              the    entrance             to       the    Ground,




I heard         one        of    these              officers             say,        "Ease       back,          lads,          ease       back."

The     officers            achieved                 some          success           as    people          in       the       crowd       tried          to    ea

the     pushing,                There          was        a    movement              towards          forming             a    queue,          although

there       was      still            a    tremendous                   press        of    people,             and       I experienced

diff i culty          in        g e t t i ng         to       the       tur nst i l e s .




Eventually            people               were          gaining             entrance           through             the       turnstiles,                 I

found       myself          crammed                 up    against              the       wall    to       the       side       of    one       of    the

turnstiles.                 This           turnstile                was        in    the       middle          of    a    block          of

turnstiles?                 I am           not       sure          how       many        turnstiles             there          were.           I manange

to    put    my      hand        and         foot         against              the       wall,       and       pushed          back

              against           the    crowd.                In       this       way     I managed              to       get       enough       room          to

              manoeuvre           into        the        turnstile.

             When     my      brother          got    to        me,       we    spoke        for          a    while           and       exchanged           views

             on    the       situation.               1    could              see    that        he       was       still           in     possession             of

             women,          one    of      whom     I had        met          once       before.               I am           n ot      sure     of    their

    time,       which        was      about       2,58        pm    <1458).




    The    players           were         already        out       on    the    pitch,          just       completing                their          warm

    After       about        five         minutes        I was          aware       that    a    number          of       supporters                were

    attempting             to    get       out    of     the       terraced          areas       by    climbing                onto       the

    Safety       fencing,             which       I    call        barrier          fencing,          up       and       over       onto       the

    I then       remember             a    Pol ice       officer          running          onto       the       pitch,              He

    approached             the       Referee,          and     the       Match       was    stopped,                 I    remained             on    the

    terracing             for    a    further          ten     minutes          watching          more          and       more       people

    getting          onto       the       pitch,         I also          saw    people          being          carried          away.




    The    whole          atmosphere             at    the     time       was       very    upsetting,                   so    my    brother          an

    I    left    the       terracing             and    stood           against       the       wall       a    few       yards          to    the

    rear    of       the     position            I had        held       while       waiting          for       my       brother          to       enter

    the    Ground.              We    remained          at     this       point       for       twenty          minutes,             talking.

    During       this        time         1 spoke        to    other          fans;    in       particular                I    remember             one

    fan    who       had    travel!ed             all     the      way        from    Hamburg          for       the          Match,           He    tol

    me    that       he    still          had    both     halves          of    his    ticket,             and       that       like          my

    brother,          he     had      entered          the     Ground          through          the    concertina                   gates.




    At    some       stage       this       gentleman              left       our    company,          and       I then             went       on    my

    own    to    see       what       was       happening,               I walked          back       towards             the       Leppings          LN

    turnstiles.                 It    was       there     that          I assisted          two       or       three          people          among       a

    group       of    injured             people,,        I    cannot          now    describe             any       of       the    people          who

    I helped,              I did          not    adminster              any    First       Aid    as       I do          not    consider

I went           back       to       my    brother,            and       we       concluded            that       the     Hatch          would       not,

continue              any       further             that     day.         We       decided            to    leave,        and       walked       back

and      out      through             the       gate        into     Lappings              L N.        I. w o u l d     say     that       the       time

was     about          4.00          prn ( 1 6 0 0 ) .




My     brother             went       off       to     look       for     my       father         and       brother-in-law                 at    a    pre.

Having           seen       the       concertina               gates          open       for      a    second          time     when       the

crowds           rushed          in,       I    cannot         say       that       they       were         shut       at, a n y     time

following              this.




Whilst           I was          on    my       way     to    the     Ground          just         before          the     Hatch,          I got       rid

of    the        ticket          I had          purchased            from          the    ticket-tout                  that     morning,             by

I disclaim                 any       rights          of     ownership              concerning               my    portion           of    the    semi­

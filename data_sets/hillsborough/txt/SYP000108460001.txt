            Sir



            I a m PC                                          of the N o r t h u m b r i a Police Force,                presently

            st a t i o n e d at S o u t h Shi elds Police Station,                          Ke p p e 1 Street,         South

            Shi e 1d s .



            H a vi n g    been brought        up    in N o t t i ngham,            I    attended      the semi- f i n a l         of

            the FA C u p b e t w e e n N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t         and L i v e r p o o l     a long w i t h my

            b r o t h e r . We   both had standing                  tickets        for     the S p i o n K o p a t

            H i l l s b o r o u g h a nd drove      up myself            to S h e f f i e l d    from Nott i n g h a m .



            We a r r i v e d and m a n a g e d to              park a p p r o x i m a t e l y 500 metres           up a road

            from the ground and w a l k e d                     down to the            gr o u n d at about 2 . 1 0 p m . F r o m

             leaving       the   car to e n t e r i n g           the gr o u n d       I was a p p r o a c h e d at      least     half

            a d ozen times          by L i v e r p o o l        Supporters         as k i n g   if you had any spare

            tickets.        In fact all           the way to the              gr o u n d you       could see           people

            as k i n g    for tickets       from an y o n e and              everyone,,



            A fter       entering    the    gro u n d and           standing at            the Kop end         I commented             to
                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                              R5&

my brother       that    there       looked to be far                 too man y     people at        the

Leppings       Roa d End     in the areas               behind the Goal.            That w o u l d     have      been

at about 2.40pm.



When    the teams       came     out        a n d the fans at            both         ends were cheer i ng you

could see       even from the               Kop     end people         start to be      pulled up          into   the

s tand a b o v e ,, a l t h o u g h at      that    time        it was    only one or t w o . The             match

star t e d and then there were                    people who          could be seen on the              fencing

b e h i n d the Goal     trying        to    climb       over.        As more     and more people           climbed

over    the    fencing     it was           obvious to me             if not          others    at the K o p end

that    it was     the sheer         n u m ber     of    people       in that      end that was         causing

the    overspill.



A matter       of minutes        later       people who were              coming     over    the     f e n c i n g and

onto    the    pitch were       just        c ollapsing an d a number                s t a r t e d to be

carried towards          the Ko p end to the exit at                       the     right    hand side         of the

Kop    end.



About    3 minutes        later      I noticed          the first         person to be         carr i e d across

the    pitch towards         the H op end on a m a k es h i f t                 str e t c h e r made    from the

Advertising        Hoa r d i n g s   who     had their           heads    covered w ith a jacket.



It was       only then that          people at          the Ko p end began to               realise        the

seriousness        of the      incident.           Un a b l e    to help    in any way,         about       15

minu t e s    later my brother              and    I left       the    g r o u n d , returned      to the        car

an d w h e n two other         lads a r r i v e d who also               travelled      up w ith us we            left

and    returned to N o t t i n g h a m .

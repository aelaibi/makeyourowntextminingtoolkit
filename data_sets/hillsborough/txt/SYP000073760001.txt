I bought      the two tickets tVom a person that                       I do not know       personally.

The    information          came    from a iShird party.

We ar r i v e d     in Sh e f f i e ld at    13.15 hrs     (1315)      and   parked in a side

street about          1 ~ one and a half miles              from the ground.            We sat      in the

car and ate          some sandwi ches '^Rd coffee and made                   our way to the ground

after about          15 minutes.        Whilst walking to the ground we saw hundreds

of    police officers             in groups of 2-3. \}ne officer asked if we were

Liverpool         supporters and d irected us to tl4e g r o u n d.                   I did not see any

disorder      or drunkenness              on the way to the ground,            but   I did see

hundreds      of fairs drinking             from cans     in the    street,     but none seemed

’worse    for wear          .      ^

We ar ri v ed at the entranbs^ljo the ground at about                          13.55 hrs      ( 1 3 5 5 ),

there were          people millin g arou nd but we              could easily make         our way to

our entrance          point and there were only queues 2 or 3 deep.                          We were

searched      inside and outside              the turnstiles.          'X did not see any gates

no dif fi cu lt y finding               our match viewing       pyint    in the No rth S t a nd.             I

did not     see any disolhisr between my entry                     point and match viewing

At about      14.4 \ hours           (1445) I saw that the' middle             pens of the Leppings

from the t u n n e l .          At this     time    I could see     people     climing    out of the

mid dle    pens      into the outer          pens whi ch were almost           empty.     People

continued to enter                the    pens all    the time    but    I noticed that        the

became     semi-conscious.             He was     then taken away on a stretcher                      for

hospital       treatment.        I realised after            treating        the first        casualty that

I had spent          too   long wit h him        in this     sort     of situation,           the more

casualties       I saw the       less     time    I realised        I could spend with each one.

I found I had to make a quick assessment.                             If they a p pe ar ed         to have

some    hope    I would spend some .time wi t h them.                       There were four wh ic h              I

believe was          dead.     I find     it difficult after               the first       two   casualties

to describe          them due    to the      realisation that              there was a large           number

of    casualties and that             I had a very limited amount                   of time with each.

I. at tempted C.P.R.           on at    least     10 p e o p l e , as      I sai d I be 1 i eve 4 we re

de fin ite ly dead the other 6 I believe                     showed signs           of    recovery.         Of

the    10 people       I treated all         had had more         than a modest amount                of

alcohol,       t'he smell      of alcohol        was    obvious,      not to be confused with

gastric       content.       This     does make a casualty harder                    to assess      because

it dulls       the    reflexes and        it makes       it more      difficult          to get a response

from a non -breathing            casualty.         Also an aspect            that made        initial

ex am in at io n and ass es sm en t mors difficult was                      the fact that          if a

casualty had been brought                 out of the        crowd     " b l u e ’ then res uscitation

attempted,       it had the e f f e c^ of making               them     ’p i n k ’ again.        Obviously

giving an       impression that           there'swas a greater              chance of       reviving        them.

I feel     that there was           no medical         e»qih>^ment a v a i l a b l e not even a supply

of    *ai i— w a y s ’ that wou ld      have enabled any medical                   staff    to   leave a

casualty to tend to others.                   There was

plan    put    into    play to deal with a large                number       of    casualties.         I spent

about 45 minutes             on the    pitch w i t K c a s u a l t i e s   and about

anothe r 45 mi nutes           in the first aid urhsj^ tending                    to ca s u a l t i e s the r e .

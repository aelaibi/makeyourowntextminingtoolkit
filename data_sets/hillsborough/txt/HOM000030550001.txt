Dear Mr Daines

HILLSBOROUGH

I refer to your letter of 21 September and our telephone conversation yesterday about the release of
material from the South Yorkshire Police Hillsborough archive.

I explained that I was concerned that your decision to defer any further release until afterthe CPS
had concluded its review of the criminal proceedings would place Ministers in an invidiousposition,
given the Government’s earlier commitment to place all the relevant statements in the House of
Commons Library. The issue would be brought to the fore later this month when Maria Eagle MP is
due to ask a Parliamentary Question about the material in the Library.

I indicated that, having discussed it with George Croston at the CPS, there did not appear to be any
legal constraint to fulfilling the Home Secretary’s commitment and that this should be regarded as a
separate issue to the disclosure of material by South Yorkshire Police to other parties.

I would be grateful if you could confirm that you will provide the outstanding statements, a list of
which is attached behind, at your earliest convenience.

I am copying this to George Croston for information.

                                            Yours sincerely




                                            M J Pyne

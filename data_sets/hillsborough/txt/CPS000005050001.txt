     HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST - VIDEOS

     Thank you for forwarding to me a copy of the letter received from
     the Deputy Chief Constable of Cheshire Constabulary. I have also
     now been passed by Private Office the original letter to the
     Director.
     I enclose herewith for your information a copy of the letter that
     has been sent to Mr Jones and you will note that I have asked to
     be notified of the date when any video is likely to be shown and
     I hopefully then can attend as an observer.

     You may wish to know that to date only one such video of an
     interview has been shown, at a magistrates' court in the West
     Midlands.

     Thank you for referring the matter to me.

       Dear Mr Jones,

      VIDEO TAPE RECORDING OF INTERVIEWS
      The Director has asked me to thank you for your letter of
      11th December; he has passed it to me for attention since I have
      special responsibility within the CPS for issues relating to
      video recording.

       I am grateful to you for bringing to our attention the fact that
       it is likely that early in the New Year the Coroner's Court will
       be shown a video recording of an interview.     I am aware that
       three Police Forces are currently conducting experiments
       concerning the video recording of interviews with suspects and
       indeed, I understand that to date only one such video has been
       shown at a magistrates' court in the West Midlands.

      In the event that it is decided to show a video recording of an
      interview, it certainly would be of interest to me to attend the
      proceedings and observe the process of replay: Perhaps you would
      be good enough to let me know in due course if this is arranged
      so that I can attend court as an observer, if possible.
      Thank you once again for bringing this matter to my attention and
      I should add that the Director has asked me to reciprocate your
      good wishes for the forthcoming festive season.

       Yours sincerely,




       D R H CONNOR

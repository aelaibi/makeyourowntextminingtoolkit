     HILLSBOROUGH PRIVATE PROSECUTION
     ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD

     Thank you for your letter of 19 October 1999 and the attached file of papers. I am copying
     this material to Chris Enzor and he and I will work on a response as soon as possible. Subject
     to the timing of any further submissions, your response deadline of 13 December seems very
     generous and I would hope to be able to meet it comfortably.

     For your information, our current information is that an abuse of process argument is listed
     for hearing on 4 January 2000; and a trial date has been fixed for 6 June 2000. I understand
     that there is also to be a three day hearing on 20-22 December of this year, to consider
     questions of admissibility of evidence and other defence submissions.

   joined       by    someone           who       appeared         to    be    an    official          w i t h a UHF           type

   radio and          together           they        unlocked           an    internal          perimeter            fence        which

   divided       the       access        from        the     North       stand       and     the    West         st a n d .       I

   questioned          the        man    with        the     radio       as    I was        concerned            that       fans

   entering          later        when       it w o u l d     be    busy would              have    access           to     either

   side.        I was        told       t ha t     they had w r o n gl y             positioned             two      markers              outside

   entering          the     ground          on    the     West     stand       end.         I was         also      told     that             it

  was     too    late        to    take       them        d o w n as     they       had     been    screwed            in     position.

  A s m all      portable              type       aluminium         barrier          had     been      positioned             to          the

   left    of    turnstiles              9    to     12 a n d      manned       by       further       s t e w a r d s ,who h a v e

   been    requested              by    the m a n w i t h          the       radio.

  By     this    time        I was       aware        that      the      Serial          Sergeant,          S g t.    Edwards,                 wa s

   not    in the       vicinity.                  I returned            to    my     p o s i t i o n a n d at t h a t         time             the

   turnstiles          opened           and       fans     began        to    enter.

  At     around       2 p m ( 1400)          I was        aware     that       two       fans    had       been      brought              in

   through       the       gate        leading        to     the    North        stand        immediately              to m y         right.

   They were          in     possession              tff s e v e r a l       hundred        pounds         in    cash and             a

   number       of    tickets           for       the m a t c h     th a t     were       suspected             to   be     forgeries.

   They were          conveyed           to       the P o l i c e       room.

   A   short     time        after       this        as    I was        searching           a fan entering                  the

   turnstile          at     1.        1 heard        one     of    the       ticket collectors                     shout     from             the

   direction          of     turnstile             4 or 3       " H e ’s      got     no t i c k e t " .        I    turned        and          saw

   a young       lad       in a        blue       track      suit       running          from    that       direction             and          on

   seeing       me a t t e m p t i n g        to     run a w a y        f r o m me.
^   I detained            the    youth          who    wa s      in    possession                   of a       ticket          stub        which          he

    a greed Was           not    ha s      and after             obtaining                his       details          he    was        ejected             via

    the    North      stand          gate       which was             by    this          time       beginning             to       be     blocked

    by    large     numbers           of       fans.

    The    y o u t h was        e j e c t e d as       opposed             to    being          arrested             or     taken          to       the

    Police      r o o m as       it w a s        becoming             much       busier             and    I wa s         aware          that

    numberous         other          fans       were       causing          problems                in the          area       of     the

    turnstiles            by    jumping          over       them       or a t t e m p t i n g             to    enter          two       at     a

    time.      Had        I taken          any    other          action          it w o u l d         have          left       less        of a

    Police      presence             at    the    turnstiles.                    Youth          ejected?




    It w a s   getting           progressively                   more       and more                busier          at    a ll      the

    turnstile.             I had          to    intervene             several             times       between             turnstile                 1 and

    6 where        more        than       one    fan was          attempting                   to    enter          through           the

    turnstiles            together.              One       fat    fan,          30    years,          pushed             out     of

    turnstile         -    no    ticket.              He    had       tried          to    get       in w i t h          three        others          who

    had    tickets         and       had       entered.           He       was       extremely             drunk          and       hi s      three

    friends        were        also       intoxicated.                 Incidents                involved             fans        attempting                to

    pull    tickets            and    stubs       f rom the            turnstile                attendants.

    At    around 2.30pm               (1430)          I detained                a further             person who                 had       jumped

    fan a r o u n d       through          the    West        stand         (then          I r e m a i n e d at            this          po in t )        area

    along      with about             three       other          fans       who       had       been       escorted              to      this        point

    by o t h e r    officers,.             1347 Bungy,                1506 M a r s h            — E 2,         by    this        time         it was
.♦approximately 2 . 35pm                   (1435).

 As    I ha4 a p p ro a ch e d           the     area      behind          turnstiles                A    to G at             the       rear           of

 the    West      stand       I observed             about       10       persons             climbing             along          the       t o p of

 the    gate      between          turnstile          16 a n d        turnstile                A.

 These     fans        were    progressively                making             their          way    towards                the    r oo f s       of

 turnstiles            A to    G.        After       ejecting                        I was          concerned                for       the       few

 officers         working          at    these       turnstiles,                a    large          number             of    fans       who       were

 in a n a g g r e s s i v e        and     noisy mood were                     congregating                   around          turnstiles                    A

 to G a n d       the    fans       who     ha d     been       on    top       of       the       gate       earlier             were       by

 this    time      on    the       roof     of     turnstiles              A    to G a n d w e r e                 increasing                in

 numbers.

 The    fans      on    the    roof        were      waving          what       appeared             to       be       complete             tickets

 with attached            st u b s ,       they      began       to       jump       from          the    turnstile                roo f s        in

 increasing            numbers.            I was      by    th i s        time       on m y         own.           I    decided             to

 r e m a i n at    this       point       as     it w a s       appearing                to    be    having             greater             control

 problems         that    at       turnstiles           1 to         12 w h e r e         I had          been          earlier.

 I was    being         approachd           by     larger        groups             of    fans       some          of       whom       had

 climbed       the      outer       gate       and    gained          access             from       the       turnstile                r o ofs     at

 turnstiles            A to G.

 I can o n l y         recollect           seeing       two      or       three          uniform          officers                standing

 beside     the        closed main             gates       on    the       South          stand          road          side       of    the       West

 stand     entrance,           a    further          one    or       two       officers,             one       I think             was       a

 Sergeant         were    immediately                in f r o n t         of    turnstiles                A    to G .

 Numerous         fans    some          of w h o m w e r e       intoxicated were                         screaming                abuse          at

 me,    stating         that       people        were      being          crushed             to    death          outride             on

 Leppings         Lane    by       the     crowd.          At    this          time       1 was          frightened                for       my        ow n

 safety.

 Several       stated         that       it was       going          to    be a n o t h e r          Hyesel             Stadium             outside

 the    turnstiles            and       pleaded       that       the       main          gates       should             be    opened             to,

 save    lives.          I genuinely               believed           at       this       time       that          people          outside              an
•Leppings           Lane    were          in d a n g e r         of     dieing.         I tried             to     position myself

nearer         the       gate    and turnstiles.                                                                        M        *a r ‘3 e

number         of    fans       continually             abuse                           and        threats          towards           me.         I

observed            through          on e    of     the      turnstile,              I believe              turnstile             B , on the

West      stand          entrance           an    unconcscious                 young        lad a p p r o x i m a t e l y           11 y e a r s

of age.             He    was    dressed            in     red a n d          was    being         passed         over      the       heads           of

fans      outside          the       turnstiles              towards           the     South          stand        road     entrance.

 I wa s    by th i s        time          being       pushed            phys i cally            back     away       from     th e       gates

and    other         fans       were        approaching                 pleading        that          the    gates         should            be

opened.             Mature,          sober        men were              in t e a r s    pleading             that      children and

women were               being       crushed          to     death           outside.            Some       fans     who     were        more

sympathetic               stated          that      they         ha d    heard       other         fans      state         ouside            that

if t h e y      pushed          before           k ic k    off        and     caused        a    crush       the P o l i c e          would

have      to    let       them       in,     this         was     mentioned            by       one    fan a nd another                  with

him agreed,               all    the        fans     were         by     this       time        entering          through

turnstiles               A to    G    in a d i s t r e s s e d               state.

1 s a w one          man male,              white,         approximately                30 years,                5 ’S s l i m       bu il d ,

dark      hair,          black       moustache,              thin        facial        features,             he     entered           through

turnstile            E and       was        in a      collapsed               state     and        appeared          to be       suffering

from      che s t        crush       injuries.               As       I attempted               to a s s i s t      him      I sa w a n ol d

man    enter         through          these         s a me       turnstiles            and       lean       on t h e w a l l          gasping

for air,

I offered            to t a k e       the        injured man                 to a f i r s t        aid      post     but     he       ref-used

stating         that       he    would           be a l r i g h t        and wanted              to w a t c h       th e    match.

A number            of    fans who           were         milling            around     behind           the      West      stand again

started         shouting             at     me    on s e e i n g         the     apparently              i n j u r e d -''screaming               for

the    gates         to    o p en.

I believe            that       it w a s         sometime             around        2.50pm         (1430)         that       I was

standing            opposite          turnstile              A    in     line       with        the m a i n       gate       C

immediately alongside                            turnstile              G.      (Leading           onto      the     South          stand;          \

gates        mentioned             above       opened;!,:; ::tl_ b e 1 ieve              that       they       were     opened          by

P o 1ice officers                  whom       I had       seen     standing              near       them a short              time          before

As    s o o n as        the     gates         opened a           flood       of     fans       came       into       the     ground,

approximately 6                    to S wide,             they     rushed           towards          me       causing        me    to       run

to my        left       and     b a ck    towards           the    main       gate        above.

Although           it    seemed          l i ke a     long        time       th e    gates          were       only     opened          about

 1 minute          then       closed.            I assumed             that       all     the       fans       who    entered           I

would        guess       100       or E 0 0      perhaps           more       went        in the          direction           of the        West

stand        tunnel.            I do      not     recall           seeing any            Police           officers         at, the

mouth        of    the    tunnel          p ri o r    to     the       gates        being       opened.              I do     however

r e c al l    after       the       gates       had       closed        looking           towards             the    tunnel        entrance

and    one        blue    wooden          door       wa s    pulled          partly           across          and    the     other

opened,           there       were       no    fans       milling        about           or    crowded           into      the     mouth          of

the    tunnel.            X do       not       recall        whether          at     that       time          X could        see    the

grassed           area    of       the    pitch w hi c h           is    normally              visible          from       where        I was

standing.

Alt ho ug h most              of    the       fans    entered           in a        rush,       some          walked       in,     several

were     obviously              distre ss ed and                 appeared           to    be    suffering             from        breathing

difficulties.                   Again         I was       subjected           to a        torrent             of a b u s e    and       pleas

to    have        the    gates       opened again                 by    the       fans        who    had       just     entered.

They     stated          that       a l t h o u g h we       had       let    a     l ar g e    number           in th e      problem

was    just        as    ba d      and    again       reference              was     made       to       it    being       'Another

Hyesel        Stadium           outside’.

Again more              sympathetic              fa n s     were       arguing           on m y      behalf          that     they

shoulnd't           blame          me.        I was       asked        for    t he       name       of    the       officer        in

 charge       and       the     name      of m y C h i e f         Constable.                  The       fans       were     extremely

 distressed             and     from what            I could           see    I feared that                    someone        would

 surely       die       outside.              I could        see       fans       continuing              to     climb       the    gates

<*and f a l l i n g         through             the    turnstiles                  at    A to G,            some       in     injured           states.

 M e n t i o n was          made          by o ne      of     these          fans,         of     a    public          house where                  fans
                                                                                                                                  " i


 had     been       drinking                shortly          before          the        g a me    called          The       Bee         Hive.        This

 public        house          was         not     known       to me          prior         to     being          mentioned               by    this

 fan.         To    date         1 do        not      know     its          location             although           I presume                 it must-

 be    reasonably                near        the      stadium           at     Hillsborough.

 I was        busy      dealing              with      these           fans        and     trying           to    console               and appease

 them,        when      again             about       3 or 4 m i n u t e s               later,            the    same        gate           opened

 again,        and a l tho ug h                 further        fans          entered             it w a s        not     in as           many       numbers

 At    this        p o i nt      I recall             a uniformed                  PC    calling            to me        from           the    gate       and

 asking        me      to     help          push      th e   gate           closed,         which           I did.            I have

 considered             this          matter          and am           unsure           whether            I assisted             this         PC    to

 close        the      gate          on     the    first       or       second           occasion.

 During        this t i m e               I was       aware        of       tw o    stewards               to m y      left       wearing            the

 flourescent                waistcoats,                one     of       them        mentioned               to me        that           he    did    not

 know where             all          the     fans      would           go as        the     West           stand       must       be         full.

 Also        whilst         th e      crowd        entered             on    the        first         occasion           I believe              t h at       I

 saw     the       juvenile                           whom     I had           ejected            from       the       North            stand       g a te

 at a r o u n d 2 p m            ( 1 40 0 ) ,      he w a s        in th e          centre            of    the     crowd w it h               other

 youths        who      were          running          hard.            I formed            th e       impression              that           this

 group        did      not       have        tickets.              A    large           number         obviously              did and           on

 entering           several               attempted           to       give        me    their         tickets           to    remove           the

 stub.         Du e     to       the        circumstances                   several          injured             persons          staggering

 around and             few          officers          I did           not     attempt            to       take     tickets              from       them.

 Had     I done         so       I would           most       certainly                 have      been       pushed           out        of    the     way

 b y the       bulk         of       th e    crowd       and       would           have      impaired             their        entry           which

 would        h av e    defeated                the    object           of     the       exercise            that        is    relieving               the

 pressure           outside.

 GROUND        INCIDENT

 After        the      gates          had       closed        on       the     second            occasion           it      seemed            strangely

♦ quiet      in the           vicinity              of    the     turnstiles.                   I was       relieved                to    find       that,

 most      of     the m o r e         aggressive                fans       had       gone       and       I looked around                      to    see

 if    I could         see       any       of my          colleagues              or      other         officers.               There          were

 few    officers              around.               After       about       5 minutes                I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y                10 to

 15 u n i f o r m e d         constables                 run    past       me     from        th e      direction              of    the       North

 stand.          Amongst             them       I s a w DC            T u r n e r , DC F r i e n d , DC              Titterton             and

 other       officers            from          my    serial           (S e r i a l     11).          They were            running          in        the

 direction           of       the     Police             control        r o o m at         the       side       of    th e      West       st a n d.

 At    this      time         I was        unaware             of w h a t       the       incident          was       and       on       joining

 these       officers            running             towards          the       Police          control          room          I was       informed

 that      it w a s       a    pitch           invasion.

 1' wa s     not    aware            of    the       time       and     I did          not      realise          that          the       game       was

 in f a c t      underway.                 On arrival                 at    the        side        of     the    West          stand       an

 internal          dividing               gate      at     the        rear        of the        P o lice room             was       opened           and

 we    all      ha d a c c e s s          to    the       side     of      th e      South         st a n d .        On    entering             the

 first       aisle        leading              onto       the     pitch,          I was         aware       that          no    players             were

 on the         pitch.           I could             hear       fans       state          t ha t     the    teams          had       just       left

 the    pitch.

 On    looking         across             towards          th e    front          of      the      West     stand          to m y         left       I

 could       see P o l i c e          officers             in f r o n t         of     th e     security             fencing             in the

 area      behind         the        goal       post,          numerous           fans        were        scaling          th e      perimeter

 fence       and     dropping              over          onto     the      pi t c h .         It     became          obvious             that       it

 was    not a        pitch           invasion,             people were                 staggering               from       the       perimeter

 fence       being        assisted              by P o l i c e        officers             and       other       fa n s .           They were

 falling         onto         th e    grassed             playing          area        in the           vicinity           of       the    goals.

 Women,         ol d men,            young          children          were        sitting            crying,          some          having

 difficulty            breathing.

 Togther         with my             colleagues,                1 went          directly             to    the       area       at       the    rear

 of    the      goal      po s t s.            To m y      left a          perimeter               fence        gate       some          4 ’ wide         wa

 open,       between           this        area and             the     area         to    the       r i gh t    of       the       goal       posts       .1
*could       see       a number          of     obviously                dead    bodies,           young           women       and     mainly

 teenage         male       fans.          They       were          pressed       firmly           against           the       perimeter

 fence        in a s t a n d i n g         position.                 I estimated              initially about                     20

 obviously             dead     persons.              At       this       time    officers             were         climbing           the

 perimeter             fence       and     assisting                in    pulling          bodies         and       injured           out.     1

 immediately              went      to     the       open       gate       to m y       left       and        joined a Police

Sergeant           (I . D . ? ? ? ? ) .         He    was       attempting              to    pull        a    large          unconscious

male        person        out      of    the        gate.           This    p e r s o n w as        trapped              by    his     legs.

He    was      wearing          a white/light                   T shirt,          heavy          bu i l d,         blue       jeans     and

short        fair       hair,       despite           attempts             he    wa s      jammed         ti g h t .          Alongside            hi m

was     a    conscious             young        woman          with       long    brown          ha i r       slim       b ui l d ,

approximately                 20    to     30 years.                 She    was       screaming               in    pain a n d         trapped

by    her      waist       like         th e    unconscious                man    by       her     side.            She       could     not        be

pulled         f r ee    at     this       time.           I then          became          aware       that         at     least       another

8 or        10 b o d i e s      were       enmeshed             and       piled       up     behind           them       directly         behind

the     gate       most       were       blue        and       appeared          dead.           The      crowd          were     s t i ll

surging         forward            and     despite             shouting          at     them       to m o v e        back,        they

obviously              could       not     hear       from          the    noise        being       made           mostly       from      the

 rear       by a n g r y a n d          aggressive              fans.           I could          see      DC       1177 Davis,            he was

 inside        this       area      behind           the       bodies.           He     had      lost         his    helmet.            Hi s

tunic, wa s            opened.

 I could         see      what      appeared              to    be a P o l i c e           officer            directly          b e h i n d DC

Davis.          He      had     been       lifted          physically             and        dropped           head       first        ovetr the

 Through         exhaustion              I wa s      unable           to    continue              the       r esuscitation and                I was

 relieved         by     someone           else      who       took        over.

 During       t hi s     time        1 was         observing           a young             Policewoman              (shoulder              length

 black      hair        b u s y at       bottom).              Sh e    had       been       resuscitating                 a young           man,

male,       white,        £0*s,          green       T shirt           (tennis             style):,         blue     jeans*           6'    tall,

 slim      bu i l d .     At       one     point         he    seemed            to    have reco v er e d            and started

 breathing.              I recalll             thinking             that         she       was doing          a g r e a t jo b

 bringing         him around.                  She       had    placed           him       on his        s id e     in    the     recovery

 position.

As a       result        of m y a t t e m p t e d             resuscitation                 I had        been       left        dizzy       and

after       a few mo m e n t s             I turned            to     see    that          the    above        described              fan    had

stopped          breathing            again.             I then went              over       to       her    and wit h           her

assistance              I again          turned          him    onto        his    back,          cleared           his    airway           and

together          we     administered                cardiac           and       artificial              resuscitation.                     After

a fe w m i n u t e s          we    were       joined          by a D o c t o r            and a       nurse        who     took       over

with       the    aid     of       an a m b u l a n c e        resuscitation                 mask       and       oxygen         tank.

fan with          the m o u s t a c h e ,           he    had       been     removed             by    someone           and     presumably

taken       to    the S p o r t s          Hall      where          ambulances              had       by t h e n     arrived.

 I was      also        aware       whilst          resuscitating                 the       first        fan      that     a     reporter

 instantly          offensive.                 He    wa s      casually           walking             past     myself           and    other

 officers         and      fans       who      were       struggling              to       resuscitate              casualties.               He

was       adjusting           his     tie      as    if to          prepare           to    be    filmed          and appeared               to

 be   looking           for    any       or    a    certain           senior          police          officer.

As a       result        r o ar s     of      anger       could        be    heard          from       fans       who     were        likewise

angered          and     disgusted             by    his       behaviour.                  I was       aware        that        several
*Pplice        officers          removed          them       from    the       pitch.

 After     this       I looked             around       to    see    if    I could          assist           anyone         else       but

 by     this    time       everything             was     under      control,

 I made        my way       towards             where     the      bodies       had      been       recovered,               at    this

 time     a number          of L i v e r p o o l        fans       were    standing            around mainly                 at    the

 rear     of    all       the    bodies          had     been      removed and Police                     officers           were

 beginning           to    collect          clothing          and    personal            i t em s    dropped           by    the

 injured        and       deceased.              As    they were          doing       so    I saw a y oung                  Liverpool

 fan a p p r o x i m a t e l y        16 y e a r s      walk       through       the       area where             a barrier             had

 collapsed           behind          and    to    the      left     of    the      goal     post        he    looked         around

 and     then     quickly            snatched          up a       programme          which       had o b v i o u s l y        been

 dropped        by    one       of    the       injured       or    dead.        He      quickly          put     it    in his          back-

 pocket        and    ran       back       up    to    the    left       hand      side     of      the W e s t        stand       to

 join     other       young          Liverpool           fans.       I went          after       him and          asked       him       if

 he w a n t e d      to    steal       anything            else     from       the    dead.          He      took      the

 programme           from       his    pocket          and    put    it    back       d o w n at m y          request          left      the

 stand     a r ea.

 As     instructed          together             with      other     officers            I attended             at     a de-brief

 in the        North       stand a short                 time      later       before       returning             to W o o d s e a t s

 Police        station          via a P SV            f r o m C l a y w h e e 1s     lane.

 The     bodies       h a d all        been       removed and             I walked          with another                officer          to

 th e    Sports       Hall       where          I was      approached           by        the       elderly parents                of a

 Doctor        who    had       been       assisting          with       the    injured.             They       a s k e d if       t

 could      locate         him.         I enquired            at    the    Sports          Hall/Police               rooni/First A i d

 In m y    opinion          there          appeared          to    be a    lack       of    first         aid     equipment/

 airways,         oxygen         etc.           The    atmosphere          on      the     pitch          could      only     be

 described           as    totally          uncontrollable                chaos       due       to the        incredable

 numbers        of d e a d       and       injured,          the    situation            was      not     helped        by    the
       cpntinual interference                           of    press       photographers                    and    camera            crew and          the

       In    respect         of    the       perimeter             fencing,          I ha d         great        difficulty            in

       assisting           the     evacuation                of    persons          from       the     West       stand         due    to a w a l l

       some    3 ’ high           before          you       reach       the    bottom          of    the     gate.             It    had a        ditch

       like    effect         in w h i c h         people          collapsed             and    could        not          be   seen    through

       the    fe n c e .

            Secretary,
            Liverpool City Council




            Dear Councillor Chase

            Following our conversation of 18 May respecting permission sought
            by you to attend the West stand or Sheffield Wednesday Football
            Club,  I am yet to receive a ’fa xe d ’ letter from you in order that
            I csn glV6 written sutho^ity 35 I ©xplsinsd#

            T have learned today from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club that
            you have visited the ground and in particular the West stand
            without my written authority.

            Can J remind you that access has been restricted by order of Lord
            Justice Taylor and any contravention of those directions may be
             considered a contempt.

             In view of the fact that you have taken this action into your own
             hands without ray written authority it is necessary to interview
             those who attended without that permission to discuss the purpose
             of.the visit and the events that took place during the visit.

             I shall    be appointing a senior officer from my Liverpool office        to
             contact    you on Monday 22 May.

             I trust    in future that you will coipply with Lord Justice Taylors
             directions on this matter.




                                  Unstable

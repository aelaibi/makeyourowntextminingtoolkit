taking      place at H i l l s b o r o u g h and whe n         I heard these           calls    I

i mm ed i a te l y    thought     to mys elf       that   there was so met hin g

w r o n g , although        I had no        idea of the       nature      of the      incident

at this      time.



Ambulance man                     and I took         the transfer         to Royal

H a l l a m s h i r e as q u i c k l y as   possible,      and as we were head ing

to the hospital             we heard on the veh ic le              radio that         control

was    reque st in g all        vehicles wi t h patie nts               on board to off

load as q u i c k l y as        possible at          the i r des tination.            I knew at

this time       that      there was a major            incident         taking   place

because      such m e s s a g e s are       very     rarely given.            Once    the

patient      had been off          loaded at the transit wa rd at the RHH,

were t r a v e l li n g al ong P e n i s t o n e Rd there were quite heavy

traffic        queues.          We used the           central    re se rv at io n to get       past

a number of vehicles                   and e n te re d the gr ou nd at           point A

by a police of fi cer                 to a point m a r k e d B on the a t t a c h e d          plan.

We    could go no further                    because of the number           of ve hi cl es an d

people at this             point.



I im m ed i a te l y saw a casualty being                      carried out       on an

advertising             board t h r ou gh the gap betwen the N o r t h S t a n d

an d the S p i o n Hop.               I got out        of the vehi cle an d by the time

I had made my way to the back,                          the    rear doors were a l r e a d y

open and                         and     1    took    the    ca su alt y off the

a dv e r t i s i n g    board and       put him        i m m e d ia te ly onto the    cot

inside the vehicle.                    I began to exa mi ne          this male       casualty,

whilst a se c o n d            ca su alt y was        put    into the vehicle        on the

se co nd     cot.        B y this      time     I had d e ci de d that       the first

casualty was             dead.        The sec ond       casua lty was also male,            but

he was a l i v e a n d          in a very        poor       condition.     He was a c t u a l l y

displaying             signs    of brain damage,              pr ob abl y as a    result    of

hypoxia,         be cause       he had di l a t e d         pupils and his       left a r m was

twitching,             which    ind ic at ed     possi ble      cerebral     irritation.

The    cas ua l t y was         breathing,           he had a good       p u l s e , but was

clearly un co ns cio us.                I d e ci de d as a ma tt e r       of    pr io ri ty to

treat      this        casualty.



There was an at te mp t                to put a third           casua lty on the

       casualty.         I i ns ti nc ti ve ly to ld                            that we       should go

       the N o r t h e r n General       whi lst      I t r ea te d the sec ond               casualty.

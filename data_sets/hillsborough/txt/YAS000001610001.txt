                        states :
1.   I was born on 29th June, 1944.

2.   I am one of       four Standards    and Efficiency Officers with
     SYMAS, which position involves me in being responsible for

     liaison     between      the Ambulance    Service    and    the    hospitals
     within    the     SYMAS area.       My    own    responsibility       is    in

     relation     to    the   Barnsley Area    Health     Authority      and    the
     Northern General Hospital in Sheffield.

3.   I joined the Ambulance Service in May 1966, initially as an

     ambulanceman,      then a Shift Leader (a post which no longer
     exists),     I    then became    a Control        Officer,        thereafter

     Planning      Superintendent        and   I     became     Standards       and
     Efficiency Officer in October, 1988.              I am based at Control
     in Rotherham.

4.   I was not on duty on Saturday 15th April, 1989.                     I called

     into Control by chance shortly after 1500 to collect some
     items that I had left at work the day before.                      As I was
     making my way into the Control building,                 Mr Alan Hopkins

     came rushing out of the building in order to speak to Roger

     Morley, who was standing near to me.                Mr Hopkins informed
     Mr Morley that there was trouble at Hillsborough.

5.   I carried on into the Control building to inform the Control

     Superintendent,       Ray Clarke,   that I was in the building.

     This is standard procedure if one enters the building when

     off duty.         Mr Clarke told me that an incident was taking

     place at Hillsborough.           At this point in time,            a lot of

     'phones were ringing continuously,            and I immediately began




                                       22f
to answer some calls.                      It became quickly apparent that
there was a Major Incident taking place at Hillsborough.                                    I
asked Ray Clarke if I could do anything to assist, and in
the meantime kept taking calls.

As far as possible, I kept a handwritten log, covering the

major tasks           that       I dealt with during               the    course of the

afternoon and early evening.                    I was also aware of the SYMAS
Major Incident Plan and its general workings.

Ray Clark quickly decided to open a separate Incident Room
up,      next   door to the Control               Room,       for    the purposes of
solely dealing with the Hillsborough Incident.                                    Mr Clark

took over the running of the Incident so I remained in the

Control Room and took charge of all emergencies and other

incidents            that        were     not   otherwise           connected            with

Hillsborough.              As it transpired, a number of calls relating

to the Hillsborough Incident continued to be received in the
Control Room rather than the separate Incident Room.

I decided that I would personally take as many calls from
the police           as    I could handle in order to give some coÂ­

ordination to what was taking place,                           rather than two or

three      Control        Assistants       taking   separate             calls    from    the
police.

I   do    recall          that    at     some   stage    the       police        asked    for

confirmation              of     which    Hospitals          the    casualties           from

Hillsborough would be taken to.                     I informed the police that

the Northern General Hospital would be the main hospital for

transfer        of    casualties          because       it    was    closest       to     the
football ground.         I also recall that Police Force Control

requested medical assistance at the ground at some stage.

These calls should all be logged.                  Sometime thereafter, I

received a further call from the police informing me that
they had notified the Northern General Hospital and Royal

Hallamshire Hospital to expect casualties.                   I am quite sure
that these hospitals had already been notified by ourselves

to expect casualties.          As the Incident developed and the

Northern     General     and   Royal       Hallamshire       Hospitals     were

unable to take all casualties.               I informed the police that

I would inform all hospitals necessary, which included the
Barnsley District General Hospital and Rotherham District

General      Hospital,     and    gave      both    hospitals         as   much
information as possible regarding the incident.                      This call

should also be logged.

When   the    police   informed       me   that    they    required    medical

assistance at the ground,         I immediately rang the Northern
General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals to inform them that

medical teams were required at Hillsborough, and that SYMAS

vehicles would be sent up to both hospitals in order to pick

up the medical teams for transportation to Hillsborough.                      I

provided     similar     information        to    the     Barnsley    District

General Hospital and in fact informed all three hospitals

that we were dealing with a large number of casualties with
crush injuries.

Thereafter,    I continued       to    co-ordinate        the   Control    Room

dealing with a large number of calls.                   It is difficult to
     recollect the specific calls without                  reference to my own
     log,    although as       the   Incident      progressed,      the calls    did

     begin to slow down.             At the same time, the staff In the

     Control    Room still had to deal with all other emergency

     calls     that    were    not    concerned       with    the    Hillsborough
     Incident.             I   continued      to    work     in   Control      until

     approximately 2240, at which point in time I telephoned Mr
     Don    Page,     to   inform    him    that    somebody      from   the   Trent

     Regional Health Authority wished to speak to him.                         After
    making this call, I left for home.

                -iM
Dated this            day of               1989.

            SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

            Thank you for your prompt response to my letter of concern about the
            South Yorkshire Police initial submissions.

            I have noted the contents and have passed a copy to Mr P Wright, Chief
            Constable, South Yorkshire Police. I believe there is no need for any
            further action and am grateful to you for the explanation.

I attended Hillsborough Football Stadium on Saturday, 15th April 1989, as a

result of Operation Support.

P.hrvptl v aftnr rr>v arrival I entered the gymnasium which was being used as a

                          Dn-Hng the early stages of the incident I requested a

Major Incident Box to be brought to the gym and assisted with the

identification of medical teams and doctors.           At that time I allocated the job

of assisting Officers accompanying the deceased to P.C. Pears,           ’E l ’,

P.C. Newbold, ’E l ’ and P.C. Pendriss,      ’B1 ’ .   These Officers later, with the

assistance of D.C. Titterton,       ’E 2 ’, were subsequently directed by me to log

and record items of property which had been brought to the gym as found on the

pitch.     These items were brought in numerous plastic bags and the description

was recorded in detained property book obtained from the Major Incident Box.

The property was subsequently taken to Hammerton Road Police Station.

These Officers, under my supervision, then searched the bodies and recorded

all items found with and on the bodies and recorded it in ’Property Other

Th-.r! PnupH r‘r.~kn'_   This property was either returned to relatives against

         ure             gc-Ar.^1 iy taken by the Officer accompanying the body to

the Medico Legal Centre.

All records of the property were left at the gym, along with other records

which had been collated by D.I. Charles.

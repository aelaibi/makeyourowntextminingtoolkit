            On     15th April          1989    (150 4 8 9 )      Liverpool               were      to         play N o t t i n g h a m F or res t

           at H i l l s b o r o u g h    Stadium           in S h e f f i e l d .          I had              got    a £6 L e p p i n gs        Lane

            terrace       ticket        and    travelled           to      the      game     with             my    brother      and    two      work

            mates.




            Further       to m y a l r e a d y       completed             questionnaire,                         I can a d d    that     1 was

            separated         from my         friends         outside           the      ground           and was          in the L e p p i n g s

After     the      players       left       the       field        that     afternoon,               I waited a             few

minutes       and      about     3.15pm          (1515)          I walked          from       the       terrace         towards          the

toilets       at    the    rear       of    the W e s t          Stand.            As    I got          near      the    m e n ’s

toilets       situated          in the          area,       I sa w a m b u l a n c e s         with        lights        flashing

and    sirens       sounding,          they were             outside         the L e p p i n g s           Lane     terrace             area.

When    1 looked          I saw       several          men       sitting       on       the    ground          with      their

backs    to      the     building          wal l ,     all       struggling             to    regain         their       breath.




I saw     p e o ple,      fans,       carrying             injured        people         out       of    the      tunnel,

from    the      terracing.                On    the       ground        scattered a b o u t , were                     the

bodies     of a b o u t       between           12 a n d     twenty         bodies,           some       were      injured

but    some      appeared        to me          to    be    dead.           I had        never          seen a dea d             body

till    that       day.




I can     remember         amongst          these          m e n a man,        a white             mal e ,     late      5 0 "s a n d

e a r l y 6 0 vs,      grey     bushy       hair,          with a        lar g e     nose,         he w as        a big man,             had

the    appearance          of    being          tall       and     heavy.            H is     face       was      grey      c o l o ur e d .

I believe          he w o r e    a white             *T*    sh i r t .       I d o n ’t t h i n k            he    had      shoes        on    I

can't     remember         the    rest          of    his     clothing         in d e t a i l .




I do    remember          a youngish             looking           lad,    a teenager,                  someone         h ad     put a

coat    o ve r     his    head.            I n e ve r       sa w    his     f ac e      he    ha d      on a      pair      of     blue       or

black    t r ac k      suit     bottoms          and a        pair       of w h i t e        training          sh o e s .




I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r      the    others,             but     1 believe            these        two     were       dead.            I

couldn't         find     them    so       left       the    ground about                3.45pm          (1545)         and      stood        in

the    street       outside.               I met       my    brother         outside           the       ground about               5pm

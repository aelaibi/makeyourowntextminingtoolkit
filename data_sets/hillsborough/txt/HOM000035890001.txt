about the tragic events at Hillsborough.

Where someone claims negligence, as in the Hillsborough case, it is for the courts to
decide whether damages are payable, taking into account all the relevant circumstances.
Generally it will not be appropriate to exclude people from bringing claims on the basis of
their occupation.

In this case the handling of the claims for financial compensation by some police officers
involved in the tragedy is a matter entirely for the South Yorkshire Police Authority, and
consequently it is not open to Ministers to intervene in an issue which properly is being
dealt with by the police authority and, as necessary by the courts.

As you will be aware, the Home Secretary has undertaken to consider carefully the
points which were made in the programme Hillsborough, and the representations which
have been made to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has emphasised that
he would not take the decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would need to be
convinced that it would be in the public interest to do so and that it would stand a
chance of providing a better understanding than there is at present of what happened on
that terrible day.

In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider whether there is any new
evidence; he will also consider whether that evidence appears to be of such significance
that had it been put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome of the
Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide the Home Secretary
with a detailed report of all the points raised by the programme. The Home Secretary
has promised that he will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon as
he has been able to consider all the issues.

                                          (Full oddrcsses, If necessary'
Thank you         for your        letter of    23 December to Michael                 Howard,
enclosing one           from
                                                             about the tragic events
at Hillsborough.


Where someone claims negligence, as in the Hillsborough case, it
is for the courts to decide whether damages are payable, taking
into account all the relevant circumstances. Generally it will
not be appropriate to exclude people from bringing claims on the
basis of their occupation.


In   this     case          the    handling    of     the     claims      for     financial
compensation by some police officers involved in the tragedy is
a matter entirely for the South Yorkshire Police Authority, and
consequently it is not open to Ministers to intervene in an issue
which properly is being dealt with by the police authority and,
as necessary by the courts.


As   you    will       be    aware,   the    Home    Secretary      has    undertaken      to
consider carefully the points which were made in the programme
Hillsborough, and the representations which have been made to him
by the bereaved families and by others. He has emphasised that
he would not take the decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but
would      need    to       be   convinced    that    it    would   be    in    the   public
interest to do so and that it would stand a chance of providing
a better understanding than there is at present of what happened
on that terrible day.


In   coming       to    his      decision    the    Home    Secretary      will    consider
whether there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether
that evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been
put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome
of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been
different.


The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide
the Home      Secretary with a detailed                    report   of    all   the points
raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that he
will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon
as he has been able to consider all the issues.

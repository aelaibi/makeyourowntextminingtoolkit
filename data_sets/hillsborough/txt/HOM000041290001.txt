DELETED:-

[“I also felt in relation to the entrance outside Leppings Lane end that there should have been some
sort of semi-sterile area. We, that is, Rotherham officers, had this particular duty for the F. A.Cup
semi-final in 1987, which was played between Leeds United and Coventry City”.] (p.263)

“My overall observations of the disaster will take many, many years to come to terms with. One
thing that has gnawed at me, was feeling so useless, people were crying for help and we could do
nothing. As part of my normal duty, I work the police control at Millmoor, and I fully appreciate the
problems of working a football match control.
But only one thing has concerned me, was that the pure location of the control Box at Hillsborough
overlooks the area where the tragedy took place. Were not the officers appreciative of the
developing situation? What was the feed back from the officers working the perimeter of the pitch.
Couldn’t they see the developing crush on the terraces?”.(p267-268)

In the “Scrutiny” Report, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith comments only upon the deletion of the first
two sentences above. (P.321-322) He points out that the solicitors for South Yorkshire Police had
also advised the deletion of the following paragraph:
“On this occasion we kept the crowds back outside the metal railings and gates to allow myself and
other officers to carry out searches etc. Also there seemed to be a general lack of information
coming from within the ground from ground control via the radio or public address system either
giving information to us, or information and requests etc, to the crowd.”

He excuses the deletion of reference to PC Ramsden’s experience at the 1987 semi-final, stating that
the substance of what happened was retained, as the previous paragraph was not, after all, deleted.
However, anyone reading the amended report in its entirety, would not identify the fact that this
officer was on duty at the 1987 semi-final when a semi-sterile area was created to prevent congestion
in Leppings Lane.

The deletion is even more critical when one considers the removal of facts from PC Brookes
statement (p. 107) where he asserts that at the 1987 semi-final the pens were filled sequentially and
the centre pens were closed prior to the kick off as both were full.

These omissions are further compounded by the wide scale-scale deletions of officers’ experience in
1987 as to the central pens being closed off. (For example, p89;p94)

     pub.        They    quietened                 down       and       asked       where    else          they     could        get       a

     drink.        We    told          them        the       best       way    was    to    make       their        way     down       to       the

     ground,       but       I must           add       at    this       time       selected          people        who     were       suitable

     were    allowed          entry           into       the       public          house.        We    then       returned            to       our

     position       at       the       Station.

     We    then    received              a    radio          message          for    our    serial          to    attend         at    a

     Supermarket             on    a     side       road          about       40G    yards       from       our     position.                  The

     general       message             was     "Problems                with       supporters          -    drinking         on       the

     streets’.           Along           with       15       other       officers          and    a Sherpa            van    attended.

     All    quiet       on    arrival,              but       a    large       amount       of    Liverpool              supporters              in

     the    excess       of       150        sat    on       the    grass          banking       outside          shops      drinking

     from    the    cans,          they        were          noisy,       but       caused       no    re a l     problems.                We    then

     returned       to       our       position              at    the    Station.           Whilst          walking         down          the

     road    with       PC    Cammock,              we       were       approached          by a       group        of     Liverpool

     supporters          three          adults           one       of    which       was    wearing          a    Glasgow         Rangers

     shirt.        With       them           was    one       small       boy.        They       were       carrying         a    fold          up

     stool.        We    advised              them       that       they       would       probably          not      be    allowed             in

     with    this       stool.               They       said       they       nad    only    taken          this      to    the       game       so

     the    little       lad       could           see       onto       the    pitch,       and       they       agreed      to       take       it

     back    to    their          motor        vehicle.

     By    this    time       I saw           large          numbers          of    Liverpool          supporters            making             their

     way    down    the       main           road,       carrying             packs    of    beer       and       lager.          They          were

     very    boisterous                s h o u t ing         and    sing i n g .

     I noticed          one    youtn           in       particular             about       18-19      years         about        5'<?"         tail,

     heavily       built       wearing              Union          Jack       shorts,       was       singing         louder          than

     anyone       around          him.         He       definitely             appeared          worse       for      drink.           His
mates     appeared             to       be    telling       him       to     keep         quiet.           They       then    moved        on

down     the    main        road.

 I then       heard       a message                over    the    radio           ’A s s i s t a n c e      requirsd          outside

Public        House,       Neeps             End,    PC    having           problems’.

Mot     knowing          any     areas         of    Sheffield              I asked         PC    Cammock             was    it    close         i.

he     informed       me       it w a s n ' t .

At     approximately                2.00       pm    the    train           carrying            the    supporters             arrived.

On     leaving       station             arrangements             made          to    hold       them       together          outside

the     public       house          (name       riot k n o w n ) .           The      supporters                all    age    groups,

both     sexes,       were          very       well       behaved.              No    sieging          or       chanting,          no

evidence        of       drink,          made       their       way        from      off    the       Platform          down       the

steps.         We    were        then         joined       by    two       mounted          officers,             I believe             from

South     Yorkshire.

The    supporters              were          held    for    approximately                   5 minutes             in    the       small

triangular           area       outside             the    public          house.

1 noticed           that       two      men     at    the       rear       of     uhe      supporters             were       carrying           ^

urns.     We        were       then          instructed          to    escort             the    supporters             to    t he

football        ground.              This       was       contrary          to       the    order          and    also       it w a s

rather    unusual              considering                the    supporters                were       so    quiet      and        well

behaved.

We    escorted        the       supporters                down    the       main        road,      arriving            outside           t he

Leppings       Lane        entrance            at     approximately                  2.15        pm.        No    problems

experienced              with        the      supporters              from        leaving         the       station          to    arrivii

outside       the     ground.

They    then    made        their            way     to    the   queues           that          were       forming       outside          the

turnstile       area,          outside             Leppings           Lane.

Already       there        was      a    large        amount          of     suppor t e r s outside the                      ground        bs.

this    was    not       unusual             considering              it     was      a    Semi Final.                I was

approached          by     several            supporters          at         different times                     and   asked a

question       *We       live       in D e r b y s h i r e       purchased                tickets          at    Mnt.t.innham_______

 advised          them       that      they        must       stand       in a r e a s      to    where       the       tickets          are

 allocated.              1 was         then        instructed             by    Inspector             Ellis       to    move

 supporters             standing             on    pavements             across       the    road          from    Leppings            Lane

 instructing             them       that          if    they       had    a    ticket       to    make       their       way       into        t>

 ground       if    no       ticket          to    go    home.

We     were       receiving            feedback           that       tickets          were       being       sold       outside          a     pi

 end    of    Leppings            Lane        (name       not       known)       and      also        that    forged          tickets

 had    been       produced            but        I myself          never       saw    any       forged       tickets.

2910,        2969,       -1679,        451        and    myself          were    patrolling                area    of    pavement             or

the     bridge          generally             moving          supporters             along.           We    spoke       to    one

elderly        man       (grey         hair,           wearing      a     light       brown       Crcmbie          jacket          aged

about        65-70),         numerous              supporters             approached             him       asking       him    f or

 'spares'.              I said         to     him       "What      do     they       mean    by       spares*.          He     said

 'They're          asking         me    if        I'm    selling          tickets'.              In    fact       several

supporters           asked          this          elderly       man      for     spares,          evidently             they       had

traveiled          without             tickets.

By    this     time      approximately                    2.35      pm    the        numbers          of   people       outside              Lhe:

turnstiles           were         growing.               What      seems        strange       there          didn't         appear        to

any    Policemen             in    the       immediate             vicinity          of     the       turnstiles,             to    create

a    small    sterile             area       between          the       queyeing          supporters           and      the        actual

turnstile.              There          was    no        definite         queues.            With      2910     we      went        amongst

this    crowd        outside            the       turnstiles             to    assist        in       forming       some       kind       of

order.        The       numerous             times       we     were      asked       by     Liverpool            supporters

    Which    is    the       North       Stand'           'Which         is    Leppings           Lane      standing           area'.

'Which       is    the       West       Stand"          and     'Which          is   the    South          Stand*.           There        die

appear       to    be    any       clear          signs       to    instruct          the     fans         where       to    go.         At

this    Lime       I saw          outside          the    Leppings             Lane       entrances          Superintendent

Marshall          and    a    Chief          Inspector             (name       not    known        to      me).
 a man     pushing             a wheelchair,                   who       requested             assistance                to    get       through

 the     crowd       into          the       North       Stand.

 We    escorted        him          over          to    PC    Rose       and    PC       Morton          and    they          took       over,

 believe        they       managed                to    get    him       into    the          ground.

 There     seemed          a       general             complaint          from       Liverpool                supporters             of    the

 size     of    the    crowds                gathering             and    the    slowness                in    being          dealt       with

 entering        at    the          turnstiles.

 One     middle       aged          Liverpool                supporter          came          up    to    me    and       mentioned          in

  pointed       out    that             they       don't       arrive          all       at    the       same       time.

 The     tiae    now       about             2.50       pm.        I was       surprised             to       see    a    large          amount       c

                      climbing                onto       the       wall    above          the       turnstiles.                 I mentioned

,Othis    to    PC    Cammock,                and       also       that    they          seemed          to    wait       several          seconc

 before        jumping             off       the       wall    into       the    ground.

 A    Police     Officer                1 believe             an    Inspector             then       appeared             on    the       wall    ti-

 climbing        ceased             but       he       was    lifting          small          children          from          the    developir

 crush     to    safety.

 Again     myself          and          PC    Cammock          went       to    give          what       assistance             we       could,

 and     I myself          could             feel       the    force       of    the          crowd       and       I withdrew             furthe

 back     towards          the          road.

 I seemed        to    recollect                   earlier          hearing          a    radio          message          requesting

 Public        transport                to    be       stopped       from       travelling                along          Leppings          Lane

 but     I saw       the       buses          were       still       moving          through             the    crowd,          forcing          the

 over     towards          the          turnstiles             in    the       bottleneck                area       outside          Leppings

 Lane.         I also          felt          in    relation          to    the       entrance             outside             Leppings       Lane

 end     that    there             should          have       been       some    sort          of    semi-stsrile                   area.        We

 that     is,    Rotherham                   Officers,             had    this       particular                duty       for       the    F.A.

 Cup     Semi    Final             in    1987,          which       was    played             between          Leeds          United and

On    this      occasion          we    kept          the       crowds             back    outside             the       metal       railings

and      gates       to    allow       myself           and      other             officers             to    carry       out       searches

et c .      Also         there    seemed          to       be    a       general          lack          of    information                coming

from      within          the    ground          from       ground             control             via       the    radio       or       the

public         address          system,          either          giving             information                to    us,       or

information               and    requests             etc.,          to     the         crowd.

The      mood       of    the    crowd       by       this       time          was       growing             mors    volatile             but         no

evidence            of    violence          towards             us,       but       they       were          continuing             to    push.                      t

Land      Rover          containing          a    P.C.          which          was       parked          to    the       extreme          left             of

the      turnstile          area       began          to    edge          in       s l o w l y 9 in a n        attempt          to       slow          dowi

the      movement          of    the     crowd.             He       then          had    to       stop       because          of    the         sheer

weight         of    numbers.           He       then       left          tne       position             in    the       cab    and       standing

on    the      step       was    shouting             loudly             for       the    supporters                to    stop       pushing,

but      the    crowd       appeared             no t      to    hear          this,          or    take       no    notice.

Inspector            Ellis       then       appeared             with          a    megaphone/hailer                      and       began            to

shout       'Liverpool            supporters,                   please             stop       pushing'             this    was       repeated

several         times.

At    this      stage       I didn't             see       anything                to    indicate             the    impending

disaster            even    though          there          was       a    large          crowd          but    this       is     usual               for

big      games.

It w o u l d        be    about       this       time       I heard                over    my       personal             radio       somebody

making         reference          to    a    'catastrophe'.                         I had          no    idea       whose       voice           or

whose       call         sign    it    was.           We    were          still          receiving             nothirvg' f r o m             Match

Control,            it    seemed       strange.

I was       then         approached          by a n o t h e r             Liverpool                syrppo r t er         who    produced                  a

ticket         to    me    and    enquired              the      location                of      the     North       Stand.              I

indicated            the    general          d i r e c t i on            o f ,thg        North          Stand       and        saw   that             a

large       double         blue       gate       to     the      extreme                left       of    the       turnstile             area

open,       about         3-4    feet.        People             were          not       rushing             in,    it    seemed          as         if
         inted          out       this                the    enquiring                   Liverpool              supporter           and       he

      ar t e d     to       walk       over.

 At    this        time          I heard           from      other          officers             that          the     game       had       been

                                                           I told          approaching                supporters                 ’D o n ' t     r u sh ,

 the     start          now       delayed’.                 The       time       about          now    3.00           pm.        I then         heard         a

 loud        cheer          or    roar           likened         to    a    goal          scoring          chance.            A     group          of

 supporters                 close-by              said      ’W h a t ' s      that            then',       I     replied:           ’C o u l d        be     th

 teams        coming             out.'            I checked            my     watch            thinking          that's           unusual,              they

 usually           come          out    ten       minutes             before         s t a r t . 0 One           Liverpool              supporter

 made     a      comment           that          the       start       had       not       been       delayed           and       that        I was

 lying.            There          were       still          odd       supporters               asking           for     spare          tickets.

 I saw        PC    Rose          having          problems            with         one        youth,        apparently                 he     d i d n ’t

 have     a    ticket            and       was        just    making           a     general           nuisance             of     himself.

 I then        saw      that           the       large       blue          gate      that        had       been       opened           earlier          was

now     closed.              Then          afloat        eight        minutes             past       three           I received             a    radio

message            something               to     the      effect           ’A l l       serials           or    personnel             onto        t he

p i t c h ’.       No       reason           or    further            order          was       given        or    did       we     hear         the

emergency            code         'Mr.           Meadows         urgently                required          at     the       Police          Room.’

I then         ran      through              a    large       blue         gate          to    the     extreme          right          of       the

turnstile            area.             I     ran      through          into          the       area     behind          the       Leppings              Lane

stand        then       to       the       right        towards            the       rear       of     the       Control          Box.          To      my

left     I    could          see       terracing              (extreme               right       hand           corner      of      Leppings

Lane)        seemed          to    be        plenty         of    room.              I    could       see        no    players          on      the

pitch,        but       I    c o u l d n ’t s e e           any       fighting.

I then        eventually                made          my    way       onto       the          pitch    via       a     gangway          in      the

outside          seating           area          of    the       South        Stand.             From          this     position              I could

see    large        numbers             of       officers             on    the          pitch       and       standing           on    the

fencing        behind             the      Leppings           Lane          goal.              I saw       several          supporters
 'Fans          on    the       pitch          a    bit       of    trouble*.             He        didn't          seem       really             concerns

Following              other             officers             I went       immediately                   to    the          fencing          behind         a

goal.            I^-'couldn’t              see          any    officer          who       appeared             to       be    taking             control.

 I joj^ned            other          officers             at       the    fencing          urging             supporters                to       push

 byck,          at    the       same       time          waving.           At    the       same          time          I heard          over       the

'‘p u b l i c    address             system.              'Will          you    please          move          off       the    pitch’.

 I can          recall          whilst             running          over       the    pitch             to    the       area       behind          the

 goal       I met          a    young          lad       from       G r e a s b o r o u g h , that's                   where       I    l ive.          A    lac

 called                                    , he          shouted          then       came       over          to       me    'It's          terrible             ir

 there,          people             are    dying          people          are    dead.'             0

 I continued                   to    run       to       the    fence       and       what       I saw          1*11          never          forget.

 Young          fans       faces          pressed             against          the    fencing,                pleading             to       be    rescued,

 but     we      couldn't                get       to    them       because          of    the          wire       railings.

 I saw          four^or             five       bodies          just       piling          up    ojn^eajch^^the r .                      It       somehow

 reminded             jrie of        'Belsen             victims',             faces       blue          and       they       were          being       trod

 on.        It/was             complete             and       utter       turmoil.              One          thing          that       struck       me       on

 reaching             the       fence          was       the       strong       smell          of       alcohol             coming          from    t he

 ar/fa      behind             that       goal.           By       this    time       the       officers                in    the       left       hand

 pen      passing              the       dead       and       injured          through          to       us    on       the    perimeter

 track.              One       Liverpool                supporter          a    big       heavy          lad       holding             his       chest.

 He    was       in    danger             of       being       trod       on    by    the       other          supporters.                       I pulled

 him     away         from          the    perimeter                track.           He    was          conscious             he       appeared             to

 be    okay.           I       placed          him       in    the       recovery          position                and       shouted             over       to

 another             couple          of    Liverpool                supporters             'stand             by       him*.

 I went          to    another             casualty                who    appeared             to       have       a    severe          leg       injury.

 He    was       lying          near       the          goal       posts       again       in       danger             of    being          trod    on.

 He    was       another             large          lad       I shouted          to       young                                        to    assist          to

 take       him       away          to    safety,             over       towards          the       South          Stand.              I saw       several

 fatalities                lying          in       the    goal       area       with       jerseys             or       coats          over       their

 faces.

  airway          into     his    mouth          but       he       appeared                  to       force        it        out   with           his

  tongue,           clearing       the        airway.                   1 found               a       S t.    Johns         Ambulanceman                  who

 was     carrying           a    bottle          of       Oxygen             I     put        the          tube     into        the      youth's              mout

  he    appeared           to    come       round.              I       placed               him       in     the      recovery            position,

  reassured           him,       and     he     told        me          his        name           was        Kevin,         but     he     couldn't

  remember          his     surname           or      where             he       came         from           in L i v e r p o o l .

 Several           other        Liverpool             fans          came           over           to ®him a n d             they        said       they

 would        stay        with    him.

 By     this       time     the    St.        John's            Ambulance                     vehicle             came        round       th e

 perimeter           of     the    pitch             we    began             moving               people,           hoarding,             photography

 equipment,              off     the     perimeter               to          allow           the           ambulance           through,                  to    giv

 what    assistance               they        could.

 People        were       being        put      on        hoardings                used           as         stretchers,                and    taken

 across        to    the       gymnasium.                  I remember                    helping               to      p ut    a    young          girl        ont

 one    of     these       hoardings                 there      was           two        or       three          young         girls          at    one        end

 of    the     hoarding           attempting               to       lift           or        carry.              I went            to    their

assistance            and       quite        unknowingly                      they           let        go a n d        left        me    with          t he

weight        of     the    hoarding             and       the          body,           and           I subsequently                     injured          my

back.         No     real       pain     felt         at     this             time.               Everybody              seemed           to       be    in a

state        of     shock.         I was         never          made             aware            that         there          had       been       any

breakdown            in    radio       transmissions                          but       the           general           radio           transmissions

on     the    day     were       poor.

My     overall        observations                   of    the          disaster                  will         take      many,           many       years           t

come     to       terms     with.           One       thing             that          has         knawed          at     me     was       feeling              so

useless,           people        were       crying          for          help          and            we     could       do     nothing.                 As

part     of    my    normal        duty         I work              the       Police                  Control          at     Millmoor,              and

           But    one    thing       has   concernsd      me,   was    that       the    pure    location     of    t he

           Control       Sok    at    Hillsborougn         overlooks        the    area       where   the   tragedy        took

           place.

           Were    not    the       officers      appreciative        of    the    developing         situation?           What

           was    the    feed       back   from    the   officers      working          the    perimeter     of    the     pitc

           C o u l d n ’t t h e y    not   see    the    developing        crush    on    the    terraces?

    back       to    their           motor           vehicle.

    By       this    time        I    saw        large           numbers           of        Liverpool                supporters                       making             their

way           down     the       main           road,           carrying           packs             of    beer        and             lager.               They          were

    very       boisterous                 shouting               and    singing.

    I    noticed          one     youth              in     particular              about                18-19        years               about         5 ' 9 ’* t a l l ,

heavily              built        wearing                 Union        Jack        shorts,                was       singing                     louder          than

anyone              around           him.            He     definitely              appeared                   worse             for            drink.          His

mates           appeared              to     be        telling          hint       to       keep*         quiet.                 They            then       moved          on

I       then    heard         a    message           over           the    radio           'Assistance                       required          outside

Not       knowing          any          areas       of     Sheffield              I asked                   PC        Cammock       was       it    close           b_.

he       informed          me          it    wasn't.

At       approximately                      2.00    pm     the       train        carrying                      the     supporters             arrived.

On       leaving           station            arrangements                  made        to        hold            them       together           outside

the       public           house            (name        not    known).              The           supporters                 all      age      groups,

both           sexes,       were            very    well        behaved.                No         singing              or    chanting,             no

evidence              of    drink,            made        their           way    from             off       the        Platform          down       the

steps.            We       were         then       joined           by     two     mounted                  officers,              I    believe              from


South           Yorkshire.

 The       supporters                  were       held        for     approximately                         -■ m i n u t e s       in     the       smai1

 triangular                area             outside       the        f'Ublic        house.

    1   noticed         that           two     men       at    the        rear      of       the         supporters                were        carrying                t*a

 urns.           We     were           then        instructed              to    escort                 the           supporters          to       the

    football          ground.                 This       was        contrary           to         the           order        and    also       it    was

    rather       unusual                considering                 the    supporters                    were           so    quiet       and       well
                                        0
    behaved.

 We       escorted            the           supporters              down    the        main             road,           arriving          outside                the

    Leppings          Lane             entrance          at     approximately                      Z.15               pm.     No    problems

    experienced                   with        the    supporters                  from         leaving                  the    station          to      arrivir,:


    outside          the      ground.

    They       then     made            their       way        to    the        queues            that            were       forming          outside             the


    turnstile           area,               outside        Leppings              Lane.

    Already          there             was    a    large        amount           of s u p p o r t e r s                 outside         the     ground             b u*

    this       was     not        unusual           considering                  it w a s          a    Semi            Final.          I was

 allocated.                    1 was             then          instructed              by     Inspector                Ellis       to     move

 We    were          receiving                   feedback              that       tickets           were          being       sold        outside          a    pu.

         We    escorted          him       over          to    PC    Rose       and       PC       Morton          and    they       took        over.

         I    believe       they          managed             to    get       him    into          the       ground.

         There       seemed          a    general             complaint             from       Liverpool                supporters           of       the

         size       of    the    crowds             gathering             and       the    slowness                in    being       dealt           with

         entering          at    the       turnstiles.

         One    middle          aged       Liverpool                supporter             came          up    to    me    and       mentioned           in

         relation          to    the       crowd             gathering          that       they          had       the    same       attendance

         every       week       at       Liverpool             and       manage          much       better.              In       reply     to       this    I

         pointed          out    that          they          don't       arrive          all       at    the       same       time.

         The    time       now       about          2.50       pm.        I    was       surprised             to       see       a large        amount

         of    supporters                climbing             onto       the    wall       above             the    turnstiles.                  I

         mentioned          this          to       PC    Cammock,             and    also          that       they       seemed          to w a i t

         several          seconds          before             jumping          off       the       wall       into       the       ground.

     A        Police       Officer             I    believe          an       Inspector             then       appeared             on    the        wall,

         the    climbing             ceased             but    he    was       lifting             small       children             from     the

         developing             crush          to       safety.

     Again           myself          and       PC       Cammock          went       to gi ve        what           a s s i s t a n c e we        could,

.
1*   anc* * m y s e l f              could          feel       the       force       of    the          crowd       and       I withdrew

     further              back       towards             the       road.

     I        seemed       to    recollect                   earlier          hearing          a    radio          message          requesting

     Public              transport             to       be    stopped          from travelling                     along          Leppings           Lane

     but        I    saw    the      buses              were       stillmoving             through                 the    crowd, forcing

     them           over    towards                the       turnstiles             in    the       bottleneck                area       outside

     Leppings              Lane.

     On        this      occasion              we       kept       the    crowds          back          outside          the      metal      railings
a n t T g a t e ’s    to       allow       myself           and       other              officers              to       carry        out     searches

etc.        Also          there       seemed           to       be       a    general              lack        of       i nf o r m a t i o r .       coming

from      within           the       ground           from       ground                 control           via        the       radio        or       the

public        address               system,           either             giving              information                  to     u t , or

information                and       requests              etc.,             to     the        crowd.

The     mood         of    the       crowd        by       this          time           was        growing           more        volatile             but       no

evidence             of    violence           towards                us,          but        they        were        continuing                 to    push.               A

Land       Rover           containing             a    P.C.           which             was        parked          to     the        extreme          left           of

 the     turnstile              area       began           to     edge             in    slowly            in      an     attempt           to       slow       down

 the     movement              of    the     crowd. • He                     then            had    to     stop          became            of    the       sheet

 wei.ght        of     numbers.              He       then           left          the        position              in     the       cab    and       standing

 on     the     £tep        was      shouting               loudly                fc-r       the    supporters                  to    stop        pushing,

 but     the-        crowd       appeared             not        to          hear        this,       or       take         no    notice.

  Inspector              Ellis        then        appeared                   with        a    m e g a p h o n e / h a i 1e t and                 began          to

 shout        'Liverpool               supporters,                       please              step        p u s h i n g ’ this          was           repeated


  several            times.

 At     this         stage       I    d i d n ’t       see       anything                    to    indicate              the      impending

  disaster            even       though           there          was          a     large          crowd           but     this        is    usual             for

  It    would         be       about       this        time          I       heard           over        my     personal              radio          somebody

  making        reference               to    a       ’catastrophe’.                          I    had        no     idea       whose           voice          or

  whose        call        sign       it     was.           We       were           still           receiving                 nothing           from       Match


  Control,            it       seemed        strange.

  I was       then         approached                 by    another                 Liverpool                 supporter               who       produced             a

  ticket         to       me    and     enquired                the          location               of     the       North        Stand.              I

  indicated               the       general           direction                   of     the        North          Stand         and       saw       that       a

  large        double           blue       gate        to       the          extreme               left       of     the        turnstile             area

  open,        about           3-4    feet.            People                were        not        rushing              in,     it    seemed             as    ir

  someone            was       checking           tickets                and        using           this        as       an     extra       turnstile,

  but      I was          still        surprised                to       see        it        open.

 I   pointed              out          this         to       the           enquiring                  Liverpool                supporter              and       he" .

 started             to     walk            over.

At      thi=         time          I    heard               fron.          other             officer*               that       the        game       had    been

 delayed             until             3.15         pm.              I     told          approaching                     supporters              ’D o n ' t         rush,

 loud       cheer           or         roar         likened                   to     a       goal         scoring          chance.               A    group             of

 supporters                  close-by                   said             'What's              that         then',          I    replied:              'Could             be    the

made       a         comment               that         the          start               had       not         been       delayed and                that       I was

 lying.              There         were             still            odd           supporters                   asking          for        spare       tickets.

 I   saw        FC    Rose             having               problems                 with           one        youth,          apparently              he       didn't

 have       a    ticket                and        was        just             ma! i n g         a     general             nuisance           of       himself.

 I   then        saw        that            the         large              blue          gate         that          had    been           opened       earlier                was

 now       closed.                Then            about              ei^ht           minutes                past         three        I    received             a       radio

 I   then        ran        through                 a       large             blue           gate         to    the       extreme           right          of       the

Lane)           seemed            to        be      plenty                 of       room.             I    could          see       no     players          on          the

pitch,               but      I    c o u l d n ’t                see          any fighting.

I    then            eventually                     made          my          way        onto         the       pitch          via       a gangway          in          the

see      large            numbers                 cif o f f i c e r s                on       the         pitch          and    standing              on    the

               Young              fans          faces          pressed           against                 the        fencing,                 pleading               to       be     l'e a C U e L '

               I        saw       four          or       five        bodies          just           piling              up     on       each           other.            It       somehow

                  He     was          lying              near     the       goal            posts            again           in     danger              of    being              trod    on.

       onto       one       of     these           h o a r d i n g s ,■t h e r e            was          two       or        three       young          girls       at

       one     end       of      the      hoarding              attempting                     to       lift       or        carry.           I    went       to

       their        assistance                    and    quite          unknowingly                      they           let       go    and       left    me       with

       the        weight          of    the        hoarding             and       the          body,          and        I    subsequently                 injured

       my     back.           No       real        pain        felt        at     this             time.            Everybody                 seemed       to      be

       in     a    state          of    shock.             I    was        never           made          aware           that          there       had     been

        any       breakdown             in        radio        transmissions                        but           the    general              radio

        transmissions                   on        the     day       were        poor.

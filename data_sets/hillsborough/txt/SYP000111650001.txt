          told    them what         I    had     seen.          However,      neither           of    them      had a        r a dio    and

          they    di d     not    know    the     area      being       from Doncaster.                   At    this     time,         about

         '•1*30 pm       I stopped a           passing          Pol ice    transit           and     told      them     to    h ave     a

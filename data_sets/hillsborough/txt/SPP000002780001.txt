 fhank you vary much for your letters of the 23rd and 31st
 o'f August. I hare particularly nc^ed the second paragraph
 .of,'your letter of the 31st of August,
"'We discussed this Batter again on the 1st of September
  ■when I spoke to you regarding our concern that the parents
  of Anthony felt that the police were in some way to blame
  for the management of this young 3tan.
 You very kindly made it clear that you have explained to
 the Blands that this was not the case and that you would
 sake it clear to them again.
  As you had raised the problem of faturefaanageaaent with
 m it was essential that I should point out that this was
 outside say jurisdiction and that clinical decisions and
 aaaagesent asst be for you but that thsy havs to be reached
 or taken within the taros and provisions of English Law
 both civil and criminal, This of course is not only in your
 interests but also in the interests of Tony’s family.
  I aa obliged to you for the copy papers which you have sent.
  Although I would      to comment on these, X think in all
  the circumstances surrounding this matter it would be
  inappropriate for me to do so at the present time and I
  hope that you will understand the reason for this.
  Tours sincerely,

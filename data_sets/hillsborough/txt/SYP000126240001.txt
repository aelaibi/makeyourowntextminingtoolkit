SHEFFIELD AS I WAS NOT INTENDING TO GO IN) WE ARRIVED AT THE PENNISTONE END

NOTHING OVER THE TOP. TWO THINGS STRUCK US BEFORE WE REACHED LEPINS LANE/1/
WE WERE CONSTANTLY ASKED HAD WE ANY SPARE TICKETS/ WE MUST HAVE BEEN ASKED 20
TIMES, THE DENSITY WAS THICKER AS WE APPROACHED THE LEPINS LANE/ NO ONE
APPEARED TO BE SELLING TICKETS/ THERE WERE GROUPS OF FANS SHOUTING ANYBODY
GOT ANY SPARES /BY THIS TIME IT WAS 20 TO 3PM WE RELISED MY FATHER IN LAW

LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS PLEASE STOP PUSHING PEOPLE AND QUEUE/ BUT ALL THE FANS
WERE JUST SHOUTING ABUSE AT THE POLICE/ BECAUSE OF DRINK AND IMPATIENCE/ WE
SAID NO FOOTBALL IS WORTH THIS/ HE THOUGHT THERE WOULD VIOLENCE BETWEEN
POLICE AND FANS. IT TOOK US QUITE A WHILE TO MAKE OUR BACK THOUGH THE CROWD
STILL PUSHING BEHIND US AND BACK TO OUR CAR.
AS WE WERE WALKING BACK WE HEARD THE ROAR OF THE CROWD
WE WERE SUPRIZED NO ONE HAD CHECKED TICKETS BEFORE WE GOT TO THE GROUND NO
TICKET HOLDERS COULD HAVE BEEN ESCORTED AWAY THEN/ NO BDY CHALLANGED ME AND
NO ONE CHALLANGED ANYONE ELSE.FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS HAVE BROUGHT THIS ON

SLIDE DOWN OVER SOMEONES HEAD, AND I COULD TELL THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG AS
IT WAS SO TIGHTLY PACKED, BY THIS TIME IT WAS ABOUT TEN MINUTES TO THREE. I
ALSO NOTICED THAT THE PENS ON EITHER SIDE HAD LOADS OF ROOM SPARE. ONCE THE
GAME HAD STARTED THERE WAS SURGE FORWARD OF LIVERPOOL FANS BEHIND THE GOAL
WHICH WAS WHEN NOTTS TOOK A CORNER. I COULD SEE PEOPLE TRYING TO CLIMB UP AND
OUT AT THE REAR. THE POLICE THEN OPENED THE GATE BETWEEN THE WIRE FENCING AND
SOME OF THE FANS CAME ONTO THE TRACK AND SAT DOWN. LATER ON I SAW PEOPLE
CLIMBING OVER THE FENCING ONTO THE PITCH AND PEOPLE BEING PASSED OVER THE
TOgS OF OTHER PEOPLES HEADS. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLICE STOOD IN A
lS   line INFRONT OF THE NORTH STAND WHERE I WAS WHEN THERE WAS NO TROUBLE
THERE. THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING DOWN BY THE GOAL WHERE THE LIVERPOOL
FANS WERE.

I WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM THE DETAILS.
w A r THE PEOPLE FROM THE TERRACES STARTED SPILLING ON THE PITCH WE THOUGHT IT
WAS JUST HOOLIGANISM, AND DIDN'T REALISE FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. THEN THERE
WERE 3 BODIES LAID OUT IN FRONT OF OUR STAND, AND WE REALISED THEN THAT IT
WAS SERIOUS.
THERE SEEMED TO BE A LACK OF STEWARDS AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END FOR EVERYONE
TO BE GOING INTO THE MIDDLE AND NOT GOING TO THE ENDS. IT WAS SO EMPTY IN
THE LEFT HAND WING NR THE NORTH STAND THAT AT 2.50 YOU COULD SEE THE STEPS.

I WAS ALONE AT THE FRONT OF THE STAND.
I DID NOT REALISE THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG UNTIL ABOUT 1503HRS WHEN SOME OF
THE LIVERPOOL FANS STARTED TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCES ONTO THE PITCH...THE MAIN
CRUSH I COULD SEE WAS BEHIND THE GOALPOSTS IN THE WEST STAND ..THE SIDE PENNS
WERE ONLY HALF FULL.
I DID NOT REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING UNTIL I SAW PEOPLE ON STRETCHERS
...THERE WAS A SURGE BEHIND THE GOALPOSTS AND IT PUSHED EVERYONE FORWARDS .
MY TICKET WAS CHECKED AT PENISTONE RD END WHERE I CAME IN..I SAW LIVERPOOL
FANS TRYING TO GET IN AT THE NOTTS.END ...THEY WERE TRYING TO BUY TICKETS TO
GET IN AT ANY PRICE.
THERE WERE NOT MANY POLICE AT THE SPION KOP END AND THERE WERE NO STEWARDS
ANYWHERE,EXCEPT FOR ONE INSIDE THE STAND ITSELF.

ANY REAL PROBLEM.ONCE THE DISASTER STARTED TO UNFOLD THERE SEEMED TO BE NO
ORGANISATION.THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM COULD HAVE BEEN USED IN ORDER THAT OFF
DUTY MEDICAL PEOPLE AND POLICEMEN COULD HAVE HELPED OUT.
WHEN THE AMBULANCES WERE TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE POLICE COULD HAVE HELPED
DIRECT THE CROWD OUT OF THEIR WAY,NO ONE APPEARED TO WANT TO TAKE CONTROL.

POLICE WERE TRYING TO PUSH THEM BACK. THE POLICE SEEMED TO LACK ORAGANISATION
AND THEIR INITIAL RESPONSE WAS POOR, ALTHOUGH I THINK THEY DONE THE RIGHT
THING IN OPENING THE GATE. THE POLICE THEN FORMED A CORDON ACROSS THE PITCH
AS IF THEY EXPECTED A CROWD SITUAUTION.

ALSO WHILST OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS LANE END I ASKED A POLICEMAN TO CALL FOR
HELP TO ASSIST WITH THE CROWDS BUT HE DIDNT HAVE A RADIO AND LOOKED
NERVOUS... I WAQS ALSO A LITTLE SUPRISED TO SEE THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE
EMERGENCY EXIT TO GET AMBULANCES ONTO THE PITCH....ALSO THE POLICE DID WELL
IN STOPPING A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN LIVERPOOL AND FOREST FANS AFTER THE
INCIDENT BECAUSE THE FOREST FANS WERE BAITING WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HAD
HAPPENED       ONE POLICE MAN ON A HORSE TOLD ME AS WE WERE LEAVING THE GROUND
THAT THE CROWDS HAD BUILT UP IN LEPPINGS LANE BECAUSE POLI8CE HAD HEARD THAT
A B I F E GANG WAS APPROACHING THE GROUND AND SO POLICE WERE SEARCHING PEOPLE
WHICH OBVIOUSLY RESULTED IN A DELAY OF SUPPORTERS REACHING THE GROUND
TWO PEOPLE WERE WITH ME    \__________ AND              ..BOTH LIVE IN
SHREWBURY BUT I DONT KNOW THYE EXACT ADDRESSES

              THE MATCH HE WAS ASKED TO REPORT TO THENORTHERN GENERAL HOSPITAL,
              I TOLD HIM THAT IF HE NEEDED HELP WITH TRANSPORT HE WAS TO
              CONTACT ME. AT ABOUT 8:00PM I RECEIVED A CALL FROMTHE HOSPITAL
              BUT IT WASNT FROM MY FRIEND IT WAS FROM THE SOCIAL WORKERS DEPT.
               ASKING ME IF I COULD TAKE A LAD HOME. I AGREED AND WENT TO THE
              HOSPITAL. THE LAD

r TOOK HOME WAS ABOUT 20 YEARS OLD AND HE WAS A LIVERPOOL FAN. THE FIRST
THING THAT HIT ME WAS THAT HE SMELT STRONGLY OF ALCOHOL. IN THE CAR I CHATTED
TO HIM AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED. HE TOLD ME THAT HE NEVER ACTUALLY GOT
TO THE GAME ALTHOUGH HE DID HAVE A TICKET. HE STATED THAT ABOUT 4 OR 5 OF
THEM HAD LEFT LIME STREET AT ABOUT 8:30AM AND THEY HAD HAD 2 BOTTLES OF VODKA
BETWEEN THEM. THEY GOT TO THE GROUND AT ABOUT11:00AM AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE
OmLICENCE, THEY THEN SPENT THE NEXT 2 OR 3 HOURS DRINKING. BY 2:00PM THEY
W S R ALL DRUNK. THIS LAD WAS THEN ARRESTED AND WAS PLACED IN A MOBILE CELL
ALONG WITH WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A BUNCH OF ANIMALS, AND THAT HE COULD NOT
BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE LIVERPOOL FANS. AT 4:00PM HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS
REALISED. HE WENT TO FIND HIS MATES AT THE HOSPITAL, AND FOUND THAT ONE MATE
HAD BEEN INJURED. I KNOW MYSELF THAT THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF
DRINKING ON THAT DAY, AND THAT THE FANS OUTSIDE THE PUBS WERE ALL ASKING FOR
SPARE TICKETS. ALL    KNOW IS THAT THE LADS NAME WAS              AND I THINK
THAT HE LIVED IN                              LIVERPOOL

THE POLICE CAR CAME AND TOLD EVERYONE TO GO BACK BUT THEY COULDNT, THEY SAID
THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO GET THE KICK OFF POSTPONED. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
NO PROBLEM THEN. THEY OPENED THE LEFT HAND SIDE GATE AND THEY ALL PUSHED
THROUGH THERE, THEY DIDNT HAVE MUCH CHOICE, THE POLICE HORSES MADE A CORDON
BUT THEY DIDNT HAVE A CHANCE OF TRYING TO STOP IT. ONCE THE GATES WERE
OPENED IT RELIEVED THE PUSH OUTSIDE, BUT BY THIS TIME THE GAME HAD STARTED.
PEOPLE WERE COMING AWAY FROM THAT TURNSTILE BRUISED ASWELL, NOT JUST FROM

            SEAT WAS LEVEL WITH THE GOAL LINE. LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WERE IN
            THE MIDDLE ENCLOSURE BEHIND THE GOAL. THEY SEEMED PRETTY FULL AT
            THAT TIME AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THEM THE PENS WERE NOT QUITE
            FULL. THERE WAS A LOT OF MOVEMENT, PUSHING AND SHOVING IN THE
            CENTRE ENCLOSURES. SEVERAL PEOPLE CLIMBED OVER THE FENCE TO GET
            AWAY FROM IT.

THERE WAS ONE POLICEMAN WHO STOOD WATCHING FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME, AND I
THOUGHT AT THE TIME HE'S GOT TO DO SOMETHING BUT HE DIDN'T. AFTER AT TIME HE
WALKED AWAY AND I ASSUMED THAT THE WAS GOING TO ASK FOR ASSISSTANCE. AFTER
THAT THE PLAYERS CAME OUT AND MY ATTENTION WAS DISTRACTED AND THEN THERE WAS
THE CRISIS. I'M AFRAID THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY. EVERYTHING THAT OCCURRED AFTER
WAS WELL DOCUMENTED, BUT I SAW IT ALL CLEARLY. I THINK THAT THE MOVEMENT IN
THAT SECTION WAS TYPICAL OF THE FANS, BEFORE IT BECAME OVERCROWDED.
I ^ S WITH                I CAN'T GIVE HIS DETAILS WITHOUT ASKING HIM.
ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT TWO ROWS INFRONT OF ME WERE A NUMBER OF
LIVERPOOL FANS, AND WHEN THE INCIDENT HAPPENED THEY KEPT SAYING THAT IT WAS 1
BECAUSE LIVERPOOL WEREN'T ALLOCATED ENOUGH TICKETS.                          f

             WONDERING WHERE ALL THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE AS THE SIDE PENS WERE

FOREST WERE ATTACKING THEIR GOAL. WE DIDN'T REALISE SOMMETHING WAS SERIOUSLY
WRONG UNTIL WE SAW THE HOARDINGS BEING RIPPED DOWN TO BE USED AS STRETCHERS.
I SAW ONE LIVERPOOL FAN ATTACKING A PHOTOGRAPHER - I COULDN'T IDENTIFY HIM.
WE COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT WAS BEING SAID ON THE TANNOY. AS WE LEFT THE
GROUND, WE SAW FOREST FANS MINGLING WITH LIVERPOOL FANS, AND THERE WAS
PUSHING AND SHOVING TO GET ONTO THE BUSES, BUT ONE FAN SAID, LOOK WE'VE HAD
ENOUGH AND THE MATTER CALMED DOWN. ON THE WAY TO THE GROUND, I SAW THAT THERE
       QUITE A FEW FANS FROM BOTH SIDES DRINKING - I THOUGHT THAT WAS RATHER
Im Ir UDISH TO SERVE DRINKS ON THIS SORT OF OCCASION.
I WAS WITH MY WIFE,              (58), SAME ADDRESS.
I THINK AN EARLIER MESSAGE ON THE TANNOY WOULD HAVE HELPED, AND I WOULD
CRITICISE THE OPENING OF THE GATES FOR EVERYONE TO POUR THROUGH AT THE SAME
TIME.
MY WIFE AND I WILL BE AT THE
JERSEY FROM SUNDAY      89 UNTIL SUNDAY     P9.

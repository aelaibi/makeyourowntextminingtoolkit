      4.2.       HADIAL FENCES -         WEST TERRACE (LEPPINGS LANE)

      4.2* i)        Two radial, fences were proposed in September 1981 lc>                301
                     divide the terrace intc thr<s-o equal areas to enable
                     better crowd control. The central fence at the mouth
                     of the tunnel separating the present Pens 3 and 4 was
                     not installed until much later - 1 935.

      4.2t ii)       The Officer Working-, party agreed in September 1981 to             309/310
                     the two radlal fences with the proviso :
                     "gates at the rear of the terrace being under police
                     control*1.

      A.2lill)       The two radial fences were installed in late 1981 and                 12?5
                     m January 1982 they were considered to be working
                     well.

      4,2(iv)        Schedule 3 of the Certificate lay.1* down a capacity of
                     7,500 on the West Terrace. This figure was assessed
                     before the jnstailation of radial fences and the
                     sterile moat between home and away supporters. Plan?
                     prepared since the radial fences wore installed show
                     individual capac-iUert for each pen, again totalling
                     7,200. Tne correspondence files do not show how the
                     capacities of each pen were calculated.


      6.3        TURNSTtI.F.S__AT I.BPPINCS LANE

      4.3(i)         Tn early 1 9 S';j Eastwood and Partner* prepared plans to       1132/13(57/
                     channel supporters separately onto the centre of the            1391/1466/
                     West Terrace and two wings by dedicating turnstiles             1469/1476/
                     to a specific section of the terrace and providing              1477,
                     lateral fencing from the rear of the turnstile.*; to
                     the rear of the West Stand. The plan* incorporated
                     a similar system of segregation for supporters
                     entering the hem* and away arcus of the West Stand

                          pi'rsent radial fence separating Pen.? 3 arid 4 .

                          For reasons that, are net to be found in the files
                          these plans were never implemented but a much smaller
                          scheme, resulting in the present layout, completed.
                          This involved the moving of turnstiles 17 arid 18
                          backwards and into the smaller block known as A - G
                          and the building of the lateral wall from the
                          turnstiles to the rear of the stand. These alterations
                          did not alter the turnstile capacity or segregate
                          s11ppor!:erp. effectively.

          4.4,         THE SPlOW KOP EXTENSION

          A .A (i )       In the sunmer of 1986 the Spion Kop terracing was                    1641
                          substantially extended backwards and upwards?, and the
                          whole terrace covered. The plans proposed an
                          increase of 5,96i spectators on the Kop from the then
                          certificated ceil Lng of 1 6 ,S50 to over 2 ^,0 0 0 .

          4, 4( ii)       On 21 August 1986, the Genera! Purposes T’anc'-l                     1642
                          approved a new capacity for the Kop of 21,000 with
                          three provisos, one being the provision of extra
                          slewarding to the satisfaction of the Police and Fire
                          Service for the next two matches.

   6 ,   CONCLUSIONS


         6.1.     Since 1979 there ha* beer, much discussion end
                   correspondence on the question of the safety of the
                   Hillsborough Stadium. There have been significant
                   alterations to the West Terraco in 1961 (radial fences)
                   and the Spion Kop m 1986 (extensions) but on neither
                   occasion has Schedule 3 of the General Safety
                   Certificate beer, amended in terms of Crowd Capacity or,
                   arguably more important, Steward ini? Levels.

         6.2      The present General Safety Certificate Is inaccurate In
                   that it does not relate to the stadium as it is todny.
                   The Inaccuracy concerning the Spion Kop was pointed out            1736/1737
                   to Sheffield Cir.y Council In a letter* from Assistant
                  Chief Constable Hr. J. M. JONES, West Midlands Police on            173»
                   4 M*y 19&9- Tbe Local Authority replied in letters on
                   12 May and 15 May# the contents of which are
                   inconclusive.

         6.3      During the examination of Sheffield Wednesday’s General
                  Safety Certificate it- has come to notice, albeit
                  unconfirmed by documentation, that it is doubtful if
                  there Is a General Safety Certificate1 in force for
                  Sheffield Unitec Football CIu d ’s stadium at Brariull
                  Lane, Sheffield.

F .A. CUP SEMI FINAL
SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989
D OPERATIONS FROM 7PM ON FRIDAY 14 APRIL TO
3AM ON SUNDAY 16 APRIL 1989


1.0          INFORMATION

1.1          On   Saturday 15 April 1989 Liverpool  will  play  Nottingham
              Forest in the F.A. Cup semi final at Hillsborough. This is an
              all ticket match and a capacity crowd of 54,281 is expected.
             Copies of tickets and stand allocation is at Appendix ''C" .

1   .1 . 1   In the event of a draw at full time 30 minutes of extra time
             will be played.

1.2          F Division will be policing the match itself and the environs
              of Hillsborough. D Division responsibilities are limited to
              the  additional  demands  placed upon  the  Division   by  the
              arrival  and departure of supporters of both clubs   who  will
              use the city centre. Both have similar red/white colours.

1.3          Traffic Division are assuming responsibility for all match
              traffic which will enter and leave the South Yorkshire Police
             area. To that end each affected Division is supplying a number
             of   officers  to Traffic. 35 D officers will  be  seconded  to
             Traffic   on  15 April 1989. Traffic Order being produced.

1.3.1        The seconded officers will work from 0800 to 2000 and will be
             briefed at the Driving School, Brightside Lane at 0900 on 15
             April 1989. They, under the control of Traffic, will police
             the  traffic  routes   in D Division. D1  control   room  will
             maintain a close liaison with the traffic controllers.

1.3.2        Traffic Div have undertaken the task of publicising the
             traffic routes and parking areas via the Press Liaison
             Department

1.4          The major demand on D policing resources will occur    on   15
             April 1989, however past experience has shown that problems do
             occur  on  the evenings which precede and   follow the    match
             hence the  long time span of the operation.

1.5          The  majority of supporters will travel to Hillsborough   by
             various  means  on 15 April 1989, however it is  likely  that
             some will travel to Sheffield on the the previous day and that
             some will remain in the city centre on the evening following
             the match.




                                                                            1
1.6     Certain areas have been set aside for coach and car parking
        designed to maximise segregation. D1 Control room hove maps
        and will be able to advise. Private cars from Liverpool will
        be encouraged to park  in the Parson Cross area and those from
        Nottingham in the Neepsend area.

1.7     RAIL TRAVEL

        The Liverpool Special Train will arrive and depart from
        Wadsley Bridge. The Special Trains from Nottingham will arrive
        and depart from Sheffield Midland. For timings and platforms
        see Appendix " D".

1.7.1   There are 4 Special Trains laid on to transport supporters to
         and from Nottingham. The combined capacity of the trains is
         2,140 in each direction. Additionally there are a number of
         service trains from Nottingham.

1.7.2   There is 1 Special Train laid on to transport supporters  to
        and from Liverpool (into Wadsley Bridge) with a capacity of
         350. Many Liverpool supporters will travel by scheduled
         services into and out of Sheffield Midland.

1.7.3   Liverpool enjoys widespread support and supporters from
         all over the UR can be expected to travel into Sheffield
        Midland on service trains. The train times from destinations
        where Liverpool are known to have a strong following
         are shown at Appendix "D".

1.7.4   Supporters traveling to and from Sheffield on the Nottingham
         Special Trains will be using the North End Gate . All other
        visitors will be using the normal ticket barrier gates. See
        Appendix "E" for plan of Sheffield Midland. Skill and tact
        will be required to hive the Liverpool and Notts supporters
         from the travelling public.

1.7.5   Sheffield United are playing at Northampton on 15 April 1989
         and, although there are no special trains, it is probable that
         a number will travel to and from Northampton by rail.

1.8     The major threat will be from the Liverpool supporters whose
         hard core are well known for causing disorder and  committing
         crime (especially shoptheft) on such occasions.

1.9     PSV ARRANGEMENTS

1.9.1   Supporters arriving at Sheffield Midland will be   transported
         to and from the ground on a dedicated fleet of SYT buses. To
        maintain   segregation different routes will be used for   each
        group as follows;

        NOTTINGHAM FANS Depart from North End Gate then board SYT
        buses in Sheaf Street. Travel to SWFC via ; SHEAF SQUARE ,
        POND STREET,FLAT STREET, HIGH STREET, ANGEL STREET, WEST BAR
        SHALESM00R, GIBRALTAR STREET, PENISTONE ROAD .




                                                                       2
LIVERPOOL F ANS Depart from ticket barriers then board SYT
buses parked outside South Luggage Exit and facing CROSS
TURNER STREET.   Travel to SWFC via;gates, CROSS TURNER
STREET, SUFFOLK ROAD, GRANVILLE SQUARE, ST MARY'S ROAD, ST
MARY'S GATE, HANOVER WAY, NETHERTHQRPE ROAD, MEADOW STREET,
UPPERTHORPE, ALBERT TERRACE R O A D ,MIDDLEWOOD ROAD AND LEPPINGS
LANE .

A total of 35 PSVs are available for the day. From 0930 on
15.4.89  6 will be parked at each exit. The remainder will
be stacked on East Bank Road and will be called up by the SYT
Inspector on duty at the Midland Station when required.

The  fare is 100p return and fans will know of  this  before
arriving  at  Sheffield. They will receive a yellow return
ticket on boarding which will speed the return loading. Each
vehicle will hold  80 passengers.

2 officers      will accompany each PSV  and, once they  have
dropped   their   passengers,   the  officers will   return   to
Sheffield   Midland for another load. Officers arriving at SWFC
after   2:45pm will not return but will report to the Gym     at
SWFC and re form into serials to act as a reserve.

After   the     match the same procedure   will be   adopted to
return   the   fans   to Sheffield  Midland.   The serials will
accompany    the same groups as the inward journey.   Once   fans
are   inside      thestation then officers may be   required   to
return on the empty PSVs for return loads.

After the match Liverpool fans will load  in Penistone Road
North  from Wardsend Road North to Leppings Lane  roundabout.
Nottingham fans will load in Pensitone Road North outside the
ground facing city.

Buses returning with Liverpool fans will return via St Mary's
Road,  enter  the one way system and then Fornham  Street.
Serials 1 - 2 will be deployed to line the parking area   to
ensure that  no  one dis embarks. The buses will unload   one
at a time. SYT drivers have been briefed.

Buses  returning with Nottingham fans  will  approach  the
Sheffield  Midland  from  Sheaf  Street. Serials 3 - 4 will   be
deployed to line the arrival area to ensure that only one PSV
at a time dis embarks. The fans will enter through the North
End Gate.

It is imperative that buses do not travel in convoy and that
only one bus at a time (the lead bus) either loads or unloads.
This will assist the searching serials at the ground and will
assist with segregation at the Sheffield Midland.

Supporters (mainly from Nottingham ) will be arriving and
departing on service coaches at Pond Street. Serials 17 - 18
         will be deployed in the area to instruct both groups to
         use the SYT F;V services departing for SWFC from outside
         Sheffield Midlsnd.

1.13.0   Opposing group's returning PSVs clash at Hoyle Street   and
          Penistone  Road.  Serial 19 will patrol the  area    after    the
          match until all PSVs have passed that point.

1.13.1   The bus station is new and the serials deployed there will
          familiarise themselves with the layout and relevant platforns.

1.14     Mounted and dog section officers will be available   at the
          Midland Station for the arrivals and departures. Their
          supervisors will liaise with A/Supt. King for deployment on
          15 April 1989 but will be at the Midland by 0930.

2        INTENTION

2.1      To anticipate and deal effectively with the additional threat
          of disorder and crime posed by the influx of visitors.

2.2      To   ensure that the supporters arriving and   departing    from
          Sheffield   Midland are segregated and contained at all     times

TRAINS

1.   U n T B O W FOSEST

Five special trains carrying Nottingham Forest supporters vdll arrive at Midland
Station; the tines vill not be available until the veek of the semi-final and
therefore will be given at briefing.

Each train has a capacity of 550.

The fare for these special trains is inclusive of the bus fare to the ground.

SYT will run b uses {ran the Station to the ground using a route along Penistone Road
and unloading ir. Herries Road South; these buses will be under not or cycle escort.

After the matc±i a sirilar operation will take place to return Nottinghar Forest
supporters to the railway station , loading in Penistone Road North opposite the
ground and usinc ar. identical route back to the station.

Departure times will be given at the briefing.

There is the facility to delay the trains in the event of extra time being played.




2*   LIVERPOOL

 3   special treins carrying Liverpool supporters will arrive at Wadsley Bridge
Station at times yez to be arranged; these will be made available at briefing.

Each train has e capacity of 550.

Departure times will also be given at the briefing.

Again there is e. facility to delay the trains in the event of extra time being
played.

As the support for Liverpool is widespread, it is anticipated that supporters will
travel by service train from all parts of the country to Midland Railway Station.
Arrangements have therefore been made for those arriving at Midland Station to be
transported by SYT buses to the ground by a route separate from that used by Nottingham
Forest supporter s , travelling along Langsett Road, Middlewood Road and arriving at
Leppings Lane where they will unload.

At the end of the game, SYT buses will be available to return any person arriving in
this manner back tc the Midland Railway Station. These buses will be located in

                                    OCACHES


LIVERPOOL


     1      All Liverpool coaches should leave the Ml Motorway at Exit 36
             {Tankersley) and travel vie the A61 to designated parking areas .

     2      The geographical location cf Liverpool, coupled with the countrywide
             support enjoyed by the Cliib. suggests that coaches could well approach
             the stadiun by other routes, particularly the A616. If this is the
            case, then they must be brought to the designated coach parkin? area.

     3      The serials engaged on duty at Tankersley and Ought ibridge will
            operate selective stop and search procedures to ensure (a) passengers
            have tickets, (b) they are not in possession of alcohol and (c)
             they are not drunk. When tnis has been done, each coach will hsve
            an adhesive sticker placed on the nearside of the windscreen ani it
            will be allowed to proceed to the designated parking area.

     4      All coaches will be allowed to travel to the ground without specific
             escort, although members of the Road Traffic Motor Cycle Wing will
             be providing overall mobile supervision. All coaches will be directed
             to the traffic island at Leppings lane where in the first instance,
             they will park in Claywheels Lane. Once this area is full ther.
             coaches will be directed tc park on the ’out lane’ of the dual
             carriageway in Halifax Roar., parking to commence at the top of rne
             dual carriageway and then » r k towards the stadium.

     5      All coaches will park before being permitted to set down passengers
             thereby ensuring that the occupants know exactly where to return to
             on corrpletion of the football match.

     6      Where it is discovered that passengers on a coach are not in possession
             of tickets, or are in breach of legislation concerning alcohol £t
             Sporting Events, then Ground Control will be informed for consideration
             as to returning such vehicles out of the Force area under escort.

     7      Where individual passengers only are involved who have consimec alcohol
             in such amounts that they are drunk, or are in possession of almfrol,
             then they should be arrested and detained pending transport.

N o r n N a a w forest

     8      Nottingham Forest supporters who travel by coach will be encouraged to
             use the Ml motorway leaving at Exit 34 (Tinsley). This aspect cf the
             operation will be dealt vit±i by 'D' Division Officers and is th=
             subject of a separate order.

     9      These coaches will be parted in the South Yorkshire Transport G£rage,
             Herries Road South and, if necessary, Rawson Spring Road.

       TRANSIT VANS - LIVERPOOL




Transit vans, etc. carrying Liverpool supporters vill
be encouraged to travel via the M62 and K1 rmtorweys
leaving the latter at Junction 36 (Tankersley).
However, it is envisaged that such vehicles will also
approach the stadium from the Flouch (A616).


Such vehicles will be stopped and thoroughly
searched to ensure that they are not carrying
alcohol and the passengers have not consumed the
same to an extent where they are drunk.


All passengers will be checked to ensure that they
are in possession of tickets.


The vehicles will then proceed to the designated
parking area in Wardsend Road North vfrere passengers
vill alight and walk to the ground.


It is not feasible to attenpt to channel such
vehicles through one 1checkpoint1 and therefore
it will be the duty of all serials on cities outside
the stadium to monitor and check such vehicles arc
their occupants.


Should any vehicle arrive, without having been
checked on the outskirts, which is found to be
carrying passengers without tickets or in breach of
the legislation relating to the carriage and
cansurrption of alcohol en route to sporting events,
then Ground Control will be informed for consideration
as to returning the vehicle to the motorway for escort.
If necessary, the driver and passengers vill be dealt
vith for breach of the relevant legislation by w5y
of surmons or arrest, dependant on their individual
condition.

1          Unauthorised persons are not permitted to enter
            upon the field of play.

2          The clijrbing of floodlight pylons, stands and
            other buildings in the ground is forbidden.

3.         The consmption of intoxicating liquors is

           not permitted within the ground, and any person
           in possession of such an article or container
           may be refused entry or ejected from the ground.

5          Under no circunstanoes is it permitted to throw any
           object onto the pitch.

€          Any person who fails to corply with instructions
           from a steward may be ejected from the ground.

~          Any persons who renains in a gangway may be ejected from

£          The Club reserves the right to refuse admission
           to or eject any persons who refuses to be searched
           by a Police Officer.

9          The Club reserves the right for its servants andagents
           to remove from this ground any person who does not
           corrply with Ground Regulations and with the Rules
           and Regulations of the Football Association and The Football
           League or whose presence on the Ground is or could
           reasonably be construed as constituting a source of
           danger, nuisance or annoyance to other spectators.


MOTE;    Item 8 above outlines the contractual agreement between the
football supporter and the Club. It does not create a power to search
and any search must be with the consent of the individual supporter.
Refusal is merely a bar to entering the ground and not a criminal offeree.
Where a search is conducted with consent, it is a search within the
meaning of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Section 3 (i ) cf the
Act requires an officerto make a record of the search in writing unless
±t is not practicable to do so and large scale searches such as those at
football matches fall within this section. There is not therefore a
requirement to corplete a Form PAZE/ 1.

TRAINS

1.   NOTTINGHAM FOREST

Five special trains carrying  Nottingham Forest supporters will arrive
at Midland Station;  the times will not be available until the week of
the Semi Final and therefore will be given at the briefing.

Each train has a capacity of 550.

The fare for these special trains   is inclusive of the bus fare to
the ground.

SYT will run buses from the station to the ground using a route along
Penistone Road and unloading  in Herries Road South; these buses will
be under motor cycle escort.

After the match a similar operation will take place to return
Nottingham Forest supporters to the railway station, loading in
Penistone Road North opposite the ground and using an identical route
back to the station.

Departure times will be given at the briefing.

There is the facility to delay the trains   in the event of extra time
being played.

2.   LIVERPOOL

Two special trains carrying Liverpool supporters will arrive at
Wadsley Bridge Station at times yet to be arranged;  these will be
made available at briefing.

Each train has a capacity of 550.

Departure times will also be given at the briefing.

Again there is a facility to delay the trains in the event of extra
time being played.

As the support for Liverpool is widespread, it is anticipated that
supporters will travel by service train from all parts of the country
to Midland Railway Station.  Arrangements have therefore been made for
those arriving at Midland Station to be transported by SYT buses to the
ground by a route separate from that used by Nottingham Forest supporters
travelling along Langsett Road, Middlewood Road and arriving at Leppings
Lane where they will unload.

At the end of the game, SYT buses will be available to return any
person arriving in this manner back to the Midland Railway Station.
These buses will be located in Penistone Road North on the'to city'
carriageway outside Beeley Wood Special School.
                                                                  Appendix 'L'



                                COACHES


LIVERPOOL

            All Liverpool coaches should leave the Ml Motorway at Exit 36
            (Tankersley) and travel via the A61 to designated parking areas.

            The geographical location of Liverpool, coupled with the
            countrywide support enjoyed by the Club, suggests that coaches
            could well approach the stadium by other routes, particularly
            the A616. If this is the case, then they must be brought to
            the designated coach parking area.

            Liverpool Executive Club coaches will be supplied with a red
            notice (Copy attached) to display in the windscreen and these
            will be permitted to unload at the ground. This facility will
            not be extended to any other coach for whatever reason.

            The Serials engaged on duty at Tankers ley and Ought ibridge will
            operate selective stop and search procedures to ensure (A)
            Passengers have tickets, (B) they are not in possession of alcohol
            and (C) they are not drunk. Wh^n this has been done, each
            coach will have an adhesive sticker placed on the nearside of
            th^ windscreen and it will be allowed to proceed to the designated
            parking area.

            All coaches will be allowed to travel to the ground without
            specific escort, although members of the Road Traffic Motor Cycle
            wing will be providing overall mobile supervision. All coaches
            will be directed to the traffic island at Leppings Lane where,
            in the first instance, they will park in Claywheels Lane. Once
            this area is full then coaches will be directed to park on the
            'out lane' of the dual carriageway in Halifax Road, parking to
            conmence at the top of the dual carriageway and then work towards
            the stadium.

            All coaches will park before being permitted to set down passengers,
            thereby ensuring that the occupants know exactly where to return
            to on completion of the football natch.

            Where it is discovered that passengers on a coach are not in
            possession of tickets, or are in breach of legislation concerning
            alcohol at Sporting events, then Ground Control will be informed
            for consideration as to returning such vehicles out of the Force
            area under escort.

            Where individual passengers only are involved who have consumed
            alcohol in such amounts that they are drunk, or are in posses­
            sion of alcohol, then they should be arrested and detained pending
            transport.

  NOTTINGHAM FOREST

            Nottingham Forest supporters who travel by coach will be encouraged
            to use tte Ml Motorway leaving at Exit 34 (Tinsley). This aspect
            of the operation will be dealt with by 'D' Division officers and
            is the subject of a separate order.

                                                                                62
Nottingham Forest Executive Club coaches will be supplied with
a white notice (Copy attached) affording the same facilities
as in Paragraph 3 above.

These coaches will be parked in the South Yorkshire Transport
Garage, Herries Road South and, if necessary, Rawson Spring
Road.

          TRANSIT VANS - LIVERPOOL




Transit vans, etc. carrying Liverpool supporters will
be encouraged to travel via the M62 and Ml Motorways
leaving the latter at Junction 36 (Tankersley).
However, it is envisaged that such vehicles will a so
approach the stadium from the Flouch (A616).

Such vehicles will be stopped and thoroughly searched
to ensure that tl>?y are not carrying alcohol and the
passengers have not consumed the saTie to an extent
where they are drunk.

All passengers will be checked to ensure that they are
in possession of tickets.

After the search has been completed an adhesive sticker
will be placed on the nearside windscreen to confirm
the search has been completed.

The vehicles will then proceed to the designated
parking area in Wardsend Road North where passengers
will alight and walk to the ground.

It is not feasible to attenpt to channel such vehicles
through one "checkpoint" and therefore it will be the
duty of all serials on duties outside the stadium to
monitor and check such vehicles and their occupants.

Should any vehicle arrive, without having been checked
on the outskirts, which is found to be carrying
passengers without tickets or in breach of the
legislation relating to the carriage and consurrption
of alcohol en route to sport ing events, then Ground
Control will be informed for consideration as to
returning the vehicle to the motorway for escort.
If necessary, the driver and passengers will be dealt
with for breach of the relevant legislation by way of
sunDons or arrest, dependant on their individual condition.

   TRANSIT VANS - NOTTINGHAM FOREST




Transit vans, etc. carrying Nottingham Forest supporters
will be encouraged to travel via the Ml Motorway leaving
the latter at Janet.ion 34 (Tinsley)

Such vehicles will be stopped and thoroughly searched
to ensure that they are not carrying alcohol and the
passengers have not consumed the same to an extent
where they are drank.

All passengers will be checked to ensure that they are
in possession of tickets.

After the search has been ccrpleted an adhesive sticker
will be placed on the nearside windscreen to confix-:,
the search has been completed.

The vehicles will then proceed to the designated
parking area in Rawson Spring Road where passengers
will alight and walk to the ground.

It is not feasible to attenpt to channel such vehicles
through one "checkpoint" and therefore it will be the
duty of all serials on duties outside the stadium to
monitor and check such vehicles and their occupants.

Should any vehicle arrive, without having been checked

tion relating to the carriage and consunrption of

If necessary, the driver and passengers will be dealt
with for breach of the relevant legislation by way of
summons or arrest, dependant on their individual
condition.

          STANDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE POLICING OF FOOTBALL MATCHES


OBJECT

1.1       It is necessary, as far as is possible, to standardise our method
          of policing at all football league grounds in South Yorkshire so
          that all officers of the force are aware that wherever they are
          detailed for duty, slight variations being accepted for each
          ground, they will know what is expected of them. Additionally,
          by standardising our procedures which have been evolved through
          experience we should be more able to ensure the safety of
          spectators, look to the protection of residents and business
          concerns likely to be affected by the influx of football
          supporters into their area, provide good value for money to the
          clubs who pay for the hire of our services and display a high
          standard of smartness and professionalism before large gatherings
          of the public.

1.2       It    accepted that there will be slight variations in policing
           at the five football league grounds to cater for the different
      j   conditions appertaining at each of them but the standard methods
           set out in this - report will be followed throughout the police
           district.

1.3       It will be the responsibility of Superintendent (Operations) to
           circulate amendments to these instructions but it will be the
           duty of divisional commanders to bring to the notice of the Chief
          Superintendent (Operations and      Traffic) recommendations for
          amending this order, resulting from their experience in policing
           football matches.

1.4       With a view to these standing instructions being frequently
          evaluated, they will be      discussed at a Chief Constable's
          Conference mid-way through the football season and also following
          the end of the season.   These discussions will coincide with the
          inspection of football grounds by the South Yorkshire County
          Council Working Party involved with the Safety of Sports Grounds
          Act 1975.


COMMAND STRUCTURE

2.1       The officer in charge of policing football league matches will be
           of not less than superintendent rank, with the exception of
           matches being played at Bell Vue, Doncaster, where the rank of
           the officer should not be less than chief inspector, unless the
           match is one where, because of abnormal circumstances, an officer
           of not less than superintendent should be deployed.

2.2       General policing outside the ground should te the responsibility
           of an officer not less than chief inspector rank, but in the case
           of Doncaster the rank may be that of an inspector. The duties of
           the officer outside the ground will encompass the prevention of
           public disorder, the supervision of car and coach parks, anti­
           vandalism patrols, the supervision of licc-rs-'X*   -Tribes in the
           vicinity of the ground and the escorting ox get     oi supporters
           to and from the ground.




                                                                                1
                                       (2)


OPERATIONAL ORDER

3.1        It is necessary to use a standard format for operational orders
           for football matches within the force area with additions to
           cater for local conditions.   The format shown at Appendix 'A'
           will be adopted.


BRIEFING ARRANGEMENTS

4.1        The Officer in Corrcnand will, as far as is practicable, undertake
            his briefing within the       close confines of the ground in
            sufficient time to allow officers to take up their duties within
            the ground before the gates are open to the public, and outside
            the ground before the main body of spectators arrive in the
           vicinity of the stadium. .

4.2       ,l All officers will be briefed with uniformed officers being
            paraded in three ranks ready for inspection.      It will be the
             responsibility of the briefing officer to see that each officer
             is fully instructed in his duties and is smartly turned out
      ’     including having his hair cut to an acceptable length and his
      1     be aid or moustache trimmed - one     man of scruffy appearance
            standing before a crowd of spectators discredits the force as a
            whole. Officers not coming up to the acceptable standard will be
             advised and returned inmediately' to their sub-division or
            station.    The officer in command will subsequently report the
            matter to that officer's divisional corrmander. "

4.3        Points to consider during inspections and briefing, whilst not in
           themselves exhaustive, are set out in Appendices 'B' and 'C'.


MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS

5.1        In estimating manpower requirements, the     following factors must
           be considered:

             i)   the inportance to each club of the result, ie            league
                   position, local reputation in 'derby' games, etc;

            ii)   the history of previous encounters between     clubs and the
                   supporters of the clubs;

           iii)   the absence of other fixtures in the area;

            iv)   the likely number    of    visiting   spectators   and   their
                   reputation;

             v)   -relationships of public transport systems to the stadium,
                   ie rail stations, bus routes-, etc - personnel will be
                   required to protect premises 'en route' to and from the
                   stadium;

            vi)   the geographical features of each ground and location in
                   relation to town or city centres - the arrival of early
                   transport encourages supporters to        ..leaping areas
                  which require extra protection.
                                     (3)


5.2       To assist in identifying 'manpower requirements' a Football
          Liaison Officer has been appointed within Operations and Traffic
          Division.   It is his responsibility to collate and disseminate
          intelligence relative to fixtures within South Yorkshire.      He
          will liaise with his counterparts in other force areas and supply
          information in respect of South Yorkshire Clubs and supporters
          travelling to 'away' fixtures.    This officer will work closely
          with divisional officers     responsible for football policing
          arrangements.

5.3       It is vital not to underestimate the police commitment, but it is
          inpractical to lay down a basic overall police detail. This can
          only be determined locally, through experience of the conditions
          applying to the area and of the stadium concerned and also of the
          reputation of the home and visiting supporters.     Additional to
          officers employed on public order duties, officers will be
          required for the police control room, detective and plain clothes
          duties, prisoner reception, transport crews, traffic points,
          motor cycle and traffic      patrols, mounted and dog duties,
          supported by an adequate mobile reserve for emergencies.

5.4      Whenever possible community constables should be used to police
         the same areas of the ground at every match to try and establish
         a rapport with supporters and co identify and eliminate any
         disorderly section of supporters.

          Inspectors, sergeants and constables should also, if at all
          possible, police the same areas of the ground so that they become
          fully aware of the problems in their sector.

5.5      Football matches will be graded by divisional commanders using
          their experience of previous    encounters between the clubs
         concerned and intelligence from the Football Liaison Officer and
          local football clubs. The criteria for grading is outlined at
         Appendix 'D'. The Chief Superintendent (Operations and Traffic)
         will be involved in the planning of all category 'A' and 'B'
         matches, and it will be his responsibility to keep the Assistant
         Chief Constable (Operations) informed of police plans for such
          commitments.

5.6      The criteria for calculating the charge to clubs   for the hiring
          of police officers is given at Appendix 'E'.


METHODS OF DEPLOYING PERSONNEL

Uniformed Officers

6.1       After a general briefing by the Officer in Command, all uniformed
          officers will as far as possible be designated to a serial. J.t
          will be the responsibility of the Officer in Command to deploy
          his serials according to the special needs of the particular
          stadium.   Whenever possible, officers within and outside the
          ground will be employed in serials of one sergeant and ten men,
          with an inspector to every three serials.




                                                                              3
                                        (4)


6.2      Serials will be deployed both inside and outside the        ground
          during the pre-match period, then mainly inside the ground during
          the duration of the game. The operational order should allow for
          the withdrawal of certain serials from within the ground as the
          match nears its end to facilitate dispersal of the spectators and
          prevent public disorder.

6.3      Operational orders will emphasise the need for police serials to
          march to their tasks or appointed positions and for units less
          than serials to march or walk in single file especially around
          the perimeter track. The order will specify individual duties
          for each serial so that supervisory officers are aware of their
          exact roles prior to, during ani after the match.    Each serial
          serceant will be responsible for completing a debriefing form at
          the end of each match (as shown at Appendix *1*).

Detective and Plain Clothes Personnel

6.4      The main function of detective and plain clothes officers at
          football matches is the prevention and detection of crime outside
         the ground, particularly in relation to the theft of and f::om
         unattended motor vehicles.    They will be used at the discretion
         of the Divisional Conmander.       Officers so ertployed will be
         equipped with radios to enable them, if necessary, to be called
         into the ground to supplement those officers given specific
         duties within the stadium.

6.5      Detective and plain clothes officers may also be used outside the
         ground to gather intelligence in relation to the mood of
         supporters using licensed premises and for spotting the carriage
         of offensive weapons by supporters making their way to and from
         the stadium.

6.6      A number of detective or plain clothes officers will be detailed
         for duty within the ground to investigate reports of crime and on
         special occasions to concentrate on particular facets of crime,
         for instance pick pockets      are known to travel with sons
         supporters and certain clubs attract ticket forgers for 'all
         ticket' matches.   Uniformed officers and not detective or plain
         clothes officers will be involved in the supervision of licensed
         bars within the football stadium.


ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

Transport and Mobile Reserves

7.1      The use of resources additional to those kept on division, ie the
         command vehicle or force coach, will be considered by the Officer
          in Command and particularly so for category 'A' and 'B' matches.

7.2      At least one divisional personnel carrier with a driver and
         police attendant will be available at each football fixture for
         the carriage of prisoners.        When the detention vehicle is
         avaiJable,     - should toe used.




                                                                              4
                            (5)


 7.3      There will be a mobile contingency held in reserve at every
           football league fixture.   The use of such a reserve will be for
           two main purposes, ie as a unit in radio contact with the Officer
           in Command and available for deployment to any situation and,
           secondly, to afford assistance in the escorting of supporters
           between public service termini and the stadium.

 7.4      The use of a personnel carrier containing one sergeant and ten
           constables in the immediate vicinity of the football ground has a
           moderating influence on the behaviour of supporters.          The
           divisional crime and anti-vandal patrols will be considered for
           such a reserve strength.    However, it should be borne in rrt.nd
           that crime and vandal squads may be withdrawn at any time to
           perform duties at major incidents. They should not, therefore,
           be considered when planning manpower requirements, or be included
           in Operational Orders.

 7‘
  .5      The motor cycle wings      will     be used for facilitating the
           unhindered movement of traffic    to and from the football grounds
           and for escorting visiting team   coaches into and out of the force
           area when requested to do so by   Divisional Commanders.

 Police Horses

 7.6      Police horses are invaluable in the policing of football matches.
          They should be used to escort visiting supporters to and from the
          ground in the segregation of opposing fans, regulating queues at
          turnstiles and clearing the playing area in the event of serious
          crowd invasion. A mounted officer has a greater field of vision
          than his contenporary on foot and is of such value that police
          horses will be used at every first team football fixture in South
          Yorkshire. When necessary, a request will be made to the Chief
          Superintendent (Operations and Traffic) for the hiring of horses
          from other police forces.   During the game mounted horses, where
          possible, will be on view to the spectators. Their presence has
          a moderating influence upon potential hooligans.

.Police Dogs

,7.7      On 9 November 1976, the Hc*re Office Standing Advisory Committee
          on Police Dogs agreed that while dogs can be used to deal
          effectively with small groups of hooligans, they should not
          normally be used when large crowds are present.     The Committee
          pointed out that the presence of dogs may well appear provocative
          and if surrounded by unruly crowds would be likely to be care
          excited and bite indiscriminately.

 7.8      Whilst the Conmittee advocated the retention of dogs in a reserve
          capacity, it could see no objection to their use as a deterent at
          railway stations, car or coach parks or along routes to football
          grounds.   It advised that dogs should not be used within the
          playing area at football, matches or other sporting events unless
          there were exceptional reasons.     This advice does not preclude
          the officer in charge from allowing them to be paraded around the
          perimeter track before the kicl--off and during half-tirrc so a:- to
          interest the spectators in their presence.




                                                                                 5
                                            (6)


    7.9       The Officer    in Command will take the      above advice into
              consideration but he has the overriding discretion to use police
              dogs if he considers their use absolutely necessary to avoid a
              dangerous public disorder situation.

    Specialist Equipment

    7.10      In due course it is hoped to arrange with football clubs for the
              acquisition and use of closed circuit television and video
              recording equipment as at Sheffield Wednesday's ground. At this
              stage the only visual aid which will be used at football fixtures
              will be binoculars which have been supplied to each station
              concerned with the five football stadiums. Divisional Commanders
              should also consider using the fccilities of Audio Visual Aids

    7.11      The use of 'spotters' with binoculars in radio contact both w;.th
              the police control room and arresting officers, is a technic{ue
              which has been successfully employed nationally.      .They can
              concentrate on particular sections of the terraces renowned for
              disorder, where pick-pockets are operating, from where missiles
              are being thrown into the playinc area, etc.
P
    7.12      Once offenders      have been located by the 'spotters', other
              officers can be     guided into the crowds and directed by radio to
              persons to be       arrested.     'Spotters' will submit evidence
              accordingly.

    7.13      Consideration should be given to using a helicopter for traffic
              control, and identifying public disorder situations in connection
              with category 'A' matches and possibly category 'B' games.
              Requests for a helicopter      will be directed to the Chief
              Superintendent (Operations and Traffic) for decision by Assistant
              Chief Constable (Operations).

    Special Constables

    7.14      The presence of special constables at football grounds is
              acknowledged as a valuable supplement to the regular force. This
              is especially relevant in crowd situations where an enhanced
P             uniform presence contributes to the observance of public order.

    7.15     Special Constables can be used as a deterrent factor but whenever
             possible they should not be employed in volatile situations.

    Force Press Officer - Media

    7.16     The Force Press Officer will be consulted for press publicity in
             relation to other than the normal fixture.     It has been found
             from experience that there are advantages in publicising police
             plans for matches likely to attract large crowds.




                                                                                    6
                                     (7)


Refreshments

7.17      The provision of refreshments is necessary for all matches.
          Usually this can take the form of pre-packed tea, coffee or soup
          beverages, but for major functions the Force Catering Officer
          will be consulted about providing a substantial meal for officers
          on longer tours of duty. Such rreals could be provided within the
          ground, or nearby, and if necessary by outside caterers.


TOE MOVEMENT OF SPECTATORS

8.1      The movement of spectators to and from a football ground can
         present a threat to public safety through conflict between heme
         and visiting supporters.    The basic strategy for dealing w.vth
         football hooliganism, as with all public order events, is to
         ensvtre segregation of the opposing factions.   This segregation
         should be planned in three stages - before, during and after the
         match, as is set out at Appendix 'F'.


TRAFFIC FLOW

9.1      The five main football stadia in South Yorkshire were purposely
          constructed in residential areas to cater for mass spectator
          attendance. That situation was no doubt satisfactory at the time
          but the advent of mo d e m transport in current times has resulted
          in serious congestion and       conflict between pedestrian and
          vehicular movement.

9.2      Controlled parking can    be   a   contributory factor to easing
          congestion but cannot,   in   a   residential area, be a total
          solution.

9.3*     There must be an acceptance by persons attending a football
         match, whether on foot or otherwise, that delay and congestion
         will arise and must be endured when in close proximity to a
          ground.   It is our duty, however, to make every effort to
         minimise delay and congestion by whatever means possible.

9.4      During the pre-match period there is usually less of a traffic
         problem because spectators stagger their arrival at the ground
         during the hour preceding kick-off time.     Notices showing the
         whereabouts of coach and car parks should be displayed.

9.5      At this time previous intelligence enquiries will have been of
          assistance to determine the     number of visiting supporters
         expected and their mode of travel. Once known and identified,
         arrangements should be made for their routing and arrival at the
         designated parking areas at a time shortly preceding 'kick-off'.
         This strategy of delayed arrival of visitors reduces the time for
         pre-match disorder problems.




                                                                               7
                                       (8)


9.6        It will be necessary for more widespread and advanced traffic
            arrangements to be made when the fixture in question is of major
            importance, in particular a semi-final match involving teams from
           different areas of the country.        On such occasions it is
            important to establish a      close liaison with the motoring
           organisations and local authorities for pre-determined routes to
           be taken by vehicular traffic.

9.7 .      Traffic Division through the Chief Superintendent (Operations and
           Traffic) or the Traffic Group Superintendent, will be involved in
           giving advice upon traffic arrangements for all football matches
           and traffic officers will be used to supplement territorial
           divisional personnel.


'MATCH' AND DIVISIONAL CONTROLS - FOR OPERATIONS ROOM

10.1       It is essential in the interest of efficiency that every first
            team football fixture in South Yorkshire should be controlled by
       ;   radio from a Police Control Ro o t situated within the stadium, ie
       I   'tfetch Control'.  The officer ir charge of Match Control should
            not be of less rank than sergeant and be aided by at least one
            police constable.

10.2       There is no requirement for Force Operations Rocxn to be involved
           in the control of a normal football fixture but it is necessary
           foe: the Operations Roan Inspector to be fully aware of all police
           open ations in conections with football league matches, and this
           will be achieved by the supply of the relevant operational order.

10.3       Exceptions to this general principle will apply in relation to
           category 'A' and 'B' matches, when there will be an overall force
            involvement necessitating the use of the force communications
           vehicle with direct contact to the Operations Room.

10.4       Thrcwghout every match contact will be maintained between the
           stadium and the Divisional Control. By this means the Divisional
           Controller will be alerted quickly in the event of additional
           resources being required, and the requirement for resources
           beyond the capacity of the division will be referred immediately
           to Force Operations Roan, from where the Duty Officer will be
           responsible for obtaining the necessary additinal manpower and
           equipment.

10.5       The officer in charge of the Communications Department will visit
           stadiums to ensure efficient radio communications.

10.6       All supervisory officers will      be   supplied   with   radios   to
           facilitate control and deployment.


STANDARDISATION OF METHODS OF PROCESSING PRISONERS

11.1       There will be a standard procedure for th" processing of
           offenders detained at football matches. rr’V    :’.on-'sod at
           Appendix 'G* and the standard forms to be Uc.a are shown at
           Appendix 'H'.




                                                                                   8

CRIME PREVENTION

12.1       Each of the five football league grounds within South Yorkshire
            Police area has been visited and a survey corpleted by a
            divisional crime prevention officer.

12.2       The surveys had a two-fold function:

            i)     To ensure the general security of the premises, ie
                    the adminitrative offices, the Development Fund
                    Offices where much of the clubs' revenues are
                    collected and the Supporters' Club where varying
                    amounts of cash accrue frc/n the sale of liquor.

           ii)     Evaluate the systems currently in   use in relation
                    to the care and control of cash.

12.3       The police can prevent crime by protecting persons dealing with
            or conveying money within the ground and officers in command will
       j   make adequate supervision available to cater for this objective.
       I


12.4       To ensure that standards of security are maintained, divisional
            crime prevention officers will re-visit the clubs at three-
           monthly intervals and report to divisional commanders. The visit
           will, on each occasion, include attending a football league match
           to check upon security systems. A copy of the report showing any
           action taken will be sent to the Detective Chief Inspector (Criire
           Prevention) for him to check upon uniformity of advice throughout
           the force area.

12.5       The consumption of alcohol before arrival at the football stadium
           often exacerbates police problems.   With a view to reducing this
           problem and thus preventing crime, advice will be given through
           the media, trade organisations, supporters clubs and the police
           of the area of visiting supporters, about the advisability of
           prohibiting the sale of alcohol in containers to obvious football
           supporters on natch days, the carriage of alcohol for consumption
           in coaches, and the stopping of coaches at licensed premises.
           The Chief Superintendent (Operations and Traffic) in conjunction
           with the local divisional cotmanders and the Force Press Officer
           will be responsible for giving this advice to the appropriate
           persons.

12.6       If the visiting supporters have a reputation for violence,
           endeavours will be made to bring forward the kick-off time to
           outside licensing hours.    Discussions for an early kick-off
           should be undertaken as soon as possible after the fixtures are
           published.




                                                                                9
                                      (10)


FOOTBALL GROUND FACILITIES

13.1     Every police coop lex at a sports stadium roast have good vehicular
         access and its location well signposted. It should have separate
          accesses for    public enquiry (lost/found      property, missing
         persons, complaints of crime etc) and prisoner reception.       The
         public enquiry section should include a reception desk and
          interview room.     There   should be facilities for prisoner
         reception and     processing linked with      separate and secure
         detention acconmodation for adults and juveniles. As an ideal
         there    should be    further accommodation     for briefing    and
         refreshment purposes.    Toilet facilities for both prisoners and
         police officers should be provided.

13.2     The availability of desirable po‘ice acconmodation is clearly a
         natter for the football club cor'cemed.      There should be full
         consultation between the club officials and the divisional
         officer concerned.     The Superintendent (Operations) ' will be
         available for advice regarding the: standard facilities required.


EMERGENCY EVACJATION PROCEDURES

14.1      Divisional Corrmanders should ensure that emergency procedures at
          each ground are adequate and are in accordance with the 'Green
          Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds' (paragraph 10.7) viz:

          (a)   It is essential that plans should be made for
                dealing   with   emergency  situations.      Joint
                consultation between the mangemant of the ground,
                police,   fire, ambulance   and other    emergency
                services should be held in order to produce agreed
                plans of action.

          (b)   While the public are in the ground an adequate
                 number of staff should be maintained to cover
                entrances, exits and other strategic points.

          (c)   All such staff should be trained in the use of the
                fire fighting equipment provided and in the action
                to be taken in the event of a fire.

14.2     Divisions should include details of evacuation plans, emergency
         warning systems etc, in their operational orders.


FOOTBALL MATCH SUMMARY/INTELLIGENCE

15.1     A Football Match Surttnary has been designed by the ACPO Ce::3 rel
         Purposes Sub-Corrmittee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events as part
         of a comprehensive and systematic approach to intelligence
         gathering for the coming football season. (Appendix: 'K' copy and
         specimen.)




                                                                               10
                                       (11)


 15.2      It is intended that the Summary (ADM/124) will be completed
           by the Police Liaison Officer for the home club and forwarded
           without delay to the Headquarters Football Liaison Officer so
           that intelligence about fans behaviour at both home and away
           fixtures will be collated and made available for future matches
           involving that club.

 15.3      The Summary also includes an Appendix showing details of those
           arrested, charged or ejected and the offences or misbehaviour
           cortplained of. It should not be restricted to areas of hooligan­
           ism inside football grounds but is intended to cover all such
           behaviour associated with a particular match, whether taking
           place inside football grounds, adjoining streets, public houses,
           railway/coach stations or other vanues where football supporters
           gather.    It should also give details of incidents involving
           supporters travelling through tne county to other        matches.
           This will allow for regular offenders to be identified and sub­
           sequently targeted so that a systematic build-up of intelligence
           will result.

15.4       Misbehaviour by football supporters whilst travelling on trains
           or ferries or on British Rail property is already collated by
           British Transport .Police as part o f a conprehensive intelligence
           system operated by that Force.      This information is available
           to Force Liaison Officers through their British Rail couterparts
           and is recorrmended as part of the nationwide intelligence gather­
           ing system.

INSPECTION OF FOOTBALL STADIUMS

16.1      A Working Party has been forrred under the control of the South
          Yorkshire County Council to carry out its responsibilities under
          the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.        This Working Party
          comprises representatives of the Chief Executive of the South
          Yorkshire County Council, representatives of the Building Author­
          ity of the council concerned, the Chief Fire Officer and the
          Chief Constable of South Yorkshire.      Arrangements have been
          made for the Working Party to visit the football stadiums twice
          a year, at the beginning and mid-way through the season, and
          on any other occasion as the need demands, to ensure the safety
          of spectators.    The Chief Constable has delegated his duties
          to the Superintendent (Operations Division), to whcyn problems
          in relation to safety should immediately be notified, so that
          the secretary of the Working Party can be informed, with a view
          to the problem being examined without delay and before the next
          football league match.

LIAISON BETWEEN CLUB MANAGEMENT AND THE POLICE

17.1      There are considerable benefits to be gained from a close person­
          al liaison with the directors and management of football clubs.
          The establishing of such a working relationship by divisional
          commanders is essential to the success of police operations.

GENERAL BRIEFING

1.       The officer in command will wherever possible conduct his
         briefing within the confines of the stadium in sufficient tims to
         allow officers to take up their duties before the gates are
         opened to the public, and before the main body of spectators
         arrive in the vicinity of the stadium.

2.       The briefing should set the tone of the operation and should also
         communicate the standard of policing expected of all officers. A
         plan of the ground will be displayed to assist in the briefing.

         Lack of a thorough briefing will result in a loss of efficiency.
         It is inperative that this force is seen to discharge its dutios
         effectively. A deliberate and precise briefing at the outset of
         an operation is seen as essential towards this end.

4.       Officers will be paraded in three ranks and            inspected   for
         smartness and dress which will be as follows:

           i)      Male uniformed patrol sergeants and constables will wear

                 at football fixtures.

         iii)   Traffic patrol officers will parade in full uniform and
                 flat caps and be in possession of anorak, and traffic
                 motor cyclists will parage in standard motor cycling kit.
                 Traffic officers will be briefed with other officers
                 involved in the operation unless specifically excused by
                 the officer    in command due to     their duties being
                 undertaken some distance away from the stadium.       Any
                 officer not attending the briefing will be briefed by
                 other means.

          iv)   Mounted officer will wear full uniform and protective

                 they wear the short 'wet suit' jacket normally used for
                training and patrol duties.

          vi)      CID officers will wear convention.-' ' ’        1 'ho3   and
                   report for briefing with their uniform col-ieuyues.

        to stop the use1 of obscenities by spectators, including those in
        team 'dug outs*.

               Breach of the Peace - Justices of the   PeaceAct, 1361
               Breach of the Peace - Common Law, etc
               and

                                 (18)


17.   The operational order will be distributed to all supervisory
      ranks who will be responsible for a more detailed briefing of the
      officers under their charge.    This briefing will enphasise the
      way officers will undertake their duties, working as a team.

                                                             APPENDIX 'D'

GRADING CRITERIA


Category 'A'

Typical of a match which warrants a Category 'A' grading will be a Football
Association Cup Final, International or local 'derby' fixture.

Category 'B'

A match whic'i merits such a grading wil.l be one where serious public
disorder can be anticipated from the considerations msntioned at paragraph
5 of the Standing Instructions. The number of police officers to be used
for such a mitch should be increased by at least two serials above the
number allocated for duty at a Category 'C' match.

Category 'C'

Such a match is one thought unlikely to result in serious disorder after
giving cons iiierat ion to the matters at paragraphs 5.1 to 5.4 of ;he
Standing Instructions.

                                                                   APPENDIX 'E'

    CRITERIA FOR LEVYING CHARGES FDR POLICE SERVICES

    The amount levied for police personnel doing duty in the stadium will be
    related to crowd attendance and the incorporation of a constant basic
    number.   At all tines this basic number will be one sergeant and five
    constables. The number of constables will be increased by three for each
    2,000 spectators.   The number of sergeants will be increased in the ratio
    of one to every nine constables. A charge will be levied for the services
    of an inspector for a gate of over 9,0C0 and will be increased by an
    additional inspector for every four sergeants. In addition, there will be
    a charge for a chief inspector whenever the spectator attendance reaches or
    exceeds 35,000 and for a superintendent whenever the gate exceeds 49,000.
    The chart below illustrates this criteria.

    CONTROL OF SPECTATORS

    PRE-MATCH

    The main risk of a pre-match clash between supporters is in the immediate
    vicinity of the ground and on public transport. Home teams' supporters
    often congregate at some distance from the ground so as to arrive in a
    group, either on foot or using public transport.       They should not be
    allowed to loiter at the approaches to the ground and officers should be
    instructed at briefing to ensure that persons are not allowed to congregate
    until acutally in the designated spectator areas within the confines of the
    stadium.

    An increased police presence will have the desired effect of discouraging
    rowdyism and vandalism. This applies to post-match also.

    Special police arrangements always need to be made at railway stations end
*   on routes which visiting coaches will use.

    The use of mobile patrols in the form of the mobile reserve, motor cyclists
    and mounted officers in the immediate vicinity of the ground have a good
    moderating influence on the behaviour of the supporters. Thought should be
    given to the need for selective searches, both inside and outside the
    ground and particularly at transport termini.

    Posting police officers to the vicinity of public houses to encourage
    separate use by either 'heme' or 'away' adult supporters and not both, has
    been found to reduce pre-match incidents.

    Consideration should also be given to police visits being made at selected
    licensed premises.   Other known trouble spots, especially those on coach
    routes, if applicable, should be identified and policed.

    The uise of signs to ensure that supporters go to the appropriate section of
    the staidum and do not accidentally mix with the opposition supporters is
f   essential.

    A most useful instrument available to the police in their responsibility
    for crowd control within the stadium is the tannoy or public address
    system. This facility should at all times be available to the police and
    it is essential this equipment should be proved effective throughout the
    ground and thoroughly tested before each fixture.

    IN THE STADIUM

    The crucial period for disorder is in the half-hour irrrrediately preceding
    the garre and maximum police strength should be available at that time. The
    use of 'entertainment' during this per Lod is valuable       in turning the
    attention of supporters away from disorder and clubs should be encouraged
    to make the necessary provision.




                                                                                   24
Segregation of supporters within the stadium is essential. As a matter of
policy clubs must be influenced to provide barriers, sectorised fencing and
other services (toilets and snack bars etc) which will facilitate effective
separation of opposing supporters. It should not be necessary for police
to undertake a task which could better be performed by manufactured
barriers.

Attempts to    'capture' the opposing    supporters'   end   is   a   problem,
particularly at 'local derby' matches.

The most common way this is attempted is by home supporters gaining access
to one end of a terrace before visiting supporters arrive. Police should
be in position early to prevent this but sometimes the supporters take care
to be unident:Lfiable until in sufficient numbers to cause trouble.

It is considered that the appropriate police strategy, if this occurs, is
to cordon them off and contain than, not tc- attempt to move them elsewhere,
unless numbers are so small as to make it a sirrple police operation. (The
fact | this occurs is a strong argument in favour of sectionalised end
terraces.)

It occasionally occurs that an attenpt is made to capture 'ends' after they
are fully occupied by opposing supporters.      The most effective way of
preventing this is the erection of a fence around the whole of the
perimeter track and adequate partitioning of the various sections of the
ground to prevent unauthorised movement of the spectators, as mentioned
above. If in the absence of such fences and partitions the attenpt occurs,
the only available strategy is interposing police officers between the two
factions and sending reserves in from the rear or both sides.      Officers
should never go into the crowd alone to deal with trouble.

Where serious disorder occurs in a section of the crowd, it is not good
strategy to attempt to clear the whole terrace, whether onto the pitch or
otherwise.   It is better to drive a double line of police officers,
preferably from the rear or side of the terrace, towards the centre of the
trouble.   Reserves can then be fed in between the police lines to make
arrests.   Where disorder of this kind is anticipated the strategic
positioning of ample reserves is inportant.

Clubs should be encouraged to provide perimeter fencing and partitioning as
previously described but where such fencing is not provided, there may be
occasions when a pitch invasion occurs.        Such invasions could have
differing motivations.   In the event of a surge onto the playing area to
avoid scenes on the terraces, clearly police attention must be directed to
stabilising that position and spectators can 'then be returned.      In the
event of an invasion designed to disrupt play, all uncommitted officers and
as a last resort police dogs on short leads, should go onto the playing
area and clear it under the direction of the Officer in Command.       That
officer should consider the mood and object of the offending spectators and
deploy his resource accordingly with a view to protectiny players and
officials and effecting the return of the supporters to the terraces, if
necessary by a 'sweep' of the playing area.
                                      (26)


Where there is a capacity crowd, supporters are often locked out and can
becoms frustrated and hostile and have to be supervised by the police. In
order to alleviate this problem clubs on appropriate occasions should be
advised to have 'all ticket' games.     Correct allocation of such tickets
will further assist the desired segregation of opposing teams.


POST MATCH

Most of the strategy suggested for 'pre-match' apply equally to after the
match, particularly in relation to preventing the congregation of fans, as
this often heralds an attack on opposing supporters.

On accasions there can be advantages of holding back visiting supporters
until the main body of hare supporters has left or vice versa.      If this
manoeuvre is selected, sufficient manpower must be available to achieve the
objective without keeping the gates closed.

Police horses are very useful in this context.     Experience has shown that
keeping the gates closed after match is likely to result in police officers
and spectators being crushed against the solid partitions.        The tannoy
system should be used to announce any such rranoeuvre before the match ends,
and the announcement should be repeated and the spectators exorted to be
patient.   Spectators should be held in such a position for a mininrum
period. Details of these procedures have been included in the literature
to be sent to visiting clubs by Football Liaison Section prior to fixtures
in this Force area.

In any case, provision must be made for escorting visiting supporters to
their coaches or the relevant railway stations in a conpact unit.    This
will entail close supervision by as many mounted, dog and foot patrol
officers as possible. Additionally, there should be a liberal presence of
police officers along the prescribed route to prevent attacks by horns
supporters.   Officers should join the escort through 'roll-up' tactics,
thus strengthening police presence.
   «
There should be a follow up vehicle to accormodate prisoners     should the
occasion arise for arrests to be made.

Coach operators should, wherever possible, be warned in advance not to
arrive at the designated coach parks until a specified time.    This is in
order to afford police protection of the vehicles throughout the duration
of their stay and to prevent visiting supporters arriving too early.
Liaison with British Rail should be established to co-ordinate arrival and
departure times of special trains.

Having escorted visiting supporters to their transport it is stressed that
coaches must not be released until such time as the surrounding area is
clear of home supporters. When released they must be escorted in convoy as
far as is deemed necessary to ensure their safety.        Police divisional
boundaries should be ignored for this purpose. Where Force boundaries are
concerned, neighbouring Forces should be notified and asked to take over
the escort responsbility when the convoy enters their area.

PROCESSING PRISONERS

The following procedures will be implemented throughout this          force area
when offenders are detained at football matches:

(a)       Every detained person must    be taken   imrediately to    the Police
           Room within the ground.

(b)       The circumstances    of the detention must then be the subject of
           full enquiry by a supervisory officer of at least sergeant rank.
          At this stage, a decision will be made as to whether the person
          will be charged, processed by surnnons or ejected.   If the facts
           reveal only an infringement of the Ground Regulations, that
          person should be ejected forthwith, via the Police Room, where
           only his name and address should be recorded.

(c)       Prisoners should    be photographed with the arresting officer by
          use cf a Polaroid camera. This photograph should show the facifl
           features of both the prisoner and the arresting officer.

(d)       The prisoner should be searched and his personal property placed
           in a property bag.   Any property subject of a possible charge
           should be placed in a separate bag suitably labelled and cross
           referenced.

(e)       The prisoner's details should then be documented to expedite his
           speedy flow through the reception area, thereby allowing the
           arresting officer to return to his match duties with the minimum
           of delay.   Standard forms will be introduced for this purpose
           (Appendix 'H').    The corrpleted form and photograph will be
           affixed to the property bag of the relevant prisoner.         The
           arresting officer should retain a carbonised copy of this form.

(f)   •   All prisoners with their property will be conveyed to a nominated
           police station.   In the case of those arrested at either of the
           Sheffield football grounds, the Central Charge Office, Bridge
           Street, will be the designated police station.   At this station
           there will be present a prisoner reception squad, capable of
           obtaining the prisoner's photograph, finger inpressions and
           antecedent details.     In addition, form Gen/29, (Record of
           Detention and Charge) will be conpleted.

(g)       The prisoner should then be charged and formally cautioned,
          normally by a member of the prisoner reception squad and not
          necessarily the arresting officer and a pre-prepared statement
          form conpleted by the Charging Officer.

(h)       On corrpletion of his match duties, the arresting officer should
          attend the nominated police station and corrplete a 'short'
          prosection file.

(i)       Juvenile prisoners should be processed by this same method but
          care mast be taken to separate them from adult prisoner? and to
          ensure that existing procedures in relation to juvu:,. l -o
          adhered to.




                                                                                   ’2 1
                                     (28)


Pursuance of the above procedure in relation to adult prisoners will
eliminate the necessity for the preparation of a full file unless a plea of
'not guilty' is entered.


THE PRODUCTION OF PRISONERS BEFORE COURT

There is considerable merit in the production of prisoners before court at
the earliest possible occasion following the commission of the alleged
offence. This will encourage the speedy disposal of justice with a minimum
of administration.

When disorder is anticipated, Divisional Cormanders should liaise with che
Chief Inspector, Headquarters Prosecutions, or the Prosecutions Inspector
at 'A', 'B' and 'C' Divisions, to identify a suitable date to which alleged
offenders should be bailed.

On occasions when it is considered that it would be an advantage to hold a
special court to sit on a Saturday evening then arrangements should also be
made via the appropriate senior officer of the Divisional Prosecutions
Department.

Hie question of bail should be considered on the merits of each case witiin
the existing i:erms of the Bail Act 1976.

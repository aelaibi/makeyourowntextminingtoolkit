                            QUESTION                 THREE

    Why was the game not delayed, as a number of police officers
    thought it should have been, when it became obvious that it would
    not be possible to get all the Liverpool fans safely into the ground
    before the 3 pm kick-off?

    Consideration to delay the kick-off was in Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's mind as
    the build up progressed, through his conversation with Superintendent Murray.
    However when the time to consider taking up the option to postpone the kick-off was
    reached staff in the Police Control Room were overcome by other events principally
    the fault with the radio communications and soon after, as the teams were on the
    pitch, the option to delay became more difficult. Danger to life and injury would be the
    purpose for delaying the kick-off.

    OBSERVATIONS
    Please see pages 1 6 -4 1 , Volume 2.


    Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report

    226. At various stages in his evidence, Mr Duckenfield gave three accounts of why he
    thought it too late to postpone kick-off. Once it was that one of the teams had already
    come onto the pitch. Then it was that a group of photographers at the tunnel had
    wrongly led him to think that the teams were coming out. Finally, he did not know why
    he thought the teams were coming out. They did not in fact come onto the pitch until
    2.54 pm, two minutes after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked
    for a postponement of kick-off before gate C was opened. It should not, however,
    have needed a Police Constable in the thick of the crowd (and there were others of
    like mind) to think of postponing the kick-off. The need should have been clear in the
    control room.

    227. The truth was that Mr Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed
    with Mr Murray. Kick-off would not be postponed unless there were some major
    cause for delayed arrivals eg a jam on the motorway or fog. I accept that the thinking
    behind this policy was not callous or punitive. If kick-off is postponed whenever a
    proportion of fans choose to leave the public houses late, the practice may grow and
    kick-off times would become meaningless. But, a commander must deal with the
    problem of the day. Faced with a situation which was becoming dangerous, crowd
    safety should have been his paramount consideration. Kick-off should have been
    delayed.


    Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report Recommendation 29
    29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in
    command at the ground. Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in
    deciding whether to exercise it.

     r e f e r e e ? - A. Yes.

Q.   In fact as we know that arrang e m e n t d i d not work as it
     h a p p e n e d , but that was the arra n g e m e n t ? - A . Y e s , the
     a r r a n g e m e n t was that a P o l i c e Offi c e r at the tunnel would
     c o m m u n i c a t e wit h the l i n esman nearest to the players' tunnel,
     wh o would then i n d i c a t e to the referee.            Unfortunately, that
     was not prompt enough.

     c o n s i d e r e d at this s t a g e    the circumstances under which you
     m i g h t p o s t p o n e k i c k-off?   - A. I had earlier during the build
     up to the operation, but                 not earlier that particular day.

          MR. COLLINS:   I d o n ’t know,              sir,   whether you would like
     to go into that tomorrow?

                                               D.G. DUCKENFIELD

Q. We know that was in fact the situation because we have
   heard plenty of evidence to that effect.     h . I did not
   receive that information sir.

Q. Did you instruct, as part of your briefing, your Sector
   Commanders outside or any officers to give you that
   information should the occasion arise?  - A. No sir, I
   would expect them to give it m e .

Q. Oh Chief Superintendent is that fair to them really to
   expect them of their own volition to give that sort of
   information, which isn't immediately obvious as being vital
   information, to you as Ground Controller?  - A. They are
   trained Police Officers sir.

Q. Yes but they have to be briefed don't they, and they
   expect to receive instructions from their superiors don't
   thev?  - A. They are trained Police Officers who police
   football matches regularly.

Q. You see what you appear to be saying is that you would
   expect vour subordinates to take all the steps necessary
   of"their own initiative to fill you in as things went o n .
   is that really fair to them?  - A. It is fair sir.   They
   are trained Police Officers, they are accustomed to this
   situation and they are out there to advise me.

Q. Even if they don't know that circumstances ace such and
   unusual circumstances have arisen which render the
   necessity to give the advice from your end that they don't
   know about?   - A. At 2.30 sir I didn't consider it
   unu s u a l .

Q.   Well you didn't know what was usual did you, because you
     had no experience.     A. I have experience of crowds at
     football matches sir.

Q. Yes but not at Hillsborough and not at the Leppings Lane
   turnstiles.       - A.    Not at the Leppings Lane turnstiles
   but Su pe ri nt en de nt Marshall, who has experience, could
   ass es s* t h e situation and advise me.

q   . You say, going back to your statement, and I have got page
      5.  Please have it in front of you if you wish.  Having
      dealt with 2.30 and the question about whether you get
      people in you say this in your statement:

                 "?ibout this time I asked Superintendent
                 Murray to clarify with me the circum­
                 stances under which we would consider
                 delaying kick-off."

      -   A. Yes sir.


                                                              18

                                                      D.G. DUCKENFIELD



          Q. Presumably you asked him that because you were concerned
             as to whether you ought possibly to delay the kick-off.
             A. No sir, not specifically.

          Q. Why did you raise it then if it wasn't in your mind as
      B      something which was a possibility?  - A. As a new
             Commander, and thinking through many of the developments
             in a semi-final tie, I asked him to clarify with me the
             situation for delaying kick-offs, and it was a general
             conversation.

          Q. Did you not know then what was the contingency plan for
             delaying kick-off, because it was your responsibility and
             no-one else's, to decide on whether kick-off should be
             delayed wasn't it?  -   A. Yes sir.

          Q.   Had you not clear in your mind before you started what
               were the circumstances under which you would delay kick-
               off?  - A. As I said earlier I had had a discussion with
               Superintendent Murray and during the day, as with many
      D        things to clarify my thoughts, I asked him for advice
               once more.

          Q. Whv did you need his advice because you surely had already
             made the decision of the circumstances under which kick-
             off would be postponed.     A. I discussed with
             Superintendent Murcay many things, and I just discussed
             with him that point to refresh my memory.

          Q. And you go on in your statement to identify what you have
             already given us in evidence, namely that you had
             previously agreed that if there was an identifiable
             problem, for example a serious incident, an accident on
             the motorway, fog or something like that which prevented
             large numbers of fans arriving on time, you should con-V
             sidsr delaying the kick-off.  - A. Yes sir.''       ~ ''

          Q. You go on to say:

                          "As opposed to those who had been brought
                          to the area within a reasonable time but
                          had chosen not to enter the ground as soon
                          as possible."

                  A. Yes s i r .

          Q. That suggests that you had taken a policy decision that if
             problems arose due to late arrival of fans because they
             chose to arrive late you wouldn't postpone the kick-off.
             - a . You have got to be vary careful in a situation such as
             this with regard to delaying kick-offs.   Now if there is a
      H      major incident then yes I would seriously consider
             delaying a kick-off as I have said.

Q. I appreciate that it is a big step to take and it is an
   unpopular step with the teams and no doubt with those
   responsible for staging the match, but it is a matter of
   common experience with policing football.matches is it
   not that people will try, if there is a build-up, if
   there are"any problems at the entrances, you get
   difficulties if people are pressing in to get in by kick-
   off?  - A. Yes sir.

Q. You have potential crowd problems.     -   A.   Yes sir.

Q. If you get a large number oc people who are not in the
   ground by kick-off.  7  A. Not necessarily.

Q. Thev get frustrated apart from anything else, they are
   liable to push, they are liable to try to take other
   measures to get in on time.  - A. If we deal with crowds
   generally and people who ace late for events, one would
   imagine that they queue and form orderly queues and
   behave normally.

Q. Are you a Police Officer speaking or ---         -   A. No I'm
   applying a generalisation.

Q. You may hope that, or imagine it, but it doesn't happen
   does it?  Certainly not with football crowds.   - A. But
   football crov/ds shouldn't be different to anybody else.

Q. Maybe they shouldn't, but it is a recognisable phenomenon
   that if you want to get to an event on time you do all you
   can to get to the turnstiles on time , and if there is a
   crush and a crowd of people you tend to get pushing.  It
   may be stupid but it tends to happen.  - A. It can occur.

Q. And it is something you should foresee.   - . A.      As a Police.
   Officer I can foresee the difficulties. .                       .

Q. So you could foresee the problem that if there was a crowd
   of people  still trying to get in through the Leppings
   Lane turnstiles at three o'clock, or just before three o'clc
   you might have a crowd control problem.  - A. I might.

Q. And more importantly you might have a safety problem
   because people can get crushed in that situation.        - A.
   If t h e s e * people are frustrated and they are pushing to get
   in .

 q   . And that is something which you foresaw.    -    A. Not on the
       semi-final day.

 Q. You foresaw surely as something which might happen if you
    had a large number of people trying to gt in or still out
    at or about kick-off.  - A. I think the point is sir that.-


                                                                    20

      there was a crowd at 2.30, thera was a crowd of people who
      ware trying to get in, and thera is potential for
      difficulties, but I didn't foresee at that time from the
      information supplied to me, that thece would be any
      difficulty.

Q. Let me put it this way - I know you didn't foresee any
   difficulty but let me ask you this:  you asked your
   question of Superintendent Murray at about half past two
   as to whether he thought you could get them all in on
   time.  - A. Yes sir.

Q.    He said he thought you could.    -   A. Yes sir.

Q.    If he had said, "No, I'm afraid we have got a build-up
      hera, I don't think we will be able to get them in in time,
      we are going to have problems." what would you have done?
         A. I would have seriously considered delaying kick-off.

Q. Exactly.  And why would you have seriously considered
   delaying kick-off?  - A. Because the advice I was being
   given was that thera was a difficulty.

Q.     But why would you delay kick-off in those circumstances?
      What difficulty did you foresee, or what problems did you
      foresee or what dangers did you foresea if you did not
      delay kick-off?    - A. Would you rephrase that again sir?

Q.     You say that if Hr. Murray had said to you, "I d o n 't think
      we will be able   to get all this lot in by three o'clock."
          A. At that stage I would have considered delaying kick-
      of f .

Q.    Why?   - A. Because if you can't get the fans in, and there
      was a’ considerable -number outside that we r a n 't getting
      there, I would have delayed the kick-off.

Q. But for what purpose?  To accommodate the fans or because
   you thought that thece might be otherwise crowd control
   problems and disorder problems outside,.or a combination
   of the two?  - A. No.   We are taking the point that -
   what I am saying is this:  if there were perceived
   difficulties that could have caused a major problem at
   2.30 and the advice I was being given is we should delay,
   I would have considered delaying.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     We are skirmishing.   Can I try
      and clarify:

q    . All counsel is asking is if you had decided to delay the
       kick-off against what risks would you have made that
       decision?  Why would you have thought it right to do it?
          A. If there was a danger to life and injury.


                                                               21

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Because that might arise if you d i d n ’t
     delay because of: people trying to get, right?  - A, Yes.

Q. Now why does it matter then whether people have chosen to
   arrive lata, or for whatever reason, the fact is if thera
   is a build-up outside that is what must trigger off the
   decision    surely.  - A. If it is a build-up and it is going
   to causa a problem and they can't   get in.

Q. But you say, and looking back to your statement, that you
   had agreed that you would postpone kick-off if there was
   an identifiable problem which you have talked about, as
   opposed to those who had been brought to the area within a
   reasonable time but had chosen not to entec the ground as
   soon as possible.  What you appear to be saying is that if
   they were late because it was their fault you were not
   going to    delay kick-off.   - A. If you read it in that
   light per sa it seems to say that I am lacking in
   consideration for latecomers.     I don't mean that.

Q. What it appears to be saying is that you had made a
   decision that you would not delay the kick-off if the only
   reason for late coming was the fans' own decision.  Is
   that right or wrong because that is what the statement
   says?     A.  I accept that is what the statement says.

Q.   I simply want to give you the opportunity of clarifying
     that.     A. I retain the flexibility to delay the kick-
     off.

Q. Anyway you decided at half past two that it wasn't
   necessary.   By twenty to three the crowd had continued to
   increase.  -    A . Yes sir.

Q. So the situation did not get any better,        it got worse.    - =
   A. Yes s i r .

Q. And it was plain was it not by twenty to three that you
   would not get them all in in time?  - A. No sir.   It was
   plain that we had a difficulty at twenty to three.

Q. Now was the time, was it not, to postpone kick-off?          - A
   It may have been a consideration sir, but at twenty         to
   t'nraa I was overcome by events.

Q.J What events were you overcome by?       -   A. The radio
     developed a fault.

Q. Let me ask you a bit about that. Which radio developed a
   fault?  - A. The personal radio.

Q. Which meant that you couldn't communicate with who?         -    A.
   The Police Officers in the operational field.

But you did not know that at the time, did you, that is to
say you did not know that individual Officers were tellinc
people that the kick-off had been delayed? - A. It was
becoming apparent that people were not responding to
Mr. Marshall or other Police Officers1 directives because
that situation would not have arisen.

Did it not occur to you that one of the reasons why they
were not responding might be because of their anxiety to
get in to the ground before 3 o ’clock because we are now
approaching close to 3 o ’clock and it is perfectly plain
to"anyone stuck in that crowd outside that there might
be problems in getting in? - A. I can understand it if
someone arrives at that situation at tnat uime, at that
late hour, that they may believe they w o n ’t get in.

In those circumstances surely it must have occurred to you
that to delay kick-off might well be to take one way of
taking the anxiety out of the situation for those wanting
to cet in and thus making them hold back, have some reason
to hold back? - A. Sir, at that time the crisis situation
that there was took all my concentration.

Eut you were trying to resolve that crisis? - A. I was.

And all   I am suggesting is that your best weapon to
resolve   it was delay the kick-off? - A. I did not consider
that my   best weapon at that time was delaying the kick-
off.  I   v/as trying to assist Superintendent Marshall.

•'What did you think was your best weapon?  You must have
  had some idea as to what you might do to try and alleviate
  that situation? — A. It was the Tannoy messages; it was
  the public address system and sending extra Officers to
  assist to calm the crowd and to get them to move back.

You f.elt I imagine, or did you feel that this situation -
had been created because people had not arrived on-time? ;
- A. Yes, there v/as a large crowd that had obviously
arrived very late.

 So you thought effectively:  "It is their own fault they
 are stuck in this trouble" did you? - A. Sir, in a
 situation such as that you never think things of that
 order.

 You see you have referred yet again to   there being "no
 maior incident", no reason.  That must   have had some
 effect on your thinking? - A. Mo, as a   Police Officer I
 was responding to that crowd situation   then and very
 concerned about it.

 Anyway 2.47, I think it is, we have the first request
 from Superintendent Marshall to open the gate.  Right?
 - A. Yes sir.

                                  not going through my mind.

                               Q. Now when he made that request what was your-immediate
                                  reaction? - A. To be honest I did not want to open the gate.
                           B
                               Q. Why not? - A. To open a gate at a football ground it would
                                  have defeated the  objectives of our Operation Order in
                                  that drunken fans may get in; people who had got drink;
                                  people who had got missiles and people who were without
                                  tickets would get access.

                               Q. Were you aware by now that there was a problem with a number
                                  of people outside without tickets? - A. I was aware that
                                  during the day there had been people without tickets.

                               Q. Eut v/ere you aware that there were a considerable number
                                  of fans at the Leppings Lane entrance who did not have
                                  tickets? - A. I was not aware sir.

                           D   Q. Because I think a lot of statements, or a lot of evidence
                                  we have heard and certainly a lot of statements that I have
                                  read, refer to considerable numbers of people without
                                  tickets and asking for tickets.  Is tha something that
                                  had not been drawn to your attention? - A. Hot at that
                                  stage sir.

                               Q. Because that was rather an important factor, wasn't it,
                           E      because if there were a lot of people milling around
                                  without  tickets that v/as something which would have added
                                  to the disorder or the problems rather outside? - A. In
                                  what respect?

                               Q. Well if you have a lot of people milling-around in a
                                  small area who are without tickets coupled with people'
                                  coming along trying to get into the ground, you add to
                                  the problems don't you, because you have cot more people
                                  there? - A. I would suggest that there are people there,
                                  there are probably people without tickets.

                               Q. I see.             But the crowd difficulties are there whatever.

                               Q. Anyway you v/ere reluctant to agree to the gate being
                                  opened because of the factors you have identified? - A. Yes
                                  sir.

                               0. Were you able to make direct contact v/ith Superintendent
                                  Marshall or not? - A. I remember receiving a radio message
                                  but having received the radio message from him, or it
                                  came into the Control Box to open the gate, I immediately
                                  looked at the monitor for the Leppings Lane turnstiles and
                           H      as I did so I v/ould describe it as the gate burst open.
                                  I have since found looking at the compilation that might

     gates, what action if any did you take to try to contain the
     situation inside as a result of a lot of people coming in.
     some of whom may be should not have been in at all? - A. Yes.
     I gave instructions that every available Officer should attend
     in two different locations.  In the North Stand to patrol the
     landings and to ensure those who were going into the North
     Stand area who did not have tickets would not flood through
     the exit/access entrances on to the pitch.  In addition. I
     asked for increased Officers around the perimeter track to
     assist.

Q. To assist where? - A. On the perimeter track in observing tne
   situation in the North Stand, and perimeter generally.

Q. But your concern was largely in relation to the North Stand
   and the consequences of opening gate A, is that right? - A.
   Yes .

G. What about the consequences of C and the terraces?  Did you
   take any steps in relation to that? - A. No, sir, other -chan
   the Officers in the control box were watching that situation
   as with other situations in the ground, knowing what had
   developed.

Q.   If I may go back to your statement, page 10, you say this,
     having dealt with the manpower request at the top of page 1 0 .
     the matters you have just covered in your evidence:

          "I watched the Leppings Lane terrace intently icr any
          de v e l op me nt s as a result of the gates opening” .

     - A. Yes,   sir.

Q    What developments did you anticipate or what possible
     developments did you anticipate as a result of the gates
     opening on the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. I was concerned to
     see what...the effects of opening the gates and allowing people
     into the ground would have.                           v -.

Q    What effects did you anticipate? - A. I thought that there
     could be pushing, and I wanted to observe the situation across
     the terrace.

O    We know the gate was in fact opened at 2.52.    That is the
     video monitor time.   It may be we are talking of a range
     within a minute or so either side.   We know that the teams
     came out at about 2.54, in fact.   I think 2.54, just after.
     You do say, if I may go back in your statement that you did
     consider again the question of delaying the kick-off, and this
     as I understand it was before the decision was made to open
     the gates.  Am I right in that? - A. Yes, sir.

0    Before you could make a final decision on that you realised
      that the teams were about to come out on to the pitch? - A.
      With the events, sir. and that particular timing, in the
      statement it may be out of sequence.  My perception is when I
      wa= considering the teams coming - when I was considering
                                                                    27

                                   delaying the kick-off because of a request from elsewhere, I
                                   looked to my right and I thought the teams were about to run
                                   on to the pitch because of the photographers. I thought that
                                   the teams were coming out.  It appears my time sequence is
                                   incorrect there.

                              Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        I am sorry.  "A request from
                                   elsewhere"?  A request from where? - A. There was a
                                   suggestion over the r a d i o ’almost at kick-off time
                                   for the kick-off to be delayed.

                              Q. From? - A. From a P.C. Buxton,         I believe, my Lord.

                    q   .        MR C O L LI N S : Are you saying that this request came
                            aftec the gates had been opened?      - A. Sir with the
                            passage of time and the events as they were
                            simultaneously, ray only perception was then and is now
                B           that there was a hal£ circle of photographers outside the
                            players* tunnel and I thought at that stage that that was
                            when the players were coming out.

                    q   . That isn't, with respect, an answer to my question.       -   A.
                          I ’m s o r r y .

                    Q. My question was did the request from Mr. Buxton, which you
                       have been telling Lord Justice Taylor about, come after
                       the gates had been opened or before?  - A. In the time
                       sequence of events, sir, I am told it came after the gates
                       were ooened.

                    Q.      I am asking you your memory.     A. I believed that it
                            came shortly before the gates were ooened.
                D
                    Q. Vihen did you make this statement, can you remember? It.
                       may be dated.   - A. It is not, sir, but it was something
                       li.ce three weeks after the event.

                    Q. Because if you go back to page 6 the way you recollected
                       it then is thus - I look at the penultimate paragraph on
                       page 6, have you got that?  - A. Yes.

                    Q.                 "The ccowd situation was changing
                                       rapidly.  It had increased in numbers.
                                       Superintendent Marshall had asked for
                                       a vehicle with a PA facility.  Tannoy
                                       messages were being relayed to ease
                                       pressure.  Mounted Officers were having
                                       difficulty and extra resources had been,
                                       sent to assist.  I looked at the
                                       situation on the Leppings Lane terrace
                                       and saw there was room for supporters
                                       and considered because of the deteriorating
                                       situation whether or not to delay the
                                       kick-off to ease the difficulties."

                            -   A.     sir.

                    Q.                 "I looked through the Control Box window
                                       to my right and saw a half circle of
                                       press photographers on the pitch at the
                                       players' tunnel, obviously waiting for
                                       the teams to appear, and at that point,
                                       whilst considering the position, the
                                       first team ran out on to the pitch."

                                -   A. Yes sir.

                                           removed."

                 B              -   A. Yes sir.

                           Q. Well now what you are there saying, and is this an
                              accurate picture, that before you could come to a final
                              decision to postpone, or to ask for a postponement oE the
                              kick-off, that teams came out on to the pitch and there­
                              fore you considered that that option had been removed?
                              A. Yes sir, once tne :eams ran out on to the oitch.

                                The fact that the teams are out on the pitch doesn't
                                itself preclude still postponement of kick-off does it?
                                A. That is correcc sir.

                           Q.   It makes it, I ac :apt, more difficult, but it doesn't:
                                actually preclud; it.   - A. That is right sir.
                  D        0.   If the situation in your view mecits it.         A. Yes sir

                           Q. But that apart, we know that the teams came out at 2.54 or
                              thereabouts.  - A. Yes sir.

                           Q. But; they did come out earlier than that for their pre-
                              match warm-uo as I understand it.      A. Yes sir.
                   E
                           Q. And then went back in.        Are you referring to that pre­
                              match warm-up or are you referring to the 2.54, 2.55?           - -
                              A. I don't .■caow sir.      My sequence of events, as I can
                              honestly recollect them, and bearing in mind the develop­
                              ments of the day, I was of the opinion that when I made my
                              stat.emeA.t- that in. •;considering the developing--situation-at- -
                              2.47, and ..the actions at ■t h e ■Leppings Lane .end,' that 'is
                              when I seriously considered delaying the kick-off, and -
                              whilst considering that I looked to my right through the
                              Control 3ox window and saw a half circle of press
                              ohotographers waiting for the teams to come out, and
                              something occurred that made me think the teams were
                              running out on to the pitch.         Having said that, since that
                              time my prception at that time was that the teams were
                              running out to .start the game.        I have since been advised,
                              because I hadn't access to the material, that that
                              couldn't have occurred, that was at 2.54.          Now my
                              oerceotion is that I was thinking through that option
                              before I open the gates.         Now I cannot be any more
                              accurate than that, to say that I don't know who came out
                              or'"what made me think that, other than to say there was a
                               half circle oE photographers and something happened and I
                               thought I saw the teams run out.         It could have been for
                       H       the kick-ocf but obviously now it isn't, and I considered

        that at that stage the developing situation witliin the
        ground had gone to a situation when I had lost the option.

Q.      So what you are saying is that what you believed at the
        time you made your statement, and presumably at the time
        you made your decision, was theteams coming out may in
        hindsight not have been.   -  A. No, it may have been coming
        out for a kick-about as you say.

Q. And therefore you may in fact have been earlier, or it may
   have been at a time earlier than 2.54.   It must have been
   at a time earlier than 2.54.    - A. Yes.

Q. Coming back to page 10 ....

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If that was right and the
        teams had their kick-about and went back off again, the
        option would have reappeared.  - A. To delay the kick-off
        sir, yes.

q   .        MR.   COLLIN'S:  But by then, having regard to the
        evidence   you gave earlier this morning, the events you
        told us    about effectively made it impossible for you to
        come to    that decision you are saying.  - h . Yes.

Q.       That is the breakdown of communications .... - A. My
        perception is breakdown in communications, worsening
        situation, 2.47-ish decide to take some action, think
        about delaying the kick-off, players out, straight into
        the crisis of 2.47.

Q. Now you then you tell us watch che Leppings Lane terrace
   intently, for developments resulting from the gates
   opening.   - A. Yes sir.

Q. When, you watched that were you/aware of a surge into those
   central pens?      A. No sir.   .•                 •

Q.      I think that there clearly   was sucha surge.       You didn't
        see it though.  - A. No.

Q.      Was it not clear from what you could    see,because    the
        video was still running presumably.     - h . Yes.

Q. And you were keeping one eye on that I imagine from time to
   time.  You could see people pouring in still, and you
   could see them going towards that central tunnel couldn't
   vou?  - A. I can only refer to the compilation video I
   have just seen, and the compilation video doesn't indicate
   they were pouring towards the central tunnel.

Q. With respect Chief Superintendent, to anyone who knows the
   geography it is clear beyond any peradventure that that

                                                                         31

                           Q. W h a t e l s e c ould you do, having failed to raise Mr.              Lock?       A.
                              W i t h re g a r d to the club?

                           Q. W i t h re g a r d to the turns t i l e s which you were concerned about?
                              - A. Yes.         I could not r a i s e Mr. Lock.   I was then overtaken
                              by w hat I c o n sider w e r e m o r e serious events, that is requests
                              for the g ates to be opened in Leppings Lane.
                    B
                           Q.    That of c o u r s e was all related to the flow through the
                                 turnstile, was not it? - A. yes, sir.       I would think so.

                           Q. C a n we, as it were, go back to the chronology we were on
                              before.           Did you a c o n v e r s a t i o n w i t h Chief Superintendent
                              D u c k e n f i e l d about the crowd and gett i n g them in? - A. Yes,
                              sir.

                           Q.    Did you have a c o n v e r s a t i o n about the delay of kick off at
                                 this time? - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q.    How did that arise? - A. I think Mr. Duckenfield asked me to
                                 rem i n d him wha t we had d i s c u s s e d about delaying kick-off, and
                                 I said that normally w e w ould not d elay kick-off if people
                                 w e r e just late, but if t here was something that kept them from
                                 g e t t i n g into the ground or g e t t i n g to the ground, i.e.
                                 ac cidents or physical problems over the Pennines, etc., then
                                 o b v i o u s l y we have to d e l a y the kick-off.

                           Q.    I am sorry, did you a gree with that principle that you should
                                 d e l a y it only in those c i r c u m s t a n c e s ? - A. I think the option
                                 is always open that that was the general rule.                   That was our
                                 sort of agreement and our perception, and I think that is a
                                 fairly com m o n one.

                           Q. This was a discu s s i o n you had w i t h Mr. Duckenfield about the
                              reasons why you may or m a y not d e l a y kick-off?         First, what I
                              am i n t e r e s t e d in is what time did this discussion take place,
                              to y our best r e c o l l e c t i o n ? - A. It would be about 2.30.

                           Q. C a n you think of any e vent or a n y thing that             was occurring
                              ou t s i d e that gav e rise to this d i s c u s s i o n ?    Why should you be
                              t h i n k i n g about it at that time? - A. It was            about the time
                              that I s u g g e s t e d there w e r e a lot of people        out there and we
                              w o u l d get them in.

                           Q.    If you w e r e sure you would get them in, questions of delaying
                                 ki c k - o f f w o u l d not really arise, w ould they? - A. You would
                                 think not, sir, no.

                            Q.   If you had thought they would not get in that is when you
                                 m i g h t think about d e l a y i n g kick-off, is not it? - A. Yes.

                            Q. Was t here a time you thought that w h e n you wer e having this
                               d i s c u s s i o n ? - A. Not at that time, no, sir.

                       H    Q.   Did you the q u e s t i o n of d e l a y i n g kick-off,
                                 be f o r e 3 o'clo c k ? - A. No, sir.
                                                                                            was it raised again

                           Q. Did you think it was appropriate at any stage before 3 o ’clock
                              to consider it again? - A. i would think that it probably was.
                              There was obviously just before the players came out it was
                              obvious the people were not going to get in through the
                              turnstiles by 3 o'clock.

                           Q. That would be about 5-to-3, would not it? - A. 5-to-,      10-to-3,
                    B         yes.

                           Q. Did you mention it? - A.. No, sir.

                           G. You did, however, think it might be appropriate? - A. I did
                              not think it would appropriate, otherwise I would have
                              mentioned it.  Again it was a thought that d i d n ’t come into my
                              head.  Things were happening then that were demanding my
                              attention.

                           Q.   I think you had various bits of information coming into
                                your control room, had not you, from this point onwards,      from
                                half-past-2 to 3 o'clock? - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q. Not just of the ground and Leppings Lane but      all around,   too?
                              - A. There were many things happening.

                           Q,   I think you had some trouble with a ticket tout, had not you?
                                - A. Yes, sir.   I can't remember the timing, but certainly
                                there was a ticket tout selling tickets outside the Leppings
                                Lane end for the Kop, and our little contingency on the Kop
                                was already full.   The tout was in fact arrested.

                           Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Selling tickets outside the
                                Leppings Lane end? - A. Selling tickets to Liverpool
                                supporters for the Kop end of the ground, yes, my Lord.

                           O.        MR. PHILLIPS:     So I think he was arrested, was he? - A.
                                He was arrested.

                           Q. This was a report you had received by radio, is it?         A . Yes,
                              sir.

                           Q. So the radio was working then at this stage? - A. Yes, it was.

                           Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   As a matter of interest, he was
                                arrested for what? - A. He was arrested, I would think, for
                                causing obstruction, my Lord.

                           Q. Obstructing Officers in the course of their duty or what? - A.
                              By the course of his actions he would have been causing an
                              obstruction in the highway.  People would have been gathering
                              round him and he would be causing an obstruction.

                           Q.   If he had been selling them for the Leppings Lane end would it
                                have been any different? - A. I doubt it, my Lord, if he had
                                been causing an obstruction, no matter where he was selling
                       H        them.

                           Q.        MR.   PHILLIPS:   You were keeping I think a good watch on

                                                                                         B.D. MURRAY


                                     Yes.    Well,   it could be 4,000,   not 5,000.

                            Q. Yes.        As far as the West Stand was concerned and the standing
                               terraces, about how m a n y do you reckon still had to come in
                               t h e r e at 2.30? - A. The West Stand was filling.               It was what I
                               would call filling.          That is over half-full and on its way to
                               filling.          Not full, but doing well.          The terraces, it is very
                    B          d i f f i c u l t to establish, but c e r t a i n l y there w ere plenty in the
                               c e n t r e two pens and p l e n t y in the raised area, and there were
                               q u i t e a lot in the rest of the terrace.

                            Q. T h e s i t u a t i o n was this, was not it, at 2.30, that the two
                               ce n t r e pens wer e not filling;       they wer e full; but the two
                               wi n g pens had thousands to come? - A. That was usually the
                               st a t e of affairs on a m a t c h like this.

                            Q.       So again we have got a situation at 2.30 where there             are very
                                     man y t h o usands of pe o p l e still to come into the ground? - A.
                                     No, you said that, sir.          I said t h e r e were probably 4,000 to
                                     5.000 to go into the N o r t h Stand at the extreme and probably
                                     4.000 to go into the West Stand terrace.

                            Q.        Yes,   ver y man y thousands.
                     D
                            Q.                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  How man y to go into the West
                                     Stand? - A. I would think, my Lord, probably if I had to put a
                                     fi g u r e on it I would think there was probably about 4,000
                                     spaces on the terr a c e at half-past-2.

                            Q.On the terr a c e or the terrace and the West       Stand? - A.
                                P r o b a b l y up to 4,000 spaces on the terrace, my Lord.

                            q    .        MR. HYTNER:   Again, these figures may well be
                                     approximate, but we are getting to something like 8,000 in all
                                     to come? - A. Yes.

                            Q.       Did you think you would get all t hose in by 3 o'clock? - A.
                                     Yes, I thought half - a n - h o u r was sufficient.

                            Q. A g a i n this has been e x p lored w ith Mr. Duckenfield, but I have
                               to ask it you beca u s e it is cer t a i n l y plain on your statement,
                               o n e of the c o n s i d e r a t i o n s w h i c h weig h e d with you as to whether
                               t h e kick-off was to be delayed was whether it was the fault of
                               t h e fans or whether it was not the fault of the fans? - A. I
                               think '’fault" is not the word I would use, sir.                       I think what
                               was said was if it was purely a cas e of people not turning up
                               at the right t ime for the kick-off then it would not normally
                               be d e l a y e d .

                             Q. Yes, b e c a u s e it is their own fault?  It is their own look out.
                                Was that the a t t itude? - A. I d o n ’t think it was ever meant to
                                be as d o g m a t i c as t h a t .             t

                             Q.             LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR:       What is the distinction between
                       tr             having a l a r g e crowd outs i d e wh o are not going to be able to
                                      g e t in by 3 o'clock beca u s e t here has been fog on the Pennines

                                    t he y hav e ch o s e n to c o m e late? - A. I don't there was ever an
                                    i n t e n t i o n that be ca u s e people came late deliberately en masse
                                    that w e would not d e l a y the kick-off.         It could have been
                                    24,000 p e o p l e that c a m e late, and obviously the situation
                                    w o u l d have been c o m p l e t e l y different. I think everything we
                                    set has to have an a l t e r n a t i v e option.    The option is always
                                    there.

                           q   .             MR. HYTNER:         O n e of the reasons for delaying the kick-
                                    off is to avoid the i mpatience that arises outside the ground
                                    of fans who think t hey are going to miss the kick-off and who
                                    m a y indu l g e in s o me push i n g or shoving in order to get into
                                    the ground early?            Is not that one of the reasons why you do
                                    d e l a y a kic k - o f f ? - A. That would be a consideration.

                           Q.       It is not just a reward for those who have not done anything
                                    w r o n g or a p unishment for those who have come late
                                    deliberately.          It is a matter of crowd safety, is not it? - A.
                                    I d on't see it as a reward or a punishment.                   I see it as quite
                                    an imp o r t a n t d e c i s i o n to make.   T h e r e are other
                                    considerations;            the behaviour of the people inside;          what
                                    will happen after the event;                the arrangements that have been
                                    m a d e after the event.            I think it is something that has to be
                      D
                                    given a lot of t h o u g h t .

                           q    .             L ORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I supp o s e if you do it too lightly
                                    then people just get to rely on the fact that kick-off will be
                                    d e l a y e d ? - A. This is one of the main problems, my Lord.

                           q    .             MR. HYTNER:            And you may get impatience inside the
                                    ground.           N o b o d y is sugg e s t i n g it is an easy question to solve.
                                    What I have to put to you, however, is that the one
                                    c o n s i d e r a t i o n you should never take into account is that
                                    p e o p l e have turned up who turned up late who might have turned
                                    up earlier.               That simply should never be part of the equation,
                                    should it? - A. I thought that was what I was just saying,
                                    sir.

                           Q.       It is not appar e n t l y what you said in your statement,               Do you
                                    follow? - A. No, sir.       I don't.

                           Q.       Perhaps I had better read it to you, because it may be a total
                                    c o n f u s i o n and it may be you said something you did not mean to
                                    say.        H a v e you got you r statement in front of you? - A. Yes, I
                                    have.

                               Q.    I think it is page 9.         The middle of the page:

                                           "About this time Chief S u p erintendent Duckenfield asked

                                           the kick off.       I informed him that w e had agreed that if
                                           t h e r e was an ide n t i f i a b l e problem, such as a serious

          would not normally d elay i t ” .

     - A. Yes,   sir.   ’’Normally".    "Not normally delay".

Q. W hen you think about it that should not be a consideration at
   all, s h o u l d it? - A. What, that people come whe n they want and
   w e have the match when they arrive?

Q.   If t h e r e is a press of people outs i d e the ground and they are
     impatient to get in t here ma y be a danger of crushing and
     disorder.      It does not matter why that is, does it? - A.
     No. If w e are talking about the circumstances you are
     talking about, no.

Q. Was it a c o n s i d e r a t i o n on this particular day that it passed
   thro u g h your mind and was perhaps discussed with Mr.
   Du c k e n f i e l d that t hese were latecomers who had been drinking
   around the town? - A. No, sir, not at all.

Q. Can I just go on.

Q.             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        I s u p p o s e the thinking behind it
     is this, that people who are held up by fog or an accident
     w o n ’t tak e the delay of kick-off to be held up by fog or an
     accident next time, because that is just something that
     h a p p e n e d to them, but if people s tay in the public houses
     until the last minute and roll up then and know that last time
     it happe n e d the kick-off was delayed, then they would
     be e n c o u r a g e d to do it more?   Have I got it right or not? - A.
     Yes, my Lord, exactly.

Q.   It is a d i f ficult equation.




                                       /Q.    MR. HYTNER:      There were

                                                    B.   D.   MUSSAY




Q. And the people in his immediate front, one can see almost
   down to their waists, some of them.  People standing,
   turning, looking around, lighting cigarettes? - A. I feel
   there is some room at the front, but it looks full at the
   back

Q. Whilst you were up in the Control Box before the incident
   happened, did you have any worry or concern over the state
   of those people in the terraces? - A. No, sir, I had no
   concern.

Q.   In 1988 we know that the same game had been played - the
     same venue, same teams, supporters, similar allegiance -
     and in 1988, to the best of your recollection, how had the
     terraces been? - A. The terraces were similar to what they
     were in 1989.

Q. Hay I ask you about another matter - the question of
   delaying the match? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And it was being put to you that you had the discussion
   with Hr. Duckenfield? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. About the circumstances in which the    game would be
   delayed? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And the point was being made about people coming along
   late? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. How do you know when to draw the line? - A. I think that
   is perhaps one of the most difficult decisions that there
   is -to make, as to when you decide that you are going to
   delay the kick-off.    I think if you are in a situation
   where you know that there is something definite that is
   preventing people getting to the venue, then the decision
   is very easy, but if it is just that people are arriving
   and you are wondering whether they are going to get in in
   time, the decision is very difficult.

Q. Of course, I suppose it might be said that even one
   car-load of angry, frustrated and late supporters might
   cause some problem if they are rushing into the ground and
   the game is not delayed for their benefit.  Do you follow?
   That would be an extreme proposition, but it might be
   foreseen or foreseeable that those individuals, in their
   rush to get in, might cause problems for others?.- A. That
   is possible, sir, but my experience is that there are some
   people who come to games late anyway rather than be in
   before kick-off.

 Q. And is it very much a matter of judgment? - A. Very much
    so.




                                                                  37

                                                      B.   D.   HUBBAY




Q. And is this the situation, that that judgment, whilst it
   is more easily to be exercised in obvious situations like
   where there has been a motor accident blocking a motorway
   or something serious on the Pennines, is a judgment that
   has to take into account all matters? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And it is not a judgment in respect of which there is any
   hard, and fast rule according to which you will or will not
   delay the game? - A. I do not think there can be a hard
   and fast rule.

Q.    And has it ever been the   practice to have such a rule? -
     A. No, I have never been    to a match where the kick-off has
     been delayed.

Q.    Are you aware of any rule which says, "Never mind.  We do
     not stop it because they   are late"? - A. There are not any
     rules,    no, sir.




                                     /Q. Did the thought occur....




                                                                     38

Bid the thought occur to you that the game should be delayed?
- A. The thought did not occur to me.   I think I was probably
preoccupied with other events.

Of course with hindsight we can achieve miracles? - A. With
hindsight, yes.

May I now move on to ask you about the communication facilities,
just a little because there may be detailed evidence as to
its complexity, but first of all was a consequence of the
radio difficulties that' were being experienced, that the
Control Room switched to using the hand-held portable
radios? - A. Yes sir.

Did that mean that the Control Room by adopting that course
was in just the same position, in effect, as anybody else
equipped with a hand-held radio? — A. Yes sir.  vJhen we
use the main set we can override anyone who is sending a
message into control, but by using personal radios every­
one is on the same circuits and everyone is competing for
the same signals.

In order to achieve the communication, because of the circum­
stances which one understood to obtain., did it mean that
you in effect   no longer had the control with the substantial
radio svstem?   - A. Yes sir, we no longer had the facility
to be able to   cut people off and override them and pass
messages from   control.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: You could not go on to non­
talk-through? - A. No sir, that was my impression on the
cav and we did operate our personal radios after the
radio, breakdown, my Lord.

      I IR. WOODWARD: Of course there was a radio link that
you had with the ground, the Club's Operations Room? - A.
Yes, we did have a personal radio on their system.

That was a personal system which was possessed by the
ground which provided you the facility to link in? - A.
Yes sir.

 That is a separate radio system from the Police radio system?
 - A. It is a" separate personal radio system run by the Club.

      ' LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    That is the one the Club use
 to contact their Stewards?    - A. Contact their Stewards and
 their Officials, yes sir.

       MR. WOODWARD:  You can contact them and they could
 contact you using it? — A. Yes sir.

 Did you also have a telephone link with    the   Club? - A.Yes
 sir, on the Club's private network.

that were developing at the turnstiles rather than what
was happening in Leppings Lane.  Obviously the larger
number were around the turnstiles.

I follow that, but did it not occur to you  or to anyone
that the two should not be looked at in isolation because
the more you have coming down the worse the problem is
going to §et, is not it? - A. I can appreciate that point
but speaking for myself my interest was directed at the
people around the turnstile area.

It did not get better any way, did it, as minutes went by?
- A. Certainly not, no.

Indeed,   it got worse? - A. Yes, it did.

Did you volunteer to Chief Superintendent Duckenfieid or
anyone that the position was getting worse? - A. At the
time that this was happening Chief Superintendent
Duckenfieid was stood iust in front of my position
on the monitors.

So he could see them? - A. So he was looking up at the
monitor we were looking at and we were discussing the
general situation together.

What was the discussion as far as     can recall?
Obviously do not expect you to remember exact words.
- A. The matters we were seeing, particularly
individual events, was in relation to a mounted Officer
who seemed to be struggling with crowds who were pushing
his horse around.

It must have been fairly obvious, surely, that the crowd
was getting worse rather than better? - A. It was obvious
that the crowd was building up, yes.

Was anything said as time went on that you can remember
about possible delay of kick-off? - A. A conversation
did take place between Mr. Duckenfieid, Mr. Murray,
possibly whoever else was in the control at that time
and I remember  Mr. Murray saying that it was not our
policy to delay the kick-off for people who had just
arrived late at the ground.  Somebody else threw into
that conversation if there had been a problem on the
motorway or roadworks the situation is different.

So it was your understanding - I appreciate it is not
your decision. ~ A. Yes.

Senior Officers.  It was your understanding, was it,
that because the  fans  were choosing to arrive late
then there was no question of deferring kick-off? - A.
Yes.  I think the situation is if fans become aware
that by coming late kick-off will be delayed they will

continue to cone late.

Yes, I see.  Now again at about this time between 2.30,
2.40, that sort of period, were you aware of the civilian
radio communications officer coming to deal with the
radio? - A. Yes, he did come in and commence work on
the set which is below the desk in front of me.

We have heard Sergeant Goddard tell us about that and
I am not going to ask you to go over the same ground.
Did there come a  time again shortly after or about
this time that you heard something to do with the gates
over the radio? - A. That is right.  Mr. Marshall was
asking for the gates to be opened because of the problems
outside.  When referring to gates the gates I am talking
about, it is just C Gate.  Mr. Duckenfieid's attention
was directed to C Gate as was mine.  That is the gate
we were looking at.

Which is not surprising because it was basically the only
gate that you could really see through that camera? - A.
That is correct.

And it is the outside of which together with the inside
of which you could see? - A. Yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Are you simply giving us
your understanding of it or what Mr. Marshall said?
- A . No.   Mr. Marshall was referring to opening gates
because of the problems outside.     I directed Mr.
Duclcenf ield 's attention to C Gate and,  if you like,
when reference was made to ®ates by Mr. Marshall that
is the gate that I was looking at on the monitor and
paying attention to.

     MR. COLLINS:   That was certainly the gate that
vou could see in the video.  Did you understand or
did you think Mr. Marshall was simply referring to
that gate or to that and the other gates or did not
you know? - A. My belief was that he was referring
iust to C Gate, possibly because that is where my
attention was directed from what I could see.

And you drew Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d 's attention to Gate C?
- A. Yes, that is right, sir.

You were aware, I imagine, that Mr. Duckenfieid was not
experienced at policing or overseeing the policing at
football match at Hillsborough? - A. I knew he was new
to the specific duty.

Yes.   Nov;, again, your timing is a little out on your
notes.    We know that it was at 2.48 that the gate in
fact opened and it was at 2.47, just a minute or so
before, Mr. Marshall requested the gates be opened?

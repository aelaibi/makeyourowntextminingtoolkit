                i!               then told the other                 cadet and myself               to return to our

               original          post.      As we    did      so,       supp o r t e r s    who were     on the      pitch were

               c o m i n g u p t o u s and saying                 t h i n g s 1 ik e , “H e 3.p „      P e o pie are   dy i n g i n

               t here.       Ge t t he m ou t „"

               I explained           that    there was            nothing we         could do.          1 knew others        were

               helping       the     s i t u a t i o n and    I hadn't          been       instructed      to do anything.

               I could        see    that    the Po l i c e        were     transferring            s u pporters     into Pens

               five and          six out     of    pen four.

               A short        time after          this,      we    received        our       first casualty (the           other

               cadet,       who at       this     time    I don't          know    his        name, and I).        1 think   he

               was      brought      to us by another St J o h n ’s 0 f f i ce r ,,

               The      c a s u alty was a w hite male,                  in his SQ's,          about     5 ’iO wit h dark

               coloured          nair and       clean shaven.                I d o n ’t recall         what   he was wearing.

               He a p p e a r e d    to have       chest      i njuri e s .

               The      other     cadet and        I then         put    his arms          around    our shoulders         and by

               supporting           his weight       in this way we                took      him to the First          Aid Room.

               We    handed him over to a female St John's A m b u l a n c e Officer who was                                          on

We    then         returned          to the          pitch.,         About    half    way along      the N o r t h S tand

recall           w h i c h wrist).              I would         d e s cribe    this     person as       being a white

male         in his           late     teens         or    early E O ’s, about 5*1 0 tall,               w ith light

brown       hair and             clean shaven.                  I d o n ’t recall       anything       else about              him.

As    I was         returning             to    the       pitch,,     1 could see       the Pol ice Officers

taking           stretchers           onto         the     pitch,,      Ely this      time    1 a g a i n met       up with

the      same       cadet who             I had been wit h              earlier,       so together       we     took a

1    could         see       that    there were             a lot      of    people    on the     pitch when we

r e t u r n e d ,,

1 was       told by a Po l i c e Offi c e r                      (who was          in uniform,      wear i n g a h e l m e t ,

t h a t ’s all           1    can    recall)           that     the    c a s ualty w i t h him was        feeling

f aint      and      sick.           He was a white male                     in his 20* s , t h a t ’s all           1 can

By    this         time       there were a                lot   of    c a sualties     in the area        of the First

A i d RuoiTi so we              placed          the      st ret che r down on the             f 3.oo r outs i de ,,

A w o m a n member              of the St Johns First                        Aid   room asked me        to sit wit h a

w o rna n o u t s i d e t h e First                  Ai d R a a m and        kee p h e r c o m pany.     I h is w o m a n was

white,           in her 4 0 ’s , wit h                blonde         hair,    wearing    a red tracksuit,,                 I

discovered               that       she      had     twisted her ankle               before    coming     into       the

ground,            but       1 don't         know     of the         circumstances       in w h i c h she       s u stained

her      injuries.

She      d i d n ’t know what                  was    h a p pening      so    I explained       that    I thought              that

                                                                                                                          S764

too m a n y     people      had got          into       the    gr o u n d avid got       crushed as a result-

S3he said       she felt        guilty          that     she was      taking       up space and time                       that

could     be    used     by someone             w i t h more      injuries        than herself,,                  I

reassured        her and        she       st a y e d    in the area.

I was     also    told to         look a fter a teenager who                       had       su s t a i n e d     chest

i njuries.        He had to be sat                     upright     so that        he   could breath easier.

He *was crying           and as k i n g         for     the    toilet.      He     e v e n t u a l l y used the

t oilet    in the        First Aid R o o m and                 I di dn"t see        him after            that.            He was

w h i t e ,'m a l e , in his         late       teens.         I think      he was wearing                denim jeans.

He was     only about           5’   6    tall.

I returned        to      the    lady w i t h the          twis t e d ankle       and stayed                 wit h her         for

a w hlie.        S he    a sked      if     it was       a 1rig ht    i f s h e c ouId           ret ur n t o he r

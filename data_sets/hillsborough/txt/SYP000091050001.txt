              On Saturday,       15th April    1989 (150489)        I was on duty at the Police D o g

              Section,    Niagara,    Sheffield.         I paraded on duty at S.Oarn (0800)      this

              date.    My duties outlined for this day was to assist in supervision of

              meals for Dog Handlers from foreign forces and security of Police

              vehicles within the Niagara sports ground,                    pavillion and Dog Section

              and of people using the pavillion.                  Also this included general

              supervision of Niagara Road which leads from Penistone Rd to the

              sports ground.        This road being very close to the Hillsborough ground

              is a favorite parking spot for football                 fans and due to the large

              amount of Police vehicles using Niagara this date it was necessary to

              keep the road clear.



              The    pavillion was used by a large number of people who were fans going
                                                                     PAGE
                                                                     S3531

to the ground and they used the pavillion in order to have a meal and

a drink before the match.    For these fans to get into Niagara itself

they had to speak to me to gain entry via the sports ground gates.



Fans started leaving the club for the ground from approx 2pm (1400)

this date and many of the fans asked if I could tell them where they

could get tickets from, as they did not have a ticket.       On this point

I was unable to assist them.     The fans both from Nottingham and

Liverpool went off to the ground?      to my knowledge without tickets.



At 3pm (1500)   this day I went to the pavillion for the next phase of

my duties to assist and supervise meals for Police Officers,      the

pavillion being used for this     purpose.



Events overtook this phase and many Police Officers did not have their

meals until after 3pm   (1700)   this date.   The club being used as a

gathering point for Officers on duty at the ground.



I remained on duty at Niagara carrying out the above duties until 8pm

(2000)   this date.

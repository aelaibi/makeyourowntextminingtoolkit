Dear IjM'L ,
     Please accept my condolences re the Hillsborough
tragedy yesterday.

     I was returning along the M .62 from Manchester
towards Liverpool between 1.15 p .tn. and 2 p.m.    Soon,
after I joined the M . 62 at Junction 17 I n oticed a build
up of traffic on the Eastbound carriageway and. traffic
was at a standstill, 3 lanes solid until almost to the
junction with the di.6 - junction 10.   It was apparent
that a large number of Liverpool fans were in the jam.

     What was the cause of the hold up I do not know
or how long it lasted, but it may be that it was the cause
of a large number of people from Liverpool arriving at the
ground late ana causing the crush outside.

     Poasibly you are aware of the above facts, but I
thought it wise to let you know.  If it was a contributory
factor it looks as if intelligence of traffic delays
should in future be passed to the recipient Force as was
the case with coach loads of pickets in the strikes.

     It seems a lixeciiae since I retired frou Surrey when
we thought we had troubles with fli-jacking and terrorism,
but to-day the Police seem to be the butt for all iiisfortune

     All the best for the future.

                      Yours sincerely,
                       ,              ^      ,

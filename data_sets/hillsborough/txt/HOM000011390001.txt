          The Home Secretary has asked me to arrange a meeting shortly after his
    return to the office to take stock of the extent to which the urgent
    recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor have been implemented, particularly
    those falling to the football clubs.     He has in mind the stories which
    appeared in several newspapers recently suggesting that progress in


*   implementing these proposals was slow.    The meeting has been arranged for
    10.45 a.m. on 7 September. I should be very grateful if you could before the
    meeting gather some information (perhaps on a sample basis) from the police
    about the extent to which the recommendations have been put into effect and
                                                                      considered
    let me have a note on this and any other points which need to be considered
    at this stage.                                 _   A   ^     /j >v I/, T /

    PS.        I see that you have already issued a circular to Chief Fire Officers
               requesting information.  I am a little concerned that this might fuel
               the controversy if it leaks to the press. I understand that you have
               agreed to supply a suggested line to be taken by PRB in this
               eventuality.

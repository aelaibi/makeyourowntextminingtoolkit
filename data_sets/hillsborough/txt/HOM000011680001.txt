WIGAN ATHLETIC: SUNDAY TIMES ARTICLE 8 OCTOBER 1989

1.   The attached report of the Sunday Times refers.  Ministers
may wish to have a little further information on the issues
raised.

2.   The Football League assessment of the Wigan ground does not
mean that it is unsafe for any spectators.  Our enquiries of the
local authorities have confirmed that the recommendations of the
Hillsborough Inquiry have been and are continuing to be
conscientiously pursued.  In particular the safe capacity of the
ground has recently been reassessed and reductions made in
accordance with the Inquiry's recommendations.  That part of the
ground reserved for away supporters is seriously restricted to
378 - as reported.

3.   The local authority are satisfied that the ground offers
reasonable safety for the number of spectators authorised by the
safety certificate.  This sets a low figure for the relevant part
of the ground reflecting, as it should, the conditions which
exist there.  (We understand that the club were asked some time
ago to carry out works to replace and upgrade crush barriers in
the relevant enclosure.  This was not done and an offer by the
club shortly before the fixture against Liverpool to carry out
this work was considered by the local authority to be
unacceptable because the standards required would not be achieved
in time for the match.) As there is considerable local support
for Liverpool, Wigan's home match in the Littlewoods Cup against
Liverpool was played at Anfield.

4.      Submitted for information.

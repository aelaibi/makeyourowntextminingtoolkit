Manchester United Football Club

Football:    National Membership Scheme



1*          The United perspective as expected directs itself and its thoughts
             in the main to what is best for Manchester United and ignores
             totally what is best for the game.
2.          You may remember that Manchester United was one of the hawks prepared
             to promote a Super League for ten Clubs and to hell with the other
             82 only five months ago.
3.          Football is a dying game, a situation which has been brought about
             by a perspective of the game which directs all energies to each
             individual Club. The bigger the Club the more authoritarian it
             becomes and the less understanding it has of the plight of the
             average Club (the average Home game over 92 Clubs is 8,400). Who
             cares about Manchester United's problems of 56,000 people per
             game when some Clubs hardly get 56,000 per season. United are
             rich enough, old enough and sufficiently experienced to persuade
             their fans if necessary to arrive in good time to watch the match.
4.          I would direct your attention to page four which is almost totally
             inaccurate in that under the Football Spectators Bill, with the
             technology being developed by GEC, there will be a simple reader
             put into existing turnstiles.
5-          The facts are that the majority of Luton Town support comes from
             outside Luton, in fact only 40% comes from within the Luton area.
6.          With regard to the claim that there has been a higher than national
             average increase in violent crime in the locality of Luton's stadium,
             I attach in its entirety a letter from Bedfordshire Police which
             fully clarifies the misguided publicity which has surrounded this
             claim.
7.          With regard to casual supporters (page four paragraph two) the
             evidence is quite the opposite to the statement in the report in
             that once again the perspective is inaccurate. Luton Town has a
             closed membership list of 20,000 members. The Home gate on average
             is 10,000 and therefore it can be clearly seen that 10,000 "casuals"
            have taken the trouble to register.
8.          The remainder of the paragraph barely warrants comment except to
             say that exactly the same was said when Luton Town introduced the
            Members Only Scheme. It was claimed that hooligans would come to
             Luton to cause trouble from all sorts of clubs, including Manchester
            United. In fact none did and there has been only one arrest either



                  Telephone Hatfield (07072) 66261 or Hatfield (07072) 62632
       iniside or outside the Ground since implementation of the Scheme and
       this arrest was not football related.
9.    With regard to page four paragraph three, this is the sort of scare-
       mongering that one would expect from a club the size of Manchester
       United in that it simply does not understand that the Home gates of
       average football clubs have deteriorated dramatically over the last
       twenty years thanks to the inadequacy of the Football Association,
       the Football League and the bigger clubs who, as stated, do not
       understand or appreciate the difficulties that the smaller clubs
       have encountered during those years.
10.   Turning to the fourth paragraph on page four, when the twenty millior
       decent fans that have left the game start to come back the demand
       for Executive Suite facilities will increase for Manchester United
       and may even b§ demanded at average clubs in that clubs will be able
       to identify with every supporter, a vital factor particularly to the
       smaller clubs, and thereby encourage them into a scenario where they
      will not witness violence and where filthy language will have been
       eliminated from the game.
11.   The fourth paragraph on page two refers to a "real sense of
      belonging to a particular club". This sense of belonging, for clubs
      and supporters alike, will be the saviour of the 82 clubs that
      Manchester United was prepared to throw to the wolves, once the
      Football Spectators Bill goes through.
12.   On page three, final paragraph, you will note that Manchester United
      uses 92 turnstiles which they say can barely cope. I would ask how
       is it then that Luton Town, with a so-called complicated computerised
      system, can get 10,000 people through 30 turnstiles with no problems
      whatsoever.
13-   As a final comment, and one which seems to me to defeat all the
       arguments, is the information contained on page two under the heading
      Voluntary Membership Scheme. You will see that 40,000 members
       joined Manchester United voluntarily under a 50% voluntary membership
       scheme. One therefore presumes that a 100% membership scheme would
       equal 80,000 people and since Manchester United's home gates average
       40,000 people it will be seen that a 50% casual membership already
       exists. I therefore do not see the argument that membership would
       decrease casual support. Is the future of football supporters once
      again standing side by side on terraces, or is it massive police
      prescence, massive segregation, massive disruption in Towns and Cities
      on Match Days and a generation of young supporters growing up watching
      football through fencing?
    The Football Spectators' Bill represents in my opinion a determined effort
    by the vast majority within our society to say enough is enough in that a
    section of the 450,000 who attend matches each week have taken away the
    civil liberties of those who live within a few miles of a football ground.
    The public are sick and tired of seeing scenes on television, as recently as
    last week with the Brian Clough fiasco, of football fans behaving in a way
    which is abhorrent to any decent citizen.

    Those individuals who have taken it upon themselves to denigrate the proposed
    scheme, almost inevitably from the so-called "super clubs" for example the
    Chairman of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. who wrote an article in your newspaper
    last week, have by their own actions brought the game to its knees due to
    their lack of vision, primarily through concerning themselves only with the
    affairs of their own individual clubs. It is particularly ironic to read of
    a so-called "super club" Chairman worrying about the catastrophic effect the
    scheme would have on clubs like Burnley, Crewe, Darlington, Halifax, Hartlepool
    and Scunthorpe when he was among the same group of people seeking to undermine

•   the confidence of the small clubs and who were prepared to cut and run with
    their television contract in their pocket, and to hell with the very clubs
    that are now being used as fodder by the anti-Bill brigade. I think juggling
    facts is one thing, but the truth is that these very clubs are facing
    bankruptcy anyway through the inept performance of successive Football League
    Management Committees made up mostly of entrepreneurial, self-opinionated,
    egotistical people, so much so that over the last 25 years the game has lost
    half its paying customers and half its paid professional employees, we as a
    Nation have not won the World Cup since 1966, we are banned from Europe
    because of our hooligan element, gates in the First Division went down last
    year by 11% although through the advent of play-offs overall attendances in
    the lower Leagues rose.

    Taking the example of Fulham that was used in Irvine Scholar's plea to the
    House of Lords, this in my view proves the point of the Bill in that the 99
    arrests that took place close to Fulham's ground were allegedly, according
    to the Chairman of that Club, not Fulham supporters. However he had no way
    of proving his statement whereas under the Bill if the 99 had been arrested
    and did not have Members Cards then he would have been able to prove
    categorically that they were not football fans.

    It is unfortunate that Luton Town is often used as an example of what the
    introduction of Membership Cards would mean. However I would point out that
    the Luton Town scheme in no way represents that being proposed by the
    Government in that Luton has a Membership Scheme which was closed at 20,000
    members, and a waiting list now applies. Luton's ground capacity is 14,000
    with 31 turnstiles. The Club's attendances, taking into account the loss of
    Away supporters and the rooting out of its own hooligan element, went up in
    the first season of Membership in 1986/87 . Unfortunately because of a pricing
    policy, totally unconnected with membership, gates dropped by 27% last season
    but have increased by 30% this season. I would stress again that this has
    nothing whatever to do with membership since the list is closed.

    It is interesting to note that Luton Town's income in 1985/86 was £2.1 million
    whereas last year the income had risen to £3.9 million, not because Luton won
    the Littlewoods Cup but primarily because sponsorship from General Motors was
    increased, support was forthcoming from Luton International Airport and the
    Local Authority, 28 companies pre-paid for 28 Executive Boxes to be built

                                                                      2/.
                                     .2 .



and sponsorship was forthcoming in respect of the synthetic surface.
Additionally the local business community, well known public dignitaries,
families, relatives and friends returned to Luton Town because they knew they
would not witness violence or obscene language and therefore their guests
would not be embarrassed.

A lot has been said and written about the difficulty a Membership Card would
present in allowing people access to the Ground in time for the kick-off.
Once again very little imagination has been shown by those who have large
gates to contend with and I put it to them that first of all the Membership
Card proposed by GEC would not in any way mean people taking longer to enter
a Ground than would be the case without a Membership Card. The technology
is there for all to see. The fact is that football fans need to be re­
educated and I would refer to the fiasco at the Cup tie this week between
Manchester United and QPR which underlines the fact that had there been a
Membership scheme and had Manchester United been in direct communication with
their known supporters, and had pre-Match entertainment been arranged, then
instead of 12,000 people being in the Ground 20 minutes before kick-off it
would have been possible for 40,000 to have been admitted. Referring to the
example of queues at Theatre Box Offices, people who regularly attend the
Theatre know very well that they need to get there at least half an hour
before the curtain goes up. Football fans, at least at Manchester United,
will have to learn that lesson although this is not the case in the vast
majority of Clubs bearing in mind that the average gate over 92 Clubs is
8,400. Yes, Luton Town is a small, average Club like the vast majority who
do not have to fear the problems envisaged by Irvine Scholar of Tottenham
Hotspur and Martin Edwards of Manchester United.

Quite frankly the game is about the majority of Clubs and the Government's
determination to protect the majority of our Nation from a certain section
of the 450,000 people who attend football Grounds is at the heart of the Bill
in that it will separate the football fan from the common criminal. People
say to me that hooligans, bullies, cowards and criminals will still go to
football Grounds whether or not a Members Card exists. The same point was
made to me when Luton Town installed a Members Only Scheme in that it was
claimed thousands of Tottenham Hotspur fans would come to our Ground when
Luton Town were playing Tottenham in order to break the system. In fact
because they knew that there would be no way they could gain entry to the
ground Away supporters just did not travel, nor did the trouble-makers, and
I believe that the Members Card will eliminate within five years all trouble
inside Grounds and all football related incidents outside Grounds. Surely
the way forward is to have less police, less fencing, less dogs and horses
and less closed circuit television, towards the ultimate goal of integration
of spectators.

It is worth noting when an arrest rate inside Grounds of 0.03% is mentioned
that for an "A" category gafte 10,000 fans equals 200 policeman to look after
them. To provide similar concentration of policing throughout the Nation
means that the population of 60 million people would require approximately
1.2 million policemen whereas in England and Wales there are in fact only
124,000 policemen. One must ask whether the Nation would be prepared to
have closed circuit television on every lamp-post in every street, avenue,
road and Motorway. Do we want to live in a Police state such as that which
currently exists at football Grounds.

                                                                   3/.
                                         .3 .

    It is interesting too to note from an opinion poll recently that 80% of the
    population agree with the Government taking a firm stand on this law and
    order issue rather than being sucked into the petty whims of those prepared
    to pay millions for the purchase of players yet who have refused steadfastly
    to accept the Government's invitation of a year or so ago to introduce a
    voluntary Membership Scheme. In this context certain of the so-called
    "super clubs" to all intents and purposes put two fingers up to the Government.

    The effect of the Bill, not if but when it becomes law, will be for those
    small clubs to be able to identify their supporters who in turn will belong
    to one big Football Membership Authority acting in the best interests of all
    concerned and not just for a few, with the result being that over the coming
    years the head of the family, the mother, will allow the father to once again
    take his children to the greatest game in the world without fear that football
    Grounds are places of hostility. In other words, it represents a fresh start
    for the game, a return to Europe, an inevitable improvement in our National

•   performance and a long haul to win back the 20 million supporters who have
    left the game, not least because of the presence of hooligans.

Luton Town F.C. Revenue E98|/6 (Pre-Members Only) £2.8 million

X am in receipt of your letter dated 22nd December, 1988, Please consider
the number of policemen it would take if you had the concentration of police
throughout the U.K. that there are looking after the 18 million supporters you
quote as attending games in any one year. Would you be prepared for closed
circuit television cameras to be on every lamp-post in every street and avenue
throughout the country as is currently the case at football Grounds. In other
words, would you like to live under a police state similar to the fortress
situation which surrounds the sport.

I do not accept that the vast bulk of arrests take place outside not inside
Grounds since surely you take the point that many of the offences for whiph
people are arrested outside Grounds would not have been committed if the
football Match had not been taking place.

Is the way forward for football really more closed circuit television, more"
segregation, more      fencing, more      dogs and horses, etc., etc?

I would also like       to know who says Membership Cards will be unavailable by
post and who says       that the cost     to supporters will be £9.00   initially.Also
who says that supporters will face long queues in view of the fact that they
have to queue now. The computerised cards will be instantaneous - this
statement is not spurious as you suggest. Additionally much of the intention
behind the proposal is to reduce segregation.

Police Officers after the first two or three years will not need to be
increased, in fact I believe they will be substantially less in number as was
the case at Luton.

The supporters you state are needed at football have already been driven away
in that the game has lost 20 million of its supporters since 1966. I firmly
believe that they will return when they realise that football Grounds are again
safe venues.




                 Telephone Hatfield (07072) (M (,\ or I ImIfield (07072) 6263?
With reference to the question you pose as to how many staff will be needed    '
to cope with Identity Card applications, I am sure you would be pleased to
learn that whichever company sponsors the Membership Cards will undertake this
administration•

I would advise you that most Club Chairman have been influenced by the ten so i
called Super Clubs who would have seen the other 82 League Clubs go out of     -
business quite happily over the recent television negotiations. The Clubs who
are expecting to lose 20% of their support are being sadly misled by the large
Clubs who would be only too happy to see the demise of the smaller' ones
and I am afraid that the likes of you are being drawn into this thinking.

The question of civil liberties is easily answered - what about the. rights of
the majority of the population, who have no interest whatsoever in .football,
to go about their lawful business in peace on Saturday afternoons. I was
pleased that police files will be used to prevent convicted criminals from
creating further mayhem - this seems very good news to me indeed.

The problems inside the Ground have not been contained or defeated. As you
well know in spite of closed circuit television, a heavy police presence, dogs,
horses, etc., arrests inside and outside Grounds increased last year. ’

The four answers to questions you have given in your letter are not worth
commenting upon. They are bigoted, ill informed and useless comments.

With regard to Luton Town's 100% Membership Scheme, this has been a total
success and I would draw your attention to the heading on this letter. The
reason for this is simple in that sponsorships have flowed into the Club from
businesses throughout the Town (Luton Airport, Luton Borough Council - you name
it), all of whom have supported us because people generally now feel that they
can bring their customers, friends, relatives and children to our Ground with
no fear of being embarrassed by obscene language or being subjected to scenes
of violence.

Mr. I, Stott,
Chairman,
Football League $nti Hooliganism Committee,
The Football League Limited,
Lytham St. Annes,
Lancashire,
FY8 1JG <

Dear Ian,

Thank you for your letter of 6th January which has been sent to a selection
of M.P*'s and Peers. It is unfortunate that the contents are mostly supposition,
inaccurate and misleading.

1.        Taking the 18 million people who attend football games, I must
point out that in broad brush terms that number of people equals 350,000
policemen to produce an arrest rate of 0.03%. Therefore with a population of
60 million a comparable figure would be 1,200,000 policemen whereas in fact
the total number of policemen is 124,000. Also included in your figure of 3%
for adults are instances related to exceeding speed limits etc. whereas your
illustration excludes that sort of offence.

2.        The Minister .has clearly set out the number of arrests inside and
outside football grounds and I would point out tha‘t in many cases the arrests
outside the stadium were for offences which would not have been committed had
there been no football match.

3>        X think the Minister has been more than generous in his comments in
view of the fact the Football League has effectively "put two fingers up" to
the Government with regard to Membership. He is not exaggerating disorder
inside the Grounds and I must ask, turning again to the 0.03%,whether you
personally would like to have a closed circuit television camera on every lamp­
post in every street and avenue throughout the U.K. to combat hooliganism
since this is what we now have at football Grounds.

          Neither you nor your head in the sand colleagues may accept the need
for a compulsory Membership Scheme but, unlike you, I care about the 20 million
people who have been lost to football over the last twenty years and the 50%
of paid professionals who have also disappeared.

5.        I believe that the Football League were caught with their trousers
down over the number of companies who were prepared to finance the deal and
it is only that fact which has led you to now admit that 90 firms have expressed
an interest. Arthur Young's feasibility study is something prepared by people

                                                                                    2/ .

Who know absolutely nothing about football.

6. and 7* No comment

8.        The Luton scheme is, and will continue to be, a 100% success and
there are no reasons to doubt this assertion. I note that violent offences
rose by a) 14% in Luton Police District, b) 9.6% in the rest of Bedfordshire
and c.) 12% in the rest of the country. However, you might care to note that
the figures were similar in 1986 and the Bedfordshire Constabulary will confirm
to you that the increase in the Luton Police District against the rest of
Bedfordshire and the country follows the pattern of recent years, for all
sorts of reasons but not because of football. You have missed the whole point
of what the Government is trying to do, i.e. separate the, as you put it, hardcore
hooligans from the genuine football fan by the introduction of a Membership
Card whereas at the moment there is no way of separating the two. You state
that the hooligans will find other opportunities to attack football supporters
but at Luton this has not happened.

With regard to the next paragraph, I can only refer you again to the numbers
of police which would be. necessary if you compared police currently deployed
at football through to our normal way of life. We would end up with a police
state which even you with your lack of perception of the real world would not
wish to see.

The Football Spectators Bill is not an irrelevance and will in the next few
years when we are back in Europe be seen as the measure which set us off on
the road back to sanity.

Yours sincerely,




David Evans
Since 1966 when linglaml la«t won the World Cup the game 1ms lost approximately
half of its spectators and half of its paid employees, this latter fact in my
view being partly attributable to the scrapping of the minimum wage.     Our
Clubs are banned from Europe due to the advent of Away hooligan supporters,
crystalised at the Heysel Stadium where Liverpool fans ran amok and brought
themselves, their Club and the U.K. to a point where we were universally
condemned and were not wanted either on or off the field.


We are talking about a game that was and is being administered by in the main
entrepreneurial, egotistical, self-opinionated twits in the guise of League
Chairmen, in conjunction with an antiquated group of pensioners in the form of
the Football Association, the majority of whom never had any responsibility
with regard to running a Football League Club.   This has produced a fatal
combination of greed and ego within our game resulting in a scenario where
footballers have to comply with a "win at all costs" instruction leading to
the sacking of 450 football Managers over the last twenty years which took
the game from being naturally exciting and positive to a point where
frustrating off-side tactics became part of the normal scene together with
professional fouls, time-wasting, cheating in the form of taking tferee or four
yards to their own advantage, fouling off the ball, poor refereeing,
inconsistent linesmen, etc.


Investment in stadia was incompatible with the ridiculous salaries and
transfer fees being paid by the so-called top Clubs in that the facility for
the paying customer with regard to car parking, toilet facilities at the
Ground, etc., were on average little better than those offered in the mid­
thirties.


The resultant soccer violence, mainly from the above, was highlighted by the
following quotation from a well known football Manager who was held in the
highest regard,   Football is not a matter of life and death, it is far more
important than that."

      ll,tl'olUlc“<|.       . n o w * i" hindsight with Ulii-ec incidents which brought all
 decent members or tho public, including those in football, to a point of
 saying enough is enough.          Those were tho Luton Town versus Millwall Cup tie
 and the appalling events at the lleysel Stadium, with these in turn being
 followed by the disgraceful and embarrassing incidents in Germany during the
 European Championships.


 Luton Town decided that as only 10% of those watching football on a regular
 basis travelled away it would introduce a Members Only Scheme which
 seemed to follow other sports such as tennis, golf, fishing, the M.C.C. etc.
 in that one needed to be a member to enjoy the facilities.            The Scheme was
 introduced amongst much controversy which led to Luton Town being banned from
 the Littlewoods Cup competition in 1986/87 .          The Club, however, stuck to its
 principles with regard to ensuring safety for those who live in Luton and
 safety for its members, in that it firmly believed that the people of Luton
 should be allowed to enjoy their civil liberty on Saturday afternoons.              Whether
01* not Luton Town has lost money or not through its. scheme is irrelevant - the
main point is that Luton has returned to a tranquil Town where people are able
to go about their normal business on Match Days.


The game itself needs radical change.          If we are to attract back the father
and the son, or daughter, then we have to persuade the mother to believe that
football grounds are safe places for her children to be, either on Saturday
afternoons or midweek evening games.          Public perception at the moment is that
football Grounds are hostile and dangerous places.           This has to be changed to
one where normality prevails and for this to be so it is essential for football
fans to be separated from the common criminal.           The Membership Card will
achieve this objective in that anyone who has such a card will be part of a
huge family and those who wish to drag the game through the gutters and who
are not prepared to become Members will be labelled common criminals which
they are although at the moment they are able to hide in the shadow of the
400,000/500,000 who attend football matches on Saturday afternoons.             My
experience of football fans is thatthey-will be unhappy to apply for a card but
if it is to save the game, which         at the moment is obviously dying year by     year,
decade by decade, and the result         is that football will be able to attract
back some of the lost 20 million         fans, then I believe firmly that they will
be prepared to become members of         the scheme.

diueardod by i,h<; ton "isupuf" Clubu viu-a-v;ia the television deal, have nothing
whatsoever to worry about Financially in that the scheme will almost inevitably
bo sell-1inancing and in any event one ol’ the major companies who see the
possibility.ol commercial benefits of such a scheme will pick up the cost of
installation.     In my view the much quoted objection that computers could break
down and cause trouble is purely a red herring since at that stage in the
event of such a computer failure people would be allowed into the Ground
provided         they   <-*.re in possession of a Membership Card.


It is important too to underline the fact that the Membership Card would allow
access to every League ground.


The opposition of some of the so-called Super Clubs (although four of them are
propping up the First Division at the moment) is purely a last ditch effort by
any means whatsoever of preventing Norwich winning the First Division
Championship, Wimbledon winning the F.A. Cup, Luton Town winning the Littlewoods
Cup and Reading winning the Simod Cup.          In fact the Membership Card scheme
will be seen in years to come as the saviour of the game which at the moment
is dying because of the greed and ego of the Chairmen of the big Clubs.                When
the Membership scheme has been in place for ten years I firmly believe that
prosperity will return to the game, we will have been re-admitted into Europe,
we will have won the World Cup and the 50 million people who currently have
no interest in football whatsoever will again be proud to call it our National
Game.

If Luton Is the pet Club of the Government, then it is because it has brought
law and order to the streets, roads, avenues and terraces of the town whereas
before the Membership scheme the following were the norm on match days:
houses were boarded up, people no longer tended their gardens as it was a
complete waste of time, shopkeepers boarded up their shops and were unable to
open for normal business, residents needed to remove their cars and park five
      «.? ?S ?W ?y 1 ° aV°id the vehicles beinS vandalised, the main shopping
 _ a, the Arndale Centre, had to lock the shoppers into the complex for
their own^safety, visiting supporters were frogmarched from the station to
the ground and back, accompanied by policemen, police horses and dogs
carriages of the trains that brought the visiting supporters were vandalised
on the journeys to and from the game, and the ground was, in common with all
        if8*6           ground, turned into a prison with caging, fencing In the

where our membership is in the region of 20,000 with, as stated, average home
gjjtes are around 10,000. One other arguement which has been put forward is
that most football supporters expect to arrive at the ground between 10 and /
15 minutes before kick-off, and that this fact would cause problems with the'

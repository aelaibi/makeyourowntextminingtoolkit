          dates between the 18th April 1989 and the 28th March 1991 I conducted Inquests
          into the deaths of 95 individuals as a result of an incident at Hillsborough
          Stadium on Saturday the 15th April 1989. In total I sat for [ ] days.

3.     My attention has been drawn to the 7 grounds raised by the Applicants in
their Form 86A dated the 5th May 1992 and I will attempt to deal with each of
those matters. I will commence by providing a summary of the form an/nature of                        "f
the Inquests.     There is now produced and shown to me and marked "SLP.l" a
paginated exhibit bundle to which reference is made in the body of this

Affidavit.


4.     Immediately following the Hillsborough tragedy it fell to me to conduct
the Inquests into the deaths of the 95 individuals who died" on that Saturday on

the 15th April 1989: In compliance with my usual and well-established practice
I considered that the questions to be answered for each of the 95 Inquests                                 / ;
within my inquisitorial jurisdiction and within the parameters of the Coroners'
                                                                                IM- / l
 Act 1988 were: Who? When? Where? and How? - in other words who the person was, ^ ^ ^
 where he/she was when they died; when he/she died and finally how he/she died.                      d& J <s>

 5.    I opened the Inquests on the 95 deaths starting on the 18th April 1989.                                   i
 At the initial hearings the bodies were identified and the Inquests then



                                            2

      tragedy which were bound to impact upon the nature of the Inquests; .namely-^

              Justice Taylor by the Secretary of State for the Home Department to
              carry out an Inquiry:

                     ground on the 15th April 1989 and to make recommendations about
                     the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events."

        6.    I was acutely aware of attempting to balance the practical imperatives
        for my inquisitorial purposes and the eminently understandable desire on the
        part of all of the relatives and friends of the deceased to know every single
        piece of information concerning the lives of the deceased on that fateful

                 Saturday afternoon.


                 7.     Following the identification carried out in April 1989 there followed
                 the Interim Report by Lord Justice Taylor in August 1989 and the Final Report
                 in January 1990. The Inquiry^y/as assisted by an independent Police Force - the
                 West Midlands Constabulary - who investigated the incident and gathered                   .
                 evidence for the Inquiry,        In order to complete my statutory function I
                 determined that the factual evidence concerning the questions of who, when and
                 where, could and should be met by officers                  of this independent force

^                g       Accordingly, I decided that the questions of who, when and where should

15.      On [                ] I made a preliminary ruling that in considering the
question of "How" I would^be concerned with events up to and including the time
of 3.15pm on Saturday the 15th April 1989 but not thereafter.          It was clear to
me that an important issue for the "How" que^on j ^ ^ t h e ^ m ^ ^ i n ^ ^ c h ^ the /r
crushing on the terraces had come about. ^ I picked on the time of 3.15pm

 felt it right to draw a line in that regard and I had in mind the approach                 ^ ^
 adopted by the Coroner in the Zeebrugge£lnquest.          However, my decision was
 based mainly upon the expert pathological medical evidence.

        17.    On Monday the 19th November 1990 I heard #prtfeer argument from Counsel
        instructed for the families of the deceased about the way in which the
        answering of the "How" question was to be approached.              On that day-an4,
        s jih s e q u e a tly $ the families w ere [representedrby Mr Timothy King of Counsel
        who had been Junior Counsel instructed to represent the families before the
        Taylor Inquiry. In summary, Mr King made the following points to me in order
        to persuade me to a different view to the preSnriawy ruling I had made:


        (1)    Up to this point there had been no investigation or systematic analysis
O              of what was the organisation of the rescue, what it might have been and
                whether it would have made a difference.               In that regard he was
                concentrating on that period of time after the individuals had been
                brought off the terraces and before death was certified.


        (2)    By reference to the case of Richard Jones he contended that there was
                material to support the general proposition that not all of the victims
                were necessarily dead by 3.15pm on that Saturday afternoon.



o       (3)     There was material (in particular from Dr John Ashton) that the medical
                and rescue attempts were disorganised.


         18.    I think it right to record that Mr Hale (and possibly Mr Isaacs) were
    n   not entirely supportive of Mr King's submissions and Mr Callaghan was against
         his approach.       The remainder of the legal representatives present adopted

         essentially a neutral position.


         19.    Having listened very carefully to these submissions I was not persuaded



                                                     8
            *                                              /
                    from mv preliminary view. I reminded Mr King that^the^Inques^ ^vas^not a
                                     ft                                                        A

                     reasoning.                                                                                        ;fj

                                                                                     '                                           '1
                     20.       On that first day of the resum ed Inquests into the 95 deaths there was a
                     good deal of legal argument (in the absence of the jury) about the rules
                     against     self-incrimination   as       they   applj^ to   Police   witnesses.   Those
                     representatives also strongly urged me to consider whether the representations
    q                of the families at the adjourned Inquests was to elicit evidence in order to
                     persuade the Director of Public Prosecutions to reconsider his decision not to             ^
                     prosecute any of the officers and for the jury to bring in a verdict of

                     unlawful killing.


                     21.        I was well aware of the emotions of the families, of the concerns of the
        *

24. The. Seven Grounds of Criticism in Form 86A
       With respect to the separate arguments made in respect of each of the 6
applications I have set out my decisions (and where necessary reasoning) by way

of separate commentary in the exhibit to this Affidavit.


       I direct my evidence on this aspect specifically to the 6 Inquests the

subject matter of the application.


Criticism (D
        T jfa               iiove
                             '    the reasons why I adopted the procedure I did for
                             held in April and May 1990.          I do not believe that

there'w as any practical alternative to the procedure I ad                          was J

something in the region of over 3,000 statements taken.           If               very
witness, this aspect of the Inquest would have taken very mi                       each




Mr Fraser and there was very little questioning of the officers giving the

 seminary..     I believe that in each instance the              was a fair and accurate

 statement of the evidence then available.


 Criticism (2)
         This is in effect the same criticism as in (1) above.



 Criticism (3)
         The responsible and relevant expert medical evidence available to me
 from pathologists of high renown which had not at any stage been challenged
      during that part of the Inquests held in April                                             ,
      to the effect that each of the 95 victims <wefe-^pa<r by 3.15pm.                  Where
      appropriate, the pathologists were invited to consider lay evidence relevant to
      each particular case. At no time did the pathologists alter their opinions.


             My task was to call relevant evidence to put before the jury.              In the
      light of the unchallenged expert testimony of the pathologists, there was
      nothing that could have been done by way of medical or rescue intervention that
      would^jjtave-beea-of any help to any of the deceased^-let-atenefoave had any
                                                                                    %
 n    impact upon the cause of death.
 rO
hi
              I set out in the exhibit my comments upon the evidence of Dr Bums. ^


      Criticism (4)
              I did not <^>11 either Dr Ashton or Dr Phillips.              I considered the

       statements from both of these doctors.            In the light of the uncontested
      pathological evidence I did not consider their evidence to be relevant to the
       issue of "How" in any of the 95 Inquests.        I had noted that Dr Ashton and Dr
       Phillips had both given oral evidence to the Taylor Inquiry.           I had read the
o      Interim Report in particular paragraphs 296 to 298. They provided as follows:


               "No Fault bv the Emergency Services
               296. I say at the outset of this chapter that no valid criticism can
               be made of the response by the St Johns Ambulance Brigade by SYMAS or by
               the Fire Brigade on 15th April. Indeed, no represented party ventured
               any criticism of them. The onlyH attack on SYMAS came from 2 Liverpool
               doctors. One claimed that ambulances did not arrive swiftly or with
               sufficient equipment and that there was a lack of triage. He was proved
               to be wrong in aU 3 respects. Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on
               television on 15th April when he said more lives could have been saved
               if staff and equipment had arrived earlier. Apart from bemg proved
               wrong in fact as to the times of arrival of ambulances, he conceded in
               evidence that it was not possible to say whether lives could have been


                                                   11
          saved. His comments on television were irresponsible. The other doctor
          complained of the absence of degpBillators.     I am igtisfied on the
          overwhelming evidence that to attempt to use a defiabillator on the
          pitch with people milling about would have been highly dangerous owing
          to the risk of injury from the electric charge.
          297. I find that all 3 of the emergency services named above responded
          promptly when alerted, that they brought appropriate equipment and that
          their personnel operated efficiently.                •
           298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium,
           medical facilities capable of dealing with a major disaster such as
           occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators,
           stretchers, other equipment and medical staff sufficient to deal with
           over 100 casualties is not practicable."



o   At paragraph 301 the Report stated:


           "There was insufficiently close cooperation between the police and the
           emergency services. It is clear that SYMAS and the Fire Brigade should
           have been called earlier than they were. However, m view of the nature
           and extent of the crushing, the time when police rescue began and the
           pathetically short period for which those unable to breathe could
           survive, it is improbable that quicker recourse to the emergency
           services would have saved more lives."



           I was aware that Dr Phillips and Dr Ashton were the doctors concerned in

    the observations made at paragraph 296.
°
            I emphasise, however, that it was my opinion on relevance based upon the   ^
    unchallenged and overwhelming pathological evidence which influenced my

    decision.

Criticism (5)
       Again, this criticism is really a repeat of the point made in (3) above.



Criticism (6)
        On the relevant evidence that I had led I directed.the jury upon the
verdicts that were in my opinion open to them.            I had invited and obtained
detailed submissions from all interested parties (on- what verdict§j (ea tfae_

eswAanca thatifae jurviiad-hgard) were available.


        [This has to be very considerably expanded by illustration.]



Criticism (7)
        I am confident that the                     *e accurate and fair summaries gfc

the evidence then available.


 25.    With respect to the matters exhibited to Jeremy Hawthorn's second
 Affidavit sworn on the 11th September 1992, then I comment as follows.


 (1)    At the time I gave an interview to the makers of the television
         programme, I had retired from the office of Her Majesty’s Coroner.
         However, the transcript ^accurately sets out certain of my answers
         (plainly with editing not all of the information I gave was broadcast).


 (2)     I confirm that the views I expressed in those interviews represent my

         opinion.


 (3)    I have read and considered the 6 page report of the well known
               pathologist, Dr Iain West, dated the 20th August 1992. He is an eminent
               man a a k a r f s s p s e d in his field - but then so is Professor Usher and

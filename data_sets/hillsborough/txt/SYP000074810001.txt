a rr iving at the ground there were                     no    large    crowds    just a -few people

queuing         to enter    the ground.          I fartfe a t t e n d e d H i l l s b o r o u g h before     so I

had no problems            finding      the^for rect turnstile.               There were         police

outside         the turnstile ^ffg c k i n g t i c k e t s .       I ente re d t h r j z w g h   a t urnstile

and    I was      tham searched by a police officer % s ^ l                     entered the ground,

I turned         l a f y a n d went    to the north u p Q f r r       t erracing     between the         north

a nd the west         stand,    we stoj^d therg^fast year and                   it is a good spot.                 I

a r r i v e d on the terrace anil f c n j m d a good s p ^ K i o              stand at about 2. 10pm.

I noti ced then that               the two     centre    peyy*. behind the goal at t h e

L e pp i ng s    lane end were         full,    the^ifuter wings         of the terrace and my

terrace were          nearly/empty,            re went       off the terrace        to get a cup of

tea and then returned t s ^ o u r               position.        At about 2.25pm we              resumed our

p osition on the upper                north terrace and          I noticed that          people were

still      coming      into the two        centre    pens,      there was       plenty of        room    in the

side    pens.        A few people around us were                 saying      that the centre            pens

were    full and that          the     side    pens had plenty of            room.      At about 2.40pm

people st ar te d to          come on to the north upper                 terrace,       they were

showing         everyone    their      unused tickets,          they were       saying      that    it was

mu rd er    outside,       none of them said how they got                    into the ground.

E v er y o n e was     singing and enjoying the day.

The    next      thing that        happened,     is that the teams            came orj>«f' the       pitch.

I was then          looking at the         pitch and not at            the Le^^^ings Lane           terraces.

I w a t c h e d the kick       off,     a short time          later B p & r dsley hit the b a r , I

to.     I saw that supp jrters w e^/e being                    pulled from the          rear of the

t errace        up into the         est V t a n d above       them.     I saw a fan c 1 imb over               the

side fence and            into the other         pen,    where    there was still a lot of

room.       I a ga in     conc en tr at ed on the match,              I thought      that    it was      just

* itself out.          I then saw a policeman           run onto      the    pitch and     I saw him

 signal       to the   referee.       I looked towards          the L ep pings Lane        terrace and

 saw supporters          climbing     over the    perimeter         fence and onto        the    pitch.

 I stood and w a t c h e d as more and more              people      climbed over onto the

 pitch and more          people were        pulled from the         rear of the terraces           up

 into    the west stand.            I thought    that the supporters w ould be put                     into

 the     side pens      and then the match w ould             restart,    I did not      realise what

 had     happened.       At this time        supporterv^ere         still     coming onto my

 terrace and they were              talking a>*fut people           dying on the t er rac i n g .

 More and more         people     climb^ra over onto          the   pitch and the       police and

 ste wa rd s were      trying j^c pull        the fencing       down.       I saw some     po 1 i ce

 climbing       over   i ntq/the     pens,    I remember       police    pulling      the fence        from

 the outside a n d/ po li ce and supporters               kicking       the fence from the

 inside       in an attempt       to kick     it down.        I saw a lot of people             lying

 on the       pitch near    to the goal,        and people walk in g ar ou nd            in a daze.           I

 then saw       people    lying on the        pitch with       coats over      their    faces,     I then

 re alised that        they must      have    been dead,       and that      something more

 serious      than just a crowd problem had happened.                        I stood an d w a tc he d

 for about 5 mins          then went        down to the       rear steps      to get some fresh

 air,    as    I could not face watch in g            it anymore.        I stopped there          for

 about 20 mi ns         a nd then I went       back up to see what            was   happening.         I

 saw     that the Liverpool         half     of the   pitch was       covered w ith      people

 w a n d e r i n g ar ou nd and   people     lying on the       pitch,      some being a t t e n d e d to

 and others with          coats     over    their heads.        I sat down watch in g           this

 until    I heard over        the    loudspeaker       that    the game had been abandoned.

 I then       left the ground wit h my father arid made my way back                        to the

 coach.        We arri ve d back home and         I then went         down to the        local    public

 house with my father.               When    I got back home at about Spin,               I felt       very

 sad and       I found that       I could not speak.            I felt terrible.           I sat down

           and     I had not got the s tr ength to stand up.

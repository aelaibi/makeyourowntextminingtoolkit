            On S a t u r da y      15 A p r i l      1989       I went     to   the     Football         M a t c h at

            Hillsborough.                 I am a Liverpool                Supporter           I did    not     go    in a n

            organised            party.         I got      my     ticket    from Anfield.                I am a S e a s o n T icket

            Holder.             It wa s     a six        pound     standing       ticket        for L e p p i n q s     Lane.

            I t r a v e l led      to     the    game      myself     and       I went        on the     train.         I a r r i v e d at

            Sheffeild Station                   s o me    t ime    between       1300     hrs a n d      13.30       hrs.

            At      the S t a t i o n     the    fans      were     put    on    buses        and    taken     to   the     ground.

            There         were    Poice        Officers         organising        this.

            On      the    w a y to     the     ground      I can     not       remember        seeing       anyone       drinking          in

            the      Street.          I did      not      see a n y   disorder           or    fighting        or a n y     drunks.

            I a r r i v e d at        the      ground      sometime        between         13.30      hrs    and     14.00       hrs.

Stewards.               I can not           remember           if t h e r e       were     any Police                 Officers,

outside          but      I w as      searched          by a P o l i c e          Officer           ins i d e        the     ground.               I

entered          the      ground         by a t u r n s t i l e        and    handed           my    ticket            in.         I did          not

see     anyone          climbing          over       walls      to get
                                                                                     s ' the g r o u n d .

any     gates       open       other        than      the      turnstyle.

I did        not    see a n y         signs       showing         ye    where        I had          to    go.          I h ave          been       the

previous           year      and      I k n e w w h e rjf I was              goi ng.

I      did   not        see a n y S t e w a r d s / o r         Police       O f f i ce rs          by the          tunnel.              I walked

through          the      t un n e l ,    I Mid       f ree     passage           through           it a n d         into P e n 4.

11 w a s      j ust       before         1/ft3Q hrs       w hen    I got          into     the       pen.            I had         not    seen

or     d r u n kn ess ,

At     about       14.30       hrs       I thought          the    pen wa s          full.           I did see               people           still

passing          in f r o n t        of me      so    people were             still        coming           in.

The     pressure            in the        pen w as        gradually           increasing                 a n d at a b o u t             14.S3

hrs     when       the     teams         came     out     the     pressure           in the          pen wa s             worse         than       I

had     e ve r     experienced              before.            I presummed               t hat      o nce       the       g am e    started

the     pressure           would         ease.

When      Beardsley            hit       the    c r oss     bar    there          w as    a surge           forward.                I

expected           to     go b a c k a g a i n a f t e r          the    movement              forward              but    th is        did       not

happen.            I was       even more             c r u s h e d at    t h is      stage          and     I became               very

worried about                my      safety.          I wa s      gradually              being       moved           towards         my       left

and     at    one       poi nt m y        r i gh t    leg      became        wedged against                     a    crush         barrier.

I was        stuck        t h e re    for      about      a minute           or    so w h e n        there           seemed         to    be a

lull      in the          crowd m o v e m en t          and     I got m y          leg     free.            I carried               on m o v i n g

with      the      f l o w of        people       towards         the    fence           b etween Pens                4 a n d 5.              I

could        see    pe o p l e       climbing         o ve r    the     fence        and       getting              out.        When      I got

to     the    fence         I saw a         lad      in his 2 0 ’s s t u c k              against           a       crush       barrier            he

w as    screaming            that        his    legs      were     c aug ht.             I w as      helped           over         the    fence

and      into P e n 3.               I then       helped        other        people        o ver         the        fe nce .        I then

about       on    it.       I saw a          1o t / o f       injured      people          on    the    pitch         being

treated.            I walked           o ve r     to    the N o r t h S t a n d        by the          h al f     way      line    and

sat    down.           Someone         in the          Stand      h e l p e d me     into        the    Stand and               I sat

down.

I stayed          t h ere       u n til     I h eard an a nn ou n ce m en t                 on    the     loud        speaker

system       saying         the m a t c h         was     abandoned.              I left         about       10 m i n u t e s      after

that.        While         I was       sat      in the         North Stand           I saw a           lot      of    people

carried across                  the    park       on s t r e t c h e r s     to     the    Kop     e n d of          the    ground.            I

thought          they were            all    just       injured.           Although a             person          d id w a l k     past

me    and    said         that     there        were      dead      people        in the         Pens.

I did       not     see a n y t h i n g         in the         ground      t h at    I consider              to      be    of a

criminal          nat ure .

The    emergency Services                       were      slow      to   get      go i n g .      It s e e m e d a          long      time

before       they         realised what                wa s    happening.            The        Police       were         very slow           in

opening          the      gates       to    the    Pens.

I think          that      there       are      not     enough        exit     gates        in the        Pens,           and   t ha t    are

not    wide       en o u g h .        Liverpool           fans      should        h a ve    b§en       given         the    larger

Spion       Kop     e n d of       the      gro u n d .

I think          t h at    at    s ome      stage       the      t u n n e 1 s^rfSuld h a ve           been       closed        off      and

fans    then        di r e c t i n g       around       the      outside       off     the       stand       to      the    outer        pens

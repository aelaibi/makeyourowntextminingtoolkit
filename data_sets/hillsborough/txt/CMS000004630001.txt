              Yesterday I made a statement about the Taylor Report and I
              had the opportunity then to express my sympathy for the
              relatives and friends of those who died and for those who
              suffered injury at Hillsborough.                            To voice that sympathy
              again is not out of place - but I am sure the bereaved would
              agree with me that the best service we can now perform for
              the dead is to bend all our efforts towards preventing a
              similar tragedy ever happening again.


              What happened at Hillsborough on 15 April last year must not
              finish as just another entry in the list of major tragedies
              which have afflicted football over the years*                           It must mark
              a new beginning for football in this country.                           The tragedy
              would never have occurred had the lessons from the past been
              learned and properly applied. This time they have got to De
              learned, and if they are^the loss of life will not have been
              entirely in vain.


              I wish to record again my appreciation and thanks to Lord
              Justice Taylor for the very considerable amount of work
              whici he put Into this valuable report over the past

nine months.                I would also like to thank his assessors,
Mr Brian Johnson, the Chief Constable of Lancashire, and
Professor Ieonard Maunder, who is Professor of Mechanical
Engineering at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.                        The
special knowledge and expcriencc which they brought to the
Inquiry was obviously invaluable.


Immediately after his appointment Lord Justice Taylor set
out to identify the direct cause or causes of the tragedy
and to see what immediate steps needed to be taken, and
taken if possible before the 1989/90 season began:                      as soon
as his Interim report was published a Home Office Circular
was sent to local authorities, the police, football clubs
and others concerned with the organisation of football
matches, urging them to take action on the report's 43
recommendations.               I am glad         to     say   that,   with   few
exceptions, they were brought into effect before or shortly
after the start of the season.


We now have Lord Justice Taylor's final report, and as the
House knows his comments on the introduction of a football
membership scheme led me to announce yesterday that the
Government had decided not to place before this House at
present proposals for the setting up of a football
                                                                PAGE.0 4

membership            authority.        The Government      togk powers to
 introduce a scheme because of the refusal of the football
authorities to give any sort of                   lead in the fight against
hooliganism.            In this respect they show themselves to have
more      commonsense than the Opposition Front Bench, whose
pusillanimous and wholly negative attitude throughout has
been nothing short of              pathetic.        [MR GODFREY TO INSERT ONE
OR TWO QUOTES]

The Hon Member for Copeland’s speeches on Second and Third
reading contains not a suggestion.


The                       the report may have brought joy to some in
the industry, but this joy must have been short lived for
they are the recipients of a damming indictment.                           Lord
Justice Taylor pointed to previous reports on crowd safety
and the extent to which they had gone unheeded;                    and to how
complacency is still to be found at many grounds and in many
board rooms, even after Hillsborough.                    He illustrates this
by relating the          complacent remarks of senior club officials.
[INSERT REFERENCE]               More worrying perhaps, he refers to the
recent incident at Middlesbrough on 9 December where it is
clear that some of the specific lessons of Hillsborough had
cither not been learned or had not been applied, though
mercifully the number of injuries on that occasion was very
29   J AN   ’ 90   19:10   QUEEN   ANNS    GATE   R.777            PAGE.0 5




                                          4.


Lord Justice Taylor talks of a general malaise or blight
over the game due to a number of factors which he identifies
principally as old grounds, poor facilities, hooliganism,
excessive drinking and poor leadership.                   He says that crowd
safety and crowd behaviour are closely related to the
quality of the accommodation and facilities offered and to
the standards which are encouraged and enforced and he makes
plain his view that all too often the accommodation and
facilities are appalling and the standards deplorable.


The fans are not given a clean bill of health.                       Plainly
there is far too much drunkenness.


But Lord Justice Taylor's main criticism is addressed to
those who run the industry and who have offered squalid
conditions to their customers - conditions which encourage
rather than dissuade the hooligan.

For all the reasons which Lord Justice Taylor has identified
we arc in agreement with his conclusions that on grounds of
safety we should move towards the phasing out of the
standing accommodation at major football matches and at
certain other major sports grounds. Indeed we proposed this

                 course immediately after Hillsborough,                     We will use Part
                 I of the Football Spprt.nt.0r 5 Rill to achieve this purpose by
                 bringing into force those parts of the Act which permit the
                 setting up of the Football Licensing Authority with power to
                 issue licences to football grounds.

                 What we envisage is that the conditions of licences will be
                 related to the timetable for the phasing out of standing
                 accommodation recommended in the report.                   We shall clearly
                 need to discuss with the football authorities how this
                 5h6uld h& achieved in practice.                    Consultation of this kind
                 will also be Important in the case of some other sports
                 which have designated sports grounds under the Safety                          Of
                 Sports Grounds Act, some of which are not fully enclosed.


                 Some Members may feel that the move towards all seated
                 accommodation will force clubs to turn away spectators.                         I
                 can only ask them to read the report carefully.                  Many clubs
                 already have more seated accommodation than the numbers of
                 spectators who on average* attend their grounds.                      A 10%
                 reduction in standing capacity will not affect them for some
                 time, if at all.            Some say it will change the atmosphere of
                 the   game,     m     it may well be a change for the better, Lord
                 Justice Taylor points to experience in Scotland and says
 £9   J AN   ! 90   19:11    QUEEN   ANNS    GATE   R.777           PAGE.0 7




                                        6.


h$ is satisfied that In England and Wa le s r as in Scotland
and abroad, spectators will become accustomed and educated
to sitting. The evidence he has received shows that more
recently where seating has been installed the fans have come
to accept it and like it*

Some clubs will             ng doubt be concerned at the cost of
improving their seated accommodation, the facilities for
spectators and the other measures necessary to remove the
squalid conditions referred to in the report.                   Lord Justice
Taylor suggests a number of ways in which money might be
raised.        But he says, and we agree, that the bulk of the
money must come from the industry itself.                   There is a basic
rule in this country, originally in common law but now also
in statute law, that It Is the duty of occupiers to take
reasonable care towards those whom they Invite into their
premises. So far as the Government is concerned, our view
is that if the professional football industry wishes to
invite members of the public to watch the game, it must pay
for the facilities which are necessary to ensure that those
it invites are protected against unsafe conditions and
loutish and hooligan behaviour.

                                               7.


I come now to the recommendations made in the report for
specific changes relating to safety conditions, A number of
detailed recommendations were contained in the interim
report.            Some caused difficulty ih a minority of cases,
which was perhaps not surprising given the very diverse
nature of the sports grounds to which the recommendations
were intended to apply;                and in the final report a number of
the interim recommendations have been modified. We shall be
drawing       these         changes     to the attention        of the    local
authorities and clubs concerned shortly 1n a circular.                      I do
not want to go over the safety recommendations in detail.
I agreed yesterday that I would place in the Vote Office a
schedule setting out the Government's response and that has
now been done.              There are, however, one or two matters on
which I would like to comment.

Lord Justice            Taylor        recommends       the setting   up of an
organisation to review or supervise the way in which local
authorities carry out their responsibilities under the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and the Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 1n respect of safety at
sports grounds and other sports venues.                        Part I of the
Football Spectators Act 1989, in particular section 13,
gives such a role to the Football Licensing Authority in
 £9   J AN   ’ 90   19:1£    QUEEN   ANNS   GATE   R.777              PAGE. 0 9




respect of designated football grounds:                     designated that is
for the purposes of the 1989 Act.                  I have already said that
we propose to set up the Licensing Authority to bring about
all seated accommodation and we shall also bring into force
the powers to permit it to review these safety functions of
local authorities.


Lord Justice             Taylor   suggests     that     the    powers of the
Licensing Authority should be extended to cover all sports
grounds designated for the purposes of the 1975 Safety of
Sports Grounds Act and also other sports grounds {where
there are regulated stands under Parts III of the Fire
Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 and indoor
places of sport licensed under                                                We
shall need to consider this carefully, The powers under the
1989 Act extend only to football                      grounds and on past
experience that is where most of the problem lies.

There are a number of specific recommendations for the
amendment           of   the Green Guide.             The   Green   Guide,    as
honourable Members will know, is a document published by the
Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department
which owes its origins to the technical working party set up
by Lord Justice Wheatley in the course of preparing his
report on crowd safety at sports grounds which was published
23   J AN   ’ 30    13:12     QUEEN   ANNS    SA T E    R.777             PAGE.1 0




                                         9.


in 1972. The document has been revised on a number of
occasions           in the light of experience gained from later
incidents.          We shall of course be taking immediate steps to
revise the guide again but I think we can say that 1t has
stood the test of time remarkably well.                              Indeed it is
difficult, not. to conclude that if the guidance which it
contains           had      been   properly            followed    and applied   at
Hillsborough and more recently at Middlesbrough, neither
accident would have happened.


I turn now to the role of the police in ensuring safety and
effective crowd control at sports events.                         A key Issue here
is the liaison between the club and the police.                         There must
be no opportunity for each to stand aside thinking that the
other is dealing with the matter:                      and Lord Justice Tayl o r ’s
recommendation that there should be a written statement of
the respective functions of club and police for crowd safety
and control is one I can readily endorse.                           I also welcome
his recommendation that clubs should recruit and train
sufficient fit, active and robust stewards, not least
because the more capable the stewards the less clubs need
call for special police services, thus releasing police
officers           for duties outside the ground not necessarily
connected with football: a benefit to the public generally,
29   J AN   ’ 90   19:13   QUEEN   ANNS   GATE   R.777




                                      10 .


For these reasons, and because it is right in principle, I
support the report's recommendation [R*53] that police
authorities should ensure that charges made to clubs for
policing inside abounds                   mli&tie.         I stall   encourage

consistency of police authority practice with regard to
charging, subject to the need, recognised in the report, for
local discretion and the need to have regard to local
circumstances.


[The report also makes recommendations about the training of
police commanders [R.52] and of police officers whose duties
require them to recognise crowd densities and to understand
crowd dynamics [R.12, 16].                I endorse these and the other
recommendations dealing with police planning.                        I have no
dOUbt       that      chief     officers,, will          respond     to   these
recommendations in             the same positive way that they did to
those in the interim report.]


Lord Justice Taylor has much to say 1n his report about
iooliganism.          Like many before him, he has concluded that
ihere u            no single measure which will defeat football
hooliganism and even a package of measures will take time to
have effect.          [425.]
29   J AN   ’ 90   19:13      QUEEN   ANNS    GATE   R -. 7 7 7            .   P A G E . 12




                                         ft


In recent years the Government has been attacking the
hooligan problem on many fronts:                          we have taken action
against alcohol abuse in the Sporting Events (Control of
Alcohol etc) Act 1985;                we have introduced in section 5 of
the Public Order Act 1986 a new offence of disorderly
behaviour;           the police have developed their tactics by
making effective use of closed circuit television (CCTV) at
grounds       and     by      increasing      the     gathering          and     use      of
intelligence on hard-core hooligans.                        At the end of 1989 we
established the National Football Intelligence Unit (NFIU)
which has already made a good start in compiling and
collating centrally intelligence on the most serious and
persistent football hooligans.


[Turning to hooliganism abroad, at our initiative there has
been set up, under the TREVI arrangements for co-operation
withih th6 European Community, an information network of
permanent          football     correspondents.                   We   have developed
guidelines on the policing pf international matches which we
have put before our TREVI partners and which have been
warmly welcomed. We are co-operating fully with the Italian
authorities in providing advice and assistance for their
lioi icing of British supporters attending the World Cup.]

                                       12 .


Part II of the Football                Spectators Act         1989 has been
welcomed by Lord Justice Taylor.                  Under Part II of the Act
courts may Impose restriction orders on those convicted of
football-rela Led offences as defined In the Act.                         Those
subject        to     restriction orders          will be     prevented from
travelling to key matches abroad,                 I believe its provisions
will     have a salutary effect on those hooligans whose
disgraceful behaviour abroad has so blackened the reputation
of football.           We plan to implement Part II as soon as the
practical           arrangements    and the       remaining    Parliamentary
procedures have been completed.               [This is expected to be in
early May.]


Following bilateral agreements                    with other countries our
courts will            be able to impose           restriction     orders          on
offenders convicted abroad of corresponding football-related
offences. We are giving priority to concluding an agreement
with the            Italian authorities.            We aim     to have these
arrangements in place befofe the World Cup.                      I expect the
provisions of Part II to have a useful deterrent effect on
che behaviour of football spectators abroad.


Taken together these measures against hooliganism are having
some effect.           Lord Justice Taylor notes that in the last
£9   J AN   ’ 90   19:14   QUEEN   ANNS   GATE   R.777               P A G E . 14




                                      13.


couple of years there has been a reduction in violent
misbehaviour inside grounds.              But there Is no reason to be
satisfied with the position.


[Still less can we be satisfied about misbehaviour outside
grounds and on journeys to and from matches:                         we shall
certainly pursue vigorously the strategy we have already
adopted.]


We shall encourage the enhancement of CCTV systems and the
training of their operators, so that cogent evidence against
culprits can be more readily obtained.                    A computer system
for the National Football Intelligence Unit is being
procured as a matter of urgency and is expected to be fully
operational shortly, and it should                    be possible for the
police to target their resources more                        easily on        the
ringleaders and organisers of the violence.


The House knows that Lord’ Justice Taylor recommends the
~reation of some new offences specific to behaviour in
rootball grounds and the application of attendance centre
orders      and      electronic    tagging       to      convicted   football

 I now want to return to the football membership scheme*
What Lord Justice Taylor examined was not the general
principle            of     a    national       membership      scheme,       but       the
feasibility and practicability of the particular proposals
which were the subject of the Invitation to Tender which was
issued       by       the       consultants       employed      by    the     football
authorities.              In the event, he has concluded that there are
considerable disadvantages in those proposals and we have
for that reason decided not to proceed with the setting up
of\the Football Membership Authority.                           But that does not
mean that there is going to be a let up in the fight against
hooliganism.              I have outlined the action we are to rake.
The vast            majority pf people who go to watch football
matches, even in the appallingly squalid conditions which
exist at some major grounds, are decent, well behaved people
- neither drunken louts nor hooligans.


It 1s high time more consideration was given to their
interests, to their safety, to their enjoyment of their
sport.       And if by the measures proposed we can both enhance
their enjoyment and the reputation of the game our effort-
will not have been in vain.

 N^


Q17

 049

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR

 THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 YES, PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING AT THE POLICE TO OPEN THE GATE, BUT THE POLICE

 DID NOT RESPOND QUICKLY ENOUGH BUT TO BE FAIR TO THEM IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

 THEY COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

 Q50

 W ^ T TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 4.30PM (1630)

 Q51

 LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT.


Q18

 GS2

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 YES, THE PHOTOGRAPHERS BEING MORE CONCERNED WITH TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS,
                                                                             PAGE      S

 THEY OBVIOUSLY REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED.      C AHT                   C O K K ^ X i T
 1) THERE WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ALL THE OFF ICIAL ORGANISATION.

 I HAD TO LISTEN TO TH RADIO TO FOUND OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

 2)WHY DIDN’T THE POLICE OR STEWWARD GO TO THE SIDES OF THE PENS & HELP

PEOPLE OUT INTO PENS 2 & 5. THIS WOULD HAVE SAVED LIVES.

3) WHY WASN'T THE FENCE CUT.

4) LACK OF EQUIPMENT AND FOREPLANNING EVIDENT



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I AM A REGULAR TO LIVERPOOL GAMES IT IS ALWAYS THE CASE THAT AT 2.30PM (1430)

THE GROUND IS FAIRLY FULL, BUT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOR SOME REASON THIS WAS NOT SO

OBVIOUSLY IF THERE HAD NOT BEEN A RUSH TO GET IN THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED

ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS WE WERE DIRECTING TO SECTIONS THIS FOR SOME REASON DID

NOT HAPPEN.

 STEWARDS, WELL THEY DID BUT NOT QUICKLY ENOUGH.

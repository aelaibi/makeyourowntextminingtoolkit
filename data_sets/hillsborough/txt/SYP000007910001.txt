ate    and          drank        thfem.         We    stayed             he re      until       2.30           (1430       hrs)        and       w e re

the    police             had       come       to    the       pub       at    2.00       pm     (1400          h r s ) and        closed             it

outside.                 This       had     the      effect          of       encouraging                 the     supporters                to    move

away    towards                 the      ground.

We    walked             down       to    the       ground          via       Leppings          Lane.             There         was     a

reasonable                number          of    other          supporters                making           the     same       journey             as    we

got    nearer             the       ground          and    I could             also       see       reasonable               numbers

approaching                 the       Leppings            Lane       gate          from       the     opposite             direction.                  As    we

got    to       the       river          bridge       I    could          see       th a j / ’o a c k          from     the t u r n s t i l e s

corner          of       Leppi ngs          Lane      by       thje br i d g e           and     real ised            that        it    was

impossible                to     get      through          this          crowd       to       gain        access        tp^the          South

stood       by       a    video          cameraman             filming             the    crowds.               On    Leppings              Lane       were

officers          on     the     horses            had    a    message              and       he       made             his       way       into       the

crowd       and     I    couldn't             understand              why.           The          people                were       already             packed

in    the    gate        area       like       sardines              and    they             could          not          get       out       of    the       way

in a n y w a y     whatsoever.                     The    other           mounted             officers                   seemed             to    be    trying

to    close       the     gates          because          they        were          trying             to       position                their          horse

across       them        b ut    I didn't            see       the        outcome             of       this             as    the       time       had

reached          about        2.55       pm    (1455          hrs)        and       we       realised                   we    would          have       to       get

in    from       the     other          end.

Kevin       and    myself           ran       around          the     outside                of    the          ground             and       entered             via

the    directors              and       officials             c ar    park.              I    can       recall                the       difference                at

this       end    as     it     was      quiet       and       with        only          a    few       fans             going          in.        We       got       to

our    seats       just         before         kick       off,        the       players                were             already             out.        I

looked       at    the        Leppings             Lane       stand and              could             see          that          it    was       already

packed       with       only        a    few       spaces          available                 at    the          ends.              I commented                   that

in    no    way    could         they         all    get       in     and       certainly                   not          before             the    kick          off.

The    match       started              normally          and        for    some             reason             I       looked          at       the    crowd

in    the    West        stand.           I    recall          seeing           a    man          climbing                   over       the       heads          of

people.           He    was      coming            from       the     back          towards             the             pitch          edge       and

directly          behind         the      goals.              I can        only          remember                   then          that       someone

actually          got     over          the    fence          but     I d o n ’t             know       if          it       was       the       same       man

because          it w a s       about         now    that          BEARDSLEY                 hit       the          bar.           I then          saw       a

policeman          run        onto       the       pitch       to     the       referee                and          also          that       a    number          of

people       had        come     over         the    fencing              and       were          on    the             touchline.                 The

Nottingham             Forest           fans       near       us     thought             it       was       a       pitch

invasion          and     were          shouting          for        them       to       get       off          the          pitch.              I didn't

think       it    was     a     pitch         invasion,              it    seemed             obvious                   that       people          were

panicking          and        trying          to    get       out     whatever                way       they             could          and       in    any

case       the    police         d o n ’t      run       onto        the    pitch             if       its          a    pitch          invasion,                they

put    a    cordon        along          the       fences.            I saw          a       few       number                of    policemen                on    the

touchline          between              the    goal       and        the    South             stand             and          only       a    few       at    first

were    on       the       railings          themselves                helping             Fans       out.           The       rest        didn't

seem    to       know       what       to    do.        Fans          were       also       being          pulled          up       into        the

seats       above          the    terraces.                 I don't             know       how    long          it       was    but        eventually

the    fence          gates       were       opened          and       people          got       out       onto          the    pitch.               I

remember          one       in    particular,                a    fan       lying          by    the       corner          flag        to       my       left

with    another             fan    hitting             his       chest.           He       was    joined             by    a    policeman                 a

little       later.

It    seemed          at    this       point       that          the       Forest          fans       didn't             know       what        was

going       on    and       they       were       chanting             which          seemed          to       insite          some        of    the

Liverpool             fans       and    some       of       these          started          towards             the       Nottingham                 fans

in    the    HOP.           To    stop       this       the       police          put       a    line          of    officers              along          the

halfway          line.           Just       in    front          of    us       were       Forest          fans          and    they        were

the    same       and       Liverpool             supporters                on    the       pitch          were          incensed.               Police

Officers          came       to    them          and    the       Liverpool                fans       pointed             out       the     man

causing          trouble.              The       police          then       took       this       man       away.

I saw       an    ambulance             corne      onto          the       pitch       and       along          the       touchline              and          as

it    got    in       the    rear       of       the    goal          by    the       West       stand          it       was    surrounded                    by

the    people          on    the       pitch.           There          was       total          mayhem          on       the    pitch           by       the

West    stand          and       the    one       I had          watched          by       the    corner             flag       was        still

there.           I think          then       that       a    steward             at    the       KOP       end       got       hold        of    the

hoarding          and       took       it    to    the       injured.                 This       then          snowballed             with

supporters,                Policemen             and    other          helpers             doing       the          same       and     the       injured

were    carried             off    the       pitch          through             the    entrance                opposite.

I stayed          in m y         seat       for    about          another             hour       and       I    can       only       recall              one

announcement                about       what       was       happening                and       that       was       by    DALGLISH              asking

everyone          to       co-operate             with       the       police.              They       then          said       the        game          had

been    abandoned                and    we       left       the       seats.           We       had    a       coffee          in    the        South

stand       restaurant.                 We       then       left       and       on    the       way       to       the    car                       broke

down    and       a    Sheffield             family          took          us    into       their          house          and       l et    us       use

the    phone          to    telephone             home       and       offer          us    coffee.                 We    only       stopped              here

                                                                                                                                                  S695

             about        10 m i n u t e s      then      carried            onto          the    car      and    returned          to     Lytham       St

             Annes.

             At    last       years       match       I was          able        to    gain       access         to    the    South        stand       seats

             from       Leppings          Lane      but    this            year       it    was       impossible         and       the     crowds       were

             far       more    and      it    seems       to        me     the    turnstiles               at    this    end       were

             ineffective             to      those      numbers             that       I saw          at   the    KOP    end.        To     me    it

             seemed        obvious           that/there              were        far       too    many       people      at    t h e Lej/pings

             Lane       t u r n s t i l e s Jfr y i n q    to        get     in a n d        I think            that    the    a r e a /m o u l d

            ‘h a v e    been     cordoned           off        to    prevent           others          arriving         to    m a k e /the       matter

             worse.           A1^6      I cannot          see        why     the       start          of   the    game       was    nfot    delayed          to

             allow       fans      to     get    in     properly.                 This,          if    the      game    had    been        delayed

             would       have      stopped          poeple           from        trying          to    rush      and    push       their     way       in.

             If    that       message         had     been          p ut    over       to    the       fans      the    matter       may     have

             eased.

where        I went      in the        ground            I swopped           tickets        with         him.          After       leaving

actually           outside          the    ground       o nc e        I walked          through        the m e t a l        gates          at

I went        into       the       ground.

Only        myself       and                            went          through        these

the     others          went       into    the       stand       turnstiles.               Also      although             there       were

quite        a few P o l i c e m e n           outside       the       ground        on f o o t      and     on      horseback             I

he    then        shouted          that       the     gate w as         open       but    I d i d n ’t at              the       time       know

where        it wa s         but    I then managed                 to get my a r m s                 fre e a n d        1' l i f t e d       them

the       gat e    was       b e h i n d me,        again      I dont         know       h ow      long      it was             but a f t e r

           had     said       this       a very        very       little          amount        of      s p ace    became             c l ear     by

Somehow           I d o n ’t k n o w          how,     I managed             to    pull       myself        along           the       fence

suppose          because          they       had     been     told        he w a s        dead      but       they     grabbed         his

arms      the      lad      next      to me        that     is a n d          pulled       very      hard and             eventually

they      pulled him              out a n d as           s o o n as       they       did      the P o l i c e m e n        t hat    had

been      w i t h me,         I remember             n o w he was             a bald       headed Sergeant                  came       with

pulling          the       other      lad out.

They      d r a g g e d me        by m y a r m s         o n to     the       pitch and                       came     to me a n d        I

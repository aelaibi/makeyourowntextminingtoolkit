This is just a brief note to thank you for attending the meeting
yesterday and for your contribution to the development of our thinking,
in relation to the fulfilment of the requirements of the Lord Justice
Taylor Report.

As promised, we will produce a short report of the meeting, in the
course of the next ten days and circulate the report to all who were
present at the meeting.

May I just also confirm that the next meeting will be on Monday 6 April
1992, at Lancaster Gate, commencing at 10.00 a.m.    We will, ofcourse,
circulate an Agenda and the necessary  papers, nearer to the date.

With renewed thanks and kind regards.

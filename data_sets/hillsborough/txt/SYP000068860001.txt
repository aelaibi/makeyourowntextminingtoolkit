          w ith me,.          I didn" t know them,             but they were           talking        to me,         asking

          if    1 w a n t e d a n y t h i n g or if they could he 1 p.                  Then a P o l i c e m a n        earns

          and a s k e d me         if 1 could walk and he                 helped me        to the        other       end of the

          pitch so that              they had mo re room because they we                       still trying            to get

          people        out   of     the     pen,, S o m e b o d y   I c a n ’t remember        who      it    was     told me

          to    lie down on the             pitch,     I can't        remember       anything       from       there        until      I

          was    outs ide tne         f i r s t aid    ro o m »        w q A ' sat   down     leaning agai n s t             a pos

          I don't know          if I was       carried        tnerar or     if    I walked,,




          The    only thing          that    I can say         is that      from     being      pushed agai nst              the

          fence     to    being at      the first aid              room    I cannot        really        remember what

          happened,           I couldn't        hear       or see a n y t h i n g    other     than the          odd bits,,

          cannot        say what      happened        to             or the young           lad that was              in front

          of me as        1 just      d i d n ’t see       them,     I knew w hen        I got home           that                   wa:

          alright        and that      he had got           out    of the     pen.

          I    w ould    like      to add    that     the    overall       o r g a n i s a t i o n was    no good,,           "h e

          policing        outside      the    ground was           inadecjuaie,        there was          too many          fans

CoMKft/iS-for the amount of Police that were there.

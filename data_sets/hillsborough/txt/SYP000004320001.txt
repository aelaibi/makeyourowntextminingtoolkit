            I am       a    single        man        and    I    live       at    the      above        address          with        my   mother          and

            fathe r .

            I am       employed           as     a    programme             seller         by    the        Sheffield          Wednesday

            Footbal 1 Club                at     the       Hi 1 ls' bo r ou gh        ground.               I have       been        employed            in

            this       capacity            for       the     past      3 years.             My    normal           duties        are      to       sell

            programmes                in P a r k s i d s        Road       button         the    15th        April       1989        I was         detailed

            to    sell          them     at    the        bottom       of    the       sVps        leading          to    the        Spion         Kop.        I

            think          it    was     X and        Y    starKs          but     I'm not        sure.            This    was        a   static          post
                                                                       X           7-302-
            and       I was        accompanied              by                                   Prior        to    the    commencement                   of

            the       g a m e _______|and                 I wereissued             with      a   shoulder           bag        for    money         we    had

            collected              and    also        a    h o l d a l 1 bag         to    which        we    transfer           Bank      of       England

            Notes.              The    holdall            bag    is    normally            kept        on    the    floor       and       I stand             on

            it    so       nobody        can     steal          it.

At    about       11.20          am    on       the      15th        April                  and       I went       to       our       position

and     started            selling           the      programmes.                 We       were       in    possession                of    five

thousand          programmes                and       these          are       priced       at     one      pound        each,         so

hopefully             at    the       end        of      the        day we      would        have sold            all       of    our

allocation.                 When       weto o k          up     our       position          the        gates       had       not       been

opened          and    there          were       no      spectators              in    the       ground.           At       about          twelve

o'clock          the       gates       were        opened            and       there       was    a    steady          flow       of       spectator

into     the      Spion          Kop.           From       the       position          we    occupied             I could             not       see

the     football            pitch          or    the       West       Stand.

At    about       2.20       pm       this       day       we       were       still         in    the same l o c tio n               and        we

had     sold      about          fifteen           hundred            prog ra mm es          and       in    the       note       bag       on       the

floor       I would          estimate              there            was    about       fifteen             hundred          pounds          and       as

previously             stated          I had          my      feet        on    the    bag       and       this    money          would          have

been     visible            to    persons             who       were       passing          me.        At    this        time         1 was

the     steps         and    one       of        this          g r o u p came         up   to     me a n d       said       'Give          us    a

hoIdal1 bag.                 He       pulled          it      away        from    me       but     I was         able       to    s n a t ch         it

back.           This       youth       did       not       make       any       further          attempts          to       take       the       money

ou t,     b ut    walked          away          with       his       mates.           I discussed                this       incident             with

         and      I tried             to     contact            the       Police       with       a    view       to     reporting               the

incident          but       there          was     none         about.           At    the       time       in    question             the       area

was     very      crowded             and       were       virtually             pinned          against          the       wall.           We

continued             selling          our       programmes.

At    about       2.45       pm       I had        sold         all       but    about       a    hundred          programmes                   so    I

left     my      position             to     return           to     the       gymnasium          and       to    count          my    money

of    the    money,

At    about       2.55                   returned             to       the    gymnasium          and       she    told\e              her       coat

and    keys       had        b\en       stolen          from       a    barrier          near    to       where    we       had       been

standing.

l'n r e s p e c t       of    the       incident          involving                the    holdall          the    youth

responsible              I would             describe           as      a Nottingham             Forest          supporter             aged

about       thirty,           dressed             in a    black          leather          jacket,          denim       jeans          and

trainers.               He    had       short          cropped          hair       and    was    of       medium       build.           All

four    of       his     group          appeared          to       have       been       drinking          heavily          but       were       not

As    I have        said|_______ |joined m e                       in              gymnasium          at    about       2.55          pm a n d

we    stood       in     position             *B’ which                I have       marked       on       the    plan       which       I now

produce          exhibit           number          reference             number                 1.        There    were       a       number

of    police        officers             in       position             *F*    which       I have          indicated.              A    message

filtered          into        the       room       that       there          was    a    pitch       invasion          and    P o l i ce

officers          who        were       both       uniform             and    plain       clothes          left    the       room.

I would          estimate              that       there       were       between          twenty          and    thirty       of       them       and

prior       to    them        leaving             I assisted             them       in m o v i n g        about    six       tables             from

position          *B * to          position             'C '.          The    gymnasium          was       divided          into       four

sections          by     nets          and    curtains             hanging          across       the       room.        Shortly             after

leaving          the     police          officers             returned             and    asked       us    to    move       into       position

*D * i n d i c a t e d        on       the    plan.           I lifted             the    curtain          dividing          ’D*       and       ’C *

and    I saw        a    dead          body       on    the     floor         at    position          E    on    the    plan.

This    body        had       a    blanket             covering          the       persons       upper          half    of    the       body

and    the       person           was    wearing          an       old       fashioned          dark       coloured          suit.              The

person       was        obviously             a    male       and       he    was       wearing       black       shoes.              I formed

the    opinion           it       wa    an    elderly           gentleman.                When       we    entered          this       section

there       were        no    other          persons          or       police       officers          present          in    the       room.

1    continued           c o u n t i ng'TTiy m o n e y             as    best       as    I   could        but    there       were          a

number       of     injured             Liverpool             supporters                being    bought          into       the       section
                                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                                       S432

occupied          by    us.

1 took       my    money          to    a    man       I know         as                   who     is    in    charge       of    us,       and

I then       became          aware          of    a    number         of    dead          bodies        which       were    laid       out    on

the    floor       in    positions                F , B and           C    on       the    plan.         Most       of    them    were

covered       up       and    I am          unable          to   describe             them.         After       this       I felt

helpless          and    I just             sat       and    had      a    drink.           1 had        nothing          further       to    do

with    moving          the       injured             or    dead      bodies.              During        the    time       I was       in    the

gymnasium          it    soon          became          very      crowded             with       people        and    the    only       other

thing       I did       was       to    use       the       telephone               and    ring     home.

I   left     the       gymnasium             at       about      3    pm a n d        because           1 was       very    upset       I

went    home       with

Whilst       I was       in m y         original             position               selling        programmes             I was       aware

that    a    large       number             of    Nottingham               Forest          fans     entered          the    ground

shortly       before          the       kick          off    and      were          obviously           worse       the    wear       for

drink       and    were       very          noisy          and   rowdy.

I would       like       to       add       that       prior         to    2.15       pm    there        were       about       eight

police       officers             in m y         vicinity            but    after          that     they       went       away    and       none

returned.              I was       present             at    last         year       semi       final     and       exactly       the       same

happened.

I hav e s i g n e d          an    exhibit             label         re f er r ing         to     the    Ground          Plan    on    which

X have       indicated             points             A , B , C , D,            E    and    F .

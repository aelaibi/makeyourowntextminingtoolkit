outside,                 but    I did         see       one            steward          inside.

1 n e ve r         actually              got       into            the       ground         because          I strolled             up    to a g a t e

next      to       the         turnstiles              at          approx          3.06pm         (1506),          the       blue    coloured

concertina                 gate      next             to           the L e p p i n g s         Ln terrac e t ur n s t i l e . T h e r e               I wa s

met     by a w o m a n             police            constable,                    she      told       us    to " H o l d on

because            there         wa s     a    delay.”                      I held an            unobstructed                view    to       the    rear

of     the     turnstiles                 at       the        mouth           of    the       tunnel,          leading         under          the    stand.

We     stood             there     chatting                 with            the    p o lice,       it was          quiet       and       peaceful.              A

few m i nu te s                l a ter    they          started               to    faring        people       out.           1 s aw      one       man

he w a s       being            carried            out         face          down,       he wa s         blue,      then another                man       was

having         heart            massage.               Only             then       I realised               people       were       dead.           I was

in d e e p         sh o c k .        I saw           people                 pleading          with       police         officers          to    go    in

t he    ground and                 help,              but              they were            s l o w to      react.        W h e t h e r or not            they

could        have          helped         or       not         I d o n ’t know.'

I c a n ’t e x a c t l y             remember                 how           long    I stopped               outside          the    ground,          but

after        a while              I walked away                         back       to    the m i n i - b u s        in o r d e r         to    re-group

and make                 sure     everyone              was            OK.

I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r               anymore              about           the       deaths.             I d i d n ’t see         anyone

actually                 die,    and      I cannot                     ident i f y a n y          of     the    bodies         I saw.

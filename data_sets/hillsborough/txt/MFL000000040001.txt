  THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

Background
    Britain's worst football crowd disaster happened on Saturday, 15
April 1989 when 95 people were killed or fatally injured, many of
them crushed to death, at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, at the FA
Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
     There was massive press and broadcasting coverage of the
tragedy that evening and for the next two days, and extensive
coverage for the rest of that week of the aftermath of the tragedy and
public concern about the explanation of it and possible responsibility
for it.
     On Monday 17 April the government announced that there would
be a public inquiry into the disaster by Lord Justice Taylor and two
assessors. The same day the Press Council announced that it would
hold a general inquiry into photographic coverage of the tragedy by
the press. The decision followed widespread and serious public
criticism of the publication of pictures of spectators trapped, injured
and dead, and of the alleged conduct of some photographers and other
journalists. This criticism and direct complaint to the Press Council
continued to grow. By 19 May the Council had received 349 written
complaints from a total of 3,651 signatories. Among them they named
35 newspapers and included 56 general complaints about the be­
haviour or contents of the media which did not name specific
newspapers.
     The complaints went beyond criticism of photographic coverage
of the tragedy, and the Press Council broadened the scope of its
inquiry to embrace all press coverage.
     As well as complaints from individual members of the public,
some of them relatives or friends of the dead or injured but others
unconnected with the tragedy, the Press Council received complaints
from many Members of Parliament on their own behalf or on behalf
of constituents. Among organisations which complained to the Coun­
cil were The Football Association, Liverpool City Council
Hillsborough Working Party, Sheffield Methodist District Synod,
and the Clergy Disaster Team of the Oldham Division of Greater
Manchester Police.
     On 28 June the Home Office passed to the Press Council a
petition from the Merseyside Area Student Organisation with some
7,000 signatories protesting at one aspect of press coverage, an article
in The Sun. The petition had been forwarded to the Home Office by
Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry. Lord Justice Taylor also ordered the
West Midlands Police to make available to the Press Council all
evidence given to his inquiry which concerned the conduct or
coverage of the press. The Council is grateful.

   Newspapers specifically identified in complaints to the Press
Council were:

    The Daily Express, Daily Mail, Daily Mirror, Daily Star, Daily
Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The Sun, The Times,
Today, Mail on Sunday, News o f the World, The Observer, The
People, Sunday Express, Sunday Mirror, SundayTelegraph, Sunday
Times, The Evening Standard, Bedfordshire on Sunday, Coventry
Evening Telegraph, Daily Record (Glasgow), East Anglian Daily
Times, Evening Echo (Basildon), Evening News (Edinburgh), Glas­
gow Herald, The Northern Echo (Darlington), Evening Herald
(Plymouth), The Scotsman, Shropshire Star, The Sunday Post, Eve­
ning Advertiser (Swindon), Wales on Sunday, Western Daily Press
(Bristol), and the Yorkshire Post.



     In each case the editor was told of the complaint to enable him
or her to reply directly to the complainant, but all national newspaper
editors and editors of some regional newspapers which were not
referred to specifically in complaints were asked by the Press Council
for views on their own and other newspapers' approach to picture
coverage of the tragedy and their general views on press coverage of
disasters. The great majority responded, often in considerable and
helpful detail, for which the Council is grateful.

     Although the Council studied and considered separately the
picture coverage of all national newspapers and many regional
newspapers, including all listed above, it decided as it was conduct­
ing a general inquiry not to make separate findings on each or to
identify the photographic coverage of individual newspapers except
as examples to indicate types of photographs on which it intends to
comment.
General principles
     It is the job of newspapers to report news including tragedy and
horror and sometimes to awaken public conscience or determination
that tragedy shall not be repeated. There cannot be a comfortable or
pleasing way of doing that when those near to the events will be under
deep grief or emotional stress.
     The Council accepts the assurance of many editors that they
considered carefully how far it was right to publish photographs
which might serve apublic interest by arousing concern and focussing
determination to avoid a similar tragedy but would also distress
survivors and the families and friends of those who were killed and
were likely to be offensive to other readers. The decision was hard in
very many cases: in most of them the Council believes editors were
justified in publishing the pictures they did.
     The Council considered carefully, as it has done before, whether
colour reproduction made such a difference to the impact of pictures
that it might have been justifiable to publish some of them in black
and white but was tasteless or offensive to do so in colour. It decided
that in the case of these pictures and the circumstances of this tragedy
there was no ethical distinction to be drawn between colour and
monochromereproduction.
    Similarly, it concluded that no distinction was warranted by
whether a particular picture was published on Page 1 or on an inside
page.
     The Council decided that no distinction could properly be drawn
in this instance between newspapers which used certain pictures on
the day of the disaster, the next day in the Sunday newspapers, or on
any of the following days, though these were distinctions cogently
argued by some editors.

Specific complaints
     More than thirty national and regional newspapers published
broad pictures, taken from a distance, showing a large section of the
crowd through the high steel fence, the front row crushed against it,
many of them recognisable and in attitudes of distress, pain and fear.
Inevitably such pictures will have distressed many who saw them:
there was no means of telling how many of those shown died or were
seriously injured. Nevertheless the Press Council believes that pub­
lication of these pictures was justifiable. They were horrific; they
portrayed an horrific event. They reported the event accurately and
brought home vividly the danger of a dense crowd under pressure
packed behind an immovable fence. These photographs showed the
horror of the tragedy without isolating in close-up individuals who
were facing death or serious injury. The serious public interest was
served by their publication, which was within the discretion of editors
despite the added distress it would cause.
     In the Press Council's view the same cannot be said of a smaller
number of photographs which it has seen published in a few
newspapers. In these the focus was on a single individual or very
small group crushed against the fence, sometimes with features
cruelly distorted by its steel mesh. They showed graphically the terror
and in some cases the torture of the persons concerned in images of
which the mind cannot rid itself. Although it can be argued the public
interest would be served by their emphasis on the danger of crowd
and fence, in the Press Council's view in these pictures the intrusion
into personal agony and grief was too gross to be justifiable. The
Press Council concludes that these were pictures which editors ought
to have chosen not to publish, particularly as most newspapers had
available the general pictures which the Press Council believes they
were justified in using. In those circumstances to use intrusive
pictures of individuals as well as or instead of the general pictures
was to accentuate unacceptably intrusion into grief.
     A third category of picture widely published showed single,
often clearly identifiable, individuals lying on the ground, being
treated, or being carried away. In some cases they appeared to be
dead, in some the caption implied that they were dead. Newspapers
are free to show the injured being treated and it is right that they
should, but editors should approach the possibility of picturing the
dead with great care.
     There are rare occasions when a newspaper may justify publish­
ing an identifiable picture of a fatal casualty of an accident or incident
but this has to be judged on the circumstances of each case. Despite
the public nature of this disaster, there was no such justification here
forpublishing individual pictures ofmen or women who were known
or thought to be dead or dying. Their use was insensitive and the
decision of some editors to publish them was an error of judgement.
     It was thoughtless of a few newspapers, some of them the subject
of separate complaint, to identify stories about the disaster by the use
ofastylisedlogoechoingapublishedpictureofafatal casualty. These
victims may have been identifiable to family or friends: in any event
to use such a picture for such a purpose was to trivialise death.
Conduct of photographers
     Decisions about which pictures to publish lie with editors and
have been the subject of much criticism in public comment and
complaint to the Press Council, but there has been widespread
criticism, too, about the alleged conduct of photographers on the
scene.
     These allegations cause the Press Council concern and should
cause newspapers concern, but they have been in general terms only.
The Council has received no evidence that enables it to identify any
particular photographer or journalist or the representatives of any
particular newspaper as behaving improperly.
     There is, however, clear evidence that to people involved in the
disaster the behaviour of some photographers at the scene appeared
unhelpful or insensitive. There was serious public concern and even
anger at the impression that photographers were concentrating on
obtaining close-up pictures of those in danger and distress even at the
risk of hampering rescue work. It is understandable that this should
have been the perception but the role of a press photographer at any
incident however tragic is to take pictures of it, not to take part in it
- just as the role of a reporter is to write about what he sees, not to
become caught up in the event.
     This could not relieve a journalist from the humane duty of
rendering aid to someone in serious peril if he were able to do so and
no one else could. Nor would any journalist argue that it should
relieve him of that obligation, but that is not usually the position at
major disasters of this type.
     There the duty of the journalists on the scene is to record the
event without impeding rescue efforts, but they and their editors also
have another responsibility. They should be aware of the danger that
photographers going about their proper work of taking pictures of the
injured, dead or distressed may appear callous or insensitive to those
involved and by doing so add to their distress.
    The duty of editors in the instructions they give and of photog­
raphers in the way they behave generally in covering major disasters
is to exercise the maximum possible care and understanding for the
feelings of all those involved.

On TRUTH
     An article which gave particular offence to readers, including
the 7,000 who signed the Merseyside Area Student Organisation's
petition, occupied the front page of The Sun on 19 April four days
after the tragedy, headlined THE TRUTH. Its subsidiary headline
alleged' 'Some fans picked the pockets of victims. Some fans urinated
on the brave cops. Some fans beat up PC giving kiss of life." The
article and its headline provoked many protests to the Press Council,
some with multiple signatures, that it was offensive, distressing and
insensitive. Appearing as a news story, it reported serious allegations'1
about the behaviour of Liverpool fans by a named Member of
Parliament; by policemen, one of them named and three anonymous;
a named nearby resident, and an unnamed neighbour.

     Although it said the named policeman stressed that only a small
minority of Liverpool fans behaved "so badly", the article was
generally one-sided, offering no other counter to the allegations it
included. Whether or not any of these allegations can be sustained,
the article was unbalanced and its general effect misleading. The
headline THE TRUTH was insensitive, provocative and unwar­
ranted. The Sun's own ombudsman declared that the article should
not have been published in the form in which it appeared. The Press
Council condemns its publication.

     Although The Sun's article attracted particular criticism similar
allegations were reported, sometimes with a lack of sensitivity, in
other newspapers.

Comment articles
     Three examples of another type of article which were the subject
of specific criticism to the Council were those by Edward Pearce and
Auberon Waugh in The Sunday Times mdThe Sunday Telegraph
respectively, and by Richard Littlejohn of the Evening Standard. All
three were clearly comment articles giving the writer's own view of
the events to which they referred. The Council has said as a point of
principle that columnists and observers are free to comment on affairs
and newspapers free to publish their comments, making clear that
this is what they are.
     The freedom to comment embraces publication of deliberately
cha 1lenging and provocative views, but editors should weigh careful­
ly how far to exercise that freedom in the face of deep tragedy when
it may appear distasteful. National tragedy or disaster is not an
occasion for writers to exercise gratuitous provocation, but it was
within the discretion of the editors of the three newspapers to publish
the columnists' articles they did.
Cartoons
     Three cartoons which gave offence to some readers were drawn
to the Council's attention. They were drawings by Gaskill in Today
comparing the price of stadium safety with the cost of a star player,
Mahood in The Daily Mail showing the FA Cup running over with
woe; and a black picture by Garland in The Independent o f a goal net
torn in skull-like holes.
    Cartoons are not always intended to amuse or to poke fun. Artists
have often used them to make a sharp or bitter point and the Press
Council accepts that they were free to do so on this occasion.


                              * * * *
     In the course of the Council's inquiry it was greatly assisted by
many of the letters from members of the public. It was also helped by
the ready response of editors in explaining the decisions they made.
The Press Council will consider whether it would be useful to publish
some of these in a record of the inquiry.

       can feel
       THE Press Council is right in its verdict that
       publication of pictures from the disaster at
       Hillsborough was generally correct, it is right
       that the use of a few pictures was distasteful,
       and it is right that one newspaper in particular
       should be condemned as totally insensitive in
       its treatment of a story subsequent to the
       disaster.
          The events of April 15, with 95 deaths, were
       horrific and newspapers cannot but reflect
       that. Pictures that showed the scene in gen-
       eral have to be acceptable, even if they are
       disturbing.
          Close-ups of the dead or dying, sometimes
       with*their features agonisingly twisted by the
       wire fencing, were wrong — and the Press
       Counci I is right to condemn them.
           And The Sun’s outrageous story four days
       after the event that purported to tell 'the truth'
       about the disaster was insensitive and is right­
       ly condemned. The only saving grace is that
       The Sun's own ombudsman also said it was
       wrong and in the wake of the Press Council
       inquiry the paper has at least accepted that it
       was wrong.

       No complaints
           We take a particular pride in the fact The
       Star does not come in for any criticism. The
       Press Council considered 349 written com­
       plaints, backed by 3,651 signatures against 35
       different newspapers — but The Star was not
       complained against by anyone.
           Yet we are the newspaper on the spot. We
       were the first newspaper to print initial details
       of the tragedy on the Saturday afternoon, gave
       further details in our Saturday evening sports'
       paper the Green 'Un, and produced a special
       edition of The Star on the Sunday.
           In the subsequent weeks we devoted pages
       to coverage of the disaster and how it
       happened.

       Readers’ judgment
           We have been the newspaper at the centre
       of the whole tragic episode. In those circum­
       stances, not to get a single complaint against
       us shows we did our job not just well, but with
       the necessary sensitivity.
           Considering we deployed some 40 staff on
       the weekend of the disaster and in its after-
       math, we can be proud of every one of them
       and of our reputation for fairness. We can also
       be proud of our readers who realised what we
       had to do and why we did it.
           Now we await the preliminary report from
       the public inquiry into the disaster— believed
       to be due out later this week. If Lord Justice
       Taylor can come up with ideas on how such a
       tragedy can be avoided in the future, he will
       have done well.                               ■

  Resignation
  demanded
  Dear Sir,
  The essence of the interim report
  on the tragic events at Hillsbor­
  ough Football Ground, on 15
  April last, is that
  the policing of the semi-final at
  Hillsborough broke down
  and that
  the main reason for the disaster was
  the failure of police control.
     Speaking of the conduct of
  some 65 police officers, the report
  says
  for the most part, the quality of their
  [oral] evidence [to the inquiry] was in
  inverse proportion to their rank
   and later
   the seniot officers in command were
 ; defensive, and evasive witnesses . . .
£ But neither their handling of problems
   on the day, nor their account in evi-
   dence showed the qualities of leader*'
' ship to be expected of their rank. g f
    It was against this background
  that the Chief Constable of South
  Yorkshire, Peter Wright, took the
  sensible step of tendering his res­
  ignation. One must assume from
  this that he intended to resign.
    The Sheffield Star said in its edi­
  torial of 7 August:
  Chief Constable Peter Wright has ten­
  dered his resignation. When members
  of the South Yorkshire Police Author­
  ity meet, on 14 August, they should ac­
  cept it.                                ,
  It is most unfortunate that, when
  the committee did meet, they de-
" cided that Mr Wright should keep
  his job.
     It would appear, despite their
  protestations to the contrary, that
  the Police Committee and the
  Chief Constable do not really ac­
  cept the correctness of Lord Jus­
  tice Taylor’s interim report. If this
  is so, will they tell us who was re­
  sponsible? The facts have to be
  faced.
  Yours sincerely,
  MARTIN FLANNERY

SOUTH Yorkshire Police Authority is
to investigate allegations that its chief
co n sta b le tried to influence next
m onth’s inquest verdicts on H ills­
borough disaster victims.             ,
   A special meeting will be staged this month to analayse
his remarks in an article in The Star on February 5, when
his retirement was announced.                ;
   Mr Wright said he could not come to terms with Lord
Taylor’s finding that some semi-final fans had been drink­
ing, but that alcohol played no role in the events.;
  • More evidence would be put before the coroner which
may put a different com­
plexion on the disaster, he
said.
  The story infuriated busi­
nessm an Trevor Hicks,
whose two daughters were
among the 95 dead.
  His Complaint says Mr
Wright’s “disgraceful’’ con­
duct could affect inquest im­
partiality and '...distort the
course of justice.
   The allegations suggest
that Mr Wright, who retires
on May 1, may have abused
his privileged position to        Police chief Peter Wright

   Merseyside Ml* David Al­
ton is upset the drinking
issue has raised its head
again, saying: “If all this is
going t ^ ^ ; trigg ed , «#p

the victims and other fans, it
will cause quite unnecessary
grief for many families."
   Mr Hicks commented: “I
 know sp e cifica lly that
neither of itty daughters had
had anything to drink ajid I
fully agree with Taylor’s
view that drink was not a
major factor.”

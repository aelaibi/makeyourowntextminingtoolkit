               On Saturday           13 April         1989     I was     d e t a i l e d for     duty at H i l l s b o r o u g h

To    the    left        of    turnstile              16    is a    solid metal                barrier          some        12 feet

separating              the    turnstiles              for    the       seats      from        the     turnstiles                for    the

standing           on    the     Leppings             Lane    terraces,              There          are    10 f o o t        high

wrought        iron       gates          giving        access       to     this      enclosure             and       some        50    feet

from     the       turnstiles.

I took       up     position             outside           turnstiles           13 a n d       14    together            w i t h PC         220

turnstiles.               There          were     a    c o n s i d e r a b le     number        milling           about          in
                                                          H.F<~*dCTA*/r
Leppings           Lane       but     they       were              rsie-d to       go     into       the       ground.

By    1 p m s t il l      very        few    people          had    passed         through           the       turnstiles              we

were     supervising                and     between          1pm    -and 2 p m       t tie re was          a very           gradual

increase           in the        people          using       the    turnstile            but        s t ill     there        had       not

been     many       people          through           the    turnstiles            considering                 the      size      of    the

c ro w d e k p e c t e d .

Shortly        after          2.30pm        the       amount       of    people         wanting           to    use      the

turnstile           increased              considerably             and       orderly          queues          began        to    form       at

each     turnstile.                 We     were       still     carrying           out     duties          checking              tickets

and    s e a r chi ng         p e o p 1e    pr i o r to       them       go i ng     th r o u g h     the       t u r n s t i 1e b u t           it

became       obvious           about        the       time    that       to     search         everyone           waiting             would

cause       unacceptable                 congestion           therefore            we    were        searching              only

selected           people        in      order        to    speed       access       into       the       ground.
At    this    t i me     a    problem          became        evident          with     the        tickets          in that

although         the     tickets          had     been       colour        coded,          red for        West          S31 a n d    seats,

brown    for      North        Stand       seats        and    purple          for     Leppings           Lane          ten'race

standing         the     holders          of    these        tickets          did    not         seem    to    be a w a r e          of       the

significance             of    these       c ol o u r s .

There    were       no       signs    telling           people          to w h i c h       turnstiles              to     go    to       for

their     colour         of    ticket          and    although           the    turnstiles               were       lettered

these     letters            could    not       be     seen    through          the        ever     growing             crowd.            This

ment    that      people           getting        into       the    wrong       enclosure               had    to       go     back       onto

the    street       before          they       could     get       to    the     correct           turnstiles,,                 Also

despite       ticket          checking          by     police       officers           to    ensure           people           got       to

the    correct         turnstile           the        volume       of    the     crowd waiting                 to       get     in was

such    by £ . 4 0       that       all    tickets           could       not    be     checked           and       some        p e op l e

w i t h t h & w r o n g t i c k e t s w e r & g e 11 i n g               i n t o t h e m o u t h o f t-h e w r o n g

turnstile         and        having       to    be     turned       back       from        there,,         This         was     causing

even    further          congestion              in    extracating             them        from     the       turnstiles

before       others          could    pass        through.

At    about      2 « 4 5 pm    I became          aware        of    people          sitting         and       standing              on    top

not    attempting             to    get    o ve r      it.     Although             I could         not       see       what        was

By 2.43pm            the      n u m b e r s of      people     waiting           to        get    t h r o u g h t u r n s t i l e s was

such    that it w a s          impractical             to     search       anyone.               People          were          sti l l

waiting       in q u e u e s        for    the        turnstiles           but      were         very     tightly            packed and

by 2 . 5 0 p m    the        numbers       of     people       in       the    enclosure            had       increased              to

such    numbers          that       the    queues        had        degenerated              to a        crush.

At    this       time      I became              afraid        that           if     1 stayed where                   I    was,        I was

panicking,            not       due       to     any      fear      of       injury           but       parti ck      because            they

seemed        to     be       plenty        of     room       for          f u r t h a r pe ople.             When         I got          onto       the

  In m y    opinion          the    main    cause       of    the       original            crush      outside        the    ground

 was     Liverpool           supporters          turning          up    at    the      ground         fo m 2 . 5 0    onwards

 and     not     allowing          themselves          sufficient             t im e      to    get    into    the     ground

  before        the      kick    off.      Also    many       people          were        turning        up at       the    ground

 who     ha d    obviously          been    drinking          especially               the      ones     who   turned        up

  late.         This       was   a 1 so   born    out    when          I began         to      treat     injured       p e o p 1 e on

  the    pitch,,           I was    obliged       to    get       much       closer         to t h e m      then and        noticed

  that     many       of    them    smelled       strongly             of    d ri n k .

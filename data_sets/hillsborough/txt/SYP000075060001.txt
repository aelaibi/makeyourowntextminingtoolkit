           I am a Police         Ins        currently Ns^rving at the Communications

           S c h o o 1, EcclesXie!        lining C e n t r e , South Yorkshire Police.

           At 0800 ho u r s ,_ SatfcN^day 150489, I commenced duty at Rawmarsh Police

           Station to perform duties with 'C ' Division contingent at the F.A. Cup

           semi-final at Hi 11 sbd'Kflugh, Sheffield.               Transportation was provided by

           the Force Coach and arrivsNi^at Hillsborough for 0930.    My duty at

           Hi 1Isborough wa« in charge of   rials 59 and 6 0 , Sector 3,

           Sub-Sector 24,         covering along Penrstone R d , towards Sheffield,            from

           Parkside Rd, to Burton St,          giving necessary supervision to Nottingham

           Forest supporters.          S u p t . CHAPMAN was the Officer        in charge of

           Sectioh\3 and I was directly responsible to Ch.                    Insp. PRICE,   the

           Officer    ih charge of Sectsjr 3 B .          Under my direct supervision I had

 After    full briefing at the Ground at 1CF>430 am < 1000) dv Ch. Supt
       f(od\J
 DUCKENFIELL7 I briefed my own men in the N Stand.     We then remained in

 the N Stand and consumed packed meals.                                                                                          By 1115 hours all my Officers

 were on point,,                                                                     in pairs, along our assigned route.                      I informed Ground

 Control of this fact and received an ackn owl edge m e n t . Myself and the
                                    COW/IA, C l        _
 two Sergeants had a personal radio and rece'prir&n was reasonable at

 this time.                                                         I patrolled my area,                                  on foot, mostly with one of the other

 of the Sergeants.                                                                                         My first   concern of the day was that within my area

 there were some 5 public houses open.                                                                                          The pubs were quickly filling

 up with supporters.                                                                                         One of these pubs, The Royal on Penistohe Rcl*         •

 quickly filled up inside and supporters started to gather on the

 footpath outside to consume their drinks.

 Initially this presented no problem and the supporters,                                                                                            predominantly

 from Nottingham, were good natured.                                                                                           I saw no real reason at this timy

 to stop                                                           drinking outside and decided jusvX^o monitor the

 s it'u^it^i o n .                                                  By about                                 1300 hours there were at least 1QQ persons

 outside this pub,                                                                                   nearly all of which were consuming alcohol.           It was

 outside his premises.                                                                                         He was stopped from doing this and instructed

 to move his vehicle, which he did.                                                                                          PS THOMPSON remained with some

Officers to monitor these premises.

 At this time Penistone Rd was very busy with fans.                                                                                           I noted some

Liverpool                                                fans on foot and in vehicles were approaching the ground

  from my area but there was no trouble at this stage.                                                                                          However,   many

 fans were making their way to the ground,                                                                                          carrying bottles and cans of

  beer,                             lager,                                etc., and my men were advised to instruct as many fans as

  possible to either drink or dispose of alcohol before reaching the

Around 1400 Inours I heard PS THOMPSON on my radio,            calling for

assistance at the Royal Pub as bottle(s)            had been thrown at his men by

fans driXking outside the premises.            At tXjs time I had just met up

with Ch.    Insp. PRICE and we both attended at the Royal.             Mobile units

had also attended at the Royal on our arrival, and there had been a

large fight inside the premises,          believed amongst Nottingham

supporters only.          The premises were cleared of all- customers, and the

landlord strongly advised to close for the afternoon.              This he did and

no complaints arose from this incident to my knowledge.                By this time

Penistone Rd was crowded with supporters and,             generally speaking,      most

were   in good humour and well behaved.           There were a few Liverpool

supporters still approaching the Ground with the Forest fans but                I saw

no trouble as a result of this.           It is true to say many fans had been

drinking, but, apart from the Royal           incident,   I saw nothing further
                    '\
that was solely drink\related.

Sometime prior to 1500 hoN^rs, at a g u e s s - ^ w o u l d say ten to three
                                       Cn         (2)
<1450),    I heard some cortversVtion on my r^dio when Officers were

requesting the start of the match to be delayed.              It seemed this

request was made as there was a large build-up of fans at Leppings Ln,

many of whom would not get into the Ground in time for the match

start.     I heard concerrNexpressed over this, and some mention of

 pushing and shoving^S^         Jusi^before   1500 hours I heard excited voices

of Police Officers on my radio, roguesting gates to be opened at the

Leppings Ln end. ^fxheard one voice say words to the effect               if the

gates were not opened,         ww   Police would lose it and a serious       incident

was probable.          The radio wasN^istorted,   with transmissions drowned by

background noises and screams,          but I did hear a request for all

Officers,     including those going for meal,        to get into the Ground as

quickly as possible.          Although radio reception was     poor,   it was quite
apparent to me from the tone of voices that could be heard that

something serious was happening.            With some of my Serials,       I cannot

remember who chs^ how many,         I quickly made my way to the Ground,

arriving about ^ . 1 0 ho u r s .              Wed    C A(   .

We went straight to\the pitch itself,           entering via the gap between the

N Stand and the Spion Hop.           On looking towards the Leppings Ln end,

where the Liverpool fans were,           I saw many persons and Police Officers

on the pitch.         The noise inside the Ground was tremendous,         almost

s^eaf e n i n g .   It was not po\si^ble to tell what had happened but I

assumed there had been a ’pitch invasion’.            It was not until an

excited Police Officer         ran towards me shouting words to the effect,

"There's a lot dead over there"           (indicating the area at Leppings Ln)

that I realised a really serious           incident had taken place in the W

Stand at Leppings Ln, and it was more than a public order incident.

With some other Officers         I made my way over to theNW Stand and saw

horrific scenes of injured persons lying on the pitch and persons
                        \      C m J? t
inside the stand being cruVtned against the wire perimeter f en cin g.

Many Officers were doing what they, could to get people out by

virtually dragging them over the fencing onto the pitch.                  There were

also many Officers milling around in a complete state of shock and

bewilderment,         particularly some younger Officers that I saw.          Many

•fans were running around in a near state of hysteria.             Some of them

were screaming out that the Police were at fault or that we were not

doing enough or just generally wanting to "Have a go* at us for

whatever       reason.    I myself found the whole scene difficult to take in

quickly and for several moments took time to take it all in.                  The

 crowd itself seemed angry.          The Liverpool supporters in the N Stand in

 particular were jeering at the Police,          especially those Officers who

were facing towards them from the perimeter track.               In turn,    the

Nottingham supporters were jeering at the Liverpool              crowd,    obviously
                                                                              PAGE      5

unaware of what had happened, and,         perhaps,   blaming Liverpool

supporters for stopping the game.          I found the atmosphere frightening

and suspected a serious      pitch invasion at any moment.        If this

happened I saw no way to stop it, and very little we could do to

prevent it as it was my opinion the Liverpool fans were not happy with

Officers facing them from the track and any pitch invasion would also

include an attack on Police Officers.          It did seem,    however, as more

of the crowd became aware of the serious nature of the incident,                 the

atmosphere\reIaxed s li g h t l y ^ -

I encouraged Officers to assist         in rescue operations as opposed to

standing on the track and facing the crowds, asking them to do what

they could, where they could and as quickly as they could.             I found

the best way to handle hysterical Liverpool           supporters who were not

with   injured relatives/frlends etc. was to encourage them to use their

energies   in the rescue operation,      not on the Police.     Generally

speaking many of them responded to this,         getting makeshift stretchers,

carrying the injured and such like.         Many of these supporters had been

drinking but those I encountered wee more emotionally affected rather

than adversely affected N^y alcohol.        However,    there was the odd fan or

two that was hell bent on pbshing,         prodding and being abusive to

Police Officers - and they had \ o be restrained accordingly.

I did assist with injur'ed and unconscious        (apparently dead)    persons

myself.    I helped with heart massage on some,         putting onto stretchers

with others or getting persons into ambulances and the like.                  I have

no details of persons I was involved in this way.             During all this      I

was frequently approached by Officers wanting to know what to do,

particularly those who had attended on 'operation support*.               I

deployed all Officers as previously described.

During my time inside the Ground I heard very little on my personal

radio,    indeed for some considerable time I was oblivious to it.               Such
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             SI 932

         was the noise and activity within the Ground it was difficult to read

         properly in any case.   I did hear the P .A. system on occasions,

         particularly the voice of the Liverpool Manager which did help calm

         things a little.

         I remained in the Ground until about 1630 hours,   certainly until afte

         the announcement over the P.A.   that the match had been abandoned and

         the crowd had started to disperse.    Shortly after this I met up with

         some of my men and assisted outside the Ground with dispersal of

         supporters and ambulances and at some stage at a disturbance at

         Hillsborough Park ^hich was quickly quelled by Police horses.       About

  _      1720 hours I left Hi lYsborough to go to Ecclesf ield for duties
 •                               \    /cc
         in connection witht he Casualty Enquiry Bureau.    I retired from duty

         at 2330 hours that night.

                       trave 1led to Sheffield by m o t o r w a y , Ml and M62 and arrived in

                  Sheffield,        town centre between t/n thjrtj^ (1030) and eleven o ’clock

                  ( 11Q0) .    We all arrived at thg/same time and parked up.                I can't

                  remember where we parked.               We found a pub nearby and all went in.           It
                                                                                   PAGE         2

was about opening time, about e l e ^ n o ’clock ani (1100).                We had a

drink in there.          I had one pint, some of the others may have had a

couple.     We also had a sandwich,             then we all   left that pub, I c a n ’t

remember the name of it, and returned to our cars.                   We then drove from

the town centre towards Hillsborough.                 We parked the cars in a side

street which was about fifteen minutes from the ground itself it was

probably about midday when we parked the cars.

We left the cars ar/d walked up to a pub not far away on the right.                        11

was a big pub self back off the road.                I think it was cal 1 ed The

Greyhound,        b u t / i ’m not too/sure .   We all went into the pub at some

time before ffwelve thirj^y (^£30).              We remained in that pub until about

twenty five^to three           M4jjj^) d u i^nig whi ch time we all had a few pints.

Peter MCDONNELL drank a few jnints of lager.                  There we re a lot of othe r

supporters        in the pub both^Liverpool and F o r e s t , it was a good

a t m o sphere.     It was at about twenty fiv^y^fcT three         (1435)   that we

started leaving that pub to go to the ground.                   We didn't ali    1eave

t ogether, we left in dribs and d r a b s .           I don't remember/who      I left

with,   but the last time that I remember seeing Pete rVMcDONNELL was in

that p u b .      I c an’t remember if he left before me or after m e .            I do

not remember seeing Peter MCDONNELL a/ter the pub.

The last that I saw Peter MCDONNELy he was fit and well.

It was not until the afternoon on Monday 17 April                  1989 (170489)      that I

became aware that Peter ha\t ej/red at Hillsborough up until then I knew

he was missing,         but thought he may have been in hospital somewhere.

I had known Peter MCDONNELL for about four years.                   I used to work with

                          at

It was through                  that I got to know Peter.         We were good friends

and used to drink together occasionally.

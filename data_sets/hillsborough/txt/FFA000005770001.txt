                    such claims.

                   In these circumstances, we have been instructed by the

                     s matter please could you send the papers to us without any
                     delay and we will take all necessary steps to protect the
                  procedural position.

                  We will, of course, keep you fully advised of developments in
                  connection with the claims.

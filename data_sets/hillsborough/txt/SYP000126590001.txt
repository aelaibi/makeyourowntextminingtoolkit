  I shouted at the fans in an attempt to get them to move back but all attempts were futile.
I sent o-'e of my colleages through the turnstiles in an attempt to get some assistance,
and shortly after this,fearing for my own safety, I too went into the ground through the
turnstiles.
  Whilst I was recovering, the metal gates on the left hand side of 'A1 Turnstiles was
opened to ease the pressure on the turnstiles. Prior to this the fans outside the gate had b(
been trying to break it down. A large number of fans v/ere let into the ground and then the
gates were shut*
   At this stage we were sent to the front of the Leppings Lane stand. I entered the
fenced enclosure behind the goals \fhere £ assisted other officers and fans to carry out
casualties and render first aid to them.
Chief Supt. Duckenfield.

Sir,
    May I use this report to make mention the involvement of a young Liverpool
supporter who was actively engaged in the evacuation of follow supporters from
the Leppins Lane end of the ground. At the time that it was first known that
fatalities had :arisen the mood of the crowd was clearly anti-police and officers
that were attempting to usher people from the area were experiencing difficulties
from the badly behaved element of the crowd. This was obviously identified by
this young man who had the presence of mind to take up a position well in advance
of a police line and shout encouragement towards other 'Sccusers' to clear the
 area and thereby assist those that required help. The man worked tirelessly
and appeared to have credibility where Police Officers were not afforded such.
His actions were pointed out to Supt. Marshall who agreed that the results of
the mans action were having the desired effect.
I remained working within the same area as this person for a period of about
one hour until the area was cleared. He was one of the last to leave. I thanked
the m an f o r his assistance, he was clearly shocked by the events of the day and
had difficulty bringing himself to speak.     The only detail as to his identity is
that he gave the name I           1 He was in his early twenties and about 5 ,J+" tall
with short dark hair. He spoke with a broad Liverpool accent.

At one stage in this operation he was joined by another man who assisted in a
similar manner. I have no details as to the identity of this man however he
was equally commendable in his actions.

I feel that there will be a suitable place in the enquiries that will follow this
disaster to record the actions of these men.

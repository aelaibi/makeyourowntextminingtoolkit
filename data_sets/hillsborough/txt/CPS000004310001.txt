  Dear Sir,

  I am sorry about not formally replying to your letter of
  the 20th of February at an earlier date.

  I am very much obliged to you and your colleagues for
  dealing with the matter so promptly.

  What we have done is to have a pre-inquest review and we
  propose to resume the Inquests on a limited basis starting
  on the 18th of April 1990.

  I note your kind offer for a meeting. I think that at the
  moment this may not be necessary, but I am sure that a point
  in time will come when it will be useful to have a face to
  face discussion.

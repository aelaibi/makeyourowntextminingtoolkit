            I am          a Police                Constable             in       the    South        Yorkshire          Police          and       have    served

            in          the       Barnsley             Division          since          1981.           During     my       service          on    the    force

            I have                had       reason          to   work        a    considerable              number          of   football             matches
                    \

            at          the       Sheffield             Wednesday                football          ground.

            On          Saturday             9th       April      1988           (090488)          as     part    of    a    Barnsley             contingent,

            supervised                      by    PS        1341    Crawford,                 I was       e m p l o y e d at      the       ground       for the

            Semi          Final             match       -    Liverpool             v.    Notts.           Forest.

            After             briefing              I took         up    my       post        at    the    bottom       of       the    stairway

            leading                    to   the     seating         area          at    the        Leppings       Lane       end.           At    this    time

            being             used          by    Liverpool             supporters.

            These             stairs             are    situated             near       to     the      tunnel      leading            to    the      central

                standing                pen.

                I was             to    assist         stewards          checking              tickets        for      those       fans          using    the

                seated             area       above         the    pens.

                Entry             by    the      fans       was    steady,              the    only       problem           found       was       tickets were

                being             used      twiceafter             being          thrown           from    the    seated          area            down    to t h e


                pens.

                A       system          was      adopted          whereby              when    tickets        were       produced            for

                examination                   the      corner       was          torn     off       preventing           re-use.             Even      with

                this          a    considerable                  number          of     supporters           were      attempting                to   gain

             entry       using        these        used       tickets              and    when        entry        to   the       seating       area    was

             refused        some       abuse        was        given.

             From       approximately               2.30pm           (1430)          the       area     outside          the       pens       contained

             a    large     number       of        people          and        at    the       stairs      there         was       an    occasional

             'rush*        but    sufficient                  stewards             were       on   duty       to    funnel         the    fans       into    a

             fairly        orderly       queue.

             Sometime           between        2.45           (1445)          and    2.50pm           (1450)        I   received          an    order       to

             close       the     gates        at    the        top       of    the       tunnel         leading         to    the       central       pen    and

             remain        at    these        gates           to    prevent          entry         by   any        further         fans       into    the    Cen
ral

             I    closed        the     right       hand           gate       and    remained            at    this       post         directing       fans

             to    the     wing       entrances.

             As    3pm     (1500)        approached                 this       caused           some     confusion            with       fans    wishing

             to     enter       the     pens       quickly           and       some           abuse     was    given         at    myself.

             A     short       time     after           the    kicv       off       further           officers          attended          at    my

             location           and     the    gates           were       again           opened        after       they      took       up    duty    in


             the        tunnel.

                 I do    not     know    who        gave       the       order           to    close     these          gates      or    why    the

                 order    was     given.            I was          not    in a           position        to    see       into      the    Central           pen

                 from    where        I was    working.                   I then          took     up    my    normal         duties          which    was

                 supervising           fans        in    the       seated          area        aver     the    Central            pen.

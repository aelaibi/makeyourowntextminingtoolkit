                 Right Honourable Lord Justice Taylor, The Football League
                 Limited carried out a survey of clubs with a view to obtaining
                 the likely cost and methodology of implementing Lord Justice
                 Taylor’s recommendations.


       B)        This survey took the form of a Questionnaire in two parts (Part
                 A and Part B) sent to all clubs in the four divisions posing
                 questions relevant to Lord Justice Taylor’s recommendations.

3.   DEFINITIONS      (Cont’d )


     D)        OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS : (Questionnaire Part B)


               1)    "What are you required to do to implement the other
                     Taylor recommendations (e.g. filling and monitoring
                     terraces, crush barriers, stewarding, police facilities,
                     communications, first aid, etc.) and what is the likely
                     cost?".


     E)    COSTS


               1)   Where a    clubhas given a range of costs for any
                     particular option, the higher figure has been included in
                     the schedules attached to this report.


               2)   Where a    club has made proposals but not provided any
                     costs, no cost has been included in the schedules
                    attached to this report.


     F)    SEATING


               1)   Becauseall clubs did        not return a questionnaire the
                    figures for seating would have been incomplete on this
                    basis.     To make up the deficit of information on seating,
                    figures have been extracted from the match data recording
                    of The Football League Limited so as to give a complete a
                    picture as possible of the number of additional seats
                    required.


     G)    LEAGUE PLACINGS


               1)   The club are    arranged in alphabetical order in Divisions
                    One, Two, Three and Four based on the 1990/91 club list

PART THREE    -   CONCLUSIONS


1.   NUMBER OF CLUBS :


             A)     DIVISION 1          20
             B)     DIVISION 2          24
             C)     DIVISION 3          24
             D)     DIVISION 4          24     (1   Club not included in survey)
             E)     TOTAL               92


2.   RESPONSE TO THE SURVEY


     A)      Out of 92 clubs in the four divisions, 91 (992) returned Part A and
             77 (842) returned Part B of the Questionnaire.     1 Club (Darlington)
             was not included in the survey.


             This should be considered a good response.


     B)      Of those clubs that responded, almost all indicated their awareness
             of the problems inherent in implementing the recommendations of the
             Taylor Report and are actively seeking solutions.


3.   TENURE OF GROUNDS :


     A)      Some two thirds of clubs own the freehold of their grounds leaving
             one third with leaseholds or other forms of tenure.


             This could well have an effect on the ability of clubs to improve
             facilities since in many cases there are restrictions of various
             kinds on development.


     B)      The period of the lease remaining is also relevant in this
             connection, since improvement work would have a five year time span
             in the case of the first and second divisions and a ten year time
             span in the case of the third and fourth divisions.


             Security of tenure would be an essential pre-requisite before
             embarking upon extensive improvements.


3A   T3MESCALE :


     A)      Surprisingly few clubs took a long term view.    In divisions one and
             two, of those clubs giving a timescale for Option One, 10 proposed to
             carry out the work in one year, 8 in two years, 6 in three years, .1
             in four years and 3 in five years.


                                       - 8 -
PART THREE   -   CONCLUSIONS (CONT’D)

3A   TIMESCALE (Cont’d)


             In divisions three and four, on the same basis, 11 proposed to carry
             out the work in one year, 7 in two years, 7 in three years, 1 in four
             years, 1 in five years, 1 in eight years and 2 in ten years.


     B)      Some clubs, particularly in the two lower divisions, have very little
             work to do in order to comply with the recommendations of The Taylor
             Report, and so could implement any necessary improvements in the
             short term, but overall and particularly taking into account the
             response on funding arrangements (See item 6 ), it may be that the
             full implications of carrying out this work have not been considered
             in sufficient depth by the clubs involved.


4.   CHOICES AND OPTIONS :


     A)      Of the 77 clubs providing information only   8 had sufficient
             facilities to comply with the recommendations of The Taylor Report,
             none of which are in the first division and only 1 club in the second
             division has adequate facilities.


     B)      The most popular solution suggested by the   clubs of all four
             divisions for all Options was to refurbish   existing stands or
             terraces.


             This probably is the most cost effective method of providing the
             requisite facilities.


             The second most popular solution was to provide additional stands.


     C)      However these methods are not open to all clubs because of the nature
             of their tenures and restrictions imposed on developments or because
             of the layout of their grounds, and a certain number of clubs have
             opted for relocation to a new stadium, which has added to the costs
             of each option.


             For a minority of clubs this may be the only way of implementing the
             recommendations of The Taylor Report in full.

PART THREE   -   CONCLUSIONS (CONT’D)

4A   COSTS s


     A)      From the responses of 77 clubs the total cost of satisfying Option
             One is £321m.   However two clubs propose to expend some £130m between
             them, therefore tending to distort the total somewhat.


             In order to arrive at an order of cost for Option One the following
             adjustment is made:-


             £321m less £130m divided by 67 (77 - 8 clubs with adequate facilities
             - 2) multiplied by 84 (92 - 8 clubs with adequate facilities).


             This equates to £239m to which must be added the cost of the other
             recommendations adjusted in the same manner which is £29m.   This
             gives a minimum order of cost for implementing the recommendations of
             The Taylor Report of £268m.


     B)      Since very few clubs provide costings which definitely make provision
             for inflation, it would be as well to regard this figure as a current
             value.


     C)      It would be possible to perform similar calculations in respect of
             the other Options but, since many clubs have made no proposals the
             exercise would be academic so perhaps it would be as well to leave
             these values as set out in Part Two, Item 4A, B) to D ) .


5.   SEATING :


     A)      The total shortfall in seating requirements is approximately 450,000
             which is equivalent to TEN new stadiums.


6.    FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS :


     A)      The clubs’ response to this question was disappointing in that
             although some clubs have made a positive response, most either have
             no idea how to finance the various Options or refer to Central
             Government or Football Trust Grants.


             Many clubs state that the implementation of the recommendations of
             The Taylor Report would be impossible without financial assistance.

PART THREE   -   CONCLUSIONS   (CONT’D)

7.   AVAILABILITY OF GRANTS :


     A)      The response to   this question speaks for itself.   It would have been
             more satisfying   if a larger number of clubs were actively seeking
             information.


8.   RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES :


     A)      This section is   self explanatory and requires little comment except
             perhaps to highlight the large number of clubs (49) which are engaged
             in discussions with Local Authorities regarding -re-location.


9.   FINAL COMMENT :


     A)      In general it can be   seen that, although the overall response to the
             survey has been good, analysis of the information contained in the
             Questionnaires indicates that whilst the majority of clubs are well
             aware of the problems, they appear not to have given realistic
             consideration to the questions in every case, particularly time
             scales and funding arrangements.

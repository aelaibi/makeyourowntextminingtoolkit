                  On Saturday                     April       19 8 9    I was        at    home         pra^r    to   the    football         match

                  which       I believe          to    be    between         Nottingham             Forest\and          Liverpool           played

                  at      Wednesday's           home    ground.

                  I noticed            that\pn        this    particular             Saturday            there     were     some       thirty      f ans

                  their       accents.           The    fans     waited        in a n          or de r ly manner,           talking         and

                  laughing            u n til   the    club    opened.

             I noticed      at     f ive        t h r e e Tshere w e r e     groups       of    between       seven     and

             eight    s t ill     corning     out   cN^, the   pub,    to    go    to,    I presume        the    football

             match.      I could       see     they    were    f o o t b a l 1 fans      by    thei r d r e s s   and    the

             fact    t h e y we re w e a r i n g    scarves.

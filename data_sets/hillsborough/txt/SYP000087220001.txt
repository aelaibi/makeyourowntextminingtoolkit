                       beginning            to      flow      on    to       the       pitch,        it w a s        then          that     the       pressure

                       eased.          I looked around                       for                  and     spotted             him       towards        the       bottom

                       right      of      the       pen.          I made          rny w a y       down     to       him,       people           passed me           on      the

                       way     going        back         up   the       pen,       who       were        obviously             breathless.                   Some      of

                       these      were         helped         up     into         the       stands.          I joined                           and    we      stood        for

                       some     twenty minutes                     and       than made              our    way       back          through           the     pen toward-:

                       the     tunnel.              This      would          have       been ab out             4    pm       <1600)        or       j ust    after,            a

                       Police        officer             came      into          the    pen a n d         said       t h at        we    all     might        just       as

                       well     go.



                       The     tunnel          was       pretty         c l ea r       of    p e op le ,     just         a    few mil lin g               around.

                                and       I then          made      our          way    back        to    the       car.           I d id       not    assist          anyone

             that    was     injured     purely          because       I was        ignorant       as    to wh at       to   do.        I

             feel    that     after     the     event       there      should        have      been more       awareness           on       th

             part    of    the    professional            bodies       and      t ha t   the     public      should      have      been

             informed       of    the   course       of     ev e n t s .



             I feel       t hat   the   overall          p r o b l e m wa s     the a m o u n t    of    people     building            up

             outside       the    ground.       No-one         seemed      to    take     it     upon    themselves          to

             organise       anyone      outside          and    there a p p e a r e d       to    be a      lack   of

             communication          between        them        outside        and    those       i nside.




             I would       like    to a d d     that      my    ticket        for   that       d a y wa s    retained        complete

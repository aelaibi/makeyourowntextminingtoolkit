              On    Saturday                  15th       April          1989        I was        on       duty      at    the    Hillsborough

              Football                Stadium            in       connection              with        the      FA    Cup       Semi-Final          football

              match          between               Liverpool                FC    and     Nottingham                Forest       FC.        I was       part    of

              serial             34       under      the          supervision               of       Police         Sergeant          Sherratt.

              At    10.00             am      all    Officers                attended            a    briefing            in    the    ground's          North

              stand.                 At    11.00         am       serials           number           34    and      35    were       briefed       by    the

              Commander/                   Inspector                  Townend.            Communication                   was    by    means       of    Personal

              Radios             which          were      in          the    possession               of      the Inspector            and     two

•            Sergeants                    only.

              At    11.15             am      we    took          up    our       position            on      Claywheels             Lane.     In       company

              with          PC       12 3 S     Hogd      weswere                r e s p o n s i b 1e      for      the    direction          of    coaches

              containing                   Liverpool                  supporter's           along          Claywheels            Lane.

              At    S.E5             pm w e        were       further             deployed            to      supervise          the    arrival          of

              supporters                   at      the    junction                of     Claywheels              Lane      and       Penistone          Road

             North.                  We    were      positioned                   near     to        ’T h e   Gate'        public       house.           We    were

              instructed                   to      form       a       filter        line     of       Officers.                The    large    volume          of

              supporters                   walking            to       the       ground      continued               for       some    40    minutes          with

             many           of       their         numbers             spilling           from        the      pavement          and    onto       the

              roadway.                    there      was          a    range        of   ages         amongst            the    supporters.              However

    (        the     largest                  proportion               were        those      under           30 years          of    age.         A minority
of    thes|Tsupporters                     were       consuming            alcohol             as    they       approached                 our
              \
linesi            They       were       instructed           to       deposit         the        alcohol          before

continuing.                  All       those     so       required         did       so,       although           a    proportion

remained           in       our    presence           to    consume            their          purchase.               In    some       cases

where        the       supporter           was       in    possession            of       a    quantity           of       canned

alcohol,           he       would       consume           each    can      or    distribute                it     amongst             other

supporters.                  I did       not     witness          any      supporter                refusing           to       deposit          his

purchase           of       alcohol.            The       supporters            were          generally           well          behaved.

At    2.55        pm w e      were       requested           to       attend         at       'The       Gate'        public          house

after        receiving             a    report        of    disorder            inside.              A    number           of    men       had

been     ejected              from       the     public          house         and    were          standing          outside.              They

showed        signs           of       being     involved             in a      struggle.                They    did        not r eq ui re

medical           treatment.               On    access          being         gained          to    the       lounge           bar,       it w a s

evident           from       the       damage        to    property            that       disorder             had     preceded             our

arrival.               It     was       quiet        on    our    departure.

On    returning               to       Penistone          Road,       a   further              c al l w a s     r e c e i v e d of

fighting           at       "The       G a t e ’ public          house.          Access             was    gained           and       although

there        was       no    disorder,           the       landlord            was    instructed                to     close          the    ba r.

■I l e f t    the       premises           at    3.10       pm    which         were          now    empty.            Once          again       our

serial        returned             to    Ngrth        Penistone            Road       resuming             original              duty.

I became           aware          that     transmissions                  received             on    the       supervisors                 radio

had    intensified,                    I was     unable          to    determine               the       content           of    these

transmissions.                     Police        Constable             106      Goss,          who       had    assisted              in    ’T h e

G a t e ’ public             house       was     ordered          to      return          to     his      own     serial             which       was

now    due        to    take       refreshment              at    the      Traffic             Garage,          Claywheels                 Lane.

He    therefore              left       our     company.

Minutes           later,          PC    Goss     returned.                He    informed             us    that        there          were       no

officers           at       the    Traffic           Garage,          they      had       all       be    directed              to    assist          at

the    football              ground.            At    this       time      we    were          unaware          of     any       incident             at

the    ground.               We    immediately              made       our      way       to     the      ground.               On    reaching

the      entente                 to    the       Spion          Kop,       we       were          instructed             by    Inspector

Townend            to          remain       outside.                 After          a    few       minutes          we    entered                the    ground

and      along          with          other          Officers          I was             instructed                to    set       up    a       cordon

across         the             access       to       the    Spion          Kop.              Our       responsibility                   was       to

restrict            access             to       the    stand          fay p e r s o n s            wanting          to    enter          or       re— e n t e r

the      Hop.

Minutes            later             the    serial          was       directed                to       the    field.           Access             was

gained         by        taking            the       walkway          between                the       North       stand       and       Spion          Kop.

A    number         of          ambulances             were          parked             along          this       walkway.              The       field       was

littered            with             people.           Initially                I saw             people          pulling          advertising

boards         from             the    South          stand.           Naturally,                      I assumed          disorder                had

erupted.                However,                this       was       instantaneously                         refuted          by    a    contingent

of      men    running                towards          me       with       a    body          lying          on    an    advertising

board.             I gave             assistance                in    carrying                the       body       to    the       gymnasi u m .

After         rendering                First          Aid,       I immediately                         returned          to    the       field?              My

path      continually                      impeded          by       the       flow          of    men       and    women          rushing

through            the          walkway          carrying             bodies             towards             the    gymnasium.                    My

attention               was          immediately                drawn          to       the       goal       posts       nearest             the       East

stand.             I saw             three       bodies          on    boards                lying          in a    row.           They          were

conveyed            directly                to _ t h e      gymnasium.                       I gave          what       First       Aid

assistance                     could       be    reasonably                applied                to    each       victim.              In m a n y

cases         it    was          blatantly             obvious,                they          were       unretrievable.                       I

continued                in      this       vein       for       approximately                         1 hour.

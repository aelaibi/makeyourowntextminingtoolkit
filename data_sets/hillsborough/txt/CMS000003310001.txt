Dear D r Martin,


RESPONSIBILITY FO R PUBLIC SAFETY A N D HYGIENE D U R IN G LARGE
GATHERING S OF PEOPLE


Miss Stew art has asked m e to reply to you?letter o f 13 Septem ber, in w hich y o u asked
for com m ents o n a letter from Jo h n A shton o f the Faculty o f Public H ealth M edicine
about the co-ordination o f em ergency services in a n u m b er o f settings.

I w o u ld offer the following:


SAFETY A T SPORTS G R O U N D S: D N H AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

Follow ing its creation in A pril 1992, responsibility for three pieces o f legislation governing
the safety o f spectators at sporting events was transferred from the H o m e Office to the
D ep artm en t o f N ational H eritage. These are th e Safety o f Sports G rounds A ct 1975;
T h e Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport A ct 1987; and those Sections o f the Football
Spectators A ct 1989 concerning the Football Licensing A uthority. A t the same tim e,
D N H also assumed responsibility for the G overnm ent’s 'G uide to Safety at Sports
G rounds'.


T he Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975

This A ct applies to all sports grounds w ith accom m odation for spectators. Safety controls
are im posed prim arily b y safety certificates issued b y local authorities for grounds
designated under th e A ct by the Secretary o f State. A ny sports ground w h ich has
accom m odation for over 10,000 spectators and at w hich football, rugby union, rugby
league o r cricket are played m ay require designation.


T he Fire Safety and Safety o f Places O f Sport A ct 1987

Part III o f the 1987 A ct b ro u g h t into effect a system o f safety certification and subsequent
inspection o f stands able to accom m odate under cover at least 500 spectators ('regulated
stands’) at sports grounds n o t designated under the Safety o f Sports G ro u n d A ct 1975.
As w ith the 1975 Act, the safety certificate is issued by th e local authority.


Safety Certification and Responsibility for Spectator Safety

T h e aim o f safety certification under b o th Acts is to ensure the reasonable safety o f
spectators at sports grounds used for sporting events. T h e safety certificate establishes the
m axim um n u m b er o f spectators that m ay be adm itted, and its term s and conditions are
determ ined b y the local authority, in conjunction w ith the police, fire and building
authorities. In doing so, the local authority is expected to com ply w ith the advice
contained in the D epartm ent's 'G uide to Safety at Sports G rounds’. T h e G uide has no
statutory force, b u t its recom m endations m ay be m ade statutory b y th eir inclusion in
safety certificates.

C h ap ter 2 o f th e G uide m akes it clear that th e responsibility for the safety o f spectators
lies at all tim es w ith the ground m anagem ent, ie those w h o stage the event a n d /o r
adm inister th e ground. T h e G uide recom m ends that each club appoints a safety officer
w hose sole duty is safety during an event. T h e G uide also highlights the need for the
preparation, in consultation w ith the police, fire and am bulance services o f contingency
plans, including arrangem ents for stopping or delaying an event, for:

        (a)'     various em ergency situations, including fire;

        (b)      possible crow d disturbance;

        (c)      coping w ith an exceptionally large num ber o f spectators arriving at the
                 ground;

        (d)      the failure o f any detection, w arning, lighting o r com m unications systems
                 o r o th er equipm ent.

A lthough the n u m b er and disposition o f police is at the discretion o f the C h ie f Police
O fficer in w hose area the ground is situated, th e G uide also stresses the im portance o f a
w ritten ’statem ent o f intent' betw een the police and ground m anagem ent, setting o u t the
tasks, duties and responsibilities o f each as to crow d safety. D ealing w ith disorder (as
distinct from norm al gro u n d operations and crow d m anagem ent on the premises) will,
as in any o th er circumstances, fell to the police.

This advice is also reflected in paragraphs 3.1 and 6.1 o f the Football Licensing A uthority's
G uidance o n Safety C ertification, w hich was issued in M ay 1992 to local authorities w ith
safety certification responsibilities for football grounds designated u n d er th e 1975 Act.


T he Football licen sin g Authority and the Football Spectators A ct 1989

T h e Football Licensing A uthority was created under the Football Spectators A ct 1989, and
th e A uthority has been given the task o f ensuring the im plem entation o f G overnm ent
policy concerning safety at football grounds. In particular by:-

        (a)      operating a licensing schem e for grounds at w hich designated football
                 matches are played;

        (b)      advising the G overnm ent o n the introduction o f all-seated accom m odation
                 at Football League grounds and the national stadia; and,

        (c)      keeping under review th e discharge by local authorities o f th eir functions
                 under th e Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975.
        (d)      ensuring that any terracing w hich is retained at 2nd and 3rd D ivision clubs
                 o f the Football League m eets the necessary safety standards.

U n d e r Section 13 o f the 1989 Act, the FLA is em pow ered to require a certifying
authority to include in any safety certificate such term s and conditions as th e FLA m ay
specify in w riting. T h e aim is to ensure consistency o f practice b etw een certificating
authorities.

T h e FLA does n o t have any pow ers relating to safety certificates issued under the Fire
Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport A ct 1987, n o r does its rem it extend to Scotland.


Trafalgar Square - N ew Year's Eve Celebrations

D N H is also responsible for pulbic safety in Trafalgar Square, and the D epartm ent is
currently review ing th e handling o f crow ds there w ith a view to ensuring b etter safety
measures there in the future.


N on-Sporting Events at Sports Grounds

Spectator safety at non-sporting events held at sports grounds is regulated by m eans o f the
H ealth and Safety at W o rk A ct 1974, and the Local G overnm ent (Miscellaneous
Provisions) A ct 1982 o r (in G reater London) the L ondon G overnm ent A ct 1963. I
understand that the 1974 A ct is the responsibility o f the H ealth and Safety Executive, and
that the H o m e Office deals w ith entertainm ent licensing law.


Lead Department for Accidents in Sports Grounds

In N o v e m b e r 1992, Miss Stew art agreed w ith B rigadier B udd o f the C abinet Office that,
notw ithstanding the transfer to D N H , it continued to m ake sense if the H o m e Office (or
appropriate territorial departm ent) to o k the lead in the event o f a disaster, since action
follow ing any accident w o u ld rest w ith the em ergency services w hich rem ain u n d er the
control o f th e H o m e Office. H ow ever, this departm ent w ould, o f course, b e kep t closely
involved.

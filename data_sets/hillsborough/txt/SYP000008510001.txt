                At    about            1430           hours,          when                         a nd                      iad    returned           from       a    walk

                I    left        the        first           aid       room          in    company              with                 and       walked        along       the

                back     of       the           North           Stand          and       down       onto        the      pitch.            When      we     had       reached

                the     corner              of        the       ground          by       the       North        Stand         and     the      Spion        Kop, I

                looked           back           down        the       ground             towards             the     Leppings            Ln    end     and       commented

                on    how        empty            that          end       of    the       ground             was     considering               the     game       was       due

                to    kick        off           at     1500          hours.              In    fact          I would          estimate           that       it    was       only

                half     full.

                After        a    few           minutes              we    returned                to     the      first       aid       room.         We    remained

                there        until              about           1455       hours,             when                       and       myself        left       the       room
                                                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                                                 S755

and    went          down          to    the       pitch       to     watch          the    teams         come        out.

W h i 1st       we       were       there           I think          Iheard          either           aP o l i c e    Officer,          a

Steward,             a    programme                 seller          or e v e n       o n e of     our        members            say     that they

were       contemplating                      putting          the      kick         off    time        back         but    I    can't

honestly             say       who       said       it.

Almost          as       soon       as    this       had       been        said,          both    teams           ran      on    to    the       pitch,

so    I assumed                that       they       were       going           to    start       at      the        normal       time       of       1300

hours.

Both                          and       myself       then       returned              to    the       first        aid      room,       by       this

time       it    had          just       turned          1500       hours.

After       sitting                in    the        first      aid room              for a       few         minutes,            I heard a

message          come          over       the       radio       to      the      effect          that        people         were       getting

crushed          down          here,          however,          I didn't              know       who      the        message          was    coming

from.           X did          ask       for       the    caller           to    repeat          the      message,              but    got       no

response.

It    was       at       this       point          I assumed            something               was     wrong         as    no    one       had

responded                to    my       call,       so               and        myself          said      we      would         try    and       find

out    what          was       happening.                 As    we     walked             out    of     the       first         aid    room

underneath                the       North          Stand,       I     could          see    groups           of    Police         Officers

running          towards                the    pitch.

At    this       point             we    both       started           running             towards         the        pitch,       but       were

motioned             to       by    a Police             dog    handler              to    stay       where        we      were.        At       this

time       we    still             did    not       know       what        was       wrong.

A    few    seconds                later       a    young       boy        came       towards           us     carrying           an    even

younger          boy          in    his       arms       and    said,           "Have       you       got      any      ventolin,            my

brother's                having          an    asthma          attack.”

I    told       him       we       weren't          allowed           to    carry          drugs        however            I would          do    what

I    could       and          to    bring          him    to    the        first          aid    room.

In    the       first          aid       room,       the       older        of       the    two       boys        told      me    that       people

were       being          crushed             and    that       people           were       being         killed.

It    was       at    this          point          that       a       young       man       of    about          eighteen                   years    of       age

was    brought             into          the       room       and          I could          see    that          his          right          arm    was

 rokeryln             two       places.                 We    sat          him    down       and       one       of       the       cadets,

                 suggested                putting             a       cold       compress          on       it,       however,                I didn't

 hink       a    cold       compress                   would          help       and    as       I knew          that          the          County

Ambulance             Service             w e re        on    hand          and       I knew       they          would             have       ENTONOX,

which       is       a mixture                of       gas    and          air,    and       a    pain          reliever                with       them,       I

requested             them          to    attend.                 This       they           did    and       put          a   s p l i n t onhis           arm.

He    was       then       sat       down          and       remained             in        the    office             for       about an            hour

waiting          for       transport                   to    take          him    to        hospital.

At    the       same       time          as    the          youth          with       the    broken             arm       was       in       the    room,          a

second          man       was       carried             in    on       a    carrying             chair.              He       had       a    suspected

broken          right       ankle.                 With       the          aid    of                \ my         colleague,                   we    lifted

this       man       onto       a    treatment                couch,              I    could       see          that          he    had       two

bandages             bound          around             his    knees          and       ankles          to       prevent             them          moving.

            then          left       the       room          with          the    chair          and    returned                   to       the    pitch       area

At    this       point          I moved                the    bandage             around          this          man's          ankles             very

slightly             in    order          to       inspect             his       injuries          and          saw       that          his       right

ankle       was       swollen             and          deformed             and       showed       the          signs          of       being       fractured

As    he    d i d n ’t a p p e a r             to       be    in       too       much       pain,           I    raised             his       ankle       off

the    couch          by    placing                a    blanket             under       his       calf          to    ease          any       future          pain

and    left          him    there             to       await          transport             to    hospital.

It    was       at    this          point          about          a    dozen          people       were          brought                into       the    First

Aid    Room          area       and       as       there          was       no    room       left       in       the          room          itself       we

lay    blankets             on       floor             outside.              We       lay    these          people             down,          we    checked

that       their          airways             were          clear          and    inspected             their             injuries                which

apart       from          bruising             appeared                to    be       only       that       of       having             difficulty             in

breathing,                which          is    consistent                   with       being       crushed.

By    this       time       we       were          being          approached                by    numerous                people             offering

help       as    they       were          from          the       medical             profession.

came       up    to    me    and          said       t h a t 't h e y       were         using          some        of    the        Police             transit

vans       to    ferry       the          people          who    were         not        seriously              injured              and          who        could

walk       to    hospital.

I then          returned             to    the       First       Aid        Room         and        together             with        someone                 who       I

can't       remember,                we    took       the       youth        with            the     broken          arm        and       a       young

girl       who       had    had       her       left       arm      strapped                 to     her    chest           to    where             the

Police          cars       were       parked          which        was       at       the         rear     of       the     gymnasium.

Upon       walking          back          to    the       First       Aid          Room,          I was        approached                 by       a    young

girl,       who       was    wearing                what    appeared                to       be     some       sort       of     uniform                and        I

think       she       was    a       member          of    the     Football               Club          Staff.            She        was          carrying

about       five       packs          of       paper       serviettes.                    She        told       me       that        a    doctor              had

requested             them.           As       I knew       we      had       doctors              assisting              us,        I took             them

from       her       and    said          I'd       try    and     find            out    who        wanted          them.

I then          asked       around             for    the       person             requesting              the       serviettes                    and        I

think       it       was    a Police                Offic                                          think        they        are          needed              in

the    gymnasium.                    1 then          went                                      ,ium a n d           again        asked             for

anyone          requesting                serviette                                               rs t h a t    Sergeant

                     said,       "I       think       they         re w a n t e d

                                                                                                                                                         j
middle          section          of       the       gymna                                                                                                i

I then          walked       up       to       that       section,            but        no       one     knew       anything                 about

them,       so       I decided             to       return       to        the      first          aid     ro o m .

Just       as    I was       leaving                the    gymnasium,                 I noticed                out       the     corner

of    my    eye       that       a    lot       of    bodies          had          been       lain        out       alongside                 one       of        the

partitions.                 I could             say       how    many         there           were,        but       there           was          lots        and

                                                                                                                                                     '.

they       all    had       their       faces       covered            and     I assumed                they       were       dead.

1    then       left    the       gymnasium             and    returned             to       the    first          aid     room         where         I

saw    a    young       man       of    about       20/22          years       of       age       sitting          in a       chair

crying.           I was       then          told    that       the       young          man       had    lost       his       friend and

that       he    thought          he    was       dead.        I then          went          and    sat       with       him       and

comforted             him.

About       five       minutes          later       a    Chaplain             who       I believe             is    the       Chaplain              for

the    Football             Club       came       into    the          room    and       because          I thought                he       could

help       the    young       man       better          than       I could,             I moved          away.

As    I was       becoming             very       upset,       I moved             out       of    the    First Aid             Room           and

had    a    drink.           By    this       time       the       majority             if    not       all    of       the     casualties

had    been       taken       to       hospital          and       I    could       see       the       majority           of      my

colleagues             were       assembling             at    the       First          Aid       Room.

A    short       time       later       we    were       informed             by                    as    to       the     amount            of

fatalities             there       were       which       by       this       time       was       eighty          four.           A    short

time       after       that       we    all       left    the          ground       and       made       our       way     home.

severity          of    some       of       the    injuries,             it    was       impossible                for     me      to       obtain

any    of       the    required             details,          however,             I believe             some       of     my      colleagues

did    obtain          some       details.

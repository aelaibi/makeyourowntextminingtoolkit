blue    denim jeans and a black                    ’p u m a 11 track      suit    t o p . I wore       a

Liverpoo l       scarf™       We drove        to Leek        via the      back    roads and on to B u x t o n

on the A 5 3 .        From B u xt on       1 n a v igated my father              on to the A6 and              from

there we turned             left    on to the B 6 0 4 9 and tr a v e l l e d north.                   We     later

c on n e c t e d with the A57 and drove                   on to S h e f f i e l d .     We   took a wrong

turning       but were able          to    connect with the A61Q1 w h i c h took                      us     into

Shef'field.          As we were       t r avelling         towards S h e f f i e l d we did           not     suffer

any traffic          delays    other       than     road works.           The    traffic was          constant

but was moving           into S h e f f i el d at a steady              rate.         I saw a few            cars

w ith Liverpool          scarves      d i s pl a y e d    in the w i n d o w and as we neared the

ground    I could see          cars       parkeisL both sides             of R i v e l i n Road.       As we

neared the fire s t a 1 1on at                the    junct i o n of R i v e l i n Roa d and            H olme Lane

left    the    car my Dad had a cup of                    coffee    and     something        to eat.          It was

about 2.00 Np\ri (1400)             by now and by the time we wa l k e d up to Holme

drinking       but    I did see about              ten or fift e e n Liverpool               supporters

walking       in the same d i re ct io n            singing a nd^^dNjiking from                 c a n s.     We

crossed       over    the    road so       that we woul db\t            be walking w ith t h e m .                 I

hor s e b a c k and one officer            on foot.         1hey were        standing at             the       gate

entrance       t q the West      stand.

The    gate was open a l t h o u g h        I cannot        recollect        whether          it was a single

gate    or double.        We a p p r o a c h e d    the officers          showed the foot                 officer

our    tickets and asked           for     directions        to our       stand.          I w ould        say that

I could      clearly see thatT^Ing^ a re^ b e t w e e n the                  open g a t e and the

Jturnstiles was         packed w i t h Liverpool             s u p p o r t e rs.       There was a little

bit of swaying and j o s tli ng              but no more           than you'd expect at a

football       match.     I could see          plenty b<f empty and                    crushed beer            cans

outside      the gate     in L e p pi ng s     lane    near where a hot dog stand was at

the    corner    of L e p pings     Lane.          There were       no other           uniform P o l i c e

o f f i c e r s visible    to me at        this time and           I. c a n ’t remember              seeing any

s te wards     there either.        We were          unable     to walk along                the    tarmac       patch

which    runs alo n g s i d e   the stad i u m        because of either a fence                          or a gate

and a Police        officer      told      us that     the a rea         had been fenced off.                     We

r eturned along L e p p i n g s Lane against                 the    flow of the              fans w a l k i n g       to

the    ground.      Because     of the sheer           volume       of football              supporters          we

were    sep a r a t e d for a couple         of minu t e s      but m y Dad wa i t e d for me

until    ixcaught       him up.       We    then turned         left out of Le|H'i ngs Lane

on to C a t ch \ Bar Lane and              then made        our way      on to the lMor$h P enis t o n e

Road.     At this       stage    I could see a few N o t t i n g h a m supporters,                             they

were walking        to the ground and were well                     behaved.            We    began       to    run so

that we      could get     to our        seats      in plenty of time.                  We    left       the    road

to enter       the s t a di um Sy ia a gate a d j acent             to the         road.       At    this       time       I

could see a couple           of u m f o r m        Police    officers        on f o o t and a number                   of

of the S outh S t a n d to the             turnstile m a r k e d number 22.                    There       was    not

                    prevent any s upporters                  continuing         round to the' rear             of West    stand.

                He       showed our          tickets       to a uni f o r m e d officer at             this     point and he

                ail lowed us free                passage      to the turnstile.                We    Handed our       tickets       to

                    told us where            our seats were.                It was aboi!\ J g .40 pm (1440).               We sat

                    down     in our seats w h i c h were                 located      right    next    to the Police           control

                We were            in row GQ        in seats 5 + 6.              I looked a r o u n d the          stad i u m and

                    could      clearly see that              pens three and four               in the West         s t a n d were

                    full     of Liverpool           fans.         There was a lot of space                   in the two    pens

                of       pen three          to get     into       pen two.       I w ou l d    think     they did this          for

                more         room.         Bot h teams       then       came   onto    the    pitch from the          players

           bottom and on to the              pitch.      My first         i m pression was             that no one          knew

           face    of the     person was a mottle             blue       colouring.             We    left    the    body

           was    lying    near to the         six yard a r e a .

           He was    lying     on his       back,    I think       he was wear i n g            jeans and a shirt

hold of him just above                 the elbows and shook                   him.         He a p p e a r e d to         come

out    of his daze and              I told him to           pull      himself        together.           He    calmed

down a little and said thank you.                             I w ould       describe         him as a white

male,      ag e d about 28,         5 ’9,     dark    short      hair w h i c h was straight,

moustache,          slim build,        wear i n g     blue      denim jeans and               light      coloured

short      sl eeved shirt.            He    had a scouse accent.                     I had a short             rest

for a mo ment            to regain my breath and                  1 helped         others who were                 in

shock.        I then w a l ke d       to a y outh who was               lying        down     in the        penalty

area.        His    face was        blue.      I could see an a m b u l a n c e               or St Johns               man

same      thing     happened.         I checked for a blockage                       in his m o u t h         but

could find none.               I belie ved        that his           lungs    had       collapsed        or were

punctured,          I c o u l d n ’t do a n y t h i n g     to help him.             I left him and                ran

to help others who were                    carrying       dead and        injured off             the    pitch

a nd    I lost       track of the         time and what             I was       doing.     My Dad then

came     to me on the            pitch and took me back                 to rny seat.          I broke       down

and was        ext r e m e l y upset,       xjy Dad then took me                  to the Police          box and

sat me down outside.                    I saw Ke>tjny D A L G L I S H       come out       of the Police

box.      He    came and shook my hand but                     I don *t remember what               he    said

to me.         I returned to my seat and after a short while                                  I heard an

a n n o u nc em en t    on the      tanoy to the         effect       that       the Police wanted

ev e ryone      to remain         in the stad i u m for             the time       being.      I was      then

t aken    into a h o s p it al it y suite at               the      rear    of the S o u t h s tand to

calm down and have a coffee.                        I did      leave       the    stacN>^im with my Dad

some     time       later.      We w al k e d across H i l l s b o r o u g h         park and as we did

so     I could see a red F o r d Sie r r a               driving        thro u g h the      park along a

footpath.            It was     trave l l i n g at      con s i d e r a b l e    speed and we       had to

move     behind a tree            to a v o i d being       hit.       I saw football           suppo r t e r s

chasing the            car and shouting            "Come      on,    i t ’ll get      stuck    in the

traffic        at    the    b o t t o m , w e ’ll get    it then".

We w a l k e d back         to our      car and once          there     I saw a man         leaning on

his     red    car.        On talking       to him he         informed us that              his    three

friends were miss i n g and                 that    they had got            separated       in the       crush

He     stood    in front         of the     goal    and danced          in front         of the

supporters waving               his L i v e rpool       scarf w h i c h was          tied to his

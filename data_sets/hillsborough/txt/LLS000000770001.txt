In the w e e k l e a d i n g u p to the m a t c h a t H i l l s b o r o u g h on S a t u r d a y 15th April

I a c q u i r e d a n u m b e r o f tickets,           i n c l u d i n g my own.     This w a s a terrace

t i c k e t for the L e p p i n g s L a n e end.



C o n s e q u e n t l y on 15th April          I l e f t 1 iverpool a t 11.30am.                I was in a car

d r i v e n by a friend,                                    I h a d n o choi ce in the route that was

taken by Mr                      in d r i v i n g u s to the match.              As I recall         it was the

route that took us o v e r the Pennines.                            It w a s a p r e t t y scenic route.

We d i d n ' t e n c o u n t e r m a n y d i f f i c u l t i e s   on route.       T h e r e w e r e the usual

 s t oppages b u t th ere w a s n o t h i n g that p a r t i c u l a r l y d e l a y e d us.



 C o n s e q u e n t l y we a r r i v e d in S h e f f i e l d a t about 1.30pm.



                  simply p a r k e d the vehicle.                  It woul.d h a v e b e e n about a 10 or 15
 Mr
 m i n u t e w a l k from the g r o u n d itself.



 W e t h e n m a d e our w a y       to the ground.                I was   in the company of my g i r l f r i e n d
                                                                                   We h a d o f course t r a v e l l e d
                       of

                            and a n o t h e r friend, M r                   b u t a f t e r p a r k i n g u p w e then
 with Mr

 w e n t our s e p a r a t e ways.



 We then w a l k e d the d i s t a n c e to H i l l s b o r o u g h ,        a r r i v i n g there at a p p r o x i m a t e l y

 2.10.       I was i m m e d i a t e l y struck by the n u m b e r             of p e o p l e w h o w e r e g a t h e r e d

 in the r e l a t i v e l y small          area of space ou tside the turnstiles.



 I c o u l d see that t h e r e w e r e . s o m e q u e u e s w h i c h w e r e o r g a n i s e d into the t u rnstiles

  I say organised,            w h a t I m e a n is t h a t they w e r e o r g a n i s e d in a fashion.                   There

 were m a n y p e o p l e m i l l i n g around and I i m m e d i a t e l y for med the op inion t h a t there

 was a total           lack of        organisation.

A b o u t 50 y a r d s away .from the t u rnsti les             there a p p e a r e d to be plenty of

P o l i c e O f f i c e r s in a t t e n d a n c e but once y o u got p a s t that p a r t i c u l a r p o i n t

then it s e e m e d to me          that it was every man for himself.                        T h e r e a f t e r there

d i d n ' t seem to be a d e q u a t e Police presence.                 There w e r e O f f i c e r s o n h o r s e b a c k

a n d they did appea r to b e trying to o r g a n i s e the d i f f i c u l t s i t u a t i o n that

w a s .o bviously occurring.



T h e r e did seem,        however,     to be a total         lack of c o - o r d i n a t i o n and o r g a n i s a t i o n

at the turnstiles              themselves.



By now the crowd w a s b u i l d i n g up so m u c h so t h a t at the e ntrance to each

t u rnstile there w o u l d be about 4 i n d i vidual s                 each t r y i n g to w o r k themselves

into a p o s i t i o n w h e r e b y   they could g o into the t u r n s t i l e next.



I have to say            that t h e r e were queue jumpers.                 This h a p p e n s all the time and

no m a t t e r w h a t g a m e y o u   attend.          H o w e v e r this c o u l d p o s s i b l y h a v e b e e n

There was a P o l i c e O f f i c e r on the t u r n s t i l e t h a t we w e r e a c t u a l l y q u e u i n g into

b u t he was a b o u t 10 y a r d s away from where he was r e a l l y needed.



At 2 . 4 5 p m    it b e c a m e e x t r e m e l y c r o w d e d outside.      T h e r e was a lot of p u s h i n g and

 A t that p a r t i c u l a r time none o f us k n e w that there had b e e n fatalities.

 H o w e v e r h a v i n g regard       to the e x p e r i e n c e w e simply h a d n o a p p e t i t e to w a t c h

 the football          match.         At    that p a r t i c u l a r time we h a d no idea that the game w a s

 to be a b a n d o n e d or i n d e e d had been abandoned.



We t h e n     left S h e f f i e l d in the v e h i c l e a n d arrived b a c k             in Liverpool          at

 a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5.30pm.



 It w a s w h i l s t w e w e r e o n the m o t o r w a y t h a t w e           listened to the r a d i o and w e

 learnt for the f i r s t time that t h e r e h a d b e e n                     fatalities.         A t t h a t t i m e they

w e r e t a l k i n g a b o u t 30 deaths.



As s o o n     as I h e a r d a b o u t f a t a l i t i e s   I was o bviously c o n c e r n e d          a b o u t the w e l f a r e

of my 4        sons w h o I k n e w h a d g o n e to the ground.



U p o n r e a c h i n g L i verp ool       I i m m e d i a t e l y w e n t to   the h o m e o f m y e l d e s t d a u g h t e r

to e n q u i r e as to w h e t h e r or not she had h e a r d                   about m y sons.           S h e w a s in a

state o f p a n i c       .      She h a d n ' t h e a r d anything.



My ex w i f e also r e s i d e s a c r o s s the r o a d from my d a u g h t e r and s h e was c o m i n g

over constantly               to     e s t a b l i s h w h e t h e r o r n o t w e had h e a r d anything.              The

say    that m y ex wife,             who    is quite h i g h l y strung,           had s u f f e r e d a m i l d h e a r t

a t t a c k and had b e e n r u s h e d        to h o s p i t a l .



We w e r e c o n s t a n t l y     t r y i n g the e m e r g e n c y n u m b e r that was g i v e n o u t but it was

e n g a g e d continually.            Eventually we           then w e n t to F a r n s w o r t h S t r e e t POlice.

S t a t i o n to e s t a b l i s h w h e t h e r or n o t they could be of any a s s i s t a n c e to us

in f i n d i n g o u t w h e t h e r o r n o t m y 4 sons w e r e OK.
 We t h e n went.         I h a v e to say that the P o l i c e at F a r n s w o r t h S t r e e t w e r e

 e x c e l l e n t in that they w e r e m o s t helpful             n o t only to m y s e l f b u t to m a n y

 o t h e r p e o p l e w h o had g o n e to the S t a t i o n f o r the s a m e p u r p o s e as m y s e l f



 T h e y m a n a g e d to c o n t a c t the S h e f f i e l d P o l i c e direct.        E v e n t u a l l y I w a s told

 to g o away for h a l f an hour,               to c a r r y on t r y i n g the e m e r g e n c y n u m b e r s and

 that they w o u l d d o their best to f i n d o u t a b o u t my sons in the meantime.



 H a l f an h o u r later I r e t u r n e d and I was told by                  the o f f i c e r s to g o a w a y and

 try and find out w h a t items of c l o t h i n g my 4 sons h a d b e e n wearing.                              T h e y also

 g a v e m e a t elephone n u m b e r for me to t elephone o n c e I had a c q u i r e d t h a t
 information.



 S u b s e q u e n t l y at a b o u t 6.50pin I then l e a r n t that my 4 sons w e r e all right.

 I d i s c o v e r e d that one son I                1 h a d b e e n taken to hospital             b u t b e c a u s e of

 the r e l a t i v e l y m i n o r n a t u r e o f his i n j u r i e s he chose n o t t o see the

medical p r a c t i t i o n e r w h o s e skills w e r e n e e d e d m o r e b a d l y elsewhere.



T h e r e a f t e r T u e s d a y 1 8 t h April I was     still     s u f f e r i n g f r o m the s t r e s s a n d s hock

of the     i n c i d e n t and   I honestly         f e l t a t times t h a t I w a s g o i n g to have a h e a r t

a t t a c k for m y h e a r t    rate would increa se w i t h o u t w a r n i n g and I w o u l d have,                    what

I c o u l d only c o n s i d e r to be, p a l p i t ations.



Consequently I went              to hospital        to s e e k some k i n d of g u i d a n c e o n this p a r t i c u l a r

point.       It w a s a g e n u i n e worry        o f mine.       I was then g i v e n the r e l e v a n t tests

ie an E C G w h i c h f o r t u n a t e l y e s t a b l i s h e d that I h a d n o p a r t i c u l a r c o n d i t i o n

of the heart.           The d o c t o r did a s k m e       if I had e x p e r i e n c e d any u n d u e s t r e s s

r e c e n t l y and o f c o u r s e I e x plaine d to h i m a b o u t the p r e v i o u s Saturday.                 He then

a d v i s e d me to take it as easy as p o s s i b l e and that if I w a s still s u f f e r i n g

from stress        t h e n I shou ld make u s e o f the v a r i o u s c o u n s e l l i n g a g e n c i e s that

had b e e n set up to a s s i s t people s u c h as m y s e l f w h o h a d suffer ed from t h e trauma
of this     tragedy.
  I have not s e e n m y GP since.                   I   do   c o n s i d e r h o w e v e r that I have n o t g e t over

  my experience.                I h a v e an o b v i o u s a v e r s i o n at this m o m e n t in time to

  crowds.        I consider         that it will          be a long time b e f o r e I v e n t u r e into a
  football      g r o u n d a g a i n a n d that is if I ever do.



  I steer c l e a r o f crowds.                I s m o k e far more hea vily             than I ever d i d a n d I

 appear to be c o n s i d e r a b l y m o r e anxious that I was.                        I am also w o r r i e d

 constantly about             the e f f e c t the trag edy had on m y y o u n g e s t son 1                       |who

 has a c t u a l l y s i g n e d as a n a p p r e n t i c e p r o f e s s i o n a l    with

 F o o t b a l l Club.



 This d i s a s t e r has had a d e v a s t a t i n g effect on h i m a n d I am g e n u i n e l y c o ncerned
 for his f u t u r e w e l l b e i n g .



 This i n c i d e n t is s o m e t h i n g     that I will n e v e r forget.                A t the h e i g h t of the

 p r o b l e m s o n t h a t t e r r a c i n g I r e m e m b e r that there w e r e p e o p l e f a l l i n g to the

 n o t h i n g t h a t myself,      my g i r l f r i e n d or a p parently a n y b o d y else could h a v e done
 about it.



The day a f t e r t h e d i s a s t e r I w e n t to the C a t h e d r a l             in L iver pool f o r the

and after a w h i l e          it b e g a n to g e t a bid crowde d and my i n s t i n c t i v e r e a c t i o n

orderly t h a n a n y t h a t I h a v e e v e r s e e n in my life.



R e t u r n i n g to the e v e n t s o f the 15th April I did n o t see any acts o f h o o l i g a n i s m

o b viously w h e n t h a t h a p p e n s then there is a general                       lack o f c o n s i d e r a t i o n for

the n e x t person.           Q u i t e frankly,         however, w e should n o t h a v e b e e n p u t into

a situation         like t h a t w h e r e     there       w a s a t h r e a t to life.



I p e r s o n a l l y c o n s i d e r t h a t the c a u s e o f the tr agedy             was a lack of

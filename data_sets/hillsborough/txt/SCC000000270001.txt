Dear Sir,

Re:       Safety of Sports Grounds Act

I am in receipt of your letter dated 5th September 1989.
                                           x

In respect of the points raised please find enclosed a copy of our matchday
tickets for the current season. The wording on the tickets for visiting
supporters was printed at the request of the police.

In addition I am able to confirm that the additional medical practitioner is
trained and competent in advanced First Aid.

The stewarding plan has been completed but at present it is still in draft form
as the Police and ourselves have been making minor amendments at each of our two
home matches. Once the plan has been finalised I will have it typed and forward
a copy.

With regard to your letter dated     17thAugust 1989, containingOfficers comments,
I will deal with the points that were raised in order:

Pg 1 1(a)(i)          Work completed.
Pg 1 1(a))ii)          In hand, we are awaiting however for therelevant Fire Officer,

            Re: Safety of Sports Ground

            Further to your letter dato 6 September, I set out below our replies
            to the points therein:-                          f

            a)    I confirm that our medical practitioner is competent in advanced
                  first aid.
            b)    I confirm that thB necessary turnstile servicing has been completed.

            c)    Hie stewards who will be operating the bolt croppers have been

                  a half day course to incorporate firB extinguisher and cutting
                  equipment use which will serve as a useful refresher course.

            Yours faithfully.

    Dear Sirs,

                                    Re: Safety at Sports Grounds - Owlerton Stadium


         We hereby acknowledge your letter of 5th September that arrived this morning.
    We would like to make the point that if Mr. Bownes had not kindly faxed a copy of
    the letter* through to us yesterday that it would have been impossible to give you a
    reply by the deadline set (7th September, 1989, i.e. tonight).

          b)       We have been in touch with Chief Inspector Beal who advises us that policing
                  is not^required for greyhound racing, stock car racing and speedway.
                  Policing however is required for Rugby matches and they will only provide
                  such policing if the Stadium is issued with a Safety Certificate.

Genetd! Manager:   J. S. CARTER



                                                                             -   2    -


Mrs. Woodhead.                                                                                                                       7th September, 1989-


        c)    A random sample of the barriers and perimeter walls on the back straight
               terrace have been load tested. Stress tests indicate that the barriers
               and walls will safely withstand Category ’B* loading. The general condition
               of the barrier is good.

                   The-opening between the perimeter wall and rows of barriers satisfies       (
                   the requirement of the Green Guide in respect of the slope of the terrace.
                   However, the spacing of the individual barriers, along the rows does
                   not strictly comply with the suggested arrangement shown in Figure 3 of the
                   Green Guide. We would therefore expect the capacity of that particular
                   area of terrace to be reduced accordingly.

        d)    We have checked the turnstiles which are in use three nights a week and we
               can average ten people per minute per turnstile. On this calculation with
               ten turnstiles operating at the main entrance we would easily accommodate
               the imposed limit within the Statutory Hour. For sports other than Rugby
               League we can accommodate expected crowds within thirty minutes.

                   The turnstiles themselves are awaiting mechanical checks by Mayer Turnstiles.

        e)    The Interim Report requires us to have 1 first aid member per 1,000 of crowd
               and we usually have at least double this for stock car racing.

        f ) Our medical practitioner for motor sports is:~

                   He is located in the Private Box with the Duty Safety Officer throughout
                   the evening where he can observe the racing and where he can reach the      f
                   First Aid Room. He is contactable by telephone and the Duty Officer's radio.

                   As far as the 156 greyhound racing days are concerned we have been unable
                   to. obtain the services of a Doctor as yet as racing clashes with surgery
                   hours. We are arranging with Para Medical Organisations that a member of
                   their staff is present at the First Aid Room at every meeting and would
                   ask the General Purposes Panel to consider our request that this measure
                   would suffice for the time being.

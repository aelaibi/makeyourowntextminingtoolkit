                        Hillsborough, 15th April 1989
                                   Dr John Ashton



I am a medical        practitioner      and senior    lecturer   in Community    (Public)
Health at the University of Liverpool.               On Saturday 15th April I went to
the FA Cup semi-final match at Sheffield with ___________________________
This year we travelled by way of the M62 and Ml because for the same event
last year we had travelled on the direct route through the peak district
and there had been very bad build-ups of traffic on the way home.                 We left
Liverpool at about 10.15 am and arrived in Sheffield at about 12.15 - 12.30
pm.    We had a meal at a pub some distance from the ground and afterwards
walked perhaps 2 miles to the match.          While we were at the pub a coach-load
of Liverpool supporters came in.          They were boisterous but well behaved and
there was good humour between them and the local people who were eating in
the dining area.


We arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at around 2.30 - 2.35 pm


It was immediately apparent that it was going to be difficult to get in.
We    had   four   tickets   together    for row 2 of      the West   Stand,    above   the
Leppings Lane terrace.         I had been particularly relieved to obtain seats
this year because at last year's game in the semi-final we were in the
terrace itself (in the right hand corner behind the goal) and it had been
terribly crowded and unpleasant.


On Saturday we found that outside the ground there were a large number of
supporters trying to get in to a small number of turnstiles and that there
was very little police presence.             I saw no stewards outside the ground.
There appeared to have been no attempt to marshal the supporters into lines
in advance of our approaching the turnstile areas.


We managed to get nearer          to the turnstiles but the crush was becoming
unpleasant.        I heard a police officer telling the supporters that it was
their own fault for coming late.
I decided that I did not want to go on because it was so unpleasant,
said   it would      only      get worse       and that he was         going in.
              insisted on going in with                     and they stayed where they were as

I withdrew to the wrought-iron fence.


After a few minutes I thought I would try again.                      I could not see
and assumed that they had managed to get through the turnstiles.                            When I
approached again it was now much worse and again I withdrew.                           I was aware
of an officer trying to close one of the wrought iron gates, but he had no
chance on       his own.       I noticed that there was now a police landrover in the
lane just       outside the gates and my instincts and experience of 30 years as
a Liverpool supporter told me that things were going badly wrong.                            I went
to the police landrover and obtained the attention of one of the officers.
I said to him,          "you've got to get a grip of this situation, it is out of
control,        there     is     going    to   be a    tragedy."        He    seemed   bemused    and
unresponsive.           People were closing in around the landrover and I withdrew
to the other side of the road to see if it would ease off and I could try
again.        The time now must have been 2.45 - 2.50.


After a few minutes I suddenly realised that everybody had gone in and I
was able to walk up to the turnstiles and gain admission without difficulty
after tendering my ticket.


Once inside the turnstile it was at first unclear where I should go.                             There
were     no    stewards     in    sight   and    the       section   labelling was     confusing.    I
realised where the entrance was to the West Stand and went to get in after
buying a programme.              At this stage I had no idea that things had actually
now deteriorated to the extent that they had done.                           It must have been just
 after 3.00 pm.


When I went to the gate into the West Stand there were a few other people
 in the process of getting in and two policemen were checking their tickets.
 I then became aware of a man crying and beseeching the police.                           "There are
 kids dying in there," he said, "you've got to do something."                          He seemed to
 have come out of the terraced area.                       The police were unresponsive to him.
 They checked my ticket and let me in.

                                                       2
Once inside the stand area I turned up the stairs, now W°r^ie
                               were alright.  As I got to the top of the

ftlL      it was difficult to make progress because there were so many people
i„ the .isle.      It the top of the stairs I could begin to see why.            M.*r
people were being pulled up out of the terrace and into t e

stand.

 able to     do thiswithout difficulty.   Itmust have been about row        0^     When
 I got some way      along it I looked down       to see if I could se. the b o y .

 to them over the seats.

                          -ii         t-hpre were a large number of people on
 When I reached them I could see that there were       s
 the pitch,     people trying to get out of the terrace on to the pltc              an
 people were continuing to come up in to the stand.          There seemed to be few
  St    Johns Ambulance people attending the people who were lying around
  pitch and I could see people lying on the pitch unattended.             There was a
  large line of police officers across the pitch at the centre circle,
  tannoy told the supporters who were on the pitch to get off it.


                   ,   where we were so I made my way back some rows with
  The pressure was bad where

                 ,  ..... it Seemed incredible. Thetime must  have been
  happening on the pitch, it seemea

   about 3.15 pm.

   The overwhelming impression was of a large and growing number of casu*,lties
   and not much response.      The supporters were now impatient and angry at             he
   slowness of the response     tothe emergencies.     There appeared to be only o
   or    two stietchers on the pitch and one ambulance was      making its way a r o u ^

   from the far corner.       The supporters were chanting fot “ S1‘“ “ e
   brought to the injured who were lying on the pitch.            The next t        g
       that many of the supporters who were on the pitch began to tear down the

advertising boards and organise themselves into stretcher parties.          This
all happened very quickly.


I heard the   tannoy appeal for doctors         to help.   I could see that the
situation was really bad and could count six people who appeared to be dead
near the goal mouth.     I made sure that                          were safe with
      and that I knew where they were and made my way out down the back of
the Leppings Lane Stand.


On the stairs a policeman was attending somebody who was injured.             The
injuries did not appear to be critical so I asked the policeman where I
should report to help.     He did not know.       I went back into the stand and
brought            out and down the stairs to place them somewhere safe and
in sight.   I then tried to find somebody in charge to tell me who to report
to.   I asked several officers, but none of them knew.          There were people
lying everywhere in the yard area between the Stand and the turnstiles.         I
asked the officer who was in charge and he indicated a senior officer.          I
approached this officer and told him that I was a doctor and asked him who
was in charge of emergencies and where I should report.        He said he did not
know and that he had just arrived.    By this stage I realised that there was
no organised response and I was angry.      I asked the officer for his number
but he did not appear to have one.      I asked for his name.      He said he was
Inspector Grace.    I left him and went to see what I could do.


All around were people either dead or unconscious, or seriously hurt.         The
supporters were fantastic.     They were all helping each other and trying to
resuscitate people.      Individual police officers were also doing what they
 could.   At no time did I see anybody attack a police officer, nor did I see
 anybody who was drunk.


 I came to the conclusion that somebody needed to take an overview of the
 situation and began to go round all the casualties to appraise them.        There
 did not seem to be any St. Johns Ambulance workers around at all.        I became
 aware that some casualties were being taken out into Leppings Lane itself
 and I went out there.     There was one ambulance.        The time must have been

 about 3.30 - 3.35 pm.

                                        4
The police were beginning to put people into the ambulance and I realised
that a system of prioritising by triage was needed.                          So I did this.      I went
around     and       either    checked    people    myself      or    asked   the    person who    was
attending them.            There were two or three other health workers in evidence
who     were    assessing,       resuscitating      and    doing      what    they    could.      There
appeared to be no medical or emergency equipment.


The dead were taken to one side and I allocated the                              othercasualties to
category one or category two.                I told the police who should be despatched
by ambulance next and who could wait.                    The officers were mostly very good.
They took my instructions                and acted on them immediately.                  By this time
there was a steady flow of ambulances.                    It must have been 3.45 or 3.50.             I
became aware of a local general practitioner who had arrived at the scene.
Over    the next half           an hour we worked together as a team,                     sorting the
casualties and despatching them in the ambulances.                        An anaesthetist arrived
from somewhere and fire-engines came with resuscitation equipment, but all
of this was really too late.                 By 4.25 pm it was all over.                  The serious
casualties had gone to hospital and what remained were people with minor
injuries,       shock and distress and a line of dead people.                        I went to check
that my family was alright and when I came back a police officer asked me
to certify the deaths.             A general practitioner had already started this at
one end of the row of bodies.                I started at the other.                I think the time
was 4.27 or 4.29 and I think I certified five or six                             dead.    Only one of
whom could be identified from documents on his body.


During this whole period the public were fantastic,                           although shocked and
angry.         On one occasion       at the end a group of young men came past the
dead,    and one of           them expressed his         anger at police who were              standing
there.     I told him to "cool it", that it was not helpful and he stopped.                           I
saw no     other       episodes    like    this    at   all,    although there was          a general
atmosphere of anger at what had been happening.                          I remember thinking how
restrained everybody was.


It must have been about 4.30 - 4.35.                      There did not seem to be anything
else     for    me    to   do behind Leppings           Lane.        I checked    that
                                                  and then made my way              to the gymnasium

                                                    5
around tt\£ side of the ground to see if I could be of any help there.                      I
had become aware that other casualties had been taken to the gymnasium.


At first I had difficulty finding it as                nobody could give medirections.
When I arrived there I went in and found               that it was all over.      At one end
there were tables (I think three) which must have been used for processing
details of the injured.           There were now no casualties in this area.           At the
near end of the gym were rows of bodies.               On myway past I noticed         a large
display of photographs            and    information   on the    wall   of the gym showing
Liverpool supporters who were thought to be pickpockets, etc.


I left the gym and returned round to the Leppings Lane end to check
                       They were alright.       I thought that I should go back to the
gym   to   see    if    there would be       a debriefing    of people    involved     in the
emergency    response,       so    all   four   of us went   round.      This   time   it was
difficult to get near the gym because there was a large cordon of police
around it.       I spoke to an officer and he let us through when he knew I was
a doctor and I left                                      safely behind them and went to
the gym.         This time it was very difficult to get in.                There wastight
control on       the door.    I explained why I wanted to go in and was allowed to
enter.


I asked about a debriefing but nobody could help.                       Those who had been
helping were being cleared out of the gym.                   Just then a senior officer
 called all      the    officers    together at one end of the hall             for a police
briefing.        I don't know what it was about.         I left.


 On our way back to Leppings Lane we encountered a police officer who was in
 great distress and being comforted by another.                 I put my arm around him to
 comfort him as well.         He was sobbing uncontrollably and saying that now the
 police would get the blame.              Another officer was angry and told me that he
 felt that they had been let down by the senior officers.                       He said that
 nobody had taken charge and that when senior officers had come they had
 been of little use and just got in the way.




                                                  6
We left fche ground and returned to the car to drive home.               We must have
left the ground by about 5 o'clock.


I would like to say that I have been following Liverpool Football Club for
over 30 years and that I am familiar with the normal range of behaviour of
club supporters.       Before the match on Saturday the crowd mood was buoyant
and generally good humoured.          I feel that since the Heysel disaster an
attitude of mind has been cultivated which regards all football supporters
as members     of a sub-human species to be contained.            As a result crowd
safety has     taken second place.      On Saturday I believe that this belief
about     football    supporters   contributed   to   the   apparently   slow    initial
response by the police to what was happening.           It seemed that they mistook
the tragedy for crowd trouble.


It   is   difficult    to   know how many   lives might have been        saved   if the
emergency    response had been more effective,         but   in my opinion on this
occasion it was woefully inadequate.

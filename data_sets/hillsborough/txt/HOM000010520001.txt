HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY



A copy of the daily transcripts for the Inquiry will be available
2 days later in room 661. It will not be possible for individual
copies to be made due to their size (approximately 160 pages per
day).

The Inquiry office in Sheffield Town Hall has now been set up, Mr
Whalley will be in Sheffield for the whole of the Inquiry and can
either be contacted through me on extension 3602 or at Sheffield
Town Hall on Sheffield (0742) 736906 or 736907.

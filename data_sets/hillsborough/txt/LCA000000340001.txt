      Lord C hief Justice Taylor                               ~~~

      The W o r k i n g Party c o n s i d e r e d the I n t e r i m Report of the
      inquiry into the H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium D i s a s t e r compi l e d
      by L o r d Justice Taylor, in the light of in.i.ormation
      c o n t a i n e d wi t h i n the Re p o r t of L o r d Ouscice
      Taylor and the verbal reports given by b o t h the City
      Building Surveyor and the H i l l s b o r o u g h W o r k i n g Party
      Re s e a r c h Officer.

      R e s o l v e d that -

       (a) The Liverpool Cit y Council H i l l s b o r o u g h W o r k i n g Party
           we l c o m e s the Inte r i m Report of the Inquiry into the
           Hi l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m D i s a s t e r and its clear statement
           that no blame for the trag e d y can be a t t a c h e d to the
           supporters of L i v e r p o o l F.C.;

       (b) this Work i n g Party recog n i s e s the i mportance of the
           re c o m m e ndations c o n t a i n e d in chap t e r 24 of the
           Inte r i m Report w h i c h are d e s c r i b e d as the         minimum
           necessary' to ensure that e x i s t i n g football grounds
           can be safely used.             In o rder to ensure that the
           supporters of E v e r t o n and L i v e r p o o l can feel confident
           that G o o dison and A n f i e l d remain and will continue to be
           safe for spectators, a Special M e e t i n g of this Working
           Party will be h eld on Friday, 11th August, 1989 at
           10.00 a.m. to rece i v e reports from a p p r o p r i a t e Chief
           Officers c o n c e r n i n g the i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of L o r d Chief
           Justice Taylor's 43 specific r e commendations;

        (c) this Work i n g P a r t y believes that the I n t e r i m Report^
            highlights a series of appalling errors by the South
            Y o rkshire Police, S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football Club,
            S he f f i e l d City Counc il and the F o o t b a l l Association-.
            This justifies the immediate d i s m i s s a l of Chief
            S u p erintendent D u c k e n f i e l d and the r e s i g n a t i o n of Chief
      Constable of South Yorkshire, the Chief E x e cutive of the
      Football As s o c i a t i o n and those at She f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y
      F.C. and Sheffield City Council r e s p o nsible for the
      safety certificate for the H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium;



(d)   this Work i n g Party also calls upon the C h a i r m a n of the
      South Yorkshire Police A u t h o r i t y to resign his position.
      We believe his actions in seeking to d e f e n d a Chief
      C o n stable who was u l t i m a t e l y r e s p o n s i b l e for the
      i nadequate policing that led to the deaths of the 95
      supporters and who was u l t i m a t e l y r e s p o n s i b l e for the
      p r e s e n t a t i o n of the h e a v i l y c r i t i c i s e d evidence from
      police officers to the L o r d Just i c e Taylor Inquiry,
      are shameful;

(e)   this W o r k i n g Party also b e l i e v e s that the E x e cutive
      Com m i t t e e of the F o o tball A s s o c i a t i o n bears a heavy
      re s p o n s i b i l i t y for forc i n g t h r o u g h the use of an
      inadequate stadium.              Time and a gain L i v e r p o o l supporters
      protested, well in advance of the day of the tragedy,
      about the inadequacy of the g r o u n d and the u nfairness
      of the match being p l a y e d there.                  The E x ecutive
      Com m i t t e e of the F o o t b a l l A s s o c i a t i o n sh o u l d therefore
      also face up to their r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s and res i g n as
      well;

(f)   this W o r k i n g Party also r e c o g n i s e s the n e e d to remove
      all fences at football g r o u n d s in the interests of
      spectator safety.             We also r e c o g n i s e that the i n t r o d u c t i o n
      of Identity Cards for f o o tball s u p p o r t e r s will not
      i ncrease spectator safety - on the contrary, it will
      cause massive safety p r o b l e m s o u t s i d e football stadiums.
      In a d d i t i o n to the re p o r t on ID cards, the H i l l s b o r o u g h
      W o r k i n g Party r e s e a r c h o f f i c e r be requested, as a
      m atter of urgency, to submit a r e p o r t on the q u e stion
      of fences at football grounds;

(g)   this W o r k i n g Party also notes that the relevant
      r e c o m m e n d a t i o n c o n t a i n e d in L o r d J u s t i c e Pop p l e w e l l ' s
      R eport c o v e r i n g p o l i c e p r o c e d u r e s , p e r i m e t e r fence
      gates and stewarding a r r a n g e m e n t s w e r e absent at
      Hillsborough; and

(h)   this W o r k i n g Party b e l i e v e s the issues of spectator
      safety will never be r e s o l v e d u n l e s s safety
      reco m m e n d a t i o n s are b a c k e d w i t h legal r e q u i r e m e n t s
      and the football c lubs and a u t h o r i t i e s have effective
      supporter representation.

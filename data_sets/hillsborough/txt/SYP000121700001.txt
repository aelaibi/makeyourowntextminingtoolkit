                I was    on duty at the           1988 Semi     Final     betw e e n Liverpool          and N o t t i n g h a m

               Forest-        Bef o r e    the kick off       I was    conducting        searches       of supporters

                and e x a mining         tick e t s at the L e p pi ng s Lane                                      before

                entry to the ground,              .During     this    period     I made the        first arrest           to

                be made     that       day of a sup porter who was             very drunk.

                After    d o c u m e n t a t i o n and doing a report         I then had my meal             in the

                gy m n a s i u m and     then went    to the    rear     of the L e p pings Lane           stand.         I

                can recall       that      the   tunnels were        filled, for some          ten feet or so back

                from the terrace wit h s p ectators and four                      or five Po l i c e       officers at

                the/fear      of the       spectators.        I 'then went       outside       the L e p p i n g s Lane

                end of the g r o un d and a wa i t e d the end of the match.

                I can also       recall       being   called from the          g y m nasium to a report of

                trouble at the N o t t i n g h a m Forest            end of the ground           but this was           not

                true and no trouble was               seen.

                I have    no k no wl e d g e     of any o ve rc ro wd in g     in pens 3 or 4 or of the

                tunnels     gates        being   closed or blocked off            by Police        or stewards.

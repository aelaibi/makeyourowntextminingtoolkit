    Dear Mr Taylor

    Enclosed please find the copy of a letter dated 23 May 1990 from Messrs Davies
    Arnold and Cooper Solicitors, acting for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
    concerning removal of the remaining barriers and safety fence to the Leppings
    Lane terrace before the start of the 1990 football season.

    I have already replied acknowledging receipt of the letter indicating that
    before I respond I would wish to consult you concerning any objections you may
    wish to raise.  In this connection will you please let me have your views in
    writing before mid July 1990.

     From my point of view, I can see no valid reason for objecting to the

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Disaster
Further to my letter of tlie 17th May, I have been infonned by
the Club that it is their intention to remove the remaining
barriers and safety fence to the Leppings Lane terrace
immediately before the start of the forthcoming season.

The Club have already agreed to the removal of a further
barrier from the ground for testing in^ accordance with the
aareeaent reached between the experts in the litigation at
t h e ! r^meeting on the 5th April. It is anticipated by the end
of July/beginning of August, that these experts will^ have
completed their enquiries for the purposes of preparing a
report, and therefore from that point of view, there is no
need for the Leppings Lane terrace to remain in its present
state as the parties to the litigation will not be prejudiced
by such works being undertaken.     I have informed the parties'
Solicitors of the Club's intentions in this regard, and have
said quite clearly that the whole matter should be reviewed
once again at the end of July when we have a much clearer
picture of any potential problems that may be caused by these
intended works.
 However, I am of course extremely conscious of any continuing
  •rt+-Q-r-ii>®+- v n n r investigation team may have in the terrace

 Coroner and the Crown Frosecution         I would ask you to
 confirm whether there is any objection to these works bei^g
                      . . ,                tion needs to be
                                            stage I would be

    interest in the terrace.


                                                                                                         Contd..
2/
                                      23rd May 1990

I look forward to hearing from you.

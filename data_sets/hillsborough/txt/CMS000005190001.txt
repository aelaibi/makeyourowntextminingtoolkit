Thank you for your letter of 19 March on behalf of the
Bristol Rugby Union Football Club about the implications
of the Final Report by Lord Justice Taylor for the
Memorial Ground.
I am sorry to hear that the Bristol Rugby Club has experienced
difficulties and that our efforts to help were unsuccessful.
The Memorial Ground is a ground designated under the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) as requiring a safety
certificate issued by the local authority (in this case
Avon County Council). The figure of eight point five thousand
is probably the capacity authorised by that certificate as the
maximum number of spectators who can be accommodated safely at
the ground. The purpose of the safety certificate is to
ensure that, whatever the nominal capacity of the ground, the
authorised number of spectators reflects its actual condition.
This is intended to give flexibility in that it provides the
option for the club to limit expenditure or incur additional
cost in order to increase the authorised number up to the
maximum potential of the ground.

The Final Report by Lord Justice Taylor does not change the
position. The Report makes the point that crowd problems are
directly related to the nature of the event and the numbers
attending it. Lord Justice Taylor also made it clear that the
emphasis of his report was on football (ie soccer) with its
special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour. We
drew this to the attention of local authorities responsible
for the issue of safety certificates and the police last
February.  I enclose a copy of our circular for ease. Should
the club feel that the requirements set down in the safety
certificate are unreasonable they have a right, under the
1975 Act, to appeal to the courts.


                                                     /There is no




The Rt Hon William Waldegrave MP
There is no suggestion in the Final Report that the sale of
alcohol should be banned at rugby grounds. Chapter 6 of the
Report and Lord Justice Taylor's comments on the relaxation of
alcohol sales relate to the provisions of the Sporting Events
(Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 which applies only to
association football.

On all seated accommodation, the schedule which accompanied my
statement on 29 January (copy attached) explained that we do
not have the statutory means to make such requirements on
sports other than association football and that we would wish
to discuss the recommendation with representative sporting
organisations concerned. This remains the position and I
quite take your point about there not being the saaie anxiety •
about violence at the Memorial Ground as there is at some
soccer grounds.

There is no conflict between requirements under Building
Regulations and the advice contained in the Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds (the Green Guide). Our guide is a voluntary
code which specifically states that it is without prejudice to
the operation of the building regulations and that it is
intended to be used in order to achieve reasonable safety at
existing sports grounds.  It is not a design brief for new
work where the scope to build in a high level of spectator
safety may be greater than it is in existing buildings.

The advice in the Green Guide on stairways is consistent with
that in the Approved Document which accompanies and gives
practical advice on how to meet the statutory requirements
under the building regulations. I understand the problem
at Bristol arose over the steepness and length of the gangways
between seat rows which, under building regulations, are
considered to be stairways. This is a matter for
Chris Patten's department and I understand that
Colin Moynihan, to whom I am copying this letter, is writing
to you direct to say that a solution has been found locally.

I am arranging for copies to be sent   to the Chief   Executives
of Avon County Council, Bristol City   Council (who   are the
building authority) and to the Chief   Constable of   Avon and
Somerset Police so that they are all   aware of the   position and
of your concern.

                 A stand such as that built by Bristol Football Club is, in our

                 16 risers in a flight.               However, there is no o b li g a t i o n to adopt

                 I u nd er s t a n d that the Football Club and the local a u t h o r i t y have

Thank you for your letter of 19 March enclosing a copy of the one

you sent to David Waddington about Bristol Football Club.



The points you make about the implications for the club;                      of Lord

Justice Taylor's recommendations,              largely concerned with safety

matters,     are, of course, matters for David to consider.                    I have

asked to see a copy of his reply to you.



So far as your second point is concerned this Department does of

course have       an interest in the administration of                  the Building

Regulations.



A stand such as that built by Bristol Football Club is,                       in our

view,    a   'building'     so    far    as   the    building      regulations     are

concerned     and   needs   to    comply      with   the   requirements       of   the

regulations.         This   means,       amongst     other    things,      that    the

stairways and ramps in the stand have to be such as to afford

safe    passage     for   the    users   of    the   stand.        These   statutory

building     regulations    requirements       are accompanied          by guidance,

approved by the Secretary of State, which gives practical advice

on how they should be met.           The guidance suggests that a stairway

serving an area used for assembly purposes should be limited to

16 risers in a flight.           However, there is no obligation to adopt

any particular solution in the guidance if the requirement can be

met in some other way.
I understand that the Football Club and the local authority have

now agreed a solution which entails providing 2 extra stairways

(with a maximum of 16 riser flights) at either end of the stand,

making 8 stairways in the stand in all.           These 2 extra stairways

will   relieve   the   pressure   on   the   6   main   stairways   and   the

building control officer      in Bristol     is now satisfied that        the

design and layout of the stairways will provide safe passage.



I understand that only the structural requirements remain to be

considered and no particular difficulties are foreseen there.               I

hope that his will enable the club to get on with the rebuilding

of the stand as soon as the season is over.



I am sending a copy of this letter to David Waddington.

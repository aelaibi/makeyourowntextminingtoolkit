     No I didn't witness any disorder?                  I saw the crush but

 WHAT WAS YOUR POSITION AT THE GROUND?



     Initially I sat near to the players tunnel,.                  It was rny

     intention to photograph Brian Clough on the terracing.

     Just at kick-off             time I went to      the Leppings Lane end

     of the crowd to set up a remote                  controlled camera on the

     Advert Boarding,             I was   setting     that camera up at one or

     two minutes           past   three, I had left my camera bag        level

     with the penalty area at the front of the South Stand

     towards the West Stand.
        S8.    WHAT TIME DID YOU TAKE UP THAT P O S I T I O N ?



                        I entered the crowd at 1.30 pm (1330),           I collected my

                        Bib,   etc, and set up at 1.40 pm (1340).         I took up my

                        position at the mouth of the players tunnel at about

                        2.40 pm (1440)

                        I could see from the tunnel        that the centre pens behind the

                        Leppings Lane pens were full*    The side pens seemed
                    *                           ■■■          ■            -   ..
                        comparatively empty.  There d i d n ’t appear to be any problem

                        to me.       I walked over to that area solely to set up a remote

                        control      camera on the advertising hoardings.

                   I have not covered many football matches this season but

                   from my experience     I would say that Liverpool   fans   ’enjoy

                   themselves’..    By this I mean they get drunk.     1 can compare

                   English fans with continental     fans and say that English fans

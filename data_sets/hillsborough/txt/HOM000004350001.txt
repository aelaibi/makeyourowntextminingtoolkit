           HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE REPORT: POLICING FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM
           GOVERNMENT RESPONSE AND CHARGES FOR POLICING IN FOOTBALL GROUNDS

           The Home Secretary and Lord Ferrers have seen your submissions of 25 April
           about the Government response to the Home Affairs Committee and 26 April about
           charges for policing.

           2     They are content with the policy proposals in both submissions and with
           the draft circular and draft response, subject to two minor amendments

               (i)      The deletion of the words "and thus to the burdens of taxpayers
                        and community charge payers" from paragraph 5 of the draft
                        circular.

              (ii)      Moving the final paragraph of the draft Government response to
                        the end of the section dealing with recommendation 51.

           3     The Home Secretary is content for Lord Ferrers now to write to the
           Minister for Sport about charging and about the Government response as
           proposed.   (Mr Narev for action please.) He would then like the arranged PQ
           on charging and publication of the Government response to take place on the
           same day. He would simultaneously write to Mr Howell and Mr Pendry about both
           subjects, which would meet his undertaking to respond to the concerns
           expressed at the meeting shortly before Easter. He would also need to write
           to the Football League at the same time. The Home Office circular on charging
           could then be issued at a convenient point thereafter.

           4     I would be grateful if you could arrange for revised draft letters to
           be submitted after we have the agreement of the Minister for Sport.

             Ground,        during w h i c h time           I did not see an y form of disorder,                          fighting

             or d r u n k e n n e s s .     I remember          s eeingyXhe       odd     person          in the street wit h a

             tin of beer.

             We a r r i v e d at the turn st il es               in L ep pi ng s Lrt at about                twenty five        past

■5 o . f L   two    (1425 h r s ) .        U po n arrival         at the       turnstiles,            there were       no queue;

  u \ i—     as    such,      it was      just an u no r ga n is e d          crowd of         people,       stre tc hi ng    from

             the turnstiles              to the outer gate.                  It was     very      packed outside          the

             turnstiles.            I w ou ld         not describe        it as a crush at                 that time,     but    it

             was well         on the way to             being a crush.

             I got     to a turnstile and                 produced my ticket.                    The man on the

             turns ti le s        said    I was at the           stand t ur ns ti le s a nd                  go to the terrace

             turnstiles,           whi ch were          the ones       to the
                                                                                                      /

             Ln.     I made my way               round to these           t ur ns ti le s yand joined the              back of

             the    crowd there.             It was t o ta ll y u n o r g an i se d and               I had to       push my way

             into    the      crowd.       W h i 1st     in the       c r o w d , I/was       being       crushed due     to the

             amount      of      people.         We    got sjflit up i/r the            crush outside            these

             t urnstiles and             I was with                                              We   picked out our

             turnstile           to try and get           in on the          right hand side               of the    tu rns ti le s

          but    such was         the    crush,     we got     carried over to the               left hand side and

          e v e n t u a l l y got to a t urnstile             the r e .    By this t ime^is't'was abo ut twentj

 U   I—
          any    stewards         at all    outsi de The          touristi 1 e s .     We had a lot of

          d i f f i c u l t y getting      into     the Ground        because        of the amount            of    people

          crushing        into the t u rn st il es and the                total      disorg an is at io n.           Myself

          and               e v e nt u al l y got    through a turnstile,                handed our tickets                   in

          and    retained the stubs.                I have     since      r et urned rny ticket           to A n f i e l d and

          o b t a i n e d a r e f u n d . 1 did not see any gates                 open other          than the

          turnstiles,          nor did      I see any gates            being opened.             I did not           see any

          sort       of u na ut ho r is e d e ntr y     into the Ground.               Once     inside        the G r o u nd        it

          was my       i n tention to w at ch the m atch from Pen 7, a l on gs id e                            the N Stand.

          The    reason for this            was,     I a tt en d ed the      same      semi-final         m a t ch     last
1968
- 5 |     year and there was               no wa y     I was going         to go      into the        central        pens

          be hi n d the goal            because     I e x pe ri en ce d    crjar€hing in those            pens        last year.

          I knew from e xp er ie nc e at              the m at ch ^Kast yea r            that    I could get             round

          into Pen 7 by w a lk i ng              round the t^dfck of the              stand.     There w e r e n ’t any

          s i g ns    indicating         that    th ou gh    i/f fact the onl y signs              that       I saw was            the

          ’s t a n d i n g ’ sign over          the \ce/pf<tral    tunnel    an d signs         for the W StaruL

          seats.       H ad I not k no wn how to get to P e n seven,                         I w ou ld have          gone

          straight        for the tunnel,            because       there was         nothing     to    indicate

          otherwise.         Myself and                     found the other           lads    inside      the gr ou nd and

          we all       went a ro un d the         back of the W S t a n d an d            into Pen seven.                We got

          in there at about               q u ar te r to three.        We took        up a position v i r t u a l l y               in

          the    centre of Pen seven,                on a line wit h the other                  pens     behind        the

          goal.       It was      fairly    packed      in Pen seven at that                 time,     s ho ul de r      to

          shoulder,         but    not    uncomfo rt ab le .       F ro m the     time    that      I e n te r ed the

          ground,        I did not        see any disorder            or fighting.           1 did not         see any

          people       drinking         alcohol     inside the ground.               As soon as        I took, up my

            posit io n       in Pen Seven,              I remember        looking across             the other       pens and          i

            could see that            there was an obvious                    crush     in the two          central    pens

           behind the goal.               This         was    obvious     to me as       I could see          people     climbing

           over     the     dividing        fence        i nb etween pens four a n d five,                   getting     out      of

           .four and         into five and              in a state of distress.                    Things were very very-

            packed      in there and              I could see          numerous        people       still    entering       the

            pens    from the tunnel.                   It seined at this             time that       the two       central       pens

           were     still      filling        up,       whilst    the others w e r e n ’t.            I remember       the two

           teams      taking      the field.             This w ou ld have            been about       seven minutes             to

           three.       1' w a s n ’t really taking muc h notice                        of events          on the    pitch,       more

           of what was          h appening             in the    central        pens.    As     I remember,         Bruce

           G R O B A L A A R , the L i v e r p o o 1 g oalkeeper              h a d n ’t reached the goal,             when       I

           l ooked across            to J lfh e    two       central     pens again.          As    I did so there was a
cat
T^/VKVS    f or w a r d s   surge /i n both             pens.    It was       like a ripple           g r ad ua ll y going all
  ON
           the way thrcmgh the                    crowd from back             to front.         It a p p e a r e d to be     caused
P iT c n

           by the\+reer amount                    of    people    that were           entering       the    pens    from the

           rear.     Onl y a matter               of seconds          a f ^ e r this    surge       I saw a number          of

err         p e o p l e , about      fift ee n to twei^Ey, f a ll to the                      ground.       The y just

           s u d de n ly fell and were                  trying    to grab at           people       in front       of them,       but

           to no avail.           TKgse       peojne were             s it ua te d    in P en t h r e e , about       fift ee n
*£#3
           yards      back     from the           front       fence.    Fro m where        I was      standing       I w o u l d say

            they were         fairly      central            in the    pen.     I saw the          people    fall,    but    I    did

            not    see any of them get                   up after        because       as soon as they fell,                the

            crowd     behind just           closed up.           All     this    h ap pe n ed      in a matter       of seconds.

            I w ou ld estimate            the      time       to have     been about          five    to three w he n        I saw

            these     people      fall.       Im me di at el y after            this    I remember          saying    to the

            lads,     "A barrier must                  have    broken there,"           I could see there were                   still

           a number of          people        e nt ering        the    pens from the tunnel                 and    could still

            see the         ripple     going       forwards       thro ug h the         crowd.       By now I could

            see    people climbing                over       the fence at        the    front of the          pen onto       the

                  It was at that          time    that    I saw the first               gaps appearing.             B y this       time

                  there were a lot of             people on the               pitch,    perhaps about             two    thousand.          I

                  about    twenty m i nutes        to arrive.          I jt    should have got           there      sooner.

         \J       On a general        note      I blame the Football A s s o c i a t i o n for                    incorrect

                  also    feel    that    the    choice of ground was wrong,                      Old T r a f f o r d w o u l d have

                  been much more          suitable.

                  I personally think             the system of fans               being      penned      in is totally

                  wrong.      I believe      in segregating            the fans,          but   not having          to     put a set

            Overall      I felt     the     policing           q /c the day was     tota ll y   ineffective

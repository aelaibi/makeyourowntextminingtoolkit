MR BADEN

PQ FROM CHARLES GOODSON-WICKES ABOUT EFFECT OF TAYLOR ON LONDON
FIRST DIVISION CLUBS

1. Mr Akins has seen the PQ and amended the answer.
Parliamentary would like us to clear this ASAP.

2.   The original read.

I have had no discussions specifically about the effect of the
Taylor Report on first division clubs in London

3.   The amended reply reads:

I am aware of the concerns of a number    of firstdivision clubs
about the implementation of the Taylor Report, but Ihave had no
specific consultations with London clubs.

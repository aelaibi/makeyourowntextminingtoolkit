About       £.15   p.m.       I wen t     to   the    per i m e t e r    track       in f ront           of the S p i o n

H o p with Police             Constable        3 0 8 2 Fle t c h e r .        At    that        time     I estimate          that

the S p i o n Ko p was           about     two th i r d s        full,    but       looking         to    the    opposite

end    of    the    ground       the re were         far      fewer L i v e r p o o l       supporters.               The    two

clubs       pens    on the       Leppings        Lan e     terr a c e a p p e a r e d       to    be a b o u t       two

thirds       full,       there    seemed       to be few s u p p o r t e r s              in the       outer     pens an d

a few       supporters          well    dotted around             the West St a n d .               I was       so

surprised          by the       lack    of L i v e r p o o l     suppo r t e r s      that       I made        specific

~Hn f e r e n r e to     it to P o l i c e     Constable          Fletcher and              noted        the    time as

being       between E.15          to 2.520 p.m.



We    then walked          to    the P r o p e r t y S t o r e      under      the S p i o n K o p w h i c h was

manned       by P o l i c e     Constable        3063 Marshall            an d Mrs.             D r a bble,     Civilian

Administrator.                It was      very    busy under            the S p i o n Kop,             Nottingham

Forest       fans wer e         still     arriving         in    large     numbers.              The m o o d of        those

fans    wa s      good    natured which           I judged          from their             routine        enquiries

about       the    location       of    toilets,         refreshments              an d    entrances           to tne

terraces          and    their    general        behaviour.



After       c h e cking    mat      all    was    in o rder         at the         p r o p e r t y stare,        I walked

wit n Police            Constable       Fletcher         towards        the    second           property        store       at

the    Leppings          Lane    turnstiles.             We w a l k e d a l o n g         the    lower      passageway

beneath        the N o r t n S t a n d w h i c h was            allocated          to L i v e r p o o l     fans.

Moving       towards       the L e p p i n g s    Lan e       turnstiles           it became           quite     busy w i t h

supporters          entering        the    ground        to     gain access           to the N o r t h Stand.

At     the e nd of the           p a s s a g e w a y we passed S e r g e a n t        7 5 8 M o r g a n who was en

route      to the g y m n a s i u m w i t h            an off duty P o l i c e       O f f i c e r w ho had had

his w a l l e t       s tolen.     At      t hi s   stage I saw n o t h i n g        abnormal        or u n to w a r d

in the b e h a v i o u r         of the         crowd.

Th e    property         s tore was            situated     inside t u r n s t i l e s     1 - 1 6    and on the

g r o u n d side       of the m e t a l           fence which s e p a r a t e d      supporters            using the

North Stand            from      those         going    to the West S t a n d        and    terraces.            There

wa s    a f ur t h e r m o b i l e        cabin      for programme s e l l e r s          alongside         the Police

property           store.      This       s to re    was manned by P ol i c e          Sergeant        1153 Booth

and     Police        Constable           3253      Campbell.       Whilst     walking        to this location,

when     p as si n g u n d e r        the e n d      of the North Stand,             I had w a r n e d Police

Constable             Fletcher        that      on the occasion of the               semi-final            the

using        the      stand.     At    that       time the ground was             dry.

At     the p r o p e r t y     store m a t t e r s        were quiet w ith           little     p r o p e r t y seized

from      fans.         After      d i s c u s s i n g meal a r r a n g em e n t s    with Sergeant              Booth

and Po l i c e C o n s t a b l e          C a m p b e l l we left the s tore           intending           to re t u r n

to     the     gymnasium.             However,         immediately on l e a v i n g         I was      approached

by     a g at e m a n w h o      was m a n n i n g Gate A.          This gate         is n o r m a l l y    used to

a l l o w Police O f f i c e r s           a n d other autho r i s e d p e o p l e         to enter         the ground

without          using     the     t u r n s ti le .    The gateman was           in an a g i t a t e d state.

He     tol d me        that    because           the crowd outside          the      gate was        so heavy he

was     unable         to o pen the             gate to allow a u t h o r i s e d      access        and

a c c o r d i n g l y he     l oc k e d     the     gate.   I assured hi m he had               taken       the

c or r e c t     course      of a ct i o n ,        but during the c o u r s e         of our disc u s s i o n

fans      s ta r t e d to a p p e a r          on top of the gate h a v i n g             climbed      up the

o u ts i d e     to    a h e ig ht      of about        15-20 feet.        I signalled          and called out

to     t h e m to      get     off the          gate and they did in fact                 climb      down to the
                                                                                                                      PAGE

outside.         Because             of this s i t u a t i o n the            g a t e m a n was     clearly w o r r i e d

a n d a k s e d for a P o l i c e O f f i c e r             to a s s i s t      hi m at this gate.



My only       view of           the      crowd at that           stage        was     t h r o u g h the very       s amll

windows       in G a t e        A,      but   I could see            t here     was a       large    crowd o u t side.

I then went           to the            turnstiles        adjacent         to    the Gate A but             found      o nly

one P o l i c e O f f i c e r           who was       clearly        unable      to    leave his         post.       It was

my a s s u m p t i o n     that         all   other      officers        d e p l o y e d at this         p o s i t i o n were

engaged with              prisoners           or e s c o r t i n g    those      who     had gained u n a u t h o r i s e d

acc e s s   fro m the            ground.         T here wer e         no s u p e r v i s o r y o f f icers        present.

A small        number           of o f f i c e r s were       d e p l o y e d at      the    next g roup of

tu r n s t i l e s   but        w ere    f ully engaged.



 I ne>;t went         to        turnstiles           A-G w h i c h a l l o w e d      supporters         into the

gr o u n d to use           the      terraces.           Then      I saw       Ins p e c t o r White.          He hao w i t n

 him a number              of    officers         but the y wer e          also       fully       engaged.        It was

 clear more          officers            were     r e q uired to m a n          the     t u rnstiles       1-16.        I

 radioed a r e q u e s t              to Po l i c e     control       to     s e n d mo r e men to that

 location.           The        r e q u e s t was a c k n o w l e d g e d .       Tha t was        the   first      time        I

 had used m y          radio,           my mess a g e was          bot h     t r a n s m i t t e d and a c k n o w l e d g e d .



 For    some tim e          prior        to using the           radio        t here     had beer, i n t e r f e r e n c e

 of f i c e r s w e r e     present.            I could see            t h r o u g h the     turns t i l e s     mat        a

 large      c rowd was            present       outside       and      there was a           considerable           crush.

 Supporters          were         entering        the g r o u n d      only      v e r y siowly t h r o u g h the

turnstiles          and there were a number                         of    reasons        for      this.        One

turnstile        operator             was     e l d e r l y a n d w o r k e d slowly.              One     younger

operator       left       his        turnstile        to    remonstrate with a supporter.                               The        crush

was    so great         outside          that      pe o p l e w e r e     having        difficulty          in d e t a t c h i n g

themselves          from       the      crowd to        enter       the    turnst i l e s .          The    greatest

problem,       however,              s e e m e d to be the           nu m b e r    of   people       reaching           the

turnstiles          who       had the w r o n g         tick e t ,       who      tried to        pay    to g a i n a d m i s s i o n

or wh o a t t e m p t e d           to g a i n u n a u t h o r i s e d a dmission.



As     t hose who         succeded           in p a s s i n g    t h r o u g h the t u r n s t i l e s      entered            the

ground     they a p p r o a c h e d P o l i c e            Officers            directly.          Some     were      abusive

and     offensive,            but      the    over-riding            impression           I gained         from      t h e m was

of     panic     an d     fear       that      serious          injuries        or d eath w e r e        about       to        occur

in the     crush          outside.

fence waiting            their     tur n to c l i m b on to the wall.                          O t h e r s wer e

climbing       directly         to a p o s i t i o n    near me           from        tne t u r n s t i l e

enclosure.           On my arri v a l       these       people w e r e           s w a rming       over        the wall.

I could see           it w o u l d not have          b e e n safe         to try and f o r c e             t hem back

into     the    crowd.       In view of the             desperate             crush b e l o w          I allowed             them

to    c l i m b on    to the     roof     of the       turns t i l e ,       one at a time,                and        s h o w e d to

way    I had      climbed       to the     roof.        Some        of    t hese men had               difficulty

standing        a n d had bee n drinking,               but        non wa s      d isorderly.



A substantial            p r o p o r t i o n of these         people w e r e            in p o s s e s s i o n     of    tickets

justify        this m e a n s     of access.           A small           nu m b e r     having       climbed          to the

turnstile         roof    t r i e d to    pass       tickets        back      to those          outside           the

turnstiles.            I p r e v e n t e d this       h a ppening.            I became          so     engrossed             in

ensuring        the    safety      of these          people        that     I took no g r e a t a c c o u n t                 of

what     was    happening         elsewhere.            I was a ware            of s n a t c h e s        of    radio

messages        a bout    opening        gates,       but     I was       not aware            of the          o r i g i n of

L ho^e     me^saoes.         The     crowd     outside            turnstiles            A—G reauced             suacer;iy

which      could      only have        happened         zy    the o p e n i n g         of b a t e s B & €.               I did

not    have     gate C in view but               1    saw the        last       of tne         crowd,          about     40-50

entering        via gate B, w h i c h          I saw was            open.        Shortly after                  the     crowds

outside        turnstiles         A — G reduced,            the    same     happened outside                    turnstiles

1-16     indicating         that G ate A had also                   been open.               When      that       crowd

reduced         to    such an extent           that         it fi l l e d a bout           half      of    the      enclosure

within      the      perndter      gates,      I managed            to signal             to I n s p e c t o r     Hand-

Davis,      Counted Department               and       he    directed         one of his             officers           into

 I gauge          that     the m o o d     of     the     supporters            that    I cam e    i nto       contact wit h

w a s rriijied.           Some w e r e     a b u s i v e and ha d been d r i n k i n g .                 O t h e r s were

abusive        a b o u t wha t       they       considerd           to   be     lack    of P o l i c e    action       to

prevent           crushing        outside         the     turnstiles.            Many were         simply        fearful

that     serious           in j u r y w o u l d      o c c u r at    the t u r n s t i l e s .     Th e m a j o r i t y

demanded Police a ct io n                    to      re d u c e   the    crush.         There     is     no doubt       in my

mind     that       the m ost       appropriate              action         in the      circumstances            was    to

open     g ates A ,B & C to                prevent          injuries          in the     crush.          I did not          see

the a c t i o n s         of the? c r o w d w h e n         the     gates w ere         opened     because          it was

necessary           to ensure         the       safety       of those          people      climbing         into      the

g rou n d .




With matters               under     cont r o l       outside        the t u r n s t i l e s ,    I returned           to tne

moments        a    clear      radio       m e s s a g e was        transmitted          directing         o f f icers       on

           On Saturday              April       1969,     I per f o r m e d duty as a             logistics          officer at

F r o m 6 . 0 0 a-m.       events        p r o c e e d e d w i t h o u t any      problems.



About       2.15    p.m.      I went      to    the     perimeter         track      in f ront         of    the S p i o n

Kop with Foiice Constable                       3082 Fletcher.               At    that     time       I estimate           that

the S p i o n K o p was a b o u t           two      th i r d s   full,    but     look i n g     to     the    opposite

end    of    the    ground        there     w ere     far     fewer L i v e r p o o l      supporters.               The    two

clubs       pens    on the L e p p i n g s Lan e             terrace appeared              to   be a b o u t        two

thirds       full,       t here    seemed       to     be few      supporters            in the       o uter    pens an d

a few       s u p p o r t e r s well     dotted around             the W est Stand.               I was        so

surprised          by the        lack    of L i v e r p o o l     supporters         that       I made       specific

lnfgrpn-rp         to    it to P o l i c e      Constable          Fletcher        an d    noted       the     time as

being       between 2.15           to 2 . 2 0     p.m.



We    then walked          to the        Propert^Store              under       the S p i o n K o p w h i c h was

manned       by F o i i c e      Constable        3063 Marshall            a n d Mrs.          Drabble,        Civilian

Administrator.                It was       very      busy     under    the S p i o n Kop,             Nottingham

Forest       fans w ere          still     arriving          in   large    n u m bers.          The    m o o d of     those

fans    was       good    natured which              I judgec       from     their        rout i n e     enquiries

about       the    location        of    toilets,          refreshments           an d    entrances          to the

terraces          ana    their     general        b e haviour.



After       checking        tnat    all     was      in order at          the     property        store,        I walked

with Police             Constable        Fletcher         towards      the      second         property        store       at

the L e p p i n g s      Lan e    turnstiles.             We w a l k e d a l o n g       the    lower       passageway

b e n e a t h the N o r t h S t a n d w h i c h was a l l o c a t e o             to L i v e r p o o l      fans.

Moving        towards       the L e p p i n g s      L ane    turnstiles          it bec a m e        quite     b usy w i t h

supporters          entering        the      ground       to g a i n a c c e s s     to the N o r t h Stand.
w                                                                                                    page 3
                                                                                                                               R129
    At   the end o f the p a s s a g e w a y                   we    passed Sergeant               758 M o r g a n     who w a s       en

    route       to the g y m n a s i u m         with      an o f f d uty P o l i c e O f f i c e r who                had ha d

    his w a l l e t     stolen.           At    this      stage        I saw n o t h i n g       abnormal       or u n t o w a r d

    in the       behaviour           of the        crowd.

The p r o p e r t y s t o r e             was    situated            inside      turnstiles            1 - 16 and on            the

    ground       side     of the m e t a l             fence        which separated              supporters           u sing    the

North          Stand      from       those       going         to    the West S t a n d          and    terraces.           There

was        a further mobile                    cabin      for p r o g r a m m e     sellers         alo n g s i d e    the P o l i c e

property             store.      Thi s         store      was       manned      by P o 3 i c e    Sergeant        1153 B o o t h

and P o l i c e         Constable              325 3    Campbell.            Whilst       walking        to this         location,

when        passing        under          the    end      of    the N o r t h Stand,             I had w a r n e d P o l i c e

Constable              Fletcher           that     on     the       o c c a s i o n of the       semi-final           the

previous             year,      the       area     ha d    resembled            a waterfall            of urine        from p e o p l e

using          the     stand.        At    that        time     the     gr o u n d was     dry.

At       the     property        store          matters         w ere     quiet w i t h      little        property          seized

fro m       fans.        After discussing                      meal     arrangements             with Sergeant              Booth

and P o l i c e         Constable              Campbell         we    left     the s t o r e      intending           to r e t u r n

to       the     gymnasium.               However,         i m m e d i a t e l y on l e a v i n g       I was     approached

by a g a t e m a n wh o was                manning             Gate     A.   This gat e          is n o r m a l l y    used     to

allow          Police      Officers             an d    other        authorised people                 to enter        the     ground

without           using        the    turnstile.              The     g a t e m a n was    in an a g i t a t e d state.

He       t o l d me     that     because           the c r o w d outs i d e          the     gate      was    so heavy he

was       unable        to ope n          the     gate to a l l o w a u t h o r i s e d           access      and

accordingly              he     locked          the    gate.         I assured him           he     h a d taken        the

correct           co u r s e   of a c t i o n ,        but     during        the    course        of our d i s c u s s i o n

fans       started         to a p p e a r        on    top of the            gate h a v i n g       c l i m b e d up the

outside           to    a height           of a b o u t 15-20           feet.      I signalled            and    called        out

to       them     to    get     of f      the     gate and           they did       in fact         c l i m b down to the

                                                                                                                        R129

outside.           Because          of    this    s i t u a t i o n the gaten.an was             clearly worried

and aksed          for     a Police Officer                to a s s i s t      hini at this gate.



My   only     view       of    the       c r o w d at that       s tage w a s        t h r o u g h the    very     san.ll

windows       in G a t e       A,    but     I could see            there wa s a large              crowd outside.

I then went           to the         turnstiles adjacent                   to the Gate A but               found        o nly

one P o l i c e      Officer         who was          clea r l y u n a b l e    to    leave     his      post.          It was

my a s s u m p t i o n      that     all     other o f f i c e r s      d e p l o y e d at this          p o s i t i o n were

engaged with               prisoners         or e s c o r t i n g    thrse      who     had ga i n e d      unauthorised

access       from     the       ground.           T here w e r e     no s u p e r v i s o r y o f f i c e r s      present.

A    small    number          of    o f f i c e r s were       d e p l o y e d at    the next g r o u p of

turnstiles           but w e r e          fully     engaged.



I ne;<t w e n t        to     turnstiles            A-G w h i c h a l l o w e d      supporters          into      the

ground       tc     use      the    ter r a c e s .      Then     I saw      Inspector         White.         He    had w i t h

him a n u m b e r          .of o f f i c e r s    but    they were         also      fully engaged.                It    was

clear      more      officers             were    required        to m a n     the     turnstiles          1— 16.        I

radioed a           request          to P o l i c e     control       to    s e n d more m e n to that

lo c a t i o n .     The       r e q u e s t was a c k n o w l e d g e d .      That was         the     f irst     time       I

had    usee my           radio,          my mess a g e was        b oth t r a n s m i t t e d a n a a c k n o w l e d g e d .



For    some        tim e      prior       to using       the     radio      t here     had been          interference

ana    distortion              of m e s s a g e s     but all       the m e s s a g e      I had h e a r d       h a d been

 intelligible.



 I returned           to      turnstiles          1— 16 a n a w o u l d        estimate       the     time as-

2.45     p.m.       perhaps          with an accuracy               of 5 minutes.              On   this      o c c a s i o n ma

 officers          were       present.           I could see          t h r o u g h the     turnstiles           what a

 large      c r o w d wa s       present         outside       and there         was a c o n s i d e r a b l e      crush.

Supporters           were        entering         the g r o u n d     only      very slowly           through       the
      ,                                                                                              PAGE            5

turnstiles         and      there w e r e a n u m b e r             of     reasons       for this.           One

turnstile         o p e r a t o r was         elderly and w or k e d              slowly.        One y o u n g e r

operator       left        his       turnstile        to r e m o n s t r a t e w i t h a s u p p o r t e r .             The         crush

was   so    great        outside          that     people w e r e          having       difficulty          in d e t a t c h i n g

themselves          from        the      crowd to e n t e r         the     turnstiles.            The      greatest

problem,       however,              seemed        to be the         number        of   people     reaching            the

turnstiles          who        ha d the w r o n g       tick e t ,       who     t r i e d to pay to g a i n a d m i s s i o n

or w h o    attempted               to g a i n u n a u t h o r i s e d     admission.



As    those    who       succeded            in pass i n g        through        the t u r n s t i l e s    entered                the

ground       the y a pp roached Police                      Officers         directly.           Some      were a b u s i v e

and    offensive,              but     the     over-riding           impression           I gained f r o m t h e m was

of    panic       and     fear       that      serious          injuries        or d e a t h were a b o u t           to o c c u r

in the       crush        outside.



The       information            passed        to me       by t h o s e     supporters         c a m p *-»■trnjs wx u          my

somewhat          restrictive               v i s i o n of w h a t    wa s      happening        through         the

turnstiles,             c o n v i n c e d me       that a c t i o n       was    ne e d e d to    relieve            the

pressure          on    the      crowd o u t side.               I passed a          radio m e s s a g e        to    this

effect       to P o l i c e         Control        with a view            to a c t i o n being        taken          outside

the       ground.         I do not           recall        this    message         being a c k n o w l e d g e d .             i

outside       the t u r n s t i l e s .                       I could see the                     areas    outside               turnstiles           A- G

from turnstiles               1-16.          I saw about 30 young men sitting                               o u t s i d e this

fence     waiting          their       t u r n to    c limb on to            the wall.           Others          were

to    climb       on to the         roof      of the        turnstile,           one at a time,               and      sh o w e d to

standing          and     had b e e n     d r inking,         but      n o n was     di s o r d e r l y .



A    substantial            p r o p o r t i o n of t h e s e       peo p l e     were    in p o s s e s s i o n of ticket*

ensuring           the    safety        of t hese          people      t hat     I took      no great            account        of

messages           about      opening         gates,        but    I wa s      not a w a r e     of the          o r i g i n of

 those messages.                 The     c rowd o u t s i d e          turnstiles        A-G     reduced          suddenly

 entering          via gate B,           which       I sa w was           open.      Shortly after                the     crowds

 outslae          turnstiles           A-G    reduced,           the    same     happened outside                  turnstiles

 1-1 6    indicating           that G a t e A had also                    been     open.        W h e n that        crowd

1 gauge       that      the m o o d        of the       supporters         that     I came       into       contact w ith

was     mixed.         Som e    w e r e a b u s i v e an a had         been drinking.                 O t h e r s were

abusive      about what            they       c o n s i d e r d to be      lack of P o l i c e          action       to

prevent       crushing          outside          the    turnstiles.           Man y w e r e      simply        fearful

t hat    serious        injury w ou l d           o ccur at      the     turnstiles.             The m a j o r i t y

demanded Police                action       to    reouce       the    crush.       There        is no       aoubt        in my

mind     that     the m o s t a p p r o p r i a t e a c t i o n        in the       circumstances              was       to

open     g ates A , B & C to               prev e n t    injuries        in the      crush.           I did       not     see

the a c t i o n s      of the      crowd when            the    g ates w ere       op e n e d    because          it was

With     matters        under      control          outside      the turnstiles,                I returned           to the

moments      a    clear        radio    message         was     transmitted          directing           officers             on

to    the   pitch       in front        of L e p p i n g s L a n e       terrace.         A     large       nu m b e r    of

officers         ran    into the        ground and went                in the      direction           of    the     pitch.

stating     there        was a need         to set up a t e m p o r a r y m o r t u a r y .            I passed

JOHN JOSEPH BENNETT - CHIEF INSPECTOR                     PAGE 1




I am a Police Chief Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I performed duty as a logistics

officer at Hillsborough Football Ground for the occasion of the

semi final match between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.       At
that time I held the rank of Inspector.

I commenced duty at 6.00 am at the ground and had responsibility

for the supervision of the logistical side of the operation.

I was responsible to any Senior Officer requiring assistance

with administrative matters, but in practical terms liaised
directly with Inspector Sewell.

About 2.15 pm I went to the perimeter track in front of the

Spion Kop .   At that time I estimate that the Spion Kop was

about two thirds full, but looking to the opposite end of the

ground there were far fewer Liverpool supporters.     The two

centre pens on the Leppings Lane terrace appeared to be about

two thirds full, there seemed to be few supporters in the outer

pens and a few supporters well dotted around the West Stand.         I

was surprised by the lack of Liverpool supporters and made

specific reference to it to Police Constable Fletcher and noted
the time as being 2.15 to 2.20 pm.

We then walked to the property store under the Spion Kop.       It
was very busy under the Spion Kop.

After checking that all was in order at the property store, I

walked with Police Constable Fletcher towards the second

property store at the Leppings Lane turnstiles.     As I approached
JOHN JOSEPH BENNETT - CHIEF INSPECTOR                      PAGE 2




the Leppings Lane turnstiles it became quite busy with

supporters entering the ground to gain access to the North
Stand.

At the property store matters were quiet with little property

seized from fans.

I left the store intending to return to the gymnasium.       However,

immediately on leaving I was approached by a gateman who was

manning Gate 'A'.   This gate is normally used to allow Police

officers and other authorised people to enter the ground without

using the turnstile.   The gateman was in an agitated state.        He

told me that because the crowd outside the gate was so heavy he

was unable to open the gate to allow authorised access and

accordingly he locked the   gate.   I assured him he had taken the

correct course of action,   but during the course of our

discussion fans started to appear on top of the gate having

climbed up the outside to a height of about 15 - 20 feet.       I

signalled and called out to them to get off the gate and they

did in fact climb down to   the outside.   Because of this

situation the gateman was   clearly worried and asked for aPolice

Officer to assist him at this gate.

My only view of the crowd at that stage was through the very

small windows in Gate 'A', but I could see there was a large

crowd outside.   I then went to the turnstiles adjacent to the

Gate 'A' but found only one Police Officer who was clearly

unable to leave his post.   It was my assumption that all other
JOHN JOSEPH BENNETT - CHIEF INSPECTOR                     PAGE 3




officers deployed at this position were engaged with prisoners

or escorting those who had gained unauthorised access from the

ground.    There were no supervisory officers present.   A small

number of officers were deployed at the next group of turnstiles
but were fully engaged.

I next went to turnstiles A — G which allowed supporters into

the ground to use the terraces.     Then I saw Inspector White.     He

had with him a number of officers but they were also fully

engaged.    It was clear more officers were required to man the

turnstiles 1 - 1 6 .   I radioed a request to Police Control to

send more men to that location.     The request was acknowledged.

That was the first time I had used my radio, my message was both
transmitted and acknowledged.

For some time prior to using the radio there had been

interference and distortion of messages but all the messages I
had heard had been intelligible.

I returned to turnstiles 1 - 1 6   and would estimate the time as
2.45 pm perhaps with an accuracy of 5 minutes.

On this occasion many officers were present.     I could see

through the turnstiles that a large crowd was present outside
and there was a considerable crush.

Supporters were entering the ground only very slowly through the

turnstiles and there were a number of reasons for this.    One

turnstile operator was elderly and worked slowly.    One younger

operator left his turnstile to remonstrate with a supporter.

The crush was so great outside that people were having

difficulty in detaching themselves from the crowd to enter the

turnstiles.     The greatest problem, however, seemed to be the

number of people reaching the turnstiles who had the wrong

ticket, who tried to pay to gain admission or who attempted to
gain unauthorised admission.

As those who succeeded in passing through the turnstiles entered

the ground they approached Police Officers directly.               Some were

abusive and offensive, but the over-riding impression I gained

from them was of panic and fear that serious injuries or deaths
were about to occur in the crush outside.

The information passed to me by those supporters coupled with my

somewhat restrictive vision of what was happening through the

turnstiles, convinced me that action was needed to relieve the

pressure on the crowd outside.               I passed a radio message to this

effect to Police Control with a view to action being taken

outside the ground.               I do not recall this message being
acknowledged.

I directed officers to assist supporters in through the

turnstiles as quickly as possible.               I gave the instruction that

everybody should be allowed in with or without the correct
ticket, whether authorised or not.

Within a short time of my first radio message, Inspector Delaney

*(Sergeant Higgins?) and members of 'F' Division Crime and

Vandal Squad arrived and began to assist at the turnstiles.

* Did he give them any advice or instructions?


At that time I became aware of supporters gaining access to the

ground by climbing on a wall and shinning their way along the

top of Gate 'B'.    They were being intercepted within the ground

by Police Officers, but the people gaining access in this manner

appeared to be in considerable danger from electrical cables and

lamps on the top of Gate 'B'.     I gained access to the roof of

the turnstiles alongside Gate 'B' by climbing on a small brick

structure at the rear of the turnstiles and then climbing to the

roof with the assistance of a Liverpool supporter.     It had been

my intention to prevent people gaining access in this manner.

When I climbed to the roof I became fully aware of the situation

outside the turnstiles.     I could see the areas outside

turnstiles A - G   and 1 - 1 6 were completely filled with a crush

of people.   The crowd then extended beyond the perimeter gates

taking up the full width of Leppings Lane extending over the

river bridge to the left and along Leppings Lane to the right

about 50 yards.    Under normal circumstances I would have

estimated there to be a crowd of about 2,000 but, on that

occasion people were so tightly crushed together I estimate

there to have been twice the number.    The pressure from the

crush seemed at its greatest at the turnstiles as the crowd

pushed to gain admission.    I could see Superintendent Marshall
JOHN JOSEPH BENNETT - CHIEF INSPECTOR                          PAGE 6




standing slightly above the ground on the stonework at the head

of the bridge in Leppings Lane.         There were numerous mounted

officers in the area and I recall a radio message for more to

attend.     I   believe from the Directors entrance in the South

Stand car park.       When I first climbed to the roof there were two

Mounted Officers trying to control the crowd outside the

turnstiles A - G .      Eventually they left that area and joined

other Mounted Officers attempting to hold the crowd back in

Leppings Lane to relieve the pressure on those people between
the perimeter gates and the turnstiles.

Those supporters who were gaining access by climbing over Gate

'B' were first climbing on top of a fence which separates the

turnstiles A - G      from turnstiles 1 - 1 6 .   I saw about 30 young

men sitting outside this fence waiting their turn to climb on to

the wall.       Others were climbing directly to a position near me

from the turnstile enclosure.        On my arrival these people were

swarming over the wall.       I could see it would not have been safe

to try and force them back into the crowd.         In view of the

desperate crush below I allowed them to climb on to the roof of

the turnstile, one at a time, and showed to them the safe route
back to ground level inside the turnstiles by the way I had

climbed to the roof.       Some of these men had difficulty standing

and had been drinking, but none was disorderly.

A substantial proportion of these people were in possession of

tickets which they were waving to gain access.         Others made no
JOHN JOSEPH BENNETT - CHIEF INSPECTOR                     PAGE 7




effort to justify this means of access.     A small number having

climbed to the turnstile roof tried to pass tickets back to

those outside the turnstiles.    I prevented this happening.     I

became so engrossed in ensuring the safety of these people that

I took no great account of what was happening elsewhere.       I was

aware of snatches of radio messages about opening gates, but I
was not aware of the origin of those messages.



* Did he gain any impression of what they were about?


The crowd outside turnstiles A - G    reduced suddenly which could

only have happened by the opening of Gates 'B' and 'C'.     I did

not have Gate *C* in view but I saw the last of the crowd, about

40-50 entering via Gate *B', which I saw was open.     Shortly

after the crowds outside turnstiles A - G    reduced, the same

happened outside turnstiles 1 - 1 6   indicating that Gate 'A' had

also been opened.   When that crowd reduced to such an extent

that it filled about half of the enclosure within the perimeter

gates, I managed to signal to Inspector Handdavis, Mounted

Department and he directed one of his officers into the

enclosure and that officer prevented any more supporters
climbing into the ground.



*   Paragraph here to describe his view of the concourse ie gap
in wall, entrance to tunnel.    Did he have any communication with
JOHN JOSEPH BENNETT - CHIEF INSPECTOR                     PAGE 8




Sergeant Higgins?     Explain in more detail why he asked for extra
manpower.     What resources did he see on concourse and did he use
them in any way?     Did he see position of any barriers which
could have been utilised to control or direct the crowd?


I gauge that the mood of the supporters that I came into contact

with was mixed.     Some were abusive and had been drinking.

Others were abusive about what they considered to be lack of

Police action to prevent crushing outside the turnstiles.        Many

were simply fearful that serious injury would occur at the

turnstiles.     The majority demanded Police action to reduce the

crush.

I did not see the actions of the crowd when the gates were

opened because it was necessary to ensure the safety of those

people climbing into the ground.

With matters under control outside the turnstiles, I returned to

the ground and was rejoined by Police Constable Fletcher.

Within a few moments a clear radio message was transmitted

directing officers on to the pitch in front of Leppings Lane

terrace.



* Can he say if he heard any messages directing manpower or
alerting officers that the gates were to be or had been opened.

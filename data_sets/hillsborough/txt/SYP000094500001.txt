              I heard on the          radio,          Radio Hal lam,                    that     there was a crowd disturbance

              at the H i l l s b o r o u g h     football                  ground.           I tele p h o n e d                         *iho was

                         and                                ~iad a l r e a d y    commenced         this    procedure,

As     p r e v i ou sl y s t a te d    once a casualty a r r i v e d at the                       hospital      I w ould

place a wrist               band on their arm and                     record details             on a form.         In a

available.

Some      of the      casu a l t i e s      had a rr i v e d at the              hospital        prior     to the Major

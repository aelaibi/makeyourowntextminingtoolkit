    road w h i c h was about              5 minu t e s walk         from the        ground.

    When     I got       off   the     coach     I d i d n ’t see any            police    officers       telling      fans

    Myself     and my two            friends      went       up to tur n s t i l e       B where we were

    searched        before      entering         the    ground      by a police           officer.        This was         the

    only unif o r m         officer       at this       time,     that      I saw outside           the ground..           1

    saw no stewards             at all        outside.         Once    inside we were a g a i n s e a rched                    by

    came     in,    selling       prog ramines.             I bought a programme              off one      of them

    then     the    three      of us w a l k e d       off    down the       tunnel       into    the    pen to the

    the    pens     on t he outside            were a 1mos t e m p t y .           w h e n we entered       t fie    t unne i

Once    in       the    pen,          myself         and          my    two       friends             took        up     a    position             riet       to

the    dividing             f e n ce     to     pen          3,    about          a       third       of     the       way     down.

At    this       time       it     was       fairly           quiet          inside,             there        was       no     fighting             or       any

disorder          or    p*eople          drinking.                     Myself             and    my     two       friends           sat       down       and

read    our       programmes,                 this           was       at    about          ten       to     two.            (1350)           The       ground

began       to    fill       up       gradually,                  and       our       pens       filled           up    steadily,              it       wasn't

uncomfortable,                   and     you       could           still          move          about        quite           freely.

At    about       half       two        (1430)           -    quarter             to       three,          (1445)            the    penwe          were

standing          in a p p e a r e d          full,           so       we    ducked             under        one       of     the       barriers             and

stood       in    front          of     it,     rather             than          behind          it.         We    noticed              people          behind

us    were       alsjy'clucki ng              under           the          barriers,             and       making           their        way       to    the

front

At    ab/ui       2.55        pm      (1455)         when          the       teams          came        onto       the        pitch,          the       people

beh/nd       the       barrier           which           I had             ducked          under,          got     squashed              against             it,

preventing             them        from       getting              underneath                   it.        The     people           behind          us       were

 creaming          and       shouting              to        push          them       back       as     they       were        being

squashed.              It    was        at    this           time          that       I got        s e p i ar a t ed         from                  nd

1 was       pushing          back        as     hard          as       I    could          but    eventually                  I ended          up

towards          the    front.

Whilst       I was          pushing           in     the          pen       backwards              to      get     people           off       the

barrier,          I was          pushing           this           bloke          on       his    chest        to       try     and       get       him       off

the    barrier.               In      turn      he       was       pushing                off    rny s h o u l d e r s         to       try    and       push

himself          back.           I knew         this          bloke          was          in a     lot       of    trouble              as    he    was

screaming          at       us     to    push        him          back       off          the    barrier,              I. c a n ' t      remember             the

colour       of    his       face,           but     I       can       remember             he    had

                 I would           describe              him       as       abg^rlT 3 5          to     40    yrs,          a white           male,

black       hair,       short           and     tidy.                       had       a    black        moustache,                 no    beard          or

glasses.           I think              he w a s y a r i n g                 a white             T-shirt.               I remember                 thinking

he    was    quite          well        b|iij

I kept       trying          to       push      him          back          but    we       just       couldn't              move.            There       were

others       on the          barrier    s c r e a m i n g and shouting?             some w ith their             backs       to

us    but     the man         I have    just     described        is the          one    I remember        the most.

I don't         know how        it h a p p e n e d    but    I then ended up at the                  front       of the

pen.        There were          people       screaming        in front        of me and some             people were

climbing             up over    the    perimeter         fence.       Some        even    s c rambled over           our

heads       from behind          in order        to get out.

I could see             the    pen gate was           open,    this w o u l d ' v e       been about 3.0 5             pm.

<15055         The      game was       s t o p p e d and     I was    thinking           of getting        to    it,       but

trying        to      pull    people    out.         They were also           shouting          to the     people at

the     back         to move    back and waving at               them w i t h their             hands.

Thera       was also a bloke              standing          on the    fence w h i c h sep a r a t e d the two

pens,       pulling          people    up onto        the    fence who        were       then able       to     climb the

perimeter             fence and onto          the     pitch.

I can *t remember               how    long     1 stood       there    in the           pen    in the    crush,        I

managed         to grab at the            perimeter          fence    to    pull        myself    out,     but    I just

After       a while          I looked     behind me and           I saw that             the    crush from the

back     had s t o p p e d and         that     there was        space      behind us.            I m a n a g e d to

move      into this           space and       tell     the    people at           the    front,    who ware          still

pushing        down,         to move    back.

As    the     people m o v e d        back    I saw a far; and a p o liceman                     ripping at          the

mesh     in the         periafeter      fence.,        They e v e n t u a l l y     ripped       it off and bent

it up so             peoo/e    could get        through.         1 then saw this                old bloke        on the

floor       of the       pen,    about       5 0 - 5 5 yrs,    he w a s n ’t moving.              There was also a

                      We saw       people        down at       the Forest       end,    ripping       hoardings       off,    so me and

                               ran down an d            ripped a piece          off    o u rselves     to help       carry the

                      We    ran up w i t h        the    board and       put    it on the          ground    by the goalmouth.

                      took     the       body to the       back       of the    stand,       where    there were       other        bodies

                      laid out           on boardings..

                      We    ran back and helped with another                          body on some          boarding and helped

                      carry      it down to this               same    entrance.        As we got       to the       entrance         there

                      were     enough        people      carrying       the    boarding       so    I left them and turned to

                      it was at           this    time    the i-orest         fans    began to taunt          us,    and a    j.   oao ot

                      A    load of        police     officers         then    came    onto    the    pitch and formed a

                      been helping            the    injured.          I could       remember       a few of the Liverpool

fans        getting mad w i t h                     the      police,         shouting at         them,    saying     it was

their         fault.             The         police        just       stood there and            said nothing.           Then    some

of the fans                  calmed           the       others        down by telling            them    it w a s n ’t the

p o l i c e ’s fault and                      that       they were           ordinary       fellas      as well.

I remember                 walk i n g         around        for a while             and then sitting            down on the

pitch and having a drink                                   of water.              I also    remember      getting a lad who

dad      could see               that         I was alright.

I can't             remember            m u c h after               this    but    I remember K enny D a l g l i s h saying

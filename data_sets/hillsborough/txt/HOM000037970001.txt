 I arrived at the approach to the Leppings Hoad end of the Hillsborough
 Stadium at lL.25 hours.                  I was accompanied                                                                        and
                                    Ve all had a valid ground ticket.                                            The immediate
 approach to the turnstiles, a distance of sone 70 yards, was full cf
 a jostling crowd of ticket holders trying to make their way to the
 turnstiles.              There was no sentience of orderly queues, with some kind
 of order trying to he maintained by three mounted police officers.
 Despite the lack of organisation and frustration the m o od of the fans
 remained reasonably co -operative.                              To emphasise this, one of the horses
was very close to me and accidentally almost knocked my spectacles off.
The officer apologised and we exchanged smiles and I stroked the horse's
nose.


^ ^ e nearer one got to the actual turnstiles the pushing and crashing
became severe.              After approximately ten minutes all three of us were
literally catapulted through the turnstiles.                                               Over the last ten yards
one had no control whatsoever over our movements.


Once through the turnstile all three of my party came together,
attempted to remonstrate with a police officer regarding the lack of
organisation on the approach to the turnstile.                                              He was warned by a
steward standing alongside the officer to keep quiet because ether fans
v/ho had made similar protests had been forcibly                                           -ejected fror the ground.


Ve then moved away and vrent to use the toilet situated in front of us
^ ^ d e r the stand.             As we came out of the toilet we were directly facing
 the rear of the turnstile area and were immediately aware of the
 opening of one of the gates alongside the turnstiles.                                                       The time was nov
 just after lL.kO hours.                  Anticipating the ensuing rush I took                                               my
 companions to the right, aiming to take our place high up on the terracing
 to the left of the Lepping Road Stand facing the playing area.                                                              The
 previous y e a r ’s experience had alerted me that this was a sensiole area
 to stand, both from a safety viewpoint and it also provided an excellent
 view.               I have a vivid mental picture, as we hurried past the nov
 infamous tunnel leading to the ill-fated sections, of turning my head
 and noticing there was nobody to be seen, either spectator cr official.
  The high up area we entered was very fullf but with no crash.                   We

  positioned'ourselves within feet of the blue boards.                Looking down fro:?,

  my high vantage spot I could see the two middle            Dens   immediately   "b e h in d


  the goal were .jammed to capacity with a seething mass of people.                To isy

  surprisef the pens on the left and right were half empty.                The area on

  the far right around the electronic scoreboard was also half empty.

  The time of this observation was 14.50 hrs.




  Jftr attention then became diverted when the Liverpool team took to the

   ield, followed a couple of minutes later by the opposition.                At "the same

  time I was conscious of a few people entering cur section behind ar.i

  alongside me.     There was no large influx .just before the kick-off where

  I was standing.




  The gsme had beer, in progress for some five minutes with Liverpool pressing

  home an attack at the far endt with a c o m e r followed by a shot which hit

  the woodwork.     T believe this shot to be significant because it meant

  a tremendous surge down the Dens behind the Liverpool goal to try ar.i see

  what was happening.     This is the normal reaction on the terracing at any

^^rootball match.        Prom my vantage point I was tnen immediately avare

  of fans trying to come over the metal fence behind the goal.                Some hai

  been successful and were being led down the touchline by the police.                    Others

  were being stopped climbing out of the pens despite their obvious pretests.

  At the same time a senior police officer ran fror. behind the Liverpccl goal

  and approached the referee.        He immediately stopped the game taJring both

  teams off the pitch.        By this time a few more fans had managed tr

  escape from the pens.      One fan on the field of clay appeared to be

  pleading whilst he was being forcibly led to the side of the playir.r area.

  Behind the goal the two    Dens    were a seething mass of people with little

  or no movement either backwards or forwards.             A few people were being

  passed from the back of the       Dens   to the front.       The front of tne        pens
next to the fence seemed to "be flat without the usual bobbing heads.


Within two minutes of the teams leaving the field I realised something was

very wrong.      On reflection I have come to the conclusion that my alarm was

confirmed due to a combination of medical experience combined with an

intimate knowledge of years of attendance at football matches on the

terracing.


I quickly realised that help would be required on the pitch.       I informed

      what I was doing and because I was so close to the entrance to the

terracing I had entered I quickly made my way down the stairs to find a

Steward to get me to the side of the pitch.       I quickly found a Steward who

a c c ^ ^ e d what I was telling him and he took me through a tunnel under the mai

stand where a Police Officer again accepted rry explanation of being a trained

nurse and let me on to the pitch.


I raced to the area immediately behind the goal net.      The narrow gate belong

to the pen behind the net was open with police officers trying to pull flayir.

bodies through the narrow ooenir.e.      Other officers appeared to he trying to

instruct the fans to push back in the pens.       I helped officers pull people

through the gate.       We were pulling ar.y part of their body we could get hold

of.    On reflection I realise now because their bodies were level with the

b o t ^ ^ of the gate that they must have beer, lyinr on top of people because

the gap between the bottom of the gate to the floor of the terracing was some

three feet.



The first casualties I helped pull through the gate were conscious, but very

shocked.      I attended to them at the back of the goalmouth on the netting.

Their recovery was comparatively quick and simple were moved away from the

immediate area.       Very quickly I was aware that we were pulling out

unconscious bodies.     I can next recall working on a young man who once he

was conscious seemed to have chest injuries.      I looked around the goalmouth

for a stretcher or something to remove him to a place for him to get treatmer.
                                                      -   4~


     The scene around me remained completely chaotic with everyone tiying to do

      their own thing, fans and police all mingling together.             I eventually found

    ' a stretcher lying on the pitch with which I quickly returned to the injured man.

     I literally ordered three police officers to help me lift the patient on to the

     stretcher.      By this time he was complaining about the pain in his chest.                 We

     quickly made our way to the c o m e r of the field bet%*een the main stand and the

     Kop and took the young man behind the stand to the St. John's Ambulance room.

     X then ran back on to the field to the goalmouth.            In that short interval of

     time a lot more bodies were lying behind the goal.             People of all descriptions

     were attempting mouth to mouth resuscitation ar.d cardiac massage.             On the right

(     land side of the goal net a young girl was being worked on b y a man who stated

        was a surgeon.           I moved to the body next ir. line and worked with a your.g

     police officer until the patient appeared to be starting to cine round.                 I

    then moved on to the next person who was Ivir.s unconscious and unattended in

    the goalmouth.        I was working alone in this instance giving both mouth to mouth

    and cardiac massage, an impossible and hopeless situation.             The patient started

    vomiting to complicate the issue.           I was conscious of an elderly white haired

    St. J o h n ’s Ambulance man working alongside me.         I requested sonse swabs tc clear

    an airway, all that was forth coning was a dry sponge.             By this tir.e it was

    sfter 15*30 hours and we still had no equipment of any sort to work with.                It

     fas just after that that I was conscious of the first ambulances beginning' to
       m
    make" their way on to tne pitch.           Eventual 1;/ I realised that I nac lost tns

    battle for this young n a n ’s life.          I loo ke d ,around but I could r.ot see anymore

    unattended bodies.           By that time our ranks had been swelled by a~bular.ce crews

    and firemen with some oxygen.


    I next left the field m aking my way behind the main stand to the gymnasium where

    I understood some of the injured were being taken.             Again I found another scene

    of chaos.       The only entrance to the gym was a door of similar dimensions

    to that found in any household room.            Directly outside this door was the

    St. J o h n ’s Ambulance Room.        The space was becoming jammed full of people

    with comparatively minor injuries.           The area was also rapidly filling with

    people p r e s s e d dead.
I next assisted police to make some sort of pathway to the door of the gym by-

helping and organising the movement of both the prospectuve dead and the

 seriously injured.-          Inside the gymnasium the space was roughly divided

into two, half for the dead and the rest for the living, with tables set up

to interview the relatives.          I began to work with the injured in the

gymnasium at around 15* 5*5 hours.        I was conscious of around three doctors in

attendance, but when I arrived there there was still no medical equipment of

any sort.        One doctor shouted across the gym for some drags to treat an

injured fan who was in obvious pain.          There was nothing available so I

volunteered to go to the St. John's Ambulance room.           I was informed that

they were not allowed to carry any drags.            I rushed back to the gym asking

J Q k Senior Police Officer on the way if they could obtain some equipment

for us.       Quickly three small plastic "boxes arrived with medical equipment

plus an emergency case x^ith drugs in it.          I began passing out the meagre

items of equipment to the doctors present.           There were still only roughly

a dozen injured in the area.          I prepared ter. intravenous lines ready for the

Medical Officer to set up, and we commandeered police officers to hold the

I.Y. packs because we ha d no stands to attach them to.             3y "then some

semblance of order was b eing maintained in the part of the gymnasium given

over to the injured.            The other side of the gymnasium was rapidly filling

w ^ ^ the pr-2.C2 *w.^'/'   dead.    One of the doctors present had taken one of the

three stethoscopes available to enable hir. to declare them clinically dead.


I next tidied up the Dedical equipment as most of the injured were being

rapidly removed to hospital.          I then began to realise the full extent of

the disaster for there were already over fifty bodies lying on the floor.

My final act in this carr.age was to comfort and stay with the husband of the

young girl whom I had seen attended to behind the goal.          At least I knev:

she had had the best of attention that had been available in the

circumstances.        I stayed with him whilst he gave the necessary details

to the police, and then a local vicar took over from me.

When I left the gymnasium, to m y amazement it was still only 16.45 hours.
The longest hour and a h a l f of m y life.
PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS



1.   Comparison of the organisation with the previous year.

     The previous year I arrived at the same area of admission at 14*50 hours

     ■with              i   Before w e reached the turnstiles at Leppings Lane

     we had to go through a police filter system, whereby it was ascertained

     that we did have the appropriate      match tickets.

     This year no such system wa.s set     up.




2.           years I was delayed because   of travelling difficulties.       The

     appropriate Authorities had decided to initiate roadworks on the Mo 2

     to commence around a week before each game.       Surely the matches co-old

     have been taken into consideration when setting up these roadworks.




3.   When we cane through the turnstiles for the 19SS game we were met by a

     line of stewards and police officers who gently but firmly prevented us

     from entering the tunnel to the middle sections.          It had been   decided

     that these sections were already      full to capacity.

      :is year no such precaution was      in operation.




4.   I can understand the    Police Officers at the turnstiles wishing to open

     the gates to relieve pressure and avoid injury to life cr limb, but

     in these days of ultra m o d e m and sophisticated personal communications

     surely it could have been done in conjunction with their central police

     control area at the side of the electronic scoreboard.




5*   Very recent national   publicity has assured us that surveillance cameras

     at football grounds means that ar.y problems can be dealt with within

     two minutes of their occurrence.

     Surely with the police central control post with all its battery of

     T.V. monitors available, they should have been able to ascertain the
                                      -   2-



need to close the middle sections when they became full.



6. ' Observing from 'the outside it appears to have taken far too long

     for the authorities to decide that it was not a security problem and

     that the fans genuinely needed help.       ’
                                                .forking with   knd alongside

     the individual police officers in the immediate disaster area, I

     have tremendous praise and admiration for their efforts.          Overall

     at the scene, however, there appeared to be a lack of co-ordination

     and genuine leadership.




7.   For an extremely lor.g time we were without any form of medical

     equipment of ar.y description.       I still canr.et \ir.derstand why the

     local Health Authority’s T'ajor Medical 'Disaster Team was net called

     upon.   T understand that all Health Authorities in this country

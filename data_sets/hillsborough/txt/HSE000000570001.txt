1 INTRODUCTION

As part of the investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) into the
incident at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's Hillsborough stadium on 15
April 1989, Mr A L Collins, a Scientific Officer, and Mr D Waterhouse, a
Principal Scientific Officer, of HSE's Research and Laboratory Services
Division (RLSD) calculated the maximum number of persons (the capacity) that
was appropriate for Pens 3 and 4, The calculations were based on their
interpretation of recommendations contained within the Home Office/Scottish
Office publication "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" (H M Stationery Office:
1986).


2 ESTIMATIONS OF THE CAPACITIES OF PENS 3 AND 4

Dr Nicholson, a Deputy Director of RLSD's Safety Engineering Laboratory (SEL)
provided us with a drawing that he had received from Eastwood and Partners on
24 April 1989. The drawing was labelled Eastwood and Partners, was numbered
8945/lA, had the title "Sheffield Wednesday F.C. PLC Hillsborough Ground
Layout 1987" and was dated 16/4/87 with Revision A dated 21/10/87. This
drawing showed the capacity of one of the two central 'pens' of the West
terraces of the stadium to be 1,200 persons and that of the other to be 1,000
persons, i.e. the capacity of the combined area was 2,200 persons.

The interim report IR/L/ME/MM/89/1 prepared by RLSD for the Court of Inquiry
states that, "if 54 people per 10 sq m is assumed as the allowable packing
density for the West Terrace then the capacity of Pen 3 is 1015 and Pen 4 is
1036 making a total of 2051 for the combined area".

However, Paragraph 221 of the 1986 edition of the Home Office/Scottish Office
publication "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" (H M Stationary Office) states
"Where crush barriers meet the strength and spacing guidelines of Chapter 9
the capacity of a terrace or viewing slope should be assessed from the area
available for standing by allowing a packing density of between 54 and 27
persons per 10 square metres depending upon the condition of the terrace or
slope".

We knew that RLSD's calculation had been made as a preliminary check of the
capacity assigned by Eastwood & Partners to the two central 'pens'. We
therefore examined two drawings that had been prepared for HSE by Ralph Brade
& Associates, Consulting Engineers, Midland Bank Chambers, 3 Sharrow Lane,
Sheffield. Drawing No 1340/02 Rev A, dated 3/5/89, showed a plan view of
Pens 3 and 4 on the West terraces and Drawing No 1340/03A Rev A, also dated
3/5/89, showed a section through part of the West terraces. These drawings are
reproduced, to a smaller scale, in Figs 1 and 2 respectively.

Our examination of these drawings caused us conclude that RLSD's nominal
maximum capacity 2051 persons for the central 'pens' might have to be reduced
to compensate for some departures from the recommendations of Chapter 9 of the
Guide. We therefore calculated capacities for Pens 3 and 4 on the basis of the
areas behind crush barriers and perimeter fences in which a crowd packing
density of 5.4 persons/sq m would be permissible, provided all other aspects
of the terraces conformed with the Guide's recommendations.
3   METHOD OF CALCULATING THE REVISED MAXIMUM CAPACITIES OF PENS 3 AND 4

The calculation of the revised maximum capacity of Pens 3 and 4 was based on
our interpretation of Paragraph 113, Paragraph 225, and Table 1 of the Guide.

Paragraph 113 states: "Ideally, crush barriers should be provided along the
full width of a terrace, with gaps only at radial gangways".

Paragraph 225 states "The capacity of the terrace is calculated by multiplying
the area available for standing by the appropriate packing density. The
following following formula may be used:

                                 A
Capacity (Number of persons) —        x (27 to 54)
                                 10

where 'A' is the area available for standing in square metres.

Table 1 recommends the maximum horizontal distance that should exist between
barriers conforming to the "greater" and the "lesser" strength requirements
when they are installed on "peak viewing areas" and on "other areas". We
classified Pens 3 and 4 as being 'peak viewing' areas because they were
behind a goal, and the barriers as conforming to the "greater strength
requirement" because this permitted greater horizontal distances.

Pens 3 and 4 did not have radial gangways, nor did their crush barriers extend
the full width of the terraces, gaps being present along the rows. We
therefore calculated the plan area of terrace behind each barrier (or
perimeter fence) by multiplying the length of the barrier by a 'permissible
depth' behind it. This 'permissible depth' was either the maximum horizontal
distance between barriers that was recommended for "peak viewing" in Column A
of Table 1 of the Guide, or the existing distance between the barrier and the
next barrier (or wall) behind it, whichever was the least.

Brade's Drawing No 1340/03A showed the slope of Pens 3 and 4 to be 13 degrees
40 minutes. The recommended maximum horizontal distance between crush barriers
that corresponded to this slope was interpolated from Table 1 of the Guide as
being 3.9 m. Brade's Drawing No 1340/02 Rev A showed that the horizontal
distance between the rows of crush barriers in Pens 3 and 4 was usually 3.5m,
i.e. the existing distance between the rows of crush barriers was usually
within the recommended maximum value.

The heights of the barriers were generally less than the values of 1.02 m to
1.12 m recommended in the Guide. However, we did not discount any of the crush
barriers in our calculations; no barrier had a height less than 81% of the
minimum recommended value, and our intention was to calculate a 'base'
capacity that could be further reduced because of other departures from the
Guide's recommendations.

We multiplied each plan area behind a barrier (sq m) by 5.4 persons/sq m and
truncated the product to obtain the number of persons appropriate to each
area. Fig 3 is a pictorial representation of the method of calculation, the
details of which are shown in Appendix 1. The total capacities of Pens 3 and 4
were then obtained by summing the numbers of persons appropriate to each area
behind a barrier. Our calculations showed the capacity of Pen 3 to be 822
persons and that of Pen 4 to be 871 persons, i.e. the combined capacity of the
central 'pens' was 1,693 persons.

4   ASSESSMENT OF REVISED CAPACITIES

The white areas of Fig 3 represent those parts of the terrace where, ideally,
persons should not stand, otherwise the thrust exerted on part of a crush
barrier by a crowd of 5.4 persons/sq m might exceed the force intended by the
Guide.

Our calculations did not include any reduction in capacity of the central
'pens' to compensate for departures from other recommendations contained in
the Guide. Brade's drawings indicated that departures from Paragraphs in the
Guide, other than those associated with the continuity (Paragraph 113) and
spacing (Table 1) of crush barriers, existed in the central 'pens', i.e.

Paragraph 92   - ”A terrace step should not be less than 280 mm or more than
380 mm wide.   The preferred dimension is between 355 mm and 380 mm". Pens 3
and 4 had 33   terrace steps, of which 28 (85%) were slightly wider, (not more
than 10 mm),   than the maximum recommended width.

Paragraph 96 - "The aim should be to ensure that every spectator on the
terraces is within 12 metres of a gangway or exit so that spectators can move
quickly on to exit routes at the end of an event or in the event of an
emergency. This may be achieved by a pattern of gangways (not less than
1.1 metres wide) linked to the exit system". There were no gangways in Pens 3
and 4 and if the perimeter gates are not considered as exits, then
approximately 40% of the persons in these 'pens' were not within 12 m of an
exit.

Paragraph 110 - "In order to locate the top rail against that part of the body
most able to tolerate pressure the heights of crush barriers should be 1.02 m
to 1.12 m above the nosing of the step immediately behind the barrier, with a
preferred height of 1.1m" . Four of the five barriers in Pen 3 and six of the
nine barriers in Pen 4 did not conform with this recommendation.

Paragraph 114 - " Where barriers are not continuous between radial gangways,
the alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers on a terrace should form
an angle of less than 60 degrees to the line of the barriers. There should be
no more than 2 consecutive gaps in any line of gaps". Two of the four 'paths
of gaps' in Pen 3 and one of the eleven 'paths of gaps' in Pen 4 did not
conform with the recommendation on alignment.

Paragraph 115 - " Where there are gaps in the line of crush barriers these
should be at least 1.1 m and not more than 1.4 m in width". Four of five gaps
in Pen 3 did not conform and nine of ten gaps in Pen 4 did not conform to a
literal interpretation of this recommendation. A more liberal interpretation,
relating the acceptability of the width of a gap to the resulting depth of
crowd that could form between two rows of barriers, resulted in four of five
gaps in Pen 3 and three of six gaps in Pen 4 not conforming, as shown in the
schematic plan of Fig 4.

Paragraph 215 - "For most major stadia, whether used for association football
or other sports, the pitch perimeter fence will be required either to prevent
access to parts of the pitch as mentioned above (Paragraph 214), or at least
to discourage attempts by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates or other
access points (minimum width of 1.1 m) should nevertheless be provided for use
in an emergency and, at those grounds where a perimeter track is used as part
of the exit system, for the departure of spectators at the end of an event.
Provision of such gates or access points is particularly important to allow
for access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a
place of safety in an emergency. Such gates or access points should be
properly stewarded and clearly marked so that immediate access to the playing
area or perimeter track can be ensured". The gate to Pen 3 had a clearance
width of 0.81 m to 0.82 m and the gate to Pen 4 had a clearance width of
0.77 m to 0.79 m. The two gates in the perimeter fence of the central 'pens'
therefore did not conform with this recommendation.

It is our opinion that it might be advisable to reduce the 'base' capacities
of 822 persons for Pen 3 and 871 peraons for Pen 4, because of these six
departures from the Guide's recommendations.


5   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

5.1 We used recommendations contained within the 1986 edition of the Home
Office/Scottish Office publication "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" (the
Guide) to calculate revised maximum allowable capacities for Pens 3 and 4 of
the West terraces of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's Hillsborough stadium.
We calculated the maximum allowable capacity of Pen 3 to be 822 persons, and
that of Pen 4 to be 871 persons. It is therefore our opinion that the combined
maximum allowable capacity of the two- central 'pens' should not exceed1,693
persons, provided that all other aspects of the terraces conformed with the
Guide's recommendations.

5.2 Our calculations showed the capacity of Pen 3 to be less than that of
Pen 4. Eastwood & Partners Drawing No 8945/lA dated 16/4/87 showed The
capacity of Pen 3 to be greater than that of Pen 4.

5.3 Our revised maximum allowable      combined capacity of 1,693 persons for the
two central 'pens' was 83% of that     initially calculated by RLSD, solely on the
basis of the area of Pens 3 and 4,     and was 77% of that shown on Eastwood &
Partners Drawing No 8945/lA, dated     16/4/87.

5.4 Our calculation of the revised capacities of Pens 3 and 4 did not include
any reduction that might be needed to compensate for some departures from the
Guide's recommendations in these 'pens'. These departures were associated
with:

(i)     the   width of the terrace steps.
(ii)    the   distance of persons from gangways or exits;
(iii)   the   heights of crush barriers;
(iv)    the   alignment of gaps in the rows of crush barriers;
(v)     the   width of gaps in the rows of crush barriers;
(vi)    the   width of the gates in the perimeter fence;

It is our opinion that the revised number of 1,693 persons for the maximum
combined capacity of Pens 3 and 4 should be reduced further because of these
six departures from the Guide's recommendations.

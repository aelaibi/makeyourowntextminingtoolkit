               Hi 1 l s b o r o u g h .

               After      the      briefing          at       Hillsborough             I was       detailed         to   serial     31    under
                                                                    T rT T oS
               th e    supervision             of P S 2 8 8 1          Pearson.           At    approximately             1 0 . 3 0 ani I t o ok

               up my      p o s i t i o n at        the       roundabout          j u n c t i on    of L e p p i n g s    Lane,     Halifax

               Road,      Herries           Road and Pennistone                      R o a d a nd w a s       in    company with          PC       1934

               Smith       in f r o n t       of a n a r e a          of w a s t e     ground.

               At     this    location           th e      majority         of    people        were    Liverpool           fans.        On

               several        occasions             I was          approached          by L i v e r p o o l    fans      who   wished         to

               know either              where       to     go      in the       ground,        whether        any    public       houses       were

               open and           on    occasions             if    I had any          spare       tickets         for   sale.

               I advised           them      that        no     public      houses        were      open and         if t h e y    did    not

have      a ticket             they      should           leave        t he   vicinity              of H i l l s b o r o u g h .           The

majority           of    the       fans       t ha t      I saw        had    either           been       drinking             or w e r e

carrying           b e er      cans      and were              drinking         out       of     them.          I would           not      say

that      the      fans       were       drunk         but      were      in v e r y       high          spirits.

From a p p r o k imately                 1■30        pm    I was        aware       of a         large         number          of L i v e r p o o l

fans      looking            for      tickets          c l os e      to w h e r e     I was          st o o d .

I spoke          to a C h i e f          Inspector              and asked           him what              to    do a b o u t         the    youths

who      we re     carrying             alcohol.               He a d v i s ed me          to a l l o w         them       t h r o u g h as

At    2.00       pm a        la r g e    number           of    supporters            past          my    location             presumably

from      the      t ra i n .       These        were          accompanied            by o n l y a b o u t            20       police.              From

t hi s    t i me    onwards             the    volume           of     supporters              grew       to    thousands             and       I

noticed          the     fans       who       had      been       looking          f or    tickets             walk       down with          the

swelling           numbers            to H i l l s b o r o u g h .

At    approximately                 2.30       pm the           traffic        travelling                 down Leppings                 Lane         was

halted       by m y s e l f         and       PC S m i t h        on    the    order           of P S P e a r s o n .

At    approx imately 3.00                      pm Le ppi ngs L a n e                was        full       of    supporters              over         a

thousand           in m y        estimation and                   seemed        to come          f r o m th e        direction             of

Halifax          Road.           At     about        the       same      time      Io v e r h e a r d      on        a    radio       t h a t s om e

Inspector           c a me      past       our       location and              told        us       to    go    to L e p p i n g s         Lane

and      on arrival              at     Leppings           Lane        I saw a large                number           of L i v e r p o o l f a ns

who      were      upset         and      hurling          abuse         at   Police           Officers.

As    I went        through             gate     C     I saw several                bodies           with       people          trying          to

render       first           aid.        I then           helped        to m o v e        injured          people          outside          the,

gates.           A young           lady       then        came       to me a n d          asked          for    hel p.          I together

a young          female         with       c h e st       injuries,           as    we     carried             her       across       the

holding          area        the L i v e r p o o l         fans        refused        to       get       out    of       our    way

although           we    s h o u t e d at        t h e m we w e r e           forced           to    knock        them         out    of    the

           way.

           An    Inspector        attempted         to    t ak e   charge      of     the    situation and              ordered

           myself       and    other      officers        to    form a     barrier          to   shield          the   d e a d.        I

           received a great               de al    of a b u s e    from    the L i v e r p o o l       fans.

           A short        while      later    after       the a r r i v a l    of     fire a m b u l a n c e       services            the

           dead     and    injured        began     to    be m o v e d    from      the     scene.

           A Superintendent               then     deployed        our    serial       on L e p p i n g s        Lane and         we       were

           directed        to m o v e     people     away       to a l l o w   the     ground         to    clear a n d        for

           access       for    emergency          services.

           As    th e L i v e r p o o l   fans     left    the     ground      I received a                lot    of a b u s e      for

           what     had occurred.             We    were       instructed        to    remain         calm a nd m ak e            no

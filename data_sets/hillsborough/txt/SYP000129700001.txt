Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                      Emergency Lighting System
         In going through our accounts, our auditors have pointed
out that we have not vent an account for our work associated with
the emergency lighting system and battery tests carried out in
■1985.   ■
         Our fees account is enclosed.   Please accept our apologies
for not having sent it sooner.
         We will bring you up to date with the background to the
emergency lighting when we meet.

For the attention of Mr J.A.Strange                                28 November 1985


Dear John

               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
                           Battery Test

          As requested I attended at the above grounds on
Thursday afternoon 21 November 1985 to observe a test of the
emergency   lighting   batteries,  which was carried out in
collaboration with Sandas Batteries.
          The test consisted of activating all the emergency
lights served by the central      battery system, and observing
voltage and current readings over a three hour period.       In
addition hydrometer and voltage readings were taken of some
individual cells which had previously showed lower than normal
voltages, so that they could be closely monitored for impending
failure.
          The   voltmeter built in to the panel was very
inaccurate, reading approximately 82% of the true value.     For
convenience this meter was used during the test, but was
checked at intervals against an accurate reference meter.    The
true or corrected readings are shown alongside in the table.
          The test showed that the system was able to maintain
the actual voltage within the required 10% of the nominal value
over a three hour period.   This was  so despite the complete
failure of one cell      (no 24) after two hours.  The remaining
cells all appeared-to be in sound condition after the test.
             ciuAH>r     .

Whilst              give guarantees, it seems unlikely from this
test that there will be a large number of cell failures in the
next year or two.

          This battery installation has now been in use for
approximately 30 years, which is as long as might be expected,
but it is not unknown for such cells to last up to 40 years.
So there would seem to be no case for condemning           the
installation until   there are definite signs of widespread
deterioration.

           When the new east     stand is built the additional
emergency lighting will      impose an increase in load of about
30%.    These alterations    sometimes involve other upgrading
activities,      so it may be prudent to expect a load increase of
up to 40%.     This will have slightly disproportionate effect on
the available duration which could drop to about 60%.         This
would     give something over one and a half hours capacity from
the batteries in their present condition, which suggests that
they would easily satisfy the Fire           Authority's presumed
requirement of one hour's duration for some time to come.
          I believe that at one time it was agreed that half an
hour's duration would be acceptable for this installation,
until such time as the batteries were replaced, though I cannot
find any confirmation of this on the services files.
           It is obviously desirable on economic grounds to
retain any concession, so that the usable battery life is
maximised.      We should therefore not do anything to encourage
the authority to expect the full three hour duration specified
in BS 5266 and recommended by the 'Green Code'.

                        Yours Sincerely

 Dear Bill,
                                 Ref:       Emergency Limiting System

Many thanks for your letter dated 22nd October.

 My thoughts are that we should ask Sandas Batteries to undertake
 two tests. One in private to ascertain the current capabilities
 of the system and the second with the presence of the Fire Service,
 having rectified any anomalies which may have shown themselves
 in the first test.

 Before proceeding I would be obliged of your observations at your
 earliest convenience particularly in view of the termination of
 B.S.T. this weekend.

 Tours sincerely,

Dear         ,
                        emergency Lighting System
       Mr.        of Sandas Batteries has been in touch with
us about the capability of the emergency lighting system.
       The 'Green Guide’ suggest.s that the system should be capable
of maintaining the necessary level of illumination for a period
of three hours. We feel that this is far too onerous and we      have
been lead to believe by the Fire Service that they would be
prepared to accept one hour.    In fact, if I recall correctly
the period agreed with S.Y.C.C. at the time your Certificate
was prepared was for 40 minutes until the batteries heed replacing
after which a longer period would be provided.
       We understand that you   may ask Sandas to run a test     onthe
batteries in which case the Fire Officerhas asked that he be
notified of the date so that he may be present during the test.
Perhaps ycru would keep us informed of progress so that we can
tell Fire Officer Ron Grimshaw when the test Us to be.


                             Yours sincerely.

Dear ;Dick, .
                      Emergency Lighting System
     Many thanks for your note concerning the report on the
batteries by chloride,
     I suggest that we wait a few weeks until we have really
dark conditions in mid-evening.       I will then arrange for a
test to be carried out to see whether the emergency lights
last for the full time required by the green book.       If they
do not we will prepare a little report on what should be done.
However I suspect that an emergency generator will be a cheaper
solution rather than buying a complete new set of batteries.
The generator should also have a longer life than the batteries
and it will also be possible to build in a little extra capacity,
should you so wish.      This would mean that you could be
independent of power cuts in the areas under the South stand.
It would even be possible to have a generator large enough to
take over the load for lighting the pitch but that would be
much more expensive and you may think it not worthwhile.


                               Yours sincerely,

     Dear Dr. Eastwood,

     EMERGENCY LIGHTING SYSTEM

     Chloride have again advised us that we require to replace the
     entire system following their inspection in July 1985.

     Please advise whether or not in your opinion this is a sales
     exercise or a serious recommendation having observed substantial
     faults.

     Yours sincerely,



     R. H^Chester,
     Secretary.

Dear Tony,
     I enclose a copy of a letter from Dick Chester concerning
the batteries for the emergency lighting system at
Hillsborough together with a copy of my reply.
     I should be glad if you could help us by carrying out
a test and also writing a report on future action.
     John Strange is also likely to need your help in altering
the existing emergency lighting when the new roof over the
Kop is constructed next summer.   Perhaps you would be so good
as to contact John on both matters.


                     Yours sincerely,

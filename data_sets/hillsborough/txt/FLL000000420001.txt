HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

I refer to the submission which you and the Football Association
put forward for Part II of the Inquiry.  Lord Justice Taylor has
read this and has asked for clarification on the following
points

i.    He would like to know more about the merits of the arguments
       on transfer fees outlined in paragraph 5.26.  In particular,
      what is the source of the money originally used in the
       example? Also, there seems to be some disparity between the
       amount raised in transfer fees and the amount spent on
       ground improvement.  Are there any reasons for this other
       than the argument that the present system gives strong
       fiscal inducements to clubs to spend on players rather than
       improvements?

ii.   Do the Football Association and Football League fund safety
       at football grounds at present and how would they expect to
       see safety improvements funded in the future?

iii. Has a joint organisation to run football, embracing the
     Football Association and the Football League, ever been
      considered? What are the issues involved?

I look forward to your reply in due course.   I have sent a letter
in similar terms to the Football Association.

      Dear Sirs,

      RE:      HILLSBOROUGH: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY

      I enclose a copy of the letter dated 31 July 1998 from the Legal Advisor to the Hillsborough
      Family Support group.

      In correspondence with HFSG, I have indicated that the Crown Prosecution Service intends
      to be as fair and open in its handling of this matter as possible. They have indicated that
      they have no objection to disclosure of their correspondence to us, provided they are supplied
      with copies of correspondence to the CPS from the solicitors for the defendants and South
      Yorkshire Police.

      I propose to supply them with copies unless you indicate that you object to doing so.



      Yours faithfully,




      Christopher H. Enzor

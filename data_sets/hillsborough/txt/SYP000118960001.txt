            duty      at W o o d s e a t s      PoliceStation.                   I arrived              at the g r o u n d a n d            was

            directed           to m y     serial,          no.     11.      Sergeant              Edwards       2279      of H a c k e n t h o r p e

            and     Inspector           Woodward           were      in     charge.           I was       deployed           at     North

            Stand,        upp#V                i d o..Â£ on    crowd         control.

            At    approximately                3    p'.'m'. < 1500),         the     crowd         became       more      intense         and

            were     complaining               of a      turnstile           crush        ouside         the    gates        at     Leppings

            Lane     end.        By     this        time     lots      of        people were             pouring        in.        At 3 . 0 3     p.m.

            (1503)        I arrested               a youth        named                           'or    being     drunk and incapable

            inside        the    ground and              t o ok    him      to    the     Police         Room     situated            under       the

            N o r t h Stand.            After        documenting             etc.       of    the       prisoner,         I left         the

            Police        Room.         It w a s       approximately 3.15                     p.m.       (1515)        all    I     saw were

            bodies, mostly                d e a d , l ai d        on a d v e r t i s i n g        boards       being      rushed         into         the

            gym     opposite          the      Police        Roo m .                                                                              '   .     '


            I decided           that      it w as        pointless               t r y i n g to     fight      against            the c r o w d       to

            return        to    the N o r t h S t a n d ,          upper         corridor,          and      instead         w e n t into         the

            gym     to a s s i s t .        Once       inside        I was        called          to a y o u t h       by a n o t h e r

            officer        who     wa s     giving         mouth       to    mouth,          to    take     over       external          chest

            c o m p r e s s i o n as      it       seemed      there        was    a slight             pulse     on    the       youth.

            After       about      15 m i n u t e s        a doctor          assessed             that     it w a s     pointless,              the
                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                       R237

  youth    was       dehad.         He   was    aged approximately               20 y e a r s ,     d ar k    brown        hair,

  jeans    and       blue     shirt.           The    other    officer,         wh o    I did      not    know,       stayed
                                                                                                                I-
  with    the       body.

  I then       continued            assisting         the   medics       with    various          casualties          in the

  gym    until       a ll    the     casualties         had    gone.         I then      joined      my      serial,

  those    of w h o m        I could       find,       on   the      North    Stand,       seated        area   where        we

  had    been       told     to     congregate.

  At    7.13    p.m.        (19-15)      that    evening,         I arrived         back    at    Woodseats           and

  went    off       duty.

  I sa w a      lot     of    people       that       day   t h at    had    been      drinking      and      smelled

  highly       of    intoxicants.               They    were      very      upset      by t h e   actions       outside

  the    gates an d          th e    overall         feeling      was    that    of     discontentment               and

  frustration.

         HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY




         Thank you for ycur memorandum of the 26th July with the
         interim report on the financial costs to the Council of the
         Hillsborough tragedy.    I will come back to you on how that
         might be included within the comprehensive report when I
         have a clearer idea as to how that report will look.

         In the meantime would you have a further look at paragraph 4
         of your report and consider whether it is appropriate for
         that sort of inf ormation -to be made available in a report,
         which I imagine will become public, when negotiations are
         still continuing between the Police Authority and the Home
         Office.     I have been hearing verbal reports from Bob
         Johnston and others at South Yorkshire Joint Consultative
         Committee meetings and clearly effort are still being made
         to try to avoid any of the Inquiry costs falling on South
         Yorkshire.   I have heard other figures than £5M used as the
         estimated cost and it may be inappropriate to refer to the
         "West Midlands Police Inquiry" as the South Yorkshire line
         is that the Home Secretary decided that the West Midlands
         Police should make their report to the Taylor Inquiry.      I
         think this paragraph should be cleared with

             As requested by the Policy Committee of the 23rd May, I have prepared
             an interim report on the financial costs to the City Council of the
             Hillsborough Tragedy, which I have attached.

             Could you let me know if you wish to include this within the comprehensive
             report you were asked to arrange or if you feel my report should go to
             CoiKnittee separately.

THE FINANCIAL COST TO THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY
- INTERIM REPORT OF THE CITY TREASURER__________________________ __


1.   This report deals with the costs incurred by Council Departments as a
     result of the Hillsborough Tragedy.

2.   The attached statement attributes the cost to three main aspects - The
     operational costs of the disaster itself; the conduct of the inquiry and,
     thirdly^ongoing costs.

3.   It will be seen that most of the expenditure has already been incurred on
     the first two iteas and latest estimated total costs for the Inquiry^
     which the Home Office will reimburse, is £125,950 whilst for the disaster
     the figure is £58,710. At this stage we can be less certain on the level
     of ongoing costs arising from the Coroner's Inquests and the special
     social work task tesa but the best estimate *is around £250,000. In view
     of the nature of sone of the ongoing costs, it may be possible toobtain
     a contribution fros the Hillsborough Trust towards some of these and
     members are asked to indicate if they would like this course of action to
     be pursued.

4.   A further area of costs that will have the greatest impact, although not
     directly chargeable, is the West Midlands Police Inquiry. It is
     understood that this cost, at present estimated at around £5m., will be
     recharged to the South Yorkshire Police Authority and will not be
     reckonable for the normal Home Office Grant. In lieu of this, a
     government contribution of just under £lm. has been offered, leaving the
     balance to be met by the precept on the South Yorkshire District
     Councils. Discussions are continuing with the Home Office seeking a more
     generous contribution but; even given this, a substantial part of this
     expenditure will be precepted on Sheffield.

5.   A further report will be submitted to Committee when more information is
     available on the ongoing costs and the West Midlands Police charges.

      REPORT OF ACTING HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION & LEGAL DEPARTMENT CONCERNING
      SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS TO SPECIAL MEETING OF THE MUNICIPAL ENTERPRISE
      AND GENERAL SERVICES COMMITTEE

1.    Purpose of Report

      To update members upon the action taken as a result of the Inquiry of Lord
      Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough Disaster and to enable members to
      give consideration to further action which is required. This report
      contains a summary of the action which has been taken so far and
      enumerates a number of issues which require views from members.

2.    Summary of Action Taken            ' — • ----------

2.1   Following the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report on the
       4th August, 1989, copies of the Report were made available in the Members
      Library.

2.2   A copy of the Interim recommendations contained in the Report is attached
       at Appendix A. The items marked with an asterisk required implementation
       prior to commencement of the football season.

2.3   Immediately after publication of the Report, the Acting Head of the
       Administration & Legal Department wrote to Sheffield Wednesday Football
       Club, Sheffield United Football Club and Sheffield Sports Stadium asking
       for confirmation of the action they had taken to activate those
       recommendations.

2.4   The Acting Head of the Administration & Legal Department also wrote to the
      Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor and the Director of Health
      & Consumer Services for their views upon the interim recommendations and
      the action which needed to be taken as a matter of urgency.

2.5   On the 9th August, it became known that a pre-season match was taking
      place at Sheffield United Club. To regulate the position, the Chief
      Executive, in the absence of the Acting Head of the Administration and
      Legal Department, issued an interim Safety Certificate to the Club. This
      contained basic safety provisions and also made specific reference to the
      interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor, which required
      implementation forthwith.

2.6   The Chief Executive also issued a Notice of Amendment in respect of the
      certificate issued to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to reflect the
      items which needed immediate implementation pursuant to Lord Justice
      Taylor's interim recommendations.

2.7   The action of the Chief Executive was approved by the General Purposes
      Panel on the 17th August. The General Purposes Panel also approved
      further amendments relating to the use of the North Stand at Sheffield
      Wednesday Football Club and the use of the North West Terrace at Sheffield
      Wednesday Football Club. A copy of the resolution of the General Purposes
      Panel is attached at Appendix 2.

2.8   Most of the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor have been
      implemented. The following paragraph provides more detail about this.

3.     Implementation of Recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor

       Revised capacities have been calculated and the appropriate
       reduction made. Arrangements have been made to count the number of
       spectators entering each self-contained area. Written agreements have
been entered into with both the Football Clubs and the Police setting out
responsibilities for crowd safety and control and the filling of terraces.
JStewarding arrangements have been improved in accordance with Lord Justice
Taylor's interim recommendations. Gates in radial or perimeter fences
have been painted in a distinctive colour. The Football Clubs have
 confirmed that gates to the pitch will be kept open during specified
activities. Police Officers have been allocated in respect of each
perimeter fence. Cutting equipment has been made available. Inspections
 of crush barriers have taken place and arrangements are in hand for
 replacement of those affected by corrosion. The question of layout of
barriers has also been addressed. The Clubs have also inspected
 turnstiles. Signposting has been reviewed-and also the information
printed on tickets. Police planning has also been revised and the
co-ordination of emergency facilities. The first aid and medical
 facilities as required in recommendations 39 to 42 of Lord Justice Taylor
have also been effected. Members should, however, note that a
 satisfactory response has not been received from Sheffield Sports Stadium
 concerning these general safety issues.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
(a)    Revised capacities for calculation have been made in accordance
       with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide and a deduction of 15$ made to
        improve the safety margin. The revised capacity is reflected in
        the notice of amendment of the Safety Certificate. Thus,
        recommendations 1 and 2 of Lord Justice Taylor have been
        implemented.

(b)     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have indicated that they propose
         to limit the number of spectators entering each self contained pen
         or area using a computer system. The detail of this is provided in
         the agreement they have entered into with the Police in accordance
         with recommendation 4 of Lord Justice Taylor. It is not clear from
         this how they propose to achieve a closing of access to the pen or
         area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached. The Acting
         Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to the Club on
         the 16th August for clarification of this matter. Response has not
         yet been received.

(c)     A copy of the agreement between the Club and the Police as required
         by recommendation 4 is attached.

(d)     In accordance with recommendation 5, the Club have agreed to
         appoint stewards on the perimeter track for the purpose of checking
         crowd conditions for possible overcrowding or distress. There will
         be a need to revise the Safety Certificate to reflect the new
         levels of stewarding.

(e)     Discussions between the Football Club and Police are taking place
         and training sessions to ensure that officers and stewards are
         fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of crowd
         densities, signs of distress and crowd dynamics. There is a need
         for enquiry to be made as to the full details of this.

(f)     In accordance with recommendation 7, the gates and perimeter fences
         have been painted in a different colour from the rest of the fence
         and marked "emergency exit".

(g)-*   In accordance with recommendation 8, the requirement for perimeter
         fence gates to remain open during specified activities has been
         made a condition of the Safety Certificate. Sheffield Wednesday
         Football Club have also confirmed that this will be done.
In accordance with recommendation 9, the   Club have confirmed that a
Police Officer will be stationed at each   gate in the fence and will
be easily identifiable by the stewards.    He will be able to make
contact with the Police Control Room and   will be in control of that
gate.

In accordance with recommendation 10, the provision of cutting
equipment has been made a condition of the Safety Certificate. The
Club have also indicated that they have provided four sets of bolt
cutters. Two sets will be dispersed at each fence area, stored in
boxes, clearly marked "emergency equipment". The stewards for each
area will be trained in_the_use of this equipment and it will be
the policy of the Club to ensure each steward is regularly deployed
in the same area with the same responsibilities.

In accordance with recommendation 11, the Club have confirmed that
crush barriers have been inspected and that those showing signs of
corrosion will be repaired or replaced. The Acting Head of
Administration and Legal Department has written to the Club asking
for the details of inspections and details of which barriers have
been repaired or replaced. Site meetings have been arranged with
the Building Surveyors, the Fire Service and Environmental Health
Officers in order that further progress can be made in this area.

In accordance with recommendation 12, site meetings have been
arranged with all interested parties to discuss this complex
matter.

In accordance with recommendation 18, the turnstiles have been
inspected. The Club has provided a report of the examination.
This is attached. The Club have also provided statistics assessed
by the Health and Safety Executive which assess the potential rate
of flow. It must be appreciated that this is purely speculative
and further steps will have to be taken to undertake further tests.
This will be essential to ensure compliance with recommendation 19-
The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to the
Club on the 17th August asking for this information for the third
time. It has not yet been supplied.

No action has been taken, as far the Acting Head of Administration -
and Legal Department' is aware to install closed circuit
television.

In accordance with recommendation 22, the signposting has been
reviewed. An inspection has been undertaken by the Chief Licensing
Officer who confirmed that it complied with recommendation 22.

In accordance with recommendation 23, the Club have confirmed that
the printing of tickets has been reviewed and styled in accordance
with the recommendation. A copy has not yet been supplied.

In accordance with recommendation 24, the Club have confirmed that
tickets will be printed with the request that spectators should be
in position not later than 45 minutes before -commencement of the
game.

Recommendation 25 has not yet been addressed from the point of viev
of the Local Authority.

In accordance with recommendation 26, Mr. P. Hayes, Deputy Chief
Constable has been designated as the Senior Officer.
(s)    With reference to recommendation 35, the Police and Ambulance
        Services have nominated senior officers. Enquiries will need to be
        made to establish the proposed liaison. Essentially, the
        co-ordination of emergency services is a matter for those
        Authorities.

(t)    The requirements of recommendation 39 have been incorporated in the
        amended Safety Certificate. The requirement to employ a medical
        practitioner in accordance with recommendation 41 has also been
        made a condition of the Certificate. The Club have confirmed that
        both these recommendations will be implemented. Similarly, it has
        been made a condition of the revised Safety Certificate that one
        fully equipped ambulance where a crowd of 5,000 or more is
        anticipated shall be in attendance. Again, this has been confirmed
        by the Club. It will be necessary for the Local Authority to take
        the advice of the Ambulance and Emergency Services to ensure that
        compliance with recommendations 40 and 43 is achieved.

Sheffield United Football Club

(a)    A revised calculation of the capacity in accordance with
        recommendations 1 and 2 have been made by the Building Surveyor and
        incorporated in the interim Safety Certificate issued to the Club.

(b)    The Club proposes to use the computerised counting system to limit
        the number of spectators entering each terraced area to comply with
        recommendation 3. When the number of spectators admitted to any of
        the terraced area reaches within 10$ of the capacity figure, the
        computer monitor operator will inform Police Control who will take
        the appropriate action to close down the necessary turnstiles. The
        Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department has written to
        the Club seeking exact details of the procedures to be followed.
        They responded on the 21st August indicating that the computer
        monitor operator will inform Police Control by telephone and Police
        Officers will then be given instructions to instruct the turnstile
        operator to close down the necessary turnstiles. Consideration
        will need to be given as to whether or not this is the best
        practical means of ensuring that the terrace is closed off before
        its maximum capacity is reached.

(c)     In accordance with recommendation 4, the Club has supplied a copy
      - of the written agreement with the Police setting out
         responsibilities for crowd safety and control.

(d)    In accordance with recommendation 5, the Club have indicated that
        they propose to deploy six crowd safety stewards on the perimeter
        track to monitor specific areas for possible overcrowding and
        distress. It will be necessary to revise the stewarding figures in
        the Safety Certificate to reflect this fact.

(e)    With reference to recommendation 6 that Police Officers and
        stewards are briefed and trained with regard to recognition of
        crowd densities and signs of distress, I have not had any
        information to the effect that action has been taken to implement
        this recommendation.

(f)    With reference to recommendation 7, the perimeter fence gates have
        been removed at Sheffield United Football Club. The Club have
        painted the frame of the gate in a different colour and erected
        emergency exit signs above each gate. The Chief Licensing Officer
        has inspected this.
To comply with recommendation 9, the Club have confirmed that
Police Officers will be provided as required and their identity
known to stewards and other officers in the vicinity. The Police
Officers will have radios to make contact with the Control Room.
It should be noted that the agreement entered into with the Police
also deals with stewarding aspects.

To comply with recommendation 10, the Club have confirmed that they
will provide four bolt croppers. These will be used by stewards of
the Club. The Club have asked the Fire Service to provide
instructions for stewards in their use.

In accordance with recommendations 11 and 12, the Club have- — • ——
supplied a letter from their Consultant Engineer, Messrs. Eastwood
and Partners who have confirmed that a visual inspection of the
barriers has been carried out. The letter confirms that some
rusting has occurred but that none of the barriers is sufficiently
infected by rust for it to be necessary to carry out emergency
strengthening or replacement before commencement of the football
season. They also confirmed that a review of barriers has revealed
that in some places they do not comply fully with the criteria in
the Green Guide and that drawings are being prepared showing the
extra barriers which will be required so that tenders can be
invited. This matter will need to be given full consideration by
the Building Surveyor and Fire Service and a further report
supplied to members in due course.

With reference to recommendation 18, the Club have instructed an
independent turnstile servicing company to carry out an inspection.
A copy of their report has not been supplied.

In considering recommendation 19, the Club have responded as
follows: "I can confirm that the correlation between the viewing
areas of the Spion Kop (southern end), New South Stand, John Street
Stand and Terraces and the turnstiles serving those areas is such
that all spectators intended to be admitted to those areas can pass
through within one hour. In the Bramall Lane End Stand arid Terrace
areas on the Spion Kop (main area) servicing is necessary to some
turnstiles before this criteria can be met. We hope to complete
the work prior to the start of the season on the 22nd August but if
this is not possible, will reduce the capacity in those areas
accordingly and inform you prior to the game taking place". This
matter has been referred to the Building Surveyor and the Fire
Service for their comment for independent checks to be made.

I have no information that closed circuit television has been
installed.

The Club have confirmed that the signposting has been reviewed in
accordance with recommendation 22. The Chief Licensing Officer has
also inspected the ground and confirmed that this is the case.

The Club has supplied a copy of their current tickets which seem to
conform with recommendation 23.

The Club do not request supporters to be in their places by a
specified time.

The comments made in relation to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
are equally pertinent to Sheffield United. This is also the case
concerning the recommendations pertinent to co-ordination of
               emergency services.

      (q)      To comply with recommendation 39, the Club have confirmed that they
               have made arrangements with the St. John Ambulance Brigade to
               ensure at least one trained First Aider for 1,000 spectators is in
               attendance. This has been made a condition of the interim safety
               certificate.

      (r)      With reference to recommendation 40, consultation with need to take
               place with the Ambulance Service and other appropriate
               professionals to discuss this recommendation.'

      (s)      The Club have confirmed that they will employ a medical
               practitioner in accordance with the provisions of recommendation
                41. This is also a condition of the Safety Certificate. The Club
               have not confirmed that he is trained and competent in advanced
               First Aid. Again, this is a matter which needs to be taken up with
                the appropriate professionals.

      (t)      With reference to recommendation 42, the Club have confirmed that
               they have made arrangements with the Ambulance Authority for the
               necessary ambulance cover. Again, this is a provision in the
                interim Safety Certificate.

      (u)      With reference to recommendation 43, this is a matter which will
                require consultation by the Local Authority with the appropriate
                professional bodies.

3.3   Sheffield Sports Stadium

      The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to Sheffield
      Sports Stadium asking for the proposals on the implementation of the
      interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor. The Club have not
      provided the necessary details. The Building Surveyor, the Fire Service
      and Environmental Health Officers are to visit the Sports Stadium to
      undertake a detailed inspection of the Ground with a view to establishing
      whether or not it is safe for the admission of spectators. The Acting
      Head of Administration and Legal Department has written to the Sports
      Stadium indicating that unless a satisfactory response is received to our
      letter seeking their proposals for implementation of the interim
      recommendations, then the Council have no choice but to consider issuing a
      prohibition notice relating to the premises. It is anticipated that a
      full report will be made to the General Purposes Panel at the end of
      September once the members of the Advisory Group have reported back
      following their inspections.

4.    Matters for Consideration

4.1   Visits

      At its meetings on the 17tti August, the General Purposes Panel stated an
      intention to visit all sports grounds with the City. All three Clubs have
      been notified of this request and a suitable date for a visit will be
      arranged.

4.2   The function of members in the future.

      It is clearly essential that there»is a tightening up of existing
      procedures and a clarification of the terms of reference for dealing with
      the issue of Safety of Sports Grounds. At present, the General Purposes
      Panel has delegated authority to deal with Safety of Sports Grounds
      issues. In the past, matters have been referred to the General Purposes
      Panel for decisions as and when they were necessary. Members have
      indicated an intention to participate more fully in this area; indeed,
      this is required by the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.
      The function of the Advisory Group must be to advise members and assist
      them in providing enough information for members to make an informed and
      rational decision as and when required. The Advisory Group is made up of
      the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor, a representative from
      the Department of Health arid Consumer Services and the Ambulance Service
      since the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor were published.
      Prior to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, the meetings of the Advisory Group
      were not as tightly controlled as they should have been. This has now____
      been improved. Arrangements have already been made for the Acting Head of
      Administration and Legal Department to nominate a senior officer to Chair
      the meetings of the Advisory Group and for full detailed minutes to be
      taken. When the approved departmental structure has been completed, one
      of the new Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department (Legal) will
      undertake the function. It is suggested that one way of members becoming
      more involved in this issue would be for them to be supplied with agendas
      of the meetings prior to the meeting taking place and minutes of meetings
      which have taken place. It is recommended that this is implemented.

4.3   Inspections

      There is a statutory duty upon the local authority to inspect designated
      sports grounds at least on an annual basis. In his interim
      recommendations, Lord Justice Taylor has said that he feels more frequent
      inspections would be of benefit. It is suggested that it may be
      appropriate to undertake quarterly inspections, once during the close
      season, once at the commencement of the season, once in the middle of the
      season and once at the end. This would obviously require a substantial
      devotion of resources. .It is recommended that this is implemented.

4.4   Emergency Procedures

      In the normal course of events, matters will obviously be referred to a
      Sub-Committee of the Council for consideration. The delegated authority
      in respect of these functions is vested the General Purposes Panel.
      Recent events have highlighted the need for a proper emergency system to
      be set up. In view of the fact that the Licensing Department is part of
      the Administration & Legal Department, it would seem logical for this
      emergency delegation to be granted to the Acting Head of Administration &
      Legal Department in consultation with the chair of the General Purposes
      Panel. Members are asked to comment upon this.

4.5   Resources

      The existing structure of the Licensing Section is shown in the attached
      diagram. It consists of a Chief Licensing Officer, a Principal Licensing
      Officer, three Licensing Officers and an Administrative Assistant. The
      Section was originally comprised of five staff which were increased to six
      by the addition of the Administrative Assistant's post in 1986 upon the
      abolition of South Yorkshire County Council. The increase was to take
      account of the additional responsibilities taken on by the Section upon
      abolition of South Yorkshire County Council.

      The Section is responsible for the processing, issuing, monitoring and
      enforcing of numerous licences and consents; for example hackney carriage
      licences and private hire licences, public entertainment licences, cinema
      licences, theatre licences, street collection permits, sex shop permits,
      mini bus licences and the licensing of sports grounds. The work requires
      issues. In the past, matters have been referred to the General Purposes
      Panel for decisions as and when they were necessary. Members have
      indicated an intention to participate more fully in this area; indeed,
      this is required by the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.

Resources

The existing structure of the Licensing Section is shown in the attached
diagram. It consists of a Chief Licensing Officer, a Principal Licensing
Officer, three Licensing Officers and an Administrative Assistant. The
Section was originally comprised of five staff which were increased to six
by the addition of the Administrative Assistant's post in 1986 upon the
abolition of South Yorkshire County Council. The increase was to take
account of the additional responsibilities taken on by the_Section upon
abolition of South Yorkshire County Council.

The Section is responsible for the processing, issuing, monitoring and
enforcing of numerous licences and consents; for example hackney carriage
licences and private hire licences, public entertainment licences, cinema
licences, theatre licences, street collection permits, sex shop permits,
mini bus licences and the licensing of sports grounds. The work requires
a comprehensive knowledge of the relevant legislation and much of the work
is-carried out under delegated powers.

The Effect of the Hillsborough Disaster

This has had repercussions throughout the Section since the Chief
Licensing Officer has been engaged full time since April in dealing with
the Inquiry and subsequently the interim recommendations of Lord Justice
Taylor.

One of the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor is that "each Local
Authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring,
enforcing, reviewing, amending and renewing safety certificates." It is
clear that at present, this requires a substantial devotion of officer
time and that this is likely, to continue indefinitely. Whilst the Chief
Licensing Officer is engaged full time on this task, other important
duties are neglected.

It is clear that further resources need to be devoted to the issue of
safety of sports grounds. It is anticipated that it will require between
75$ and 100$ of one persons time to deal with safety of sports grounds
issues in the short term. This will entail dealing with the existing
designated sports grounds in the City, namely Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club, Sheffield United Football Club and Sheffield Sports Stadium. It is
hoped that by next Spring, a workable and well understood administrative
system will be in effect which should mean that there will be no need to
repeat much of the work which has been done to improve the administrative
systems. However, the World Student Games Facilities are currently under
construction and will have a significant impact in respect of the work on
safety of sports grounds.

It is anticipated that additional staff will be required to fulfill these
functions. A proposed new structure is shown in diagram form and attached
to this report. The proposal is that an additional post of Chief
Licensing Officer with specific responsibility for sports grounds is
created. There i§ also a need for an additional Licensing Officer who
will have direct responsibility to the Chief Licensing Officer for sports
grounds. Also attached to this report are draft job descriptions. In
addition to their specific duties relating to sports grounds, it is
anticipated that these two officers will as and when necessary provide
support to the existing structure which will continue to deal with the
general licensing functions.

The benefits of the changes

The increase in staff should ensure that the Licensing Section can
continue to function efficiently and provide a reasonable level of
service. It should enable the Licensing Section to improve its service
delivery and enable a review of licensing systems to be undertaken, and
proper enforcement of legislation to take place. During the last two
years, it has become clear that the quantity of work carried out within
the Licensing Section has increased. There has been an increase in the
number of private hire vehicle licences issued in particular as well as a
general increase in most areas. The World Student Games Facilities will
also in all probability require public entertainments licences requiring
additional devotion of time from the Licensing Section. In the light of
the Hillsborough Disaster, it is important that a proper allocation of
resources is made and consideration needs to be given to the allocation of
resources and priorities in other areas.
The cost of the proposals

Taking account of the recent pay offer, the cost of implementing the
proposals in a full year will total £26,460, taking account of salaries
and additional costs. Clearly, some of this will be recoverable by way of
licensing fees which can be charged for the issue and amendment of safety
certificates for sports grounds. There is statutory authority to enable
the Council to charge fees for the issue, amendment and transfer of Safety
Certificates. The fee charged must be commensurate with the work actually
and reasonably done. No charge has yet been made for the issue and
amendment of certificate since the first amendment and certificate which
were issued with those issued recently.   The original certificate issued
to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was that which had been issued by the
former County Council. The Acting Head of Administration and Legal
Department has sought the views of the various bodies which have an imput
into Safety of Sports Grounds issues to enable a full discussion to take
place about the levels of charges which should be levied. A full report
will be made to members once further information is available in this
respect. For the future, however, it is anticipated that in accordance
with Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations, certificates will be issued on
an annual basis and thus a charge will be made annually. This charge will
reflect the inspections which take place and the administrative
procedures. There may be a need for additional devotion of resources to
cover the necessary expenditure.

Recommendations

Members are asked

1.     to note the contents of this report and to authorise the creation
       of two additional posts of Chief Licensing Officer and Licensing
       Officer to deal with Safety of Sports Grounds issues subject to the
       proposals being discussed and agreed with the appropriate Trade
       Unions in line with the Council's (Responding to Change) agreement.

To update member^ upon the action taken as a result of the Inquiry of Lord
Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough Disaster and to enable members to
give consideration c-c fur tlier ^action vhich is required. '>is report

Summary of Action Taken

Following the publication of Lord Justice Taylor’s Interim Report on the
4th August, 1989, copies of the Report were made available in the Members
Library.

1 copy of the Interim recommendations contained in the Report is attached
at Appendix A. The items marked with an asterisk required implementation
prior to commencement of the football season.

Immediately after publication of the Report, the Acting Head of the
Administration & Legal Department wrote to Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club, Sheffield United Football Club and Sheffield Sports Stadium asking
for confirmation of the action they had taken to activate those
recommendations.

The Acting Head of the Administration & Legal Department also wrote to the
Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor and the Director of Health
& Consumer Services for their views upon the interim recommendations and
the action which needed to be taken as a matter of urgency.

On the 9th August, it became known that a pre-season match was taking
place at Sheffield United Club. To regulate the position, the Chief
Executive, in the absence of the Acting Head of the Administration and
Legal Department, issued an interim Safety Certificate to the Club. This
contained basic safety provisions and also made specific reference to the
interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor, which required
implementation forthwith.

The Chief Executive also issued a Notice of Amendment in respect of the.
certificate issued to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to reflect the
items which needed immediate implementation pursuant to Lord Justice
Taylor'3 interim recommendations.

The action of the Chief Executive was approved by the General Purposes
Panel on the 17th August. The General Purposes Panel also approved
further amendments relating to the use of the North Stand at Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club and the use of the Sorth West Terrace at Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club, A copy of the resolution of the General Purposes
Panel is attached at Appendix 2.

Most of the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor have been
implemented. The following paragraph provides more detail about this.

Implementation of Recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor

Revised capacities have been calculated and the appropriate
reduction made. Arrangements nave been made to count the number of
spectator-' entering each self-contained area. Written agreements have
been entered into with both the Football"Clubs and: the Police setting ou;
responsibilities for crowd safety and control and the. filling of terraces
Stewarding arrangements have been improved in accordance with Lord Justice
Taylor's interim recommendations. Gates in radial or perimeter fences
have been painted in a distinctive colour. The Football Clubs have
confirmed that gates to the pitch will be kept open during specified
activities. Police Officers have been allocated in respect of each
perimeter fence. Cutting equipment has been made available.;' Inspections
of crush barriers have taken-''"place and'arrangements..'are;*.In hand for
replacement of those affected by" corrosibriift The question, of layout of
barriers has also been addressed. The Clubs have also inspected'
turnstiles. Signposting has been reviewed and also the information
printed on tickets. Police planning has also been revised and the
co-ordination of emergency facilities. The first aid and medical
facilities as required in recommendations 39 to 42 of Lord Justice Taylor
have also been effected. Members should, however, note that a
satisfactory response has not been received from Sheffield Sports Stadium
concerning these general safety issues.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
(a)    Revised capacities for calculation have been made in accordance
        with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide and a deduction of 15* made to
        improve the safety margin. The revised capacity is reflected in
        the notice of amendment of the Safety Certificate. Thus,
        recommendations 1 and 2 of Lord Justice Taylor have been
        implemented.

(b)       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have indicated that they propose
           to limit the number of spectators entering each self contained pen
           or area using a computer system. The detail of this is provided in
 r";. ,A ,,the agreement they have entered into with the Police in accordance
-:;;j->ith recommendation 4 of Lord Justice Taylor. It is not clear from
     J     this how they propose to achieve a closing of access to the pen or
           area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached. The Acting
           Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to the Club on
'^.,3     the 16th August for clarification of this matter. Response has not
           yet been received.

(c)       A copy of the agreement between the Club and the Police as required
           by recommenda'tion 4 is attached.

(d)       In accordance with recommendation 5, the Club have agreed to
           appoint stewards on the perimeter track for the purpose of checking
           crowd conditions for possible overcrowding or distress. There will
           be a need to revise the Safety Certificate to reflect the new
           levels of stewarding-.

    (e)   Discussions between the Football Club and Police are taking place
          and training sessions to ensure that officers and stewards are
           fully briefed an<} trained with regard to the recognition of crowd
          .densities, signs of distress and crowd dynamics. There is a need
s         for enquiry to be made as to the full details of this.

    (f)   In accordance with recommendation 7, the gates and perimeter fences
          have been painted in a different colour from the rest of the fence
           and marked "emergency exit".

    (g)   In accordance with recommendation 8, the requirement for perimeter
          fence gates to remain open during specified activities has been
          made a condition of the Safety Certificate. Sheffield Wednesday
          Football Club have also confirmed that this will be done.

                      In accordance with recommendation 9, the Club have confirmed that a
                      Police Officer will be stationed at each gate in the fence and will
                      be easily identifiable by the stewards, ■ He will be able to make
                      contact with the Police Control Room and will be in control of that
                      gate.

              (i)     In accordance with recommendation 1Qr the provision of cutting
                      equipment has been made a condition of the Safety Certificate.  The
                      Club have also indicated that they have provided four sets of bolt
                      cutters. Two sets will be dispersed at each fence area, stored in
                      boxes, clearly marked "emergency equipment*. The stewards for each
                      area will be trained in the use of this equipment and it will be
                      the policy of the Club to ensure each steward is regularly deployed
                      in the same area with the same responsibilities.

              (j)      In accordance with recommendation 11, the Club have confirmed that
                      crush barriers have been inspected and that those showing signs of
                      corrosion will be repaired or replaced. The Acting Head of
                      Administration and Legal Department has written to the Club asking
                      for the details of inspections and details of which barriers have
                      been repaired or replaced. Site meetings have been arranged with
                      the Building Surveyors, the Fire Service and Environmental Health
                      Officers in order that further progress can be made in this area.

              (k)     In accordance with recommendation 12, site meetings have been
                      arranged with all interested parties to discuss this complex
                      matter.

              :d       In accordance with recommendation 18, the turnstiles have been
                       inspected. The Club has provided a report of the examination.
                       This is attached. The Club have also provided statistics assessed
                       by the Health and Safety Executive which assess the potential rate
                       of flow. It must be appreciated that this is purely speculative
                       and further steps will have to be taken to undertake further tests.
                       This will be essential to ensure compliance with recommendation 19•
                       The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to the
         ■v           jClub on the 17th August asking for this information for the third
                       time. It has not yet been supplied.

              (m)     No action has' been taken, as far the Acting Head of Administration
                      and Legal Department is aware to install closed circuit
                      television.

              (n)     In accordance with recommendation 22, the signposting has been
                      reviewed. An inspection has been undertaken by the Chief Licensing
                      Officer who confirmed that it complied with recommendation 22.

              (o) ,   In accordance with recommendation 23, the Club have confirmed that
                      the printing of tickets has been reviewed and styled in accordance
                      with the recommendation. A copy has not yet been supplied.

              (p)     In accordance with recommendation 24, the Club have confirmed that
                      tickets will be printed with the request that spectators should be
                      in position not later than 45 minutes before commencement of the
                      game.

              (q)     Recommendation 25 has not yet been addressed from ;he point of view
                      of the Local Authority.

                       In accordance with recommendation 26, Mr, P, Hayes, Deputy Chief
                       Constable has been designated as the Senior Officer,




                               mstsmxAj: :
            (s)    . With reference to recommendation 35, the Police and Ambulance
                     Services have nominated senior officers. Enquiries will need to be
                     made to establish the proposed liaison. Essentiallyf the
                     co-ordination of emergency services is a matter for those
                     Authorities.

            (t)     The requirements of recommendation 39 have been incorporated in the
                    amended Safety Certificate. ■ The requirement to employ a medical
                    practitioner in accordance with recommendation 41 h*3 also been
                    made a condition of the Certificate. The Club have confirmed that
                    both these recommendations will be implemented. Similarly, it has
                     been made a condition of the revised Safety Certificate that one
                     fully equipped ambulance where a crowd of 5,000 or more is
                    anticipated shall be in attendance. Again, this has been confirmed
                     by the Club. It will be necessary for the Local Authority to take
                     the advice of the Ambulance and Emergency Services to ensure that
                     compliance with-' recommendations 40 and 43 is achieved.

  3.2       Sheffield United Football Club

            (a)     A revised calculation of the capacity in accordance with
                     recommendations 1 and 2 have been made by the Building Surveyor "and
                     incorporated in the interim Safety Certificate issued to the Club.

            (b)      The Club proposes to use the computerised counting system to limit
                     the number of spectators entering each terraced area to comply with
                     recommendation 3. When the number of spectators aqmitted to any of
                     the terraced area reaches within 10$ of the capacity figure, the
                     computer monitor operator will inform Police Control Mn0 wi n take
                     the appropriate action to close down the necessary turnstiles. The
                     Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department has written to
                     the Club seeking exact details of the procedures to be followed.
                     They responded on the 21st August indicating that the computer
                     monitor operator will inform Police Control by telephone and Police
                     Officers will then be given instructions to instruct the turnstile
                     operator to close down the necessary turnstiles. Consideration
                     will need to be given as to whether or not this is the best
                     practical means of ensuring that the terrace is closed off before
                     its maximum capacity is reached.

            'e)      In accordance with recommendation 4, the Club has .-supplied a copy
                     of the written agreement with the Police setting out
                     responsibilities for crowd safety and control.

            (d)      In accordance with recommendation 5, the Club have indicated that
                     they propose to deploy six crowd safety stewards on the perimeter
Vkx.vv        a!
                     track to monitor specific areas for possible overcrowding and
'Pita"'              distress. It will be necessary to revise the stewarding figures in
                     the Safety Certificate to reflect this fact.
        :
             (e)    With reference to recommendation 6 that Police Officers and
            \       stewards are briefed and trained with regard to recognition of
                     crowd densities and signs of distress, I have not had any
                     information to the effect that action has been taken to implement
                     this recommendation,

            (f)      With reference to recommendation 7, the perimeter fence gates have
                     been removed at Sheffield United Football Club. Tne Club have
                     painted the frame of the gate in a different colour* an(j erected
                     emergency exit signs above each gate.   The Chief licensing Officer
                     has inspected this.
                To comply with recommendation 9 , the Gluts have confirmed that
                Police Officers will be provided as required and their identity
                known to stewards and other officers ia the vicinity. The Polic%:
                Officers will have radios to make contact with the Control Room.
                It' should be noted that the agreement entered into with the Poli^»
                also deals with stewarding aspects.                       •         ^

                f0 comply with recommendation 10, the Club have confirmed that tt-^
                will provide four bolt croppers.......Thea% will be used by stewards
                the Club. The Club have asked the Fir* Service to provide           ■
                instructions for stewards in their use.

    (i)         In accordance with recommendations 11 and 12, the Club have
                supplied a letter from their Consultant Engineer, Messrs. Eastwoc\
                and Partners who have confirmed that a visual inspection of the    v
                barriers has been carried out. The letter confirms that some
                rusting has occurred but that none" of the barriers is sufficient!,
                infected by rust for it to be necessary to carry out emergency
                strengthening or replacement before commencement of the football
                season. They also confirmed that a review of barriers has reveal,
                 that in some places they do not comply fully with the criteria ii\ 4
                 the Green Guide and that drawings are being prepared showing the
                 extra barriers which will be required so that tenders can be
                 invited. This matter will need to be given full consideration     by
                 the Building Surveyor and Fire Service and a further report
                 supplied to members in due course.

     (j)          With reference to recommendation 18, the Club have Instructed an
                „ independent turnstile servicing company to carry out an inspects,
                  A copy of their report has not been supplied.

      (k)        In considering recommendation 19, the Club have responded as
                  follows: "I can confirm that the correlation between the viewing
                  areas of the Spion Kop (southern end), New South Stand, John Str.,
                  Stand and Terraces and the turnstiles serving those areas is suet,
                  that all spectators intended to be admitted to those areas can pt,
.,wxlx           through within one hour. In the Bramali Lane End Stand and Terr,, 1
                  areas on the Spion Kop (main area) servicing is necessary to som., H>
 -"pyii           turnstiles before this criteria can be met. We hope to complete
                   the' work pri&r to the start of the season on the 22nd August but (
                   this is not possible, will reduce the capacity in those areas       1
                   accordingly and inform you prior to the game taking place”. Thi,,
                   matter has been referred to the Building Surveyor and the Fire
                   Service for their comment for independent checks to be made.

          (1)     I have no information that closed circuit television has been
                  installed.

          (m)     The Club have confirmed that the signposting has been reviewed 1
                  accordance with recommendation 22. The Chief Licensing Officer    ,
                  also inspected the ground and confirmed that this is the case.

          (n)      The (Club has supplied a copy of their current tickets which seen t
                   conform with recommendation 23.

          (o)      The Club do not request supporters to be in their places by a
                   specified time.

          (?)      The comments made in relation to Sheffield Wednesday Football Cl.
                   are equally pertinent to Sheffield United. This is also the ca:.
                   concerning the recommendations pertinent to co-ordination of
                        emergency services.

              (q)       To comply with recommendation 39, the Club have con1
                        have made arrangements with the St. John Ambulance B'
                        ensure at least one trained First Aider for 1,000 spec1
                        attendance. This has been made a condition of the inte;
                        certificate.

              (r)       With reference to recommendation' 40, consultation with neej
                        place with the Ambulance Service and other appropriate
                        professionals to discuss this recommendation.

              (s)       The Club have confirmed that they will employ a medical
                        practitioner in accordance with the provisions of recommendation1
                        41.   This is also a condition of the Safety Certificate.   The Clef
                    _   have not confirmed that he is trained and competent in advanced
                        First Aid, Again, this is a matter which needs to be taken up with -
                         the appropriate professionals.

              (t)       With reference to recommendation 42, the Club have confirmed that
                         they have made arrangements with the Ambulance Authority for the
                        necessary ambulance cover. Again, this is a provision in the
                         interim Safety Certificate.

              (u)       With reference to recommendation 43, this is a matter which will
                         require consultation by the Local Authority with the appropriate
                         professional bodies.

              Sheffield Sports Stadium

              The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to Sheffield
              Sports Stadium asking for the proposals on the implementation of the
              interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor. The Club have not
              provided the necessary details. The Building Surveyor, the Fire Service
              and Environmental Health Officers are to visit the Sports Stadium to
              undertake a detailed inspection of the Ground with a view to establishing
              whether or not it is safe for the admission of spectators. The Acting
              Head of Administration and Legal Department has written to the Sports
              Stadium indicating that unless a satisfactory response is received to our
              letter seeking their -proposals for implementation of the interim
{-yj          recommendations, then the Council have no choice but to consider issuing a
              prohibition notice relating to the premises. It is anticipated that a
              full report will be made to the General Purposes Panel at the end of
              September once the members of the Advisory Group have reported back
              following their inspections.

              Matters for Consideration

       4.1    Visits

■pi-         o At its meetings on the 17th August, the General Purposes Panel stated an
;’ w           intention to visit all sports grounds with the City. All three Clubs have
               been notified of this request and a suitable date for a visit will be
               arranged.

       4.2    The function of members in the futurf;

              It is clearly essential that there is a tightening up of existing
              procedures and a clarification of the terms of reference for dealing with
              the issue cf Safety of Sports Grounds, At present, the General Purpose.:::
              Panel has delegated authority to deal with Safety of Sports Grounds
                         '




        i'aaea.'; In the past, matters have been referred to the General Purposes
      floel for decisions as and when they were necessary. Members h%ye
      indicated an intention to participate more .fully in this area;    indeed
      this is required by the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor!
      The function of the Advisory Group must be to advise members antj assist
      them in providing enough information for members to make an informe!j ancj
      rational decision a3 and when required. The Advisory Group is' aade up of
      the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor, a representative from
      the; Department of Health and Consumer Services and the Ambulanoo Service
      since the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor were Published.
      Prior to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, the meetings of the Adviso«y Groutt
      werr:no6r:;as: tightly; controlled as they should have been. This has* row
      ,been?iapr*oirf|. Arrangements;, hayej^lready?,been- made for the kGting-kem ^f
      Administration and.. Legal Department;to nominate a. senior!offietp t0 -Chair
      the meetings of the "Advisory Group "and for ...full detailed' 'minut#g ^o* be
      taken.- When the approved departmental structure has. been compl9ke{j one
      of the new Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department (Legal) will1
      undertake the function. It is suggested that one way of memberg becoming
      more involved in this issue would be for them to be supplied with agendas
      of the meetings prior to the meeting taking place and minutes of meetings
      which have taken place. It is recommended that this is implemented.

4.3   Inspections?

      There is a statutory duty upon the local authority to inspect designated
      sports grounds at least on an annual basis. In his interim
      recommendations, Lord Justice Taylor has said that he feels mere frequent
      inspections would be of benefit. It is suggested that it may **
      appropriate to undertake quarterly inspections, once during ti>/2lo3e
      season, once at the commencement of the season, once in the         Qf the
      season and once at the end. This would obviously require a s«4i-antial
      devotion of resources. It is recommended that this is impieasg^sct.

 *^   Emergency Procedures

      la the normal course of events, matters will obviously be ra:~«.„ac}      a
      Sub-Committee of the Council for consideration. The delegs;-: ;athority
      in respect of these functions is vested the General Purposes
      Recent events have highlighted the need for a proper etnergs--.-- , vgtem
      be set up. In view of the fact that the Licensing Deparcaer:          art 0f
      the Administration & Legal Department, it would seem logical         this
      emergency delegation to be granted to the Acting Head of i-2i'..»-ration &
      Legal Department in consultation with the chair of the Gecersclarposes
      Panel. Members are asked to comment upon this.

 ,5   Resources!

      The existing structure of the Licensing Section is shown is     attached
      diagram. It consists of a Chief Licensing Officer, a            Licensing
      Officer, three Licensing Officers and an Administrative issuer
      Section was originally comprised of five staff which were — - ^ e d to six
      by the addition of the Administrative Assistant's post in     -30n ^ e
      abolition of South Yorkshire County Council. The increase     !0 ta!{e
      account of the additional responsibilities taken on by th~ ir--on up0n
      abolition of South Yorkshire County Council.

      The Section is responsible for the processing, issuing, z
      enforcing of numerous licences and consents; for example           car?-:,-»i»
      licences and private hire licences, public entertainment
      licences, theatre licences, street collection permits. i ■
      mini bus licences and the licensing of sports grounds, :
a comprehensive knowledge of the relevant legislation and much of the wXB
is carried out under delegated powers,

TMyifyiSPiyilll^ltltSttgroPgh Disaster

This has had repercussions throughout the Section since the Chief
Licensing Officer has been engaged full time since April in dealing with
the Inquiry and subsequently the interim recommendations of Lord Justice
Taylor.          '            ■               '


Authority should review its arrangements for issuing,
enforcing, reviewing,' amending''and~ran£wing safety certificates." It is
clear that at present, this'.requires a; substa:ntial devotion of’offlefi*
time .and ;that this is likely to; continue             . 'Whilst"the Chief
Licensing Officer is engaged full time on this task, other important
duties are neglected.

It is clear that further resources need to be devoted to the issue of
safety of sports grounds. It is anticipated that it will require betweefl
75$ and 100$ of one persons time to deal with safety of sports grounds
issues in the short tern'. This will entail dealing with the existing
designated sports grounds in the City, namely Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club, Sheffield United Football Club and Sheffield Sports Stadium. It is
hoped that by next Spring, a workable and well understood administrative
system will be in effect which should mean that there will be no need to
repeat much of the work which has been done to improve the administrative
systems. However, the World Student Games Facilities!' are currently under
construction and will have a significant impact in respect of the work on
safety of sports grounds.

It is anticipated that additional staff will be required to fulfill these
functions. A proposed new structure is shown in diagram form and attached
to this report. The proposal is that'an additional post of Chief
Licensing Officer with specific responsibility for sports grounds Is
created. There is also a need for an additional Licensing Officer who
will have direct responsibility to the Chief Licensing Officer for sports
grounds. Also attached to this report are draft job descriptions. In
addition to their specific duties relating to sports grounds, it is
anticipated that these two officers will as and when necessary provide
support to the existing structure which will continue to deal with the
general licensing functions.

The benefits of the -changes

The increase in staff should ensure that the Licensing Section can"
continue to function efficiently and provide a reasonable, level of
service. It should enable the Licensing Section to improve' its service
delivery and enable a review of licensing systems' to be undertaken, and
proper enforcement of legislation to take place. During the last tvo
years, it has become clear that the quantity of work carried out within
the Licensing Section has increased. There has been an increase in the
number of private hire vehicle licences issued in particular as well as a
general increase in most areas. The World Student Games Facilities will
also in all probability require public entertainments licences requiring
additional devotion of time from the Licensing Section. In the light of
the Hillsborough Disaster, it is important that a proper allocation of
resources is made and consideration needs to be given to the allocation of
resources and priorities in other areas.
Taking account of the recent pay offer, the cost of implementing the
proposals in a full year will total £26,*60, taking account .of salaries
and additional costs. Clearly, some of this will be recoverable by way of
licensing fees which can be charged for the issue and amendment of safety
certificates for sports grounds. There is statutory authority to enable
the Council to charge fees for the issue, amendment and transfer of Safety
Certificates. The fee charged must be commensurate with the work actually
arsd_ reasonably done. No charge has yet been made for the issue and
amendment of certificate since the first amendment and certificate which
were issued with those issued recently, ^ The original certificate issued
to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was that which had been issued bj the
former County Council. The Acting Head of Administration and Legal
Department has sought the views of the various bodies which have an input
into Safety of Sports Grounds issues to enable a full discussion to take
place about the levels of charges which should be levied. A full report
will be made to members once further information is available in this
respect. For the future, however, it is anticipated that in accordance
with Lord Justice Taylor’s recommendations, certificates will be issued on
an annual basis and thus a charge will be made annually. This charge will
reflect the inspections which take place and the administrative
procedures. There may be a need for additional devotion of resources to
cover the necessary expenditure.

Recommendations

       proposals being discussed and agreed with the appropriate Trade
       Onions in line with the Council's (Responding to Change) agreement.

       The Hillsborough Task Team has been established to offer professional services
       to those involved with the Hillsborough disaster and inquiry. Staff in several
       council departments were directly and indirectly involved in the* subsequent
       inquiry. It is generally recognised that professional staff connected with
       such events need to be given the opportunity to describe the tasks they undertook
       and share their experience.

       Emergency services workers have already had such de-briefing sessions. Undertaking
       this process within one's own department can be difficult, so it has been agreed
       with Occupational Health that we should offer this service. We therefore invite
       anyone who may have been involved with the inquiry to a de-briefing meeting on
       Wednesday 9th August at 3.30.pm. This will be held in room 3 on the top floor
       at Hillsborough Library.

       Other de-briefing meetings are being arranged for later in August, should anyone
       wishing to attend not be able to come on the above date please contact me should
       you require further information or details.

  Dear Sir,
                                                                               /££_         CUt.

          I have been requested by the Leader of the City Council
  (Councillor Keva Coombes) to invite your Authority to be
  represented at a meeting of leading Members of Authorities
  concerned with the Hillsborough disaster, to be held at
  2 ^ 0 0 P . M . on WEDNESDAY, 6 TH S E P T E M B E R , 1 9 8 9 in the Town Hall,
  Castle Street, Liverpool, 2.
        The purpose of the meeting is to review progress made
   since the last meeting of representatives (on 29th April)
   when various agreements were reached, in principle, about the
   need for continued co-ordination of services. A report
   should be available in time for the meeting on progress in
   attracting financial support.
        I am attaching a copy of the reply of the Secretary of
   State for Social Services to the joint letter from our
   Authorities seeking financial support. The^approach
   suggested in the response of using the Bellwin Scheme has
   been examined and would not appear to be feasible. Other
   attempts by Officers to obtain financial assistance from the
   E.E.C. and other bodies have not been any more successful.

        There is, however, some commitment of resources and it
   may be that during the course of discussion, the meeting can
   consider alternative ways of maintaining the co-ordinated
   response to Hillsborough.
        I look forward to confirmation that Members of your
   Authority will be able to attend the meeting.

                                  Yours faithfully,
                                                                iPVx,

V n u (
    T h a n k you for your letter of 6 M a y about additional financial
    support for direct serv i c e provision and for the Regional Unit you
    propose to establish to p rovide and co-ordinate continuing care"in -
    the aftermath of the H i l l s b o r o u g h •tragedy*    Y o u also w r o t e to_
    Joh n Moore/ Secretary of .state for Social S e c urity and to
    Nicholas R i d l e y S ecr e t a ry of State for t h e - E n v i r o n m e n t . Please .
    accept this as a reply to all three letters.

    T h e D e p a r t m e n t ’s Social Services Inspectorate have kept me informed
    of the action taken by the local social services departments
    together- in the wake of the tragedy and I k n o w that the Chief
    Inspector has written p e rs onally to all the Social Services
    Directors in appreciation of the remarkable efforts m a d e by them andj
    their staff.                                           -                        J

    The precise-response to a tra^e^y of this sort needs to be decided
    on the spot, on the basis of a careful examination of needs.           Ky
    Department has no power to m ake additional resources available tcj
    local authorities for this purpose.          However, I understand from
    Nicholas Ridley, S e c r et a r y of State for Environment, that under a
    model scheme designed to deal w i t h extra-ordinary costs arising frorr
    emergencies (the Bellwin Scheme), the Government has provided
    special financial assistance to local authorities in certain
    circumstances.

    The Bellwin Scheme was d r a w n up after discussions w i t h the Local
    A u t h o r i t y A s s ociations and provide for assistance towards the
    immediate and additional costs of dealing with, an emergency once
    expenditure exceeds a threshold beyond w h i c h local authorities woulc
    normally be expected to budget for.             in the case of the last use of
    the Scheme^ following the Great Storm of 1987, that threshold was
    (for Counties and M e t r o p o l i t a n Districts) set at the exclusive
    product of a l . o p rate.                                             JP
If y o u consider that you have a case for assistance of this kind,
Nicholas R i d l e y is prepared to consider a detailed and fully costed
application (though at first sight it looks as if the level of
expenditure needed w o u l d be substantially below the likely threshold
for- the authorities i n v o l v e d ) . I know that he w ill k e e p me informed
of events if you do decid e to pursue this possibility.

The G o v ernment has, of course, as you mention, a l r e a d y m ade a
c on t r ibution of £500,000 to the Disaster Fund to hel p those most
c l o se l y affected by the Disaster

        re: SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS

        With reference to your communication of 20 July, I apologise for the
        delay in responding to you, although we have h^d brief discussions on
        a number of issues and I know that since that time I have signed out
        several letters to both the Police, Fire and Ambulance Services and other
        parties regarding certain of the matters that now need to be chased up.

        Basically, I agree that there is a need for a full report to be drawn
        up for Members at the earliest opportunity and that this document should,
        amongst other things, deal with the question of safety procedures and
        resource matters.

        With regard to the other issues raised in your communication, I will
        ask       to arrange a meeting some time during Thursday or Friday of
        next week in order that we can decide on the best way forward.

                HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - LEGAL ACTION

                As  you may    or may   not  recall,   it has been agreed between   the
                representatives for the various Defendants and the Claimants in this
                matter that there be two "test" actions and, in this  regard, I enclose
                for your information and attention a copy Writ and Statement of Claim
                which has been passed to me by the Solicitors acting on behalf of
                Municipal Mutual which, of course, will be the subject of detailed
                meetings between ourselves and the Insurers.

                Accordingly, my purpose at this stage in copying the document to you
                is first of all to ensure that you are fully aware of this matter and
                secondly to draw your attention to pages 16 and 17 which sets out the
                particulars of alleged negligence, so far as the Authority is concerned
                and in particular to draw your attention to the   extent of those areas
                of alleged negligence by the Authority in comparison with those alleged
                first of all against the Police, (quite obviously), secondly the Club
                and,  equally importantly,  the Club's Advisers,   namely Eastwood and
                Partners.

                Whilst the Authority has quite clearly to deal with the criticisms made
                of it,and proposals in this regard are already well underway in the
                form of detailed reports, I believe the enclosed document does, in effect,
                underline the points made previously by both myself and Liz Bashforth
                that it is important in all these matters not to lose sight of the issue
                of causation, in that whilst in no way seeking to minimise the criticisms
                made against the Authority, the point will have to be made in due course,
                that although they are regretable and require action they did not
                contribute substantially to the disaster which occurred.

             Re: Final Submissions to Lord Justice Taylor -
             Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry__________


             I am mindful of the fact that in his Interim Report, Lord Justice Taylor asked
             that we supply our final submissions as soon as possible.  In view of the
             indictment which has been made against the local authority, it would obviously
             be disastrous if we were to delay much longer in this.  I understand from
             speaking to Mike Murphy that, he is aware that most other parties have
             submitted their comments.

             I have therefore passed to              the comments we have had in from the
             Building Surveyor and the Director o f H e a l t h & Consumer Services with a view
             to collation of the various points made being undertaken.

             It does, however, occur to me that members may wish to have some input into
             the matter.  Do you wish this to be dealt with informally, or should the
             matter be discussed at a Meeting.

           NOTES OF THE DISCUSSION AT SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY MEETING

                                 Friday, 18th August, 1989


          Relating to Items 23A, B and C on the Agenda - Hillsborough Tragedy



       Item 23 C

       Interim Report of Taylor Inquiry and Progress to date

       The Chief Constable outlined recent developments in relation to the Taylor
       Inquiry and explained that Mr. Peter Hayes would be answering further
       questions and reporting on progress in implementing the recommendations.
       As far as criminal liability is concerned the Director of Public
       Prosecutions has made clear that a criminal inquiry should now take place
       to see if any further action should be taken in relation to all parties
       involved in the tragedy.  Since Mr. Dear of the West Midlands Police has
       gathered most of the information and evidence in the first part of the
       Inquiry, the Chief Constable has asked him to conduct the criminal
       investigations.

       Mr. Peter Hayes, Deputy Chief Constable then outlined the steps taken to
       date to implement the Taylor recommendations.  These were as follows:-

(i)    Liaison between Agencies:

       Mr. Hayes has been appointed to liaise with the Football Clubs and other
       agencies and has set up an Implementation Team consisting of the
       Superintendents and Chief Superintendents who act as commanders in control
       at football matches.  Before publication of the Taylor Report the Force
       had been examining the events at Hillsborough.   They have concentrated
       their efforts on the recommendations needing to be implemented before the
       start of the football season on Saturday, 19th August.   It was reported
       that written Agreements between the Police and the Football Clubs were now
       required.  At the time of the meeting, three of the five South Yorkshire
       clubs had signed the agreements, two were outstanding.   It was the
       intention of the Force to implement one system of ground control which
       would apply Force-wide in order to get consistency and simplicity and to
       avoid confusion.  Before outlining precisely the steps taken to date to
       implement these recommendations Mr. Hayes pointed out that there was still
       some liaison work to complete, some training of stewards and officers, and
       that the issue of financing of football matches needed to be put on the
       Police Authority's agenda.  The issue here is that the contract for the
       recovery of policing costs at football matches is based on a sliding scale
       relative to the number of spectators attending.   Mr. Hayes' view is that
       the actual costs of policing matches will increase as a result of Taylor,
       whilst the number of spectators may reduce.   This will need to be
       addressed in some detail at a future meeting.

(ii)   Admission of Spectators

       Clubs will monitor the access to the ground               through their
       computers.  When capacity is reached, the Club will be responsible for
       stopping access.  The Police will respond should any difficulties arise.

(iii) Monitoring Crowds in Standing A rea s :

       Clubs will appoint stewards to monitor any signs of distress or
       overcrowding.  Every officer on duty will be briefed on this. Perimeter
       gates will be kept open; each one monitored by an officer with radio
       control linked to overall ground control.

(iv)   Training

       The Police are producing a video for training purposes which will be ready
       within one month.  In the meantime, photographs showing situations of
       crowding and of distress situations will be used with officers and
       stewards.  An aide memoire is to be available to all with clear
       descriptions of the symptoms of distress.

(v)    Cutting equipment:

       All clubs have undertaken to provide this equipment which will be kept on
       the perimeter tracks and stewards trained to use it.  The final decision
       regarding use will rest with the Force commander.  Before each match there
       will be liaison between the Club, stewards and Police regarding the
       anticipated numbers of the crowd.  If tickets are to be used, all
       information printed on those tickets, including colour codes, etc. will be
       carefully considered before the match.

(vi)   Crowd Arrivals and Departures:

       Contingency plans will be drawn up and available in all the relevant
       sub-divisions and at pre-match briefings.

(vii) Kick-off Postponement:

       The decision will lie with the Force commander. Crowd safety will be of
       paramount importance in his/her considerations.  Clubs will in future
       provide telephone lines between operational Police and the officials'
       room.

(ix)   Liaison:

       Between all the emergency services.  Each service has now appointed a
       Senior Liaison Officer and meetings are to be held in the near future.

       A number of questions were then directed to the Chief and Deputy Chief
       Constable by members of the Authority.

       Members' Questions

       1. A question was asked regarding the costs of the criminal investigation
       and who would meet these. Also about the appropriateness of officers from
       the West Midlands carrying out this investigation given the recent reports
       on the investigations into the activities of the Serious Crimes Squad it*
       that Force.  Mr.  Wright responded by saying that the officers carrying
       out the South Yorkshire criminal investigations are appointed at the
       discretion of the West Midlands Chief Constable.  It is likely that the
       team who conducted the Taylor Inquiry investigations will continue to be
       involved in the criminal investigations.  When asked whether any of those
       officers were also subject to internal inquiry from West Midlands, Mr.
       Wright replied that he did not know.

       2. Clarification was sought as to which clubs had signed the required
       agreements.  The response was that Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United
       and Doncaster have all signed.  The finalising of the other agreements was
       anticipated that day.
3. The Chief Constable was asked about communications systems between
Police officers inside and outside the Ground - an issue criticised by
Taylor.  The response given was that on 15th April, there was a
malfunction of the communications system for a brief period.  The
emergency system was immediately switched on.  The Police have now started
to improve the radio systems used at the Hillsborough Ground, and will be
coming forward to a future meeting of the Authority with an application
for improved equipment.

4.  The question of consistency of practice was raised and the issue of
whether sufficient briefing was given upon a change of personnel at senior
level.  The response to this question was that ground commanders stay on
the same patch for a considerable period.  They also do have experience of
policing other grounds.  An officer experienced in football control will
always be available and involved in policing the matches. Constables,
sergeants and inspectors will in future find it easier to police different
matches because of the standardisation of functions, for example, clothing
of stewards or key personnel at each ground will indicate functions across
the Force area.

Item 23 B

Claims for compensation:

Report of the Police Authority's insurers (MMI)

It was reported that 701 claims from the killed or injured have now been
received.  Solicitors estimate there will be 1,000 claims in total,
therefore, 300 are outstanding.   In July, the insurers had met with the
Liverpool Steering Committee.   It had been suggested that in order to make
progress a number of test cases be brought foward, six in number, to be
heard by the same circuit judge for purposes of consistency.   This is
likely to take place early next year.   The proposal from the insurers is
that no money changes hands until the courts have settled liability.   Most
claims are for nervous shock.

It is estimated that the full liability on   claims could amount to
£15 million.  The limit on South Yorkshire   Police Authority's current
indemnity is £8.5 million.  There are four   possible defendants involved on
liability; the Police, the Club, Sheffield   City Council, Dr. Eastwood.

The insurers outlined the two options as they saw it for the Committee's
consideration.

Option 1

To take the test cases forward, bearing in mind that they are likely to be
heard around the anniversary of the Hillsborough Inquiry next April, and
the possible public relations effect of this.

Option 2

To discuss with Sun Alliance, the company representing other defendants,
the possibility of reaching agreement and apportioning a settlement out of
court.  The insurers anticipate that it will be two or three years before
there is a final solution of the claims.  They stressed that Option 2
would mean the admitting of some liability by the Police.  It was also
stressed that, in the end, the decision as to the way forward would be
made by the insurance company on a commercial basis, but that that
decision would take into account views expressed by the South Yorkshire
Police Authority.
It was agreed that members may need further time to consider complexities
and that it would be referred to a subsequent meeting of F&GP.

Item 23 A

Costs of the Inquiry

Mr.           pointed out that the arguments used by the Police Authority
in support of its claims to mo re funding from the Home Office had now been
substantially changed in the light of the decision that further criminal
investigations were necessary.   His view was that the offer from the Home
Office to extract a ceiling of a V 4 of a penny rate product (i.e.,
£975,000) from the Police Authority, after which all costs would be met by
the Home Office was the optimum that could be expected at this point in
time.  The Committee concluded that the offer should be accepted from the
Home Office on condition that assurances be received that the further
costs to be covered by the Home Office would include those of both the
criminal investigations and the Coroner's Inquiry.

Item 23 C -   Closed Season: Part Two

Interim Taylor Inquiry Report

Further questions from members were invited on this issue in the closed
part of the meeting.  These consisted of;

1.  Briefing of officers to the Inquiry; who was responsible?  The Chief
Constable replied that officers at senior level were not briefed, they
wrote statements of evidence and presented these to the Inquiry, and on
the basis of these they gave evidence.

2.  Further moves within the Force of senior officers; the Chief Constable
explained that Mr. Duckenfield was moved for a variety of reasons, both to
implement a review of community consultations, and in the light of his
recent experience and sensitivity around policing major football matches.
Mr. Murray was moved for similar reasons.  Mr. Jackson was moved in order
to provide continuinty from the retiring A.C.C. Mr. Watson.

3.  When questioned further about the responsibilities given on 15th April
to two senior officers (Mr. Murray and Mr. Duckenfield) who had had little
experience of policing major football matches, the Chief Constable
reiterated his view that to have retained the previous commander in charge
would have undermined the authority of Mr. Duckenfield at that point.  He
also said that both officers had had some experience of policing football
matches at previous points in their career.

4.  Internal disciplinary action:  This was a question about any further
action to be taken against members of the Force.  The Chief Constable
replied that four complaints had been received to date.  One against Mr.
Duckenfield, one against Mr. Peter Hayes, one against another individual
and one relating to officers accused of taking money from football fans
upon entering the ground.

Apart from the complaint about Mr.  Hayes, which was to be dealt with on
the current Police Authority agenda, the other issues would be dealt with
in due course by himself.

            res HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - ARTICLE IN MUNICIPAL JOURNAL

            I enclose, for your information and attention, lest it has not already
            been brought to your attention,a copy of an       article produced by Mr
            Bush who you will perhaps recall we met during the aftermath of the
            Hillsborough  Disaster, being the City Building Surveyor     for Liverpool
            and who, from his comments seems to fit the mould of Dr Eastwood!

            It occurs to me that in the light of the very scathing   attack he has
            chosen to direct against this Authority, consideration may need to be
            given as to what,     if any, response this Authority ought to give.
            Accordingly,  I have also copied this article to both    the Council's
            Insurer's Solicitors and to Mr Murphy of Counsel who, as you know, has
            represented us throughout.

            I would add that contact has been made with the Press Office by the
            Municipal Journal asking if the Council wished to send a 150/200 word
            letter'responding to the Article - to be available by Wednesday/Thursday
            of this week.

            Whilst, of course, a lot of effort has now been put into a revised system
            for report due to be ready for the next Committee meeting in September
            you may feel that as part of the discussion at the Policy Group scheduled
            for next week consideration ought to be given to the sort of issue raised
            in this    article as to whether it would be better or more appropriate
            to move the licensing function within the Authority.

            In this   regard, whilst I feel obliged to raise the topic I feel it would
            not be   appropriate for several reasons, not least of which being that
            I do not believe that the model suggested by Mr Bush would necessarily
            be duplicated outside his particular circumstances, and moreover seems
            to be at odds with part of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations.

The Municipal Journal,




Dear Sirs,

I read with interest the article by Mr. Norman Bush published in the
Municipal Journal on the 18th August, 1989.   In that article, he advocates
the merits of delegating the functions of local authorities under the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975 to a Building Surveyor.   This is surprising in
view of the Interim Recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor in his Interim
Report into the Hillsborough Disaster.   One of the Interim Recommendations
suggests that local authorities should ensure that an accountable
administrative structure is in existance "whereby the functions of the local
authority are regularly and effectively supervised by Senior Officers and
elected Members and decisions are properly taken in accordance with the
local authority's rules".   Thus, Mr. Bush's proposal is directly contrary to
that recommendation. There is much sense in Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendation.   There are obvious dangers in delegating the function to one
party. What his article does not recognise is that Building Surveyors are
not the only people who have a function in this regard.   The Fire Service,
the Police, the Ambulance Service and Environmental Health Officers all have
a part to play. The danger in delegating the function to one of these is
the risk that no matter how careful the individual is, a balanced decision
will not be made.

In Sheffield, the Building Survey, the Police, the Fire Service, the
Ambulance Service and Environmental Health Officers join forces to make up
an "Advisory Group" Lord Justice Taylor supports such an organisation and
suggests ways in which its functionings could be improved.   He is, however,
quite clear in stating that the Advisory Group should report to the elected
Members of the local authority.   For the reasons I have explained above,
this is clearly good practice.  Indeed, at a recent Meeting of the Committee
in Sheffield which deals with these issues, the practical benefits of such
an approach were clearly evident.   One of the Sheffield Football Clubs and
the South Yorkshire Police had reached an impasse upon a particular matter.
Finally, the matter was referred to the relevant Committee, who heard all
the facts in relation to the matter and made a decision accordingly.  The
matter was determined fairly and objectively and the members who made that
decision remain accountable for it.

Mr. Bush, in his article, says that "no single competent Officer was
delegated to get on with the task".  He overlooks the fact that there was in
existence an Advisory Group comprising of a number of experts. The
administration of the system rested within the Administration & Legal
Department under the auspices of a Chief Licensing Officer.  To say that
Officers were not accountable is erroneous.

Mr. Bush also suggests that members need not be fully aware of the day to
day running of the system.  Lord Justice Taylor clearly recognised the
benefits of a proper accountable structure.  How can that operate if Members
are only asked for their views upon matters rarely? One of the failings
recognised in the administrative system operated in Sheffield is that
communication between the Advisory Group and members of the local authority
could be improved.  Steps are in hand to achieve this.

Finally, it is erroneous of Mr. Bush to say that no Building Surveyor was
involved in the process.  As I have already indicated, the Building Surveyor
was and remains one of the Members of the Advisory Group.

In conclusion, Sheffield City Council proposes to build upon and improve its
existing administrative arrangements.   I suggest that this is an eminently
sensible approach designed to ensure that there are no further disasters.
Safety Management is a multi-disciplinary matter if it is to be successful:

The Municipal Journal,




Dear Sirs,

I read with interest the article by Mr. Norman Bush published in the
Municipal Journal on the 18th August, 1989.   In that article, he advocates
the merits of delegating the functions of local authorities under the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975 to a Building Surveyor.   This is surprising in
view of the Interim Recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor in his Interim
Report into the Hillsborough Disaster.   One of the Interim Recommendations
suggests that local authorities should ensure that an accountable
administrative structure is in existance "whereby the functions of the local
authority are regularly and effectively supervised by Senior Officers and
elected Members and decisions are properly taken in accordance with the
local authority's rules".   Thus, Mr. Bush's proposal is directly contrary to
that recommendation.   There is much sense in Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendation.   There are obvious dangers in delegating the function to one
party.  What his article does not recognise is that Building Surveyors are
not the only people who have a function in this regard.   The Fire Service,
the Police, the Ambulance Service and Environmental Health Officers all have
a part to play.   The danger in delegating the function to one of these is
the risk that no matter how careful the individual is, a balanced decision
will not be made.

In Sheffield, the Building Survey, the Police, the Fire Service, the
Ambulance Service and Environmental Health Officers join forces to make up
an "Advisory Group" Lord Justice Taylor supports such an organisation and
suggests ways in which its functionings could be improved.   He is, however,
quite clear in stating that the Advisory Group should report to the elected
Members of the local authority.   For the reasons I have explained above,
this is clearly good practice.  Indeed, at a recent Meeting of the Committee
in Sheffield which deals with these issues, the practical benefits of such
an approach were clearly evident.   One of the Sheffield Football Clubs and
the South Yorkshire Police had reached an impasse upon a particular matter.
Finally, the matter was referred to the relevant Committee, who heard all
the facts in relation to the matter and made a decision accordingly.  The
matter was determined fairly and objectively and the members who made that
decision remain accountable for it.

Mr. Bush, in his article, says that "no single competent Officer was
delegated to get on with the task".  He overlooks the fact that there was in
existence an Advisory Group comprising of a number of experts.  The
administration of the system rested within the Administration & Legal
Department under the auspices of a Chief Licensing Officer.  To say that
Officers were not accountable is erroneous.

Mr. Bush also suggests that members need not be fully aware of the day to
day running of the system.  Lord Justice Taylor clearly recognised the
benefits of a proper accountable structure.  How can that operate if Members
are only asked for their views upon matters rarely? One of the failings
recognised in the administrative system operated in Sheffield is that
communication between the Advisory Group and members of the local authority
could be improved.  Steps are in hand to achieve this.

Finally, it is erroneous of Mr. Bush to say that no Building Surveyor was
involved in the process.  As I have already indicated, the Building Surveyor
was and remains one of the Members of the Advisory Group.

In conclusion, Sheffield City Council proposes to build upon and improve its
existing administrative arrangements.   I suggest that this is an eminently
sensible approach designed to ensure that there are no further disasters.
Safety Management is a multi-disciplinary matter if it is to be successful:
no one profession has all the necessary expertise.   It matters little where
the delegated authority lies to issue licenses or certificates; it does
matter that they are meaningful in content, i.e. enforceable and enforced.
Members should decide 'where the buck stops'.   Norman Bush would do well to
learn to co-operate and value the input from colleagues with complementary
expertise to his own.   Certainly in Sheffield the multi-disciplinary
advisory group on Safety in Sports Grounds has always had valuable input
from the Building Surveyors and will be doing its utmost to improve the
Council's performances in Safety in Sports Grounds administration, using all
the skills available to a local authority within direct employment and from
any field of relevant expertise.   I sincerely hope that other authorities
will exercise caution before considering adoption of the procedures
suggested by Mr.  Bush.   They are a recipe for disaster.

Dear Sirs,


             I was    surprised and rather saddened to read the article by Mr.                                   Norman Bush
in the       Municipal    Journal      on the       18th August          1989-     In     commenting upon the           interim
report of Lord Justice Taylor and in suggesting the approach which should be adopted
in the future to the safety of sports grounds he suggests that the members of local

authorities and the administrators                    should delegate what he describes as,                       11 the real
technical task1' to the building surveyor.


             Mr. Bush directs fierce criticism at Sheffield City Council for not involving

a    building      surveyor     in    the    discharge      of    its     licensing       functions    under      the    Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975-                 He says,


              ''The Health and Consumer Services officer (presumably an expert on the price
               and    freedom       from    food    poisoning      of    the     meat    pies   consumed    at    half    time)
               was involved, but no building surveyor.''


             The Building Surveyor was and still is one of the members of the multi-disci-
linary advisory group which performed                      inspections of sports ground                 in this     area and

which reported its             findings          and made itsrecommendations              to the elected members of
the local authority.             To suggest          that the     building surveyor was not involved is quite
simply wrong.           To go on to              say that the      Sheffield City Council's evidence                    did not
even    get    the    title    of    the    building     surveyor        right    unfortunately       displays      the       fact
that Mr. Bush has simply not read the City Council's evidence.                                   The mistake in termin­
ology was not a mistake made by this Council.


             The     interim    report       recommends,         inter    alia,     that    local     authorities        should
ensure      that an accountable administratrive structure exists,                               ''whereby the functions
of    the    local    authority are          regularly and effectively                  supervised by      senior officers

and    elected members          and    decisions      are   properly        taken       in accordance      with    the    local
authority's rules.''                The general proposal made by Mr.                     Bush seems directly contrary

to    that    recommendation.              The   dangers    of    delegating        the    functions    involved         to    one
party must         surely be obvious.              The Fire Service,             the Police,     the Ambulance Service
and the Environmental Health Officers all have a part to play in what Mr. Bush describes

as,    ''the real technical task.''
           The Environmental Health Officers of this authority are certainly not responsible
for meat     pies   as Mr.       Bush    somewhat   facetiously       remarks.          They,    together with        the

building    surveyor's      department,      the police      and the fire and ambulance                 services join

forces to make up the advisory group.                The administration of the system rested ’within
the    Administration      and    Legal    Department      under    the   auspices       of    the    Chief   Licensing

Officer.     To say that officers were not accountable is erroneous.


           The   tragedy    of     Hillsborough     did    reveal    shortcomings         in    the    administrative

system operated in Sheffield.               The City Council,         no doubt like many other Councils,
has taken fully into account the recommendations made in the interim report.                                    Already
changes have been made and this Council intends to build upon and improve its existing
administrative arrangements.                Safety Management is, we believe, a multi-disciplinary

matter and no one profession has all the necessary expertise.                                 The building surveyor
will    continue    to be    one    of several experts whose views                are    taken       into   account   but
I would suggest that the Council must use all the skills available to it rather than

attempting the kind of delegation suggested by Mr. Bush.                          I sincerely hope that other
authorities      will   exercise        caution   before   considering      the    adoption          of the   procedure

suggested by Mr. Bush.           They are a recipe for disaster.

            HILLSBOROUGH - FUTURE ACTION

            During a recen t discussion with Councillor B etts he asked what was going to
            happen with regard to the te rrace where the disaster occurred which was now
            closed for the foreseeable future. Amongst the item s discussed was the fa c t
            th a t it seemed to me th a t as the tunnel leading to th a t area had been the subject
            of criticism in the Taylor Report im m ediate action would have to be taken
            before fu rther use of th a t tunnel could be allowed.

            A fter fu rth er discussion Councillor B etts suggested th a t it might be appropriate,
            for example, to consider taking down all the radial fencing as a first measure
            and to substantially increase the size of the gates in the pitch perim eter fencing
            and th a t, if it was necessary, to close th e tunnel, to remove the perim eter fencing
            in the pens facing the tunnel and to secure against pitch invasions by additional
            policing methods as he fe lt th a t the South Yorkshire Police were possibly
            overstating the problems, given th a t th e Metropolitan Police had managed to
            control crowds a t the Arsenal and West Ham grounds which do not have pitch
            perim eter fences.

            Accordingly, I would be grateful if you would le t me know in due course where
            the discussion is with regard to the possible remedial action on the terrace
            and w hether thought has been given to those issues now raised by Councillor
            B etts.

These recommendations and suggestions have been drawn together from

representatives with various interests within Sheffield City Council.


They are submitted having taken time to assess the effect of the

Hillsborough Disaster,   the Inquiry and the Interim Recommendations of Lord

Justice Taylor which are being implemented in Sheffield.
                                       Page 2


1.   Clarification and Codification of Legislation

     If the Inquiry is minded to recommend amendments of or additions to the
     existing legislation then the opportunity could be taken to codify and
     clarify the legislation.

     The provisions, which are currently contained in the Safety of Sports
     Grounds Act 1975, the Fire Safety and Safety at Places of Sports Act 1987,
     various Regulations and statutory guidance could be remodelled to create one
     Act and Regulations (with functional statements) requiring certain standards
     to be achieved.

2.   Improvement/Prohibition Notices

     The 197 5 legislation (as amended) makes provision for the issue of a
     Prohibition Notice to the holder of a certificate.   It is suggested that
     consideration should be given to including an intermediate course of action.
     The Health and Safety at Work, Etc. Act 1974 makes provision of the issue of
     Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices.   An Improvement Notice requires
     the employer to carry out certain works within a given time.   If the
     employer fails to comply with the Notice, they are guilty of an offence.

     The power to issue Improvement Notices would be a useful intermediate step
     where a Prohibition Notice is not appropriate, but where some formal Notice
     is required.

3.   Periodic Certificates and Inspections

     The Popplewell Report recommended (at paragraph 3.68) that there should be
     (i) annual renewal of safety certificates issued under the Safety of Sports
     Grounds Act 1975; (ii) a duty on the local authority annually to inspect the
     premises prior to re-issuing the certificate; and (iii) power for the local
     authority to revoke the certificate.

     The interim recommendations compliment the first proposal; the second
     recommendation was implemented in statutory guidance after the Popplewell
     Report; the third recommendation has not been acted upon.

     With regard to the fir'st recommendation, annual certificates focus the
     parties' minds on the whole situation and not on a particular application or
     inspection.  It tends to promote an overall review of the circumstances
     surrounding the re-issue of a certificate.

     With regard to the second recommendation, it is suggested that prior to
     re-issuing the certificate there should be an inspection, but that there
     should also be inspections on a half-yearly or quarterly basis with guidance
     given as to timing, e.g., prior to renewal, end of season, start of season,
     during season (obviously this is less relevant to multi-use stadia where
     "seasons" are not as clear cut.)

     Visits to the ground should be carried out whilst it is empty and during use
     but the limitations on "during use" inspections by their very nature must be
     recognised.

^•   Model Safety Certificate Conditions

     The Popplewell report (paragraph 3.81) suggested that model safety
     certificate conditions should be drawn up.  A standardised form of
     conditions could form the nucleus of all certificates.   Additional
     conditions could be added to cover local conditions.   This would enable some
                                       Page 3


     degree of national uniformity of application of conditions.  It would seem
     appropriate, that the Home Office draw up the standard conditions as it has
     done in respect of byelaws for example.

5.   Resource Implications - Fees

     At present it is suggested in Circular No. 72/1987 that the statutory
     inspection should not result in significant resource implications but that
     in general inspections are not expected to take more than about two man days
     per ground.  This point is made in the context of emphasising the scope of
     inspections, together with associated report work and are not intended to be
     as detailed or extensive as that often required by the holder of the
     certificate.

     Clearly, more time is spent on safety of sports grounds than the Home Office
     anticipates.  The resource implications involved for local authorities and
     their advisers from other services to implement the existing provisions and
     the new recommendations must be recognised.

     Although the certificating authority is allowed to charge fees for dealing
     with applications for the issue or amendment of a certificate (by virtue of
     the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976) there is no express provision
     for fees for the ongoing work of enforcing the provisions of the Act and
     dealing with inspections that have to be carried out at least once a year.
     The Inquiry may wish to consider whether express provisions should be made
     to allow a certificating authority to make some reasonable charge.  There
     are many examples of legislation where local authorities are empowered to
     charge a reasonable fee to cover the cost of administering and enforcing a
     particular licensing function.

6.   Definition of Roles

     The Popplewell Report recommended that there should be urgent consultation
     between the Health and Safety Executive and the Fire Authorities and Local
     Authorities as how best to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and
     reports (.paragraph 3.95).

     It has again become clear during the Inquiry that a lack of clarity in the
     definition of roles, ds well as a lack of communication, can cause problems.
     This is particularly relevant in relation to the Police who are involved in
     the safety, of sports grounds in a number of roles, e.g. a member of the
     Advisory Group, upholders of law and order and their role inside and outside
     the Ground.   It is also relevant to consider if and at what point in an
     emergency the role of the safety officer is subsumed by the emergency
     services.

     Clarification, following consultation, is needed of the different roles
     Authorities are required to fulfil and the means of communication between
     them.

7.   The Advisory Group

     The Police and the Building Authority and, for metropolitan districts
     ■subsequent to local government reorganisation, the Police and the Fire
     Authority, have to be consulted by the certificating authority by virtue of
      the legislation.  Sheffield City Council have included officers from the
     Building Authority and Health and Consumer Services in their Advisory Group
     prior to this Inquiry.
                                                                                     1


                                        Page 4


      The legislation therefore, provides the basis of expert opinion on which the
      Local Authority makes decisions.

      The decision making process can take a number of forms, but perhaps the two
      extremes are:-

      (a) where all the experts are in agreement that decision is delegated to an
      officer of the Council, where one or more experts differ - that decision is
      delegated to an appropriate committee of the Council;

      (b) the appropriate committee considers all matters relating to works
      carried out at the sports ground.

      Further guidance could be given over and above that contained in the interim
      recommendations as to the preferred course of action.

      In addition to the statutory consultees, together with those recommended in
      the Interim Report, i.e., the Ambulance Service, the Club and the recognised
      Supporters' Club, consideration should be given as to whether any other
      bodies should be involved in the wider Advisory Group, e.g., Health and
      Safety Executive.

      It may also be necessary to have a consultation group consisting of Police,
      Fire, Building Authority, Environmental Health, Ambulance Service in
      addition to the wider Advisory Group.

      Members should be able to have professional advice from officers.

8.    Pooling of Information

      Some consideration should be given to pooling information   on anational
      basis to improve the flow of that information.

      Information should be available to all certificating Authorities and their
      statutory consultees.  This would assist to achieve a degree of uniformity
      throughout the country and enable all Authorities to learn from each others
      experiences.

      This is particularly relevant to regional level where the emergency services
      will cover a number of District Authorities.

9.    Safety Management and Safety Planning

      Sports ground management and promoters must accept safety as essential
      aspects of their business and not an adjunct to it.   It is essential for
      safety responsibilities to be clearly identified and for systems of
      accountability to be included.   Any regulations or the "Green Guide" could
      usefully develop this theme. The term safety planning is preferable to that
      of emergency planning in that it makes clear to everyone that the process of
      safety planning is exactly that and an appropriate safety plan should
      promote better safety standards.   All relevant agencies should be included
      in the planning process.  Safety planning is aimed to prevent disasters as
      well as providing contingency plans to ensure emergencies and disasters can
      be coped with.

10.   Status and Content of the "Green Guide"

      A comprehensive review of the status and content of the Green Guide is
      required.  The present guide to safety of sports grounds is predominantly
      written for football single use stadia. Multi use stadia are becoming more
                                      Page 5


    popular and it is suggested that the guide be expanded to cover spectator
    safety requirements pertaining to a wider variety of sports, e.g., speedway,
    stock car racing, hockey, archery, shooting, etc. and other potentially
    dangerous activities.

    In addition, either by expansion of the guide or by the creation of a
    similar document, requirements for spectator safety of fully enclosed stadia
    should be created.

    "Flexibility"

    The 1986 edition of the Green Guide, paragraph 6, states as follows:-

    "Deviations from individual guidelines are possible without necessarily
    detracting from the overall safety of the ground.  The variety of type,
    function and layout of sports grounds means that a flexible approach should
    be maintained to take account of the particular circumstances at individual
    grounds".

    And paragraph 8 states:-

    "It should be borne in mind when using the guide to assess whether existing
    circumstances provide adequately for the safety of spectators the criteria
    to be aimed for is that of a reasonable degree of safety.  It would be
    unreasonable, even if it were practical, to seek the absolute safety of
    everyone attending a ground".

    And, again in paragraph 11:-

    "The principles referred to in paragraphs 4-10 above should be kept in mind
    by both ground management and, where applicable, by the local authority when
    applying the guide to an individual ground.   The guide is an aid to, not a
    substitute for, professional judgment and common sense".

    There is a problem in affording the Green Guide this kind of status. What
    is "flexibility" to one mind may be slap-dash permissiveness to another.
    Clearly, emphasis on flexibility was and is well intentioned, but the effect
    is to produce a code that is not applied tightly and where non-compliance
    can be justified as falling within the scope of some flexible discretion
    allowed to the relevant authority.

    For the future perhaps the Inquiry would wish to consider recommending that
    the approach of the Green Guide should move away from that of "flexibility"
i   to, for example, an approach of the following kind:-

    "That the certificating authority, and where appropriate the club itself,
.   should always seek to establish whether there is some reasonable cause why a
    relevant guideline is not complied with, and that in the absence of some
(   such reasonable cause emerging then compliance with the guideline should be
i   achieved or insisted upon".  A recommendation not to comply with a relevant
    guideline should be in writing and approved by the certificating authority.
    Lf such a decision is considered by the relevant committee of the Council
    then the public will have access to that information.

    Parts of the existing guide could become regulatory and other parts
    re-issued (in a revised form) as a guide cf.  the majority of the Approved
    Documents to the Building Regulations or an "Approved Code of Practice" cf.
    status of an approved code of practice under the Health and Safety at Work,
    Etc., Act 1974.  In the case of documents similar to the Building
    Regulations compliance would therefore not be necessary, yet failure to
                                        Page 6


      comply with the Guide could be taken as being evidence tending to show that
      the requirements had not been met, unless it could be demonstrated by the
      party concerned, using other means, that the requirements of the legislation
      had been satisfied.

11.   Specific Recommendations in relation to the Structure and Design
      Requirements for a Sports Ground

      General Fabric

      It is recommended that the headroom for tunnels be increased from 2.4 metres
      to at least 3 metres to facilitate overhead viewing of any crushing or other
      problems occuring along its length.

      Due to the possible risk of explosion, it is suggested that gas
      installations should not be permitted in any building in the stadia used for
      spectator accommodation,  cf. tower blocks.

      To cater for different speeds of travel through tunnels or restricted
      passageways longer than, say, 5 metres, a minimum of 4 units of exit width
      should be provided.

      Ingress

      Segregation of entrances for supporters of opposing teams is recommended as
      a permanent design criteria.

      Permanent unobstructed access to the pitch area for emergency vehicles to be
      provided in at least two positions, and these being at opposite ends of the
      ground (whenever possible).

      The "guide" states a maximum notional rate of 750 persons per turnstile per
      hour, however it does not state the design time, i.e., the time within which
      all spectators are capable of being admitted.  It is suggested that a
      revised code should state a maximum ingress design time of say, 45 minutes.
      For multi use stadia, in particular, investigation of the flow rate should
      be carried out as rates may differ, e.g., for families with young children..

      Terraces

      Where terraces are to be sub-divided so as to avoid major migration and
      sideways surge, each section should be formed by inserting radial barriers.
      Radial fences should be avoided.

      It is considered that spectator accommodation should not be lower than the
      pitch level or pitch perimeter path level (whichever is the higher), so that
      spectators do not have to step up from the spectator accommodation.
      In the present "guide", it states "gradients steeper than 1:2 (26°, 34')
      could be dangerous" (paragraph 94).   In Table 1 barrier requirements are
      specified for terrace gradients of up to 30° or 1:1.7, therefore
      contradicting the previous statement.   From a graphical interpolation and
      extrapolation of all the relevant data the maximum gradient should be 31°s
      30'.  This equates to approximately 1:1.63.

      Crush Barriers - Design

      To avoid rusting in unseen and non-maintainable places, overclipped barrier
      rail supports should no longer be acceptable.  All parts of barriers should
      be capable of direct inspection and maintenance.
                                                                                   1

                                       Page 7


    Welding of all joints would achieve the aims set out in the above paragraph
    and will create a structural continuity where the failure of an individual
    element would minimise the risk of collapse.

    Consideration should be given to the application of horizontal, (in addition
    to lateral) forces.  This could be taken as 5% of the horizontal force thus
    resisting torsional and secondary effects.

    The recommended heights of the barrier rails should be re-assessed.
    Clarification is also required (preferably by sketch) to show where this
    measurement should be taken from.  The present "guide" appears to make an
    assumption that the barrier rail is in the same vertical plane as the
    terrace riser. When these vertical planes differ, the method of height
    measurement may also differ.  The acid test being at what level a normal
    person would stand who was comfortable, immediately behind the barrier.

    The opportunity should be taken to re-appraise the required test and design
    loads. An increase would achieve a greater resistance to collapse but may
    increase the risk of injury due to resisting greater crowd pressures.  A
    decrease, however, may result in earlier collapse, yet may prevent fatal
    injury.

    Crush Barriers - Testing

    It is suggested that each barrier span should be tested separately (for rail
    strength) and then adjacent spans be tested together to determine rail and
    support strength.

    The specification of the test should be modified to clearly state how
    recovery deflection is to be calculated.  Such a modification should be in
    accordance with the testing procedures in BS 5950 and other similar British
    Standard documents.

    To avoid any further doubt, a standardised test specification and procedure
    is now required.  This should include a specification of a standardised
    testing rig and a standardised test result sheet.

    Stands with seated accommodation

    Although steeper gradients can create better forward viewing for the
    spectators, very steep gradients will have the effect of creating equally
    steep radial gangways and may create a domino effect during an evacuation
    where all persons may be stood - instead of being seated.  No maximum
.   gradient is directly stated in the present guide for seated areas; the only
    tenuous reference being to the maximum calculated gradient for stairways in
    paragraph 73 as being 34°,9'.  It is considered that seated accommodation
    greater than 30° should have intermediate crush barriers at approximately 5
    metre centres.
E
    Pitch Perimeter Fences

    The Popplewell Report (paragraph 4.136 to 4.138 and also Appendix 'E',
    paragraph E29) recommended that consideration should be given to the design
    of a standard efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.

    As a direct result of the Hillsborough disaster it has been suggested that
    spectators may feel reassured by the possibility of forward escape onto the
    pitch from all sides of the ground.
                                  Page 8


If pitch perimeter fences are to remain, it is suggested that at least 50%
of its linear length is openable and such openings are evenly spaced so as
to provide maximum benefit for spectators' safety.

Where pitch side police or stewards require access into the spectator area
through relatively small doors or gates, these may be provided as additional
openings or as wicket gates in the large opening panels.

So as to avoid sudden forward movement, all such gates should be vertically
multi-hinged and open towards the pitch.  Collapsible panels should not be
acceptable.  It is a further pre-requisite that the release mechanism should
b e :-

a) capable of being operational remotely in tandem with others;

b) capable of independent opening whilst under crowd pressure, by the
   operation of a quick release, manually operated catch;

c) all opening devices must be capable of   use under crowd loading
   condi tions.

In order to simplify any new designs of catch for pitch perimeter gates arid
bearing in mind the fact that there should be no spectators on the pitch
side of the opening sections of the perimeter fencing, test loading on
perimeter fences could be reduced to, say 3 KN/m.

Estimation of Space Capacity - Terraces

Under the present "guide", terraces in good condition can be calculated as
capable of holding a maximum of 54 persons per 10 m2 , throughout the .
available terraced area.  It is, however, accepted that some parts of that
area are "peak viewing areas" and as such will achieve in practice agreater
population density due to their popularity.  The figure of 54/10 m 2 is
therefore an average, without the peak viewing parts being given a maximum
packing density.

It is considered that the 54/10 m 2 should be treated as being the maximum
and therefore only be applied to the areas of peak viewing.   Other areas of
the terrace should be’calculated as having a lower packing density, say
40/10 m 2 .

In order to practically achieve the consideration set out in the above
paragraph, it would be necessary to:-

(a)   Define the size and position of "peak viewing areas".

(b)   Surround the areas of "peak viewing" using radial barriers as opposed
      to radial fences.

(c)   Determine by effective stewarding or policing that the crowd density
      of each "peak viewing area" is at a satisfactory, safe and comfortable
      level.

Flow Rates

Throughout the Inquiry, the flow rate of 40 and 60 persons per minute per
unit of exit width have been heavily criticised as being based on
inconclusive research. A practical lesson that has been learned is that
                                        Page 9


      when people are very tightly packed, their ability to flow through exits is
      dramatically reduced. Until the outcome of further research is known, it is
      suggested that flow rates are reduced to the following:-

      (a)   "Peak viewing area" of terraces - 30 persons per minute per unit of
            exit width.

      (b)   All other areas - 40 persons per minute per unit of exit width.

      It is considered that the emergency evacuation time should remain at 2 i
      minutes.

12„   Stewards

      Training of Stewards should be carried out by people who have experience in
      training and safety.  Training should be regular to remind existing Stewards
      of procedures and ensure that new Stewards receive appropriate training.

      The acceptable age range for Stewards should be specified as being between
      eighteen and sixty five years, in addition to the current requirements
      relating to fitness etc.

      A Steward (or a police officer) carrying out isolated tasks, e.g. external
      gate duty, should be provided with an efficient means of communication with
      the Safety Officer.

13.   National First Aid Guidelines

      There is the need for national first aid guidelines which are drawn up with
      particular reference to occasions when large numbers of people are likely to
      be present, e.g.  football matches, pop concerts etc.

      It is also important for the individuals expected to provide first aid to
      receive appropriate training.

14.   Counselling and Support for Victims

      Substantial knowledge and experience now exists about the services the
      public and those directly affected by a disaster need afterwards.   These
      responses are informed by an understanding of the potentially long-term
      needs of victims.  Initiatives must be taken immediately after the disaster
      without waiting for requests for help and be available for a period of at
      least two years.  Their establishment and co-ordination with the voluntary
      sector and between statutory organisations needs to be undertaken on the
      basis of an agreed general plan.  The services have to be carefully
      provided, managed and last appropriate lengths of time, if the bereaved,
      survivors and rescue staff are not to suffer lasting damage.  These
      co-ordinated services are expensive to provide and outside of the normal
      provision made by local authorities.  Therefore their establishment and
      continuance is dependent on new and additional resources being made
      available.  Such separate funding needs to be made available.

15.   Public Appeals

      The legal issues surrounding public appeals are complicated, e.g. charitable
      status, tax etc.  Guidelines are required on the establishment,
      administration and termination of disaster appeals to ensure that funds are
      distributed as fairly, quickly and effectively as possible.

16.   Pre-Match Entertainment

      Further to recommendation 25 in the Interim Report, consideration should be
      given as to whether pre-match entertainment and associated activities can
      influence the type of crowd attending football matches (in particular) and
      for example can therefore be used to encourage family attendance.  Such
      entertainment may also result in staggered entry times.

17.   Day and Time

      Consideration should also be given to what effect changing the day and/or
      time of kick off of football matches, in particular, may have on crowd
      behaviour and therefore crowd safety.

18.   Football Membership Schemes - I.D. Cards

      The Popplewell Report recommends (at paragraph 4.128) that consideration
      should be given to some form of membership scheme for football league clubs
      in England and Wales.

      However, in view of the experiences at Hillsborough, careful consideration
      needs to be given to any national football membership scheme.  It would
      clearly be undesirable if any such scheme resulted in significant delays at
      turnstiles.

      There are other practical considerations which must be taken into account,
      e.g., patterns of attendance, different method of entry, space required for
      a complex admission system, i.e., two turnstile systems, number of
      turnstiles required, additional policing/stewarding required to control the
      crowd- and eject individuals, where to eject individuals from and how and
      reducing further the ground capacity.

19.   All Ticket Entry

      In order to increase the speed of ingress of spectators, consideration could
      be given to requiring all ticket entry for events where greater than, say,
      70% of the total available capacity could be expected.

                                         Page 2



1.    Clarification and Codification of Legislation

      If the Inquiry is minded to recommend amendments of or additions to the
      existing legislation then the opportunity could be taken to codify and
      clarify the legislation.

      The provisions, which are currently contained in the Safety of Sports
      Grounds Act 1975, the Fire Safety and Safety at Places of Sports Act 1987,
      various Regulations and statutory guidance could be remodelled to create one
      Act and Regulations (with functional statements) requiring certain minimal
      standards to be met.

2.    Improvement/Prohibition Notices

       The 1975 legislation (as amended) makes provision for the issue of a
       Prohibition Notice to the holder of a certificate.  It is suggested that
       consideration should be given to including an intermediate cqurse of actiop.
     > The Health and Safety at Work, Etc. Act 1975 makes provision' df the issue of
       Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices.  An Improvement Notice requires
       the employer to carry out certain works within a given time.   If the
       employer fails to comply with the Notice, they are guilty of an offence.

      The power to issue Improvement Notices would be a useful intermediate step
      where a Prohibition Notice is not appropriate, but where some formal Notice
      is required.

3.    Periodic Certificates and Inspections

      The Popplewell Report recommended (at paragraph 3.68) that there should be
      (i) annual renewal of safety certificates issued under the Safety of Sports
      Grounds Act 1975; (ii) a duty on the local authority annually to inspect Che
      premises prior to re-issuing the certificate; and (iii) power for the local
      authority to revoke the certificate.

      The interim recommendations compliment the first proposal; the second
      recommendation was implemented in statutory guidance after the Popplewell
      Report; the third recommendation has not been acted upon.

      With regard to the first recommendation, annual certificates focus the
      parties' minds on the whole situation and not on a particular application or
      inspection.  It tends to promote an overall review of the circumstances
      surrounding the re-issue of a certificate.

      With regard to the second recommendation, it is suggested that prior to
      re-issuing the certificate there should be an inspection, but that there
      should also be inspections on a half-yearly or quarterly basis with guidance
      given as to timing, e.g., prior to renewal, end of season, start of season,
      during season (obviously this is less relevant to multi-use stadia where
      "seasons" are not as clear cut.)

      The Advisory Group should visit the ground whilst empty and during use but
      the limitations on during use inspections by their very nature must be
      recognised.

4.    Model Safety Certificate Conditions

      The Popplewell report (paragraph 3.81) suggested that model safety
      certificate conditions should be drawn up.  A standardised form of
      conditions could form the nucleus of all certificates.   Additional
      conditions could be added to cover local conditions.   This would enable some
                                   Page 3



degree of national uniformity of application of conditions.  It would seem
appropriate, that the Home Office draw up the standard conditions as it has
done in respect of byelaws for example.

Resource Implications - Fees

At present it is suggested in Circular No. 72/1987 that the statutory
inspection should not result in significant resource implications but that
in general inspections are not expected to take more than about two days
per ground.   11118 point is made in the context of emphasising the scope of
inspections , together with associated report work are not intended to be as
detailed or extensive as that often required by the holder of the
certificate.

Clea r ly , more time is spent on safety of sports grounds than the Home Office
anticipates.     The resource implications involved for local authorities and
their advisers from other services to implement the existing provisions and
the new requirements must be recognised.

Although the certificating authority is allowed to charge fees in respect of
dealing with applications for the issue or amendment of a certificate (by
virtue of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976) there is no express
provision for fees for ongoing work enforcing the provisions of the Act and
dealing with inspections that have to be carried out at least oncea year.
The Inquiry may wish to consider   whether express provisions should be made
to allow a certificating authority to make some reasonable charge.    There
are many examples of legislation where local authorities are empowered
to charge a reasonable fee which   covers the cost of administering and
enforcing a particular licensing function.

Definition of Roles

The Popplewell Report recommended that there should be urgent consultation
between the Health and Safety Executive and the Fire Authorities and Local
Authorities as how best to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and
reports (paragraph 3.95).

It has again become clear during the Inquiry that a lack of clarity in the
definition of roles, as well as a lack of communication, can cause problems.
This is particularly relevant in relation to the Police who are involved in
the safety of sports grounds in a number of roles, e.g. a member of the
Advisory Group, upholders of law and order and their role inside and outside
the Ground.

Clarification, following consultation, is needed of the different roles
Authorities are required to fulfil.

The Advisory Group

The Police and the Building Authority and, subsequent to local government
reorganisation, the Police and the Fire Authority, have to be consulted in
certificating authority by virtue of the legislation.

The legislation therefore, provides the basis of expert opinion on which the
Local Authority makes decisions.

The decision making process can take a number of forms, but perhaps the two
extremes are:-
                                        Page 4



      (a) where all the experts are in agreement that decision is delegated to an
      officer of the Council, where one or more experts differ - that decision is
      delegated to an appropriate committee of the Council;

      (b) the appropriate committee considers all matters relating to works
      carried out at the sports ground.

      Further guidance could be given over and above that contained in   the interim
      recommendations as to the preferred course of action.

      In relation to the statutory consultees, consideration should be given as to
      whether any other bodies should be involved in the Advisory Group, other
      than the Ambulance Service, the Club and the recognised Supporters' Club,
      e.g., Health and Safety Executive.

8.    Pooling of Information

      Some consideration should be given to pooling information   on anational
      basis to improve the flow of that information.

      Information should be available to all certificating Authorities and their
      statutory consultees.  This would assist to achieve a degree of uniformity
      throughout the country and enable all Authorities to learn from each others
      experiences.

      This is particularly relevant to regional level where the emergency services
      will cover a number of District Authorities.

9.    Safety Managment and Safety Planning

      Sports ground management and promoters must accept safety as essential
      aspects of their business and not an adjunct to it. It is essential for
      safety responsibilities to be clearly identified and for systems of
      accountability to be included.   Any regulations or the "Green Guide" could
      usefully develop this theme.   The term safety planning is preferable to that
      of emergency planning in that it makes clear to everyone that the process of
      safety planning is exactly that and an appropriate safety plan should
      promote better safety standards.   All relevant agencies should be included
      in the planning process.  Safety planning is aimed to prevent disasters as
      well as providing contingency plans to ensure emergencies and disasters can
      be coped with.

10.   Status and Content of the "Green Guide"

      A comprehensive review of the status and content of the Green Guide is
      required.  The present guide to safety of sports grounds is predominantly
      written for football single use stadia. Multi use stadia are becoming more
      popular and it is suggested that the guide be expanded to cover spectator
      safety requirements pertaining to a wider variety of sports, e.g., speedway,
      stock car racing, hockey, athletics, etc.

      In addition, either by expansion of the guide or by the creation of a
      similar document, requirements for spectator safety of fully enclosed stadia
      should be created.

      ■F le x ib ility "

      The 1986 edition of the Green Guide, paragraph 6, states as follows:-
                                 ■ *   ■;- - “ • . . •—   \\            . . '. n , , : . .   . f» /iwm nL«kifct,^K^iitfia<fciili.‘■rtialto rV ’r- «feifiia&jiStifttS-




                                                               Page 5


      "Deviations from individual guidelines are possible without necessarily
      detracting from the overall safety of the ground.  The variety of type,
      function and layout of sports grounds means that a flexible approach shouLd
      be maintained to take account of the particular circumstances at individual
      grounds".

      And paragraph 8 states:-

      "It should be borne in mind when using the guide to assess whether existing
      circumstances provide adequately for the safety of spectators the criteria
      to be aimed for is that of a reasonable degree of safety.  It would be
      unreasonable, even if it were practical, to seek the absolute safety of
      everyone attending a ground".

      And, again in paragraph 11:—

      "The principles referred to in paragraphs 4-10 above should be kept in mind
      by both ground management and, where applicable, by the local authority when
      applying the guide to an individual ground.  The guide is an aid to, not a
      substitute for, professional judgment and common sense".

      There is a problem in affording the Green Guide this kind of status.  What
      is "flexibility" to one mind may be slap-dash permissiveness to another.
      Clearly, emphasis on flexibility was and is well intentioned, but the effect
      is to produce a code that is not applied tightly and where non-compliance
      can be justified as falling within the scope of some flexible discretion
      allowed to the relevant authority.

      For the future perhaps the Inquiry would wish to consider recommending that
      the approach of the Green Guide should move away from that of "flexibility"
      to, for example, an approach of the following kind:-

      "That the certificating authority, and where appropriate the club itself,
      should always seek to establish whether there is some reasonable cause why a
      relevant guideline is not complied with, and that in the absence of some
      such reasonable cause emerging then compliance with the guideline should be
      achieved or insisted upon".

      Parts of the existing guide could become regulatory and other parts
      re-issued (in a revised form) as a guide c.f. the majority of the Approved
      Documents to the Building Regulations.   Compliance would therefore not be
      necessary , yet failure to comply with the Guide could be taken as being
      evidence tending to show that the requirements had not been met, unless it
      could be demonstrated by the party concerned, using other means, that the
      requirements of the legislation had been satisfied or an an "Approved Code
      of Practice" c.f.   status of an approved code of practice under the Health
      and Safety at Work, Etc., Act 1975.

11.   Specific Recommendations in relation to the Structure and Design
      Requirements for a Sports Ground

      G e n e r a l F a b r ic

      It is recommended that the head room for tunnels be increased from 2.4
      metres to at least 3 metres to facilitate overhead viewing of any crushing
      or other problems occuring along its length.

      So as to dissipate pressure build up from the rear, long tunnels should be
      successively widened in the direction of maximum flow (i.e., means of escape
      r ou te s) .
                                   Page 6



To cater for different speeds of travel through tunnels or restricted
passageways longer than, say, 5 metres, a minimum of 4 units of exit width
should be provided.

Ing ress

Segregation of entrances for supporters of opposing teams is recommended as
a permanent design criteria.

Permanent unobstructed access to the pitch area for emergency vehicles to be
provided in at least two positions, and these being at opposite ends of the
ground (whenever possible).

The "guide" states a maximum notional rate of 750 persons per turnstile per
hour, however it does not state the design time.  It is suggested that a
revised code should state a maximum ingress design time of say, 45 minutes.
For multi use stadia, in particular, investigation of the flow rate should
be carried out as rates may differ, e.g., for families with young children.

T e rra ces

Where terraces are to be sub-divided so as to avoid major migration and
sideways surge, each section should be formed by inserting radial barriers.
Radial fences should be avoided.

It is considered that spectator accommodation should   notbe lower than   the
pitch level or pitch perimeter path level (whichever    isthe higher).

In the present "guide", it states "gradients steeper than 1:2 (26°, 34')
could be dangerous" (paragraph 94).   In Table 1 barrier requirements are
specified for terrace gradients of up to 30° or 1:1.7, therefore
contradicting the previous statement.   From a graphical interpolation and
extrapolation of all the relevant data it is recommended that the maximum
gradient should be 31°, 30'.  This equates to approximately 1:1.63.

C rash B a r r i e r s - D esign

To avoid rusting in unseen and non-maintainable places, overclipped barrier
rail supports should no longer be acceptable. All parts of barriers should
be capable of direct inspection and maintenance.

Welding of all joints would achieve the aims set out inthe above paragraph
and will create a structural continuity where the failure of an individual
element would minimise the risk of collapse.

Consideration should be given to the application of horizontal, (in addition
to lateral) forces. This could be taken as 5% of the horizontal force as
resisting torsional and secondary effects.

The recommended heights of the barrier rails should be re-assessed.
Clarification is also required (preferably by sketch) to show where this
measurement should be taken from.  The present "guide" appears to make an
assumption that the barrier rail is in the same vertical plane as the
terrace riser. When these vertical planes differ, the method of height
measurement may also differ.  The acid test being at what level a normal
person would stand who was comfortable, immediately behind the barrier.

The opportunity should be taken to re-appraise the required test and design
loads.  An increase would achieve a greater resistance to collapse but may
increase the risk of injury due to resisting greater crowd pressures.  A
                                  Page 7


decrease, however, may result in earlier collapse, yet may prevent fatal
injury.

Crash Barriers - Tasting

It is suggested that each barrier span should be tested separately (for rail
strength) and then adjacent spans be tested together to determine rail and
support strength.

The specification of the test should be modified to clearly state how
recovery deflection is to be calculated. Such a modification should be in
accordance with the testing procedures in BS 5950 and other similar British
Standard documents.

To avoid any further doubt, a standardised test specification and procedure
is now required. This should include a specification of a standardised
testing rig and a standardised test result sheet.

Stands with seatedacco— wdation

Although steeper gradients can create better forward viewing for the
spectators, very steep gradients will have the effect of creating equally
steep radial gangways and may create a domino effect during an evacuation
where all persons may be stood — instead of being seated.  The maximum
gradient is directly stated in the present guide for seated areas; the only
tenuous reference being to the maximum calculated gradient for stairways in
paragraph 73 as being 34°,9*.  It is considered that seated accommodation
greater than 30° should have intermediate crush barriers at approximate 5
metre centres.

Pitch Perimeter Fences

The Popplewell Report (paragraph 4.136 to 4.138 and also Appendix 'E',
paragraph E29) recommended that consideration should be given to the design
of a standard efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.

Whether by design or otherwise, forward escape onto the pitch from all sides
of the ground is highly desirable.

If pitch perimeter fences are to remain, it is suggested that at least 502
of its linear length is openable and such openings are evenly spaced so as
to provide maximum benefit for spectators' safety.

Where pitch side police or stewards require access into the spectator area
through relatively small doors or gates, these may be provided as additional
openings or as wicker gates in the large opening panels.

So as to avoid sudden forward movement, all such gates should be vertically
multi-hinged and open towards the pitch. Collapsible panels should not be
acceptable.  It is a further pre-requisite that the release mechanism should
be :-

a) capable of being operational remotely in tandem with others;

b) capable of independent opening whilst under crowd pressure, by the
   operation of a quick release, manually operated catch;

c) all opening devices must be capable of use under crowd loading
   conditions.
                                        Page 8


      In order to simplify any new designs of catch for pitch perimeter gates and
      bearing in mind the fact that there should be no spectators in front of the
      opening sections of the perimeter fencing, test loading on perimeter fences
      could be reduced to, say 3 Kn/m.

      Estimation of Space Capacity - Terrace*

      Under the present "guide", terraces in good condition can be calculated as
      capable of holding a maximum of 54 persons per 10 m 2 , throughout the
      available terraced area. It is, however, accepted that some parts of that
      area are "peak viewing areas" and as such will achieve in practice a greater
      population density due to their popularity.  The figure of 54/10 m 2 is
      therefore an average, without the peak viewing parts being given a maximum
      packing density.

      It is considered that the 54/10 m 2 should be treated as being the maximum
      and therefore only be applied to the areas of peak viewing. Other areas of
      the terrace should be calculated as having a lower packing density, say
      40/10 m 2 .

      In order to practically achieve the consideration set out in the above
      paragraph, it would be necessary to:-

      (a)   Define the size and position of "peak viewing areas".

      (b)   Surround the areas of "peak viewing" using radial barriers.

      (c)   Calculate the maximum population of each "peak viewing area" and
            adequately steward to see that this is not exceeded.

      Flow Rates

      Throughout the Inquiry, the flow rate of 40 and 60 persons per minute per
      unit of exit width have been heavily criticised as being based on.
      inconclusive research. A practical lesson that has been learned is that
      when people are very tightly packed, their ability to flow through exits is
      dramatically reduced. Until the outcome of further research is known, it is
      suggested that flow rates are reduced to the following

      (a)   "Peak viewing area" of terraces - 30 persons per minute per unit of
            exit width.
      (b)   All other areas - 40 persons per minute per unit of exit width.

      It is considered that the emergency evacuation time should remain at   2i
      minutes.

12.   Stewards

      Training of Stewards should be carried out by people who have experience in
      training and safety. Training should be regular to remind existing Stewards
      of procedures and ensure that new Stewards receive appropriate training.

      The acceptable age range for Stewards should be specified as being between
      eighteen and sixty five years, in addition to the current requirements
      relating to fitness etc.

      A Steward (or a police officer) carrying out isolated tasks, e.g. external
      gate duty, should be provided with an efficient means of communication with
      the Safety Officer.
                                        Page 9


13.   National First Aid Guidelines

      There is the need for national first aid guidelines which are drawn up with
      particular reference to occasions when large numbers of people are likely to
      be present, e.g. football matches, pop concerts etc.

14.   Counselling and Support for Victims

      The need for guidance and training for those professionals involved in
      counselling and support for victims in the aftermath of a disaster requires
      investigation.

      In conjunction with that, the issue of long term support needed by victims
      of the disaster, also requires consideration.

      Both issues need to be discussed by a variety of agencies including:-

      Social Services, The Health Service (including GPs), organisations assisting
      the bereaved, Samaritans etc.

15.   Public Appeals

      The legal issues surrounding public appeals are complicated, e.g. charitable
      status, tax etc. Guidelines are required on the establishment,
      administration and termination of disaster appeals to ensure that funds are
      distributed as fairly, quickly and effectively as possible.

16.   Football Membership Schemes - I.D. Cards

      The Popplewell Report recommends (at paragraph 4.128) that consideration
      should be given to some form of membership scheme for football league clubs
      in England and Wales.

      However, in view of the experiences at Hillsborough, careful consideration
      needs to be given to any national football membership scheme.  It would
      clearly be undesirable if any such scheme resulted in significant delays at
      turnstiles.

      There are other practical considerations which must be taken into account,
      e.g., patterns of attendance, different method of entry, space required for
      a complex admission system, i.e., two turnstile systems, number of
      turnstiles required, additional policing/stewarding required to control the
      crowd and eject individuals, where to eject individuals from and how,
      reducing further the ground capacity.

17.   All Ticket Entry

      In order to increase the speed of ingress of spectators, consideration could
      be given to requiring all ticket entry for events where greater than, say,
      70% of the total available capacity could be expected.

18.   All Seater Stadia

      Consideration should be given to whether all seater stadia should be
      mandatory. Alternatively, the legislation could be used to prescribe a
      minimum percentage of seated capacity for stadia.  Such a percentage could
      differ for various sizes, types and uses of the stadia.

             With reference to your letter dated 23rd August, 1989                       ,
        regarding the Hillsborough disaster,) this Hillsborough
        Working Party has been requested, on behalf of Liverpool
        City Council, to respond to the concerns, registered in your
        letter, of Members of your Authority and those Members who
        also serve on the South Yorkshire Police Authority.

             Prom our own enquiries into the Hillsborough tragedy,
        and from a full reading of the transcripts from the
        Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry, we fully agree with
        Lord Justice Taylor's unequivocal contention (para 286 of
        his Interim Report). "The poor performance by the City
        Council of its duties in regard to the Safety Certificate
        was inefficient and dilatory. The failure to revise or
        amend the Certificate over the period of three years
        preceding this disaster, despite important changes in the
        layout of the ground, was a serious breach of duty. There
        was, as a result, no fixed capacities for the pens. The
        Certificate took no account of the 1981 and 1985 alterations
        to the ground,"

              We contend that the comments of the Leader of this City
         Council are fully vindicated in respect of the 'poor
         performance' of y o u r Authority in its duties and obligations
         to the Hillsborough Safety Certificate.

              Further to the issue of resignations, this Working
         Party, on behalf of the City Council, has continued, and
         will continue to call for the resignation of those officials
         within Sheffield City Council responsible for the
         Hillsborough Safety Certificate and the Chairman of the
         South Yorkshire Police Authority.

              Your Members concern at the comments of Mr. Norman Bush
         (Liverpool City Council's Chief Building Surveyor) is
         somewhat perplexing given the Considerable offence' already
         caused to the families, relatives and friends of the
         bereaved and injured.

              Finally, your response to the Norman Bush article
         has added insult to an enormous injury and which we hope you
         will forgive us saying perhaps demonstrates a lack of
         sensitivity to the feelings of Merseyside people. The fact
         is that your Authority's administration of the Safety
         Certificate up to the 19th April 1989 showed a dereliction
         of duty and responsibility which proved to be “a recipe for
         disaster.”

                                                         Hillsborough Working Pa£ty.

RE: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Liz Bashforth received a telephone call from             , telephone number
                    ~j. She is involved in preparing a documentary on the
Hillsborough Disaster on behalf of Yorkshire Television.   The documentary
is to be based upon inquiry material and is to have a human touch.   The
Graphics Department require plans to draw plans and prepare a model.   They
have not asked the Club.  They had approached Liverpool Buildingf Surveyor
who referred them to our Building Surveyor who in turn referred them to
us.  They require a good set of plans and elevations for the whole of the
ground and related buildings, including the gym at the back.

Liz asked me to look into the matter.  I had a look at the plans that we
had within our own Department.  These consisted in the main of plans
submitted by Eastwood and Partners on behalf of the Club.  It was fairly
clear that most of these had been submitted for planning and building
regulation approval and also had an ancillary purpose in that they were
used for Safety of Sports Grounds applications.

I spoke to M r . e x t .           , in the Department of Land and Planning.
He said that all our current plans were with the Building Surveyor.    The
difficulty that he could see was that the copyright in the plans, submitted
are held by the author.   The consent of the author has to be given before
the plan can be released.   The plans are on public deposit and can be
inspected by anyone but a copy cannot be taken without consent.

I spoke to Arthur Butler on the 26th October, 1989. He advised me that
since 1979, all the drawings relating to Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club, with the exception of two schemes, have been sent via Eastwoods and
thus the consent of Eastwoods will be needed.   The plans concerning the
Leppings Lane end consist of a transfer of information from the previous
consultants to Eastwoods Drawings.   They do not bear a complete
resemblance to the layout.   The only two which show the true layout is
one which was done by the Health and Safety Executive and produced by
Braids.  Again copyright   applies to that.  Part of it was reproduced    in
the interim   report.  The second accurate drawing was that which was
produced by   the Building Surveyor one week after the event but was not
used at the   Inquiry.  It is accurate within its limited area and has    alot
of detail about Pens 3 and 4 and the concourse at the back.   The details
is less accurate in Pens 1 and 2 and 5 , 6 and 7 because they were banned
from the Ground at that stage.

I telephoned             on 26th October and explained that there was a
problem about copyright.  I did not advise her about the plan prepared by
our Building Surveyors in view of Arthur's reservations about the accuracy
of it.  She is going to approach the Health and Safety Executive and the
Club to progress the matter further.  Failing that, she will come back to
me.

fact that, while the maximum crowd capacity for the Spion Kop
terrace
at Bramall Lane Sports Ground was specified in the relevant Safety
Certificate as 14,550, according to calculations based on the
requirements of the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds,
the capacity of the exits serving the area was 11,040. The meeting
was attended by the Engineering Consultant for Sheffield United
Football Club Ltd. and a representative of the South Yorkshire
County Fire Service and the Acting Head of Administration and Legal
Department reported verbally on the recommendations made in the
matter by the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group at its meeting
held on 11th October, 1989.
          The Engineering Consultant stated that the Company wished
to ask that the permitted number of spectators on the Spion Kop
terrace at the Bramall Lane Sports Ground remain at 14,550 for at
least three months to enable the Company to improve the access to
accommodate that level, in view of the fact that walkways were
somewhat wider than the figures used in the calculation, gates onto
the pitch were permanently open and current Police practice was to
hold certain sections of the crowd until others had left the ground.
RESOLVED: That, in the circumstances now reported^ the crowd
capacity on the Spion Kop terrace at the Bramall Lane Sports Ground
be restricted to 11,040.

Dear Mr. Taylor,
                Capacity of Hillsborough Stadium

     Thank you for your letter of ?.Qth July enclosin.3 a
copy of the Chief Constable’s letter dated loth July in
connection with the Ground Capacity of Hillsbor-usn
Stadium.

     I understand the words "scientific calculation’’ were
used by your goodself in the original tenns of reference
to us but in the absence of any known foraula vje have
denlt with this matter by empirical means.

      We assembled a small crowd of people in our drawing
office to represent a snaple of a crowd standing reasonably
close together. We then established a coefficient of 1.^4
lineal feet per person on each step of terrace, each person
be ins allocated the full depth of the terrace whatever its
dimension.

     We then referred to our detailed surveys of the terrace
and we also measured on site the known usable length of the
terrace steps, nuking due allowance for ^an^ays, passageways
stairways, ecc. and the length of each section was divided
by the coefficient to establish the capacity.

     We regard the fore;;, ins as an interim approach to the
problem, until such time as the coefficient could be checked
by the use of crowd counting devices.

                               Yours sincerely.
                                                                                                                                    s

    Dear Sir

    DON VALLEY STADIUM

    Chief Inspector Waring of the Operations Division attended a site meeting at
    the Stadium on 5 December 1989• As a result of that meeting, and his subsequent
    discussion with me, I wish to make the following comments in relation to the
    Stadium in particular:-

    1     I draw to your attention to the plan, reference number A2/5158.2/1001/B
           showing the North East Bankings Option A. The site of the turnstiles
           produces a 'funnelling effect'for spectators which is quite unacceptable
           following the experience at the Hillsborough Ground.

    2     The 'queueing density' in the area designated for spectators wishing to
           gain entrance at the proposed turnstiless 1-8 of 48 person per 10 square
           metres is, in my view, far too high and the area for queueing should be
          ■ increased to reduce that density to a more acceptable level.

    3      It would be unwise, in my view, to make firm proposals in relation to
           spectators safety•without awaiting the final report of Lord Justice Taylor*

    4     Accepting that the stadium is to be built to accommodate in the first
           instance spectators for the World Student Games, then full consideration
           should be given to consider the extremes of spectator behaviour since I
           understand the use of the stadium will not be exclusively for athletic
           ewepfll'ii and we could see the whole range of sports being played in the
           stadium and the type of supporters and behaviour associated with those
           different sports.

    5      M y understanding from Chief Inspector Waring is that the Fife Brigade are
           not happy with the emergency evacuation of spectators from the upper tier
           of temporary seating which is shaded red on the plan, especially the escape
           to the rear of that tiered seating, and I would appreciate further
           discussion on this point.




            THE OFFICER DEALING WITH THIS CORRESPONDENCE IS            EXTENSION

        ADM/1
Finally, I would wish to make the point most strongly that the police do not
have the expertise to interpret detailed plans of sports stadia and other plans
associated with safety aspects within those stadia.

I know you appreciate the importance of expert advice on safety matters, and
that is something that the police cannot undertake in relation to detailed
plans and drawings.

Yours faithfully

     Dear Sir                                                                                                                            :

     Don Valley Stadium - The Hill

     Further to the meeting held at Don Valley Stadium on the
     29 November 1989 re the seating arrangements on 'The Hill', we
     forward the following comments.

    Please note that these comments are based on the information
    contained in your plan A2/5158.2/1001/B dated 19 October 1989 and
    relate only to outline means of escape and exit routes.
                                                                                                                                   'V.
     1       The dimensions shown on the plan give a total of 81 units of
             exit widths. For the 9650 capacity (seats), this will allow                                                 ;;
             an exit time of within the 2.5 minutes for emergency                                                                             -4
                                                                                                                         v

                                                                                                                                         -V,

    < )      With regards to the exit to the rear of temporary seating
             (ticket events only), our calculations show that this
             rearward route is not necessary and that the remaining exits                                                W * %\
             can accommodate the additional 1200 persons.

    3        The final seating layout and construction must conform to the
             standards given in Section 125, 126 and 127 of the Guide to
             Safety at Sports Grounds.                                                                                                       v>.


    4      s The exit flow from the top of the hill meets in conflict with
             the flow frontturnstile 9.12.
                                                                                                                             : i:i             :~f '
             Should the hill route be retained, the junction of these flows
             should be so arranged that they merge smoothly.

                                                                                                                         ,                      '

  Dear Sir

  SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 (AS /MOLDED)
  SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB - WEST STAND

  I am writing to inform you that on Saturday, 9 December 1989, a police
  officer on duty in the West Stand of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
  Hillsborough, noted the existence of cracks in a concrete structure. These
  cracks are located at the top two stairways which give access to the Stand,
  and they appear to have resulted from the stairway structure settling at a
  different rate to the body of the Stand, thus causing cracks where the
  separate structures join together.

  The crack at the top of the stairway normally used by spectators who have
  entered the ground between turnstiles 9 and 16 was sufficiently wide enough
  to enable the officers to see the ground below.

  I am informed that whilst the cracks are extensive in length, they are
  quite narrow in width, and appear to have been filled on a previous
  occasion.    I am also informed that the faults are not indicative of
  immediate danger but are sufficiently serious enough to warrant further
  investigation by a structural engineer.

 These cracks have been brought to the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell and it
 is understood that the matter is to be investigated by Eastwoods, Sheffield
 Wednesday's consultant engineer.

                                                    Buildings Engineer examine this apparent
  structural, defect.

            Safety of Sports Grounds
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club - West Stand


            I write in connection with the letter received from SouthYorkshirePolice
            (Ref. F/RM/DR, 21 December 1989), regarding the existence of cracking in a
            concrete stairway adjacent to the West Stand.

            A site inspection was made on 3 January, 1990 by Mr Sheriff and Mr
            of my Structural Assessment Unit and Mr Strange of Eastwood and Partners.

            The cracks are typical of.those that were observed in the area several
            years ago and have been subsequently monitored. They are caused primarily
            by the relative movements of the adjacent structural elements which have
            been designed to act independently.

            Although not aesthetically desirable, the         cracking does not present any
            problem from the structural safety aspect         but it is apparent that some
            maintenance work is .needed in this area.         This item is alreaG^?S6h^d®p$f
            and Mr Strange has agreed to progress the         matter.

            I am grateful for the observations made and interest shown by the South
            Yorkshire Police.

         Dear Sir

         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
         Hospitality Suites
         Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975

         Further to the inspection of the three hospitality suites at the
         above premises on 12 December 1989 the following observations are
         forwarded for your attention.

         1       A 9 litre water extinguisher is required in each suite. The
                 extinguishers are to be hung on wall brackets, adjacent the
                 fire alarm break-glass call point, so that the carrying
                 handles are about 1 metre above the floor.

         2       Documents should be forwarded confirming that the upholstered
                 furniture satisfies the requirements   of BS 5852: Part 1:  1979
                 and the crib ignition source 5 of BS   5852: Part 2: 1982.

         3        "Fire Door Keep Shut" notices are required                              on both faces of
J                 the suite entry doors.

         4       The switching device for the extract fans that allows the
                 fans to reverse direction requires disconnecting so that they
                 only extract the air from and not force air into the suites.

For the attention of Mr. J. Derricott


Dear Mr. Derricott,
                                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                                                  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                                                West Stand

                We have pleasure in enclosing eight prints of each of our
drawings 12267/1,2 and 3.                                                 The drawings have been prepared in
response to the letter dated 17 November 1989 from South Yorkshire
County Fire Service to your department.                                                                   A copy of that letter was
received by us on 9 December 1989.
                Drawing 12267/1 shows the proposed seating arrangement.
Widening the gangways by removing the adjacent seats will leave 4192
seats.                   New concrete steps will be placed in the widened gangways
where seats have been taken out.
                We believe it reasonable to accept a 60 persons/m flow rate
from the two, 4 unit staircases at the back of the stand giving a
capacity of 3840 and, in addition another 640, using a flow rate
of 40 persons/m from the 2 unit wide front staircase at the south
corner of the stand.                                         This gives a capacity of 4480 which is
greater than the proposed number of seats.
                Drawing 12267/2 shows details of the new handrails to be

Associates.

installed down the flights of the two rear staircases and drawing
12267/3   (A3 size) shows the handrail modifications on the front
staircase at the south end of the stand.   The segregation barrier
in the seated area of the stand has already been removed together
with the fences and gates on the 1st floor concourse and the gate
at the bottom of the front staircase.
     It is proposed that the brickwork dividing wall at the back
of the stand is demolished and the foundation brickwork covered
with concrete to give unhindered movement towards the final exit
gates B and C.
     The comments of the Advisory Group would be welcomed.

 For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell

 Dear Mr. Mackrell,

                                              inspection of South Stand Roof


              On 1 November John Strange, accompanied by Arthur Butler and
                             Iof the Building Surveyor's Division, made an inspection
  of the south stand roof.                                       You will recall that twice yearly
  inspections were one of the                                             conditions made by the General Purposes
  Panel at              their meeting held on 2 February 1987 for the permitted use
 of the stand.                     Other conditions were imposed as set out on the
  appended extract of the minutes of that meeting.                                                                                 Those conditions
  resulted from recommendations made in the report, dated 2 February
  1987, prepared by the Building Surveyor's Division.                                                                                     A copy of that
  report is also appended to this report.
        The strengthening work recommended in item 6.3 was completed
  in 1987, together with repairs to some of the timber boards, purlins
  and access hatches.
       Considering the stand is over 76 years old, the steelwork is in
  remarkably good condition and there is v e r y little corrosion
  evident.The top layer of paint, which we believe                                                                                      was applied in
  1966, is              unsightly where it is peeling and flaking off the paint
  beneath, but the original paint still provides adequate protection
  to the majority of the steelwork.

       The top and bottom booms of the roof trusses-y\ comprise steel
 angles fastened together back-to-back with a gap of about 6mm
 between the two.       It is almost impossible to apply paint to the
 steel on the inside of the gap and as a result there is some light
 rusting on those^efs, but the loss of metal is insignificant.              The
 horizontal legs of the top boom angles are also lightly rusted
 where paint has not been applied properly to the steel, but again
 the loss of metal is minuscule.
       Inspections of the roof began in 1985 when it was noticed that
 some of the roof trusses were out-of-plumb.       This has been measured
 in past inspections, and we are of the opinion that the twisting has
 not worsened significantly.       The trusses which appear to be most
 out-of-plumb are numbers 7, 8 and 9, counting from and including the
 gable facing Spion Kop.      We estimate that trusses 7 and 8 are
 approximately 70mm out-of-plumb and truss 9 about 115mm, at the
 worst position along their length.
       On the underside of the timber boards there are patches of
 water staining, especially over the back few rows of seats.          The
 majority of the boards appear sound, but there is evidence of the
 oriset of decay in some of the boards.     However, in most cases the
 decay is not serious at present, but we recommend that above seats
 39, 71, 110, 114, 206, 215, 232 and 233, row Z, those boards are
 either taken out and replaced with new or a panel of 9mm thick
 exterior quality plywood nailed to the underside      of the boards to
 maintain the horizontal diaphragm action offered      by the timber.
       Along the back of the stand there is a substantial timber
 member which fills the gap between the underside      of the gutter and
 the concrete eaves beam.      That member is split and rotten in places
 where we believe rainwater has run on to it from leaks in the
 gutter.   This is most noticeable behind seats 8, 9, 15, 16, 27 to
 35, 39, 55 and 77.      However, the member does not have structural
 importance and we therefore suggest that it is not necessary to
 treat the decay at present.      The member will be removed when the
 new roof is built over the stand.
      The concrete eaves beam above seats 31 and 32 is spalled and
 we recommend that the beam is repaired using a polymer based
 cementitious mortar, as specified for other concrete repairs round
 the ground.

         The timber purlins appear to be generally -sound.   Some, which
  were found to be cracked a few years ago were supplemented with new
  purlins alongside to support the roof boards.      Others were treated
  similarly when the steel bracing was introduced in 1987.
         It was also discovered in 1987 that the corrugated roof
  sheeting is very brittle.      This is normal for such sheeting of its
  age.    We fear that if attempts are made to replace damaged sheets,
 the workmen will cause even more damage.       This is likely to result
  in more leaks, not less.
         The concern of the Building Survey's Division about the
  leaking roof was primarily associated with the possible rusting of
 the steelwork.       Where the steelwork has been inspected no serious
 corrosion has been found.       Hence, rusting is no longer a cause for
 concern.
         On the external camera platform it was noted that each of the
 two plywood commentary boxes have been secured with four steel guy
 ropes.     However, one box is not in good condition.    The door has
 broken off and the timber is beginning to be affected by the
 weather. We therefore recommend that, if not used, the box is
 removed from the platform, or repaired if use is to be contained.
 Two of the guy ropes on the boxes were found to be slack and we
 recommend that they be tightened up.
         The horizontal timber member, to which the guard rail is
 fastened, was seen to be loose in the west corner of the platform.
 That timber should be repaired and firmly secured to the structure.^
         Item 5.8, page 9, of the Officer's Interim Comments, sent to
 the Club on 17 August asks that consideration be given to
 increasing the height of the guard rail along the front of the
 platform.     Looking at the height of the rail, perhaps it is little
 lower than is desirable for the peace-of-mind of people using the
 platform.     We therefore suggest that the verticals are extended and
 a new horizontal rail added.       The design strength of the rail would
 need to be checked.
         Item 5.6, page 8, of the Officer's Interim Comments, questions
 the stability of the camera platform.       You will recall that in
 April 1988 Messrs. Husband & Co. were asked to report on the
EASTW O O D f t PARTNERS                                        SHEET




  structure on behalf of the B.B.C.       A copy of Husband's letter dated
  8 April 1988 to the Engineering Manager of Television Outside
  Broadcasts is attached.


  Summary


  1)   The steelwork is in good condition and other than making
        another inspection in say May next year, we believe that no
        maintenance or remedial work is necessary.


  2)   Where decayed, the timber boards should either be replaced
        with new or covered with a panel of 9mm thick external quality
        plywood.


  3)   The spalled concrete on the eaves beam should be hacked off
        and repaired properly.


  4)   The timber purlins appear to be in good condition and we
        believe that further repairs are not necessary.


  5)   The dilapidated commentary box on the camera platform should
        either be removed or repaired.                                  ^


  6)   The slack guy ropes securing the two commentary boxes should
        be tightened, if the boxes are to remain on the platform.


  7)   The height of the guard rail along the front of the camera
        platform should be increased and the strength should be
        checked.

STRUCTURAL CONDITION OF THE SOUTH STAND

Introduction
  „*
This report is produced in response to the request by the General Purposes
Panel held on 5th January, 1987 for a report on the structural condition of
the South Stand.

It does not deal with other aspects such as Fire or Police Authorities'
responsibilities.  The Fire Authority's approval of the South Stand was given
in correspondence presented to the meeting.

The report outlines in general terms the structural matters involved and
associated legal considerations, together with recommendations which should be
observed to give a further five years' use of the Stand.

1.0   Construction and Design Concept

1.1   The South Stand was built in 1913.   It consists of steel roof trusses and
      columns supported on concrete bases.   Roof cladding is of timber joist
      and board construction fixed to the roof steelwork.   Timber decking and
      seating is fastened to a reinforced concrete floor system.

1.2   The structural design concept is that all vertical loads from self weight
      and imposed snow loading are transferred through the roof construction to
      the front and rear supporting columns to foundation level.

      Lateral wind loads are resisted by the roof elements forming a diaphragm
      to transfer horizontal forces through the columns and back to shear walls
      and foundations.

2.0   Comparison with' Current Regulations

2.1   The structure would have been designed to comply with the Bye-Laws and
      Codes of Practice existing at the time.  The design wind and imposed
      loads recommended in these Codes would be less than used at present.
      Permitted design stresses would also be less although it is possible that
      the steel used in construction may compare favourably with that produced
      today.

2.2   An analysis of the structure has been carried out by the Structural
      Assessment Unit of the Building Surveyor's Division using modern finite
      element computer techniques and assessed to current Codes of Practice.

      The result is that under the extreme loading conditions envisaged by the
      Codes several members are overstressed and it must be concluded that the
      structure would not comply with present Building Regulations.

2.3   It should be borne in mind, however, that the basis of this report is to
      make recommendations for the safe use of the structure over a projected
      period of u p to five years.

      No building can ever be guaranteed to function perfectly over an
      indefinite period and the design parameters given in Coaes of Practice
      are based on an accepted statistical probability of limits being exceeded.
0    Safety at Sports Grounds Act

1    Sheffield Wednesday F.C. became designated in accordance with the Act in
     August 1978 and a Safety Certificate was issued by the Administration
     Authority (then South Yorkshire) in conjunction with the Buiilding, Fire
     and Police Authorities in December 1979 (effective from 21st December, 191

2,    A large number of modifications to the Stand have been carried out in
     recent years in order to comply with the Act.  These have included
     reinstatement of corroded members, strengthening of elements such as
     staircases and repair of spalled concrete.  Testing, maintenance and
     survey work is always on-going to meet the safety needs.

3    It is perhaps in these areas that the Certificate requirements should be
     more formalised with particular reference to the South Stand and some
     recommendations are given in paragraph 6 .0 .

0    General Structural Appraisal

1    The roof trusses are out of alignment in several instances and although
     this may have existed for a long time, there is bound to be a loss of
     structural efficiency.

2    From an overall stability aspect there appears to be lack of bracing
     particularly between the main columns and in the extremities of the roof.

3    On the credit side the structure is orientated such that the most severe
     wind load condition (from the south-west) would have least effect.  Over
     its life-span so far the structure has shown up well to the severe
     loading conditions encountered from both wind and snow.

0    Legal Administration

1    The Authority has two main safeguards in       this respect

     a) Safety at Sports Grounds Act and the clauses in the Safety
        Certificate.  These would ensure that spectators would not be present
        during the extreme conditions outlined - although it is doubtful
        whether an event could take place under such conditions anyway.

     b) Building Act 1984 sections 77 and 78.   In this case the Authority
        could act directly to ensure the safety of staff or other persons at
        the ground by either the obtaining of a Court Order or in extreme
        circumstances taking action to remedy danger itself.

0    RECOMMENDATIONS - The South Stand should      be satisfactory to be used for a
                       further period of five years, provided the following
                       points are observed:-

1    An immediate inspection and survey of the Stand should be carried out by
     the Club's Consulting Engineer in conjunction with the Authority's
     Building Surveyor's staff.  A similar inspection and survey to be
     undertaken twice a year.

2     Planned maintenance to be carried out by the Club,particularly    to
     prevent water penetration through the roof.

3     Proposals to be submitted for approval by The Building   Surveyor of   an y
     bracing and strengthening works required.
                                     - 3 -


6.4   The Safety Certificate to be amended to include paragraph 6.1 and to be
      re-drafted to ensure that spectators will not be in attendance under
      extreme loading conditions.

6.5   The Club to be reminded of the Authority's powers under sections 77 and
      78 of the Building Act 1984 in relation to dangers to persons generally.

Dear Sir,

Sheffield Wednesday South Stand
T.V. Camera Platform

We write in response to your request for us to comment on the
perceptible vibration of the platform, resulting from personnel
movements.

Following our meeting and inspection of the platform on 5th April,
we confirm that in the subsequent conversation with you at the
ground the writer gave his opinion that the small amount of
movement noticeable did not warrant concern, being quite normal
for such cantilever construction, and there did not appear to be
any evidence of structural weakness.   We understand that the
total loading will not exceed 16 men plus 3 cameras each weighing
500 lbs,and some ancillary equipment weighing approximately
500 lbs total, and that the loading will be distributed.

We are pleased to reassure you in this instance, and should you
have any other structural problems, we should be glad to be of
assistance.

We shall send an account for our fees shortly.

Yours faithfully,
HUSBAND ft CO.

                I refer to the above report dated December 1989, prepared by Eastwood and
                Partners, the contents of which are noted.

                I am pleased to note that a structural assessment of the cantilevered
                camera platform was carried out in April 1988.

                Regarding the increase in the height of the balustrading to the camera
                platform, I trust you will confirm to the club, the necessity to submit
&               their detailed proposals for structural checking by my staff.     ^

  For the attention of Mr J Derricott


 Dear Sirs

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975
 HILLSBOROUGH - ACCESS FOR DISABLED, NORTH STAND

 In reply to correspondence from Eastwood and Partners dated 1st December,
 1989, and which enclosed plan number 12186/1, please find the observations of
 this department in respect of means of escape listed below:-

  1.       The proposed ramp would appear to be satisfactory but it is noticed that
           whilst the travel distance from the furthest point of the enclosure to
           the head of the ramp is still within 30m, the distance to the foot of
           the ramp is considerably more than in the original scheme. Also, where
           the original ramp led to an area with easy access to the escape route
           behind the north stand, the new ramp terminates on the pitch perimeter
         ■ track.

           With the foot of the ramp terminating on the pitch perimeter track, tijiis
           upward slope between the north stand and the Kop has now to be
           negotiated by wheelchair users. Details of the gradient of this slope
           are not shown and it may be that it is too steep at the top ettd. TMiif?
           needs further investigation.

 3.        The original recommendation for stewards in the disabled section was one
           at the head of the ramp and one covering the foot of the ramp and the
           gate. These were detailed in correspondence to you dated 16th November,
           1989.   It may now be the case that an additional steward may be.;
           necessary at the foot of the ramp. This can be determined when the ramp
           is nearing completion.


                                                                                                     continued




                                 All communications to be addressed to the Chief Fire Officer.
 The above matters should be brought to the attention of the other members of
 the Advisory Group for their observations but if there are any queries, please
 do not hesitate to contact the officer concerned.

^Yours faithfully




 Chief Fire Officer

        New access ramp for the disabled - North Stand




I refer to the letter from Eastwood and Partners dated
1st December, 1989, and the accompanying drawing 12186/1 regarding the
above.

My observations on the scheme are:-

1.    The general ergonomic design of the structure generally      satisfies
       the design criteria for such a ramp.

2.    The steel diamond pattern open tread flooring must not have
       perforations exceeding 20mm wide.

3.    The handrail at the base of the ramp should be extended to the
       bottom of the ramp.

4.      Mesh balustrading should be provided on the external face of the
        rails from the first landing to the head of the ramp.

5.      Structural calculations required to substantiate design.

     Dear Sir,

     SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB
     SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUND ACT 1975
     NO SMOKING SIGNS: JOHN STREET STAND

     I have to inform you that the large no-smoking signs provided on
     the inside face of the roof extremity, along the length of the
     timbered stand have been removed by the Fire Service.

    One, of the total of three signs, had fallen from its chain
    fastening at some time prior to 26th December 1989. On the
    morning of the 26th December 1989, at the request of, and after
    liaison with the club it was decided to remove the remaining two
    signs for safety reasons prior to the game with Leeds United.

    It would appear that these signs were installed at the request of
    the Building Surveyor, minuted 4.5 in the minutes attached to your
    letter dated 17th August 1989 to the club. There will obviously
    be a need to consider replacing the signs that have been removed.

     If you require any further information please do not hesitate to
     contact this department.

    Yours faithfully,




    Divisional Commander

            I refer to the attached letter frcm the South Yorkshire County Fire
            Service dated 29th December, 1989, regarding the above.

            I am concerned that these signs had to be removed as dangerous structures
            on the 26th December 1989, when they had only been erected on the
            23rd December 1989. Clearly, the means of fixings employed by the Club
            were unsatisfactory and could have had dangerous consequences to members
            of the public using that stand.

            I trust you will express to the Club, the Council's dissatisfaction of
            that means of fixing, and require the reinstatement of the signs in the
            designated positions, using permanent and secure fastenings.

                    For the attention of Mr. D. Capper


                    Dear Sir,
                    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (as amended)
                    LPG Storage Compound_ ___________________ _
                    I refer to your letter of 5th January, 1990 a copy of which is attached.

                    I note that you have re-appraised the use of LPG at the Ground and decided
                    not to store LPG on the premises.
                    I am concerned that the Club’s independent caterers will be responsible for
                    removing LPG cylinders from the Ground after use on match days.

                    To ensure that all cylinders are removed please will you arrange for the
                    caterers to record with you in some way, how many cylinders they have
                    brought into the Stadium and after use that all cylinders have been removed.
                    I also feel that a person at the Club should be designated to check that ail
                    cylinders have in fact been removed after the caterers have vapated the
                    premises. For information purposes will you also detail, in writing, where
                    the cylinders will be sighted around the Ground on match days.

                    Please confirm, in writing, to my Chief Licensing Officer that you have
                    arranged an appropriate procedure to ensure that cylinders are removed from
                    the Ground.

                    Yours faithfully,




                     Head of Department.

For the attention of Mr J . Derricott

Dear Sirs,
                                             Sheffield  United Football Clufe
                                             nprti fication of Safety Systems

             We write to report progress on the testing and certification of
the safety systems at the above ground.


a)           Emergency Lighting System

             An inspection took place in collaboration with the South
             Yorkshire County Fire Service on Tuesday 12 December 1989
             during darkness. The emergency lighting installation was found
             to be satisfactory, subject to some minor improvements and
             additions which are needed to cover changed circumstances. We
             are awaiting confirmation of these requirements from the Fire
             Service, and as soon as this is received we will make
             arrangements with the Club for implementation of the
             recommended work. Following this we will be in a position to
             issue a test certificate.

Fire Warning System


This is tested operationally each match day, and we will bgjaj^i
a position to issue a test certificate on completion of tire
wiring tests which are being carried blit in conjunction with
the general testing of the electrical systems.

General Electrical Systems


The electrical installations are very extensive and comprise
many hundreds of circuits.   This is being tackled on stand by
stand basis in the order, Bramall Lane, John Street, Spion Kop
and finally the South Stand.

So far, Bramall Lane and John Street stands have been checked
out, and we have a complete list of remedial work which is
necessary. We are at present waiting for prices from the
contractors before we can proceed on these. The majority of the
work relates to improvements needed to match stricter
standards, rather than repairs to deteriorated equipment.

Testing is now on hand in the Kop area which will be followed
by the South Stand. Although the latter has very extensive
circuitry, it is the most recent and is thought to be in
good condition.


Allowing that the electrical contractors do not resume work
until 8 January 1990, we hope it will be possible to complete
remedial work on Bramall Lane and John Street stand by
mid-February, when we would be able to procure Ilf:
certificates. Depending on what work is found necessary to the
South Stand systems, we would hope to be able to have the
entire ground certified by early March. Naturally we will be
pressing for earlier completion, if this is at all possible.

                      Yours faithfully,



S.Y.C.F.S - Station Officer

Dear Mr. Derricott,

                                                  "Greyhound" Terrace

               Surveys, design work and drawings are being done relating
to the "Greyhound” Terrace and "Greyhound" Bar.                                                                         Prints of the
drawings will be submitted to the Advisory Group in due course,
but probably not until early in the new year.                                                                        However, there
are three items which the Stadium Management wish to, start S:traljg|^t
after the coming holiday, two of which are by nature maintenance
work and as such do not require formal approval.                                                                           Nevertheless,
we write to tell you about the proposed work before it commences.
The three items are as follows:-

a)             To replace the corroded and damaged corrugated, vertical
               steel sheeting, at the back of the terrace with new plastic
               coated, galvanised sheeting.                                          The type of sheeting is Long Rib
               1000W, or equivalent section, 0.7mm thick.                                                                Single copies
               of each of two pages of the trade literature are enclosed.

b)             To inspect the roof steelwork over the terrace and to replace
               any damaged or corroded members with new steel members with
               the appropriate loadbearing capacities.                                                               These will mainly

     require replacement.

c)   To underdraw the* floor joists with 6mm thick Supalux to give
     a \ hour fire resistance to the beer cellar. Other sealing
     and fire protection may also be required as work progresses
     to produce t h e h o u r resistance required.

     Unless we here from you, we will assume that the work can
proceed, but if the Building Surveyor's representative and Fire
Officer wish to discuss the work, John Strange will be pleased
to help.

     Dear Sir

     Owlerton Stadium, SHEFFIELD
     Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975

     The 'Panorama' building main terrace and the associated exit
     routes were inspected on 23 November 1989 following notification
     that the work specified in the Prohibition Notice was completed.

     The works as detailed were inspected satisfactorily with the
     exception of the external emergency lighting system. This was
     because the automatic trip-over device for the generator was not
     installed.

     However, a following inspection of the emergency lighting was
     carried out on 28 November at 1900 hours.

     The system operated satisfactorily.

     The managements attention was drawn to the fact that due to the
     system being linked to the "off-peak" supply then the generator
     will have to be functioning should spectators be admitted between
     1600 and 1900 hours. At 1900 hours the main supply will become
     operative and the generator will automatically switch off after a
     few minutes and be ready for emergency operation should the mains
     fail.

     Yours faithfully




     Divisional Commander

   Dear Mr. Derricott,
                                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground
                                                 Capacity of North West Corner
               Please excuse the delay in giving a detailed response to your
   letter of 6 December 1989.                                               I needed to have some checks made on the
  measurements of the terrace.                                                 Arrangements were made for these
  measurements to be made on two occasions.                                                                   Each time there was heavy
  rain all day.                       The work was completed just before Christmas.
               By way of background, you will no doubt be aware that we did
  not carry out a survey of the Leppings Lane end of the ground when
  the original Safety Certificate was applied for in 1978-79.                                                                                              The
  Club provided drawings prepared by their previous consultants
  of the North stand, the West stand the North West corner from
  which we made measurements.                                                  There were no drawings available of
  the older parts of the ground (the Kop and the South stand) and
  we were commissioned by the Club to make the necessary measurements
  on site, for which we quoted a specific fee.                                                                    This is all well
  documented in our correspondence with the Club at the time and in
  our report to them of January 1979.
              We have now measured the upper part of the North West corner,
  and there is a considerable discrepancy between the actual measure-

 North West corner, the total area available would only take
 2242 on the basis of 54 spectators to 10m*.
      The discrepancy between the drawing and the actual measurement
 is not in any way apparent from a visual inspection of the terrace.
 At the time when we were reporting in 1979, we were made
 aware that in September 1970, following a report by the Club's
 previous consultants the police had agreed a capacity for the
 elevated North West corner of 3,000 spectators.    That figure
 or a higher one had been used in all the major games from the
 World Cup in 1966.    There was thus no reason for us to be alerted
 in 1978/79.   We enclose a copy of the 1970 report and the Chief
 Constable's letter to the Club dated 30 September 1970.
      Obviously we have been concerned about the possibility that
 the calculations for the terrace in front of the West stand might
 also have been based on a misleading plan.     Our check measurements
 have shown that the actual area is such that it could accommodate
 the 'notional' number of spectators with a slightly lower density
 than 54 per 10m2 .


                             Yours sincerely,

    Dear Sir/Madam

    HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR 11/1990
    FINAL REPORT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

    Introduction

    The Final Report of the Inquiry set up by the Home Secretary
    following the disaster at the Hillsborough football ground was
    published on 29 January. A copy of the Report is attached.

    2.   The purpose of this circular is first, to apprise recipients
    of the Report's recommendations and the Government's response to
    them; and second to give guidance to local authorities with
    safety certification responsibilities on compliance with the
    recommendations.

    The Report

    3.   The Report contains 76 recommendations, 43 of which are
    repeated in substance (see also paragraph 6     below) from the
    Interim Report circulated with HOC 68/1989. Attached at Annex A
    is a copy of the Home Secretary's oral statement to the House
    of Commons on 29 January responding to the final Report.     At
    Annex B is a copy of the schedule referred to in the statement
    setting out the Government's initial response to the individual
    recommendations in the report.

    4.   Local authorities may wish to note, in      particular, the
    response to recommendations 1-4 (all seated accommodation) and
    recommendation 6 (National Review Body). The intention is to
    bring into force the relevant sections of Part I of the Football
    Spectators Act 1989 in order to implement these recommendations
E.R.
   as regards football grounds as soon as practicable.             Safety
   certificates should not be amended for this purpose.

   Scope

   5.   Paragraphs 238-239 of the Report indicate that in directing
   the recommendations "essentially" to sports grounds designated
   under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 the flexibility of
   approach referred to in paragraph 5 of the Guide to Safety at
   Sports Grounds (the Green Guide) should apply. Paragraph 14 of
   the Report makes clear that its emphasis is on football, with its
   special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour, which
   are not experienced to the same extent elsewhere.      The Report
   states that "crpwd; problems are directly related to the nature
   of the event and the numbers attending it". It would therefore
   be consistent with the Report's findings for local authorities
   to take proper account of these factors when applying the
   recommendations to individual grounds:     for example a careful
   appraisal of the value of such matters as the installation of
   sophisticated communications systems and CCTV may be necessary
   where spectator attendances are numbered in hundreds rather than
   thousands and where the police presence at the ground is minimal.

   Interim Report Recommendations Adjusted

   6.   The   attention   of  local   authorities   is  drawn   to
   recommendations 8, 11, 12(b), 19, 20, 31, 33, 58, 66 and 67 all
   of which were contained in the Interim Report but have been
   modified as follows:

           recommendation 8 -   revised maximum figure

           recommendation 11 - "agreement" between club and police is
                               replaced by "statement of intent"

           recommendation 12 - qualification introduced by 12(b)

           recommendation 19 - discretion as regards opening of pitch
                               perimeter gates

           recommendation 20 - manning by police or steward

           recommendation 31 - revised   composition   of   the   Advisory
                               Group

           recommendation 33    - reference to 1975 Act provision

           recommendation 58    - hand-signals not recommended

           recommendation 66    - recommended threshold figure of2000

           recommendation 67    - ambulance may be approved        by the
                                 ambulance authorities.
.R.
  New Safety Recommendations

  7.   New recommendations are summarised below and                local
  authorities are urged to take the action indicated               where
  appropriate.

       Turnstiles (recommendation 10) - to note the revised
       maximum flow-rate to be used in place of the figure of
       750 quoted in the Green Guide which will be amended as
       soon as possible;

          Gangways (recommendation 13) - to include appropriate
          conditions in safety certificates;

          Perimeter Fences (recommendations 14, 15, 17) - to
          secure   action  by  clubs  to   comply with   these
          recommendations and to amend safety certificates, as
          necessary;

          Safety Certificates (recommendations 24, 25, 26) - t o
          consider   any   necessary   adjustment   to   safety
          certificates and note Home Office intention to
          implement recommendation 24;

          Duties of Clubs (recommendations 39, 40, 42, 43) - to
          consider appropriate amendment to safety certificates,
          as necessary;

       Police Planning (recommendations 47, 48, 50, 52, 53),
       Communications (55) and Co-ordination (61) - to note
       the recommendations and the Government's response;

          First Aid (recommendation 69) and Offences/Penalties
          (recommendations  70-73)  - to note Government's
          response;

       Green Guide (recommendations 74-76 and Appendix 3) -
       to note the Government response and to adopt the
       revised criteria/requirements which will be included
       in a revised guide as soon as possible.

  Resource Implications

   8.   Action to consider, revise and enforce the provisions of
   safety certificates in the light of the Report may have short
   term resource implications but is not expected to give rise to
   significant long-term resource implications above existing
 V commitments.

  Other

  to Fire and Civil Defence Authorities, Police Authorities,
  Regional Managers Health Authorities, Chief Officers of Police,

                                                                  money if the clubs’ m anagem ent is enterprising and

                                                                  by sponsorship. He also points to the revenue that flows to
                                                                  the football authorities from television rights and says that
                                                                  the football authorities should ensure that this valuable
                                                                  source o f revenue is directed tow ards improving stadia. He

                                                                       There is a w hole series o f detailed recommendations set

    thanks to the police for the way that they carry out the                   better atmosphere by improving the now olten squalid
    difficult, thankless and often unthanked tasks that are                    conditions to which they subject their supporters —squalid

         The report recognises the advances m ade in the last -                    Those clubs that have not faced up to their
    couple o f years in the effectiveness o f the policing o f                 responsibility now have a final opportunity to do so: and

    G overnm ent, such as the restriction on the sale o f alcohol
    and the pow er given to the courts to m ake orders
    excluding convicted hooligans from grounds.
         Lord Justice T ay lo r also recognises the great potential
    value o f the police national football intelligence unit in
    dealing with football-related crime an d with hooligans
    travelling to m atches ab road.
         As I have said. L o rd Justice T aylor takes the view th at
    better facilities an d b etter treatm ent o f fans will bring
    better behaviour. Beyond that, the report recommends the
    creation o f three new specific offences to apply at
    designated spo rts grounds— throw ing a missile: chanting
    obscene o r racialist abuse: an d going on to the pitch
    w ithout reasonable excuse. It also asks for consideration
    to be given to extending the courts' powers to impose
    attendance centre orders an d for the use o f electronic
    tagging in the case o f offenders* convicted o f football-
    related offences. T he specific new offences suggested seem,
    to some extent, to duplicate offences which are already
    available in th e Public O rder A ct 1986. b u t I shall look
    carefully and quickly a t all these suggestions.
         I now com e to the proposed football m em bership
    scheme. Lord Justice T ay lo r exam ined the invitation to
    tender for a schem e which was issued by the consultants
    em ployed by the fo otball authorities. He cam e to the
    conclusion th a t he could n o t s u pp ort a scheme o f th a t kind
    because he couid n o t believe th a t the technology would
    w ork well eno ug h to avoid the dang er o f congestion and
    disorder. H e was also concerned a b o u t the call on police
    resources. Instead, he proposes the m easures to which I
    have referred.
         In the light o f this advice, the G o vernm en t have decided
    not to proceed w ith the establishm ent of a football
    m em bership a u th o rity , b u t p a rt I o f the A ct will rem ain on
    the statute b o o k . W ork will continue to see how the
    shortcom ings identified by L ord Justice T ay lo r could be
    overcom e in case we have to return to the m a tte r again,
    should the p ro b lem o f hooliganism n o t be defeated by the
    alternative strategy p rop osed in the report.
         Let no one im agine th a t this m eans that there will be
    a n y let-up in the fight again st hooliganism . T hose who,
    unlike the G o v ern m e n t, h ave fo r so long shrugged off their
    responsibilities will now have to face up to them.
         T he G o v ern m e n t intend to proceed as quickly as
    possible to th e establishm ent o f a football licensing

INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM INQUIRY

Initial response by the Government to the recommendations in the
final report of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry into the
Hillsborough stadium diaster.

In his statement on 29 January, the Home Secretary indicated that
he would place in the Library a schedule setting out the
Government's initial response to the recommendations of Lord
Justice Taylor's final report. The schedule is annexed.




29 January 1990
initial response by the Government to recommendations contained
in the Taylor report.

ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION (Recommendation 1-4)
1.   General recommendation in respect of all sports grounds
     designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
2.   To apply to all UEFA "high risk" matches from Autumn 1993.
3.   To apply by 20% stages between now and Autumn 1994 to
          Football league. Divisions 1 and 2
          Scottish football league, Premier Division
          National stadia.
4.   To apply by 10% stages between now and Autumn 1999 to all
     other matches played at designated grounds.
The Government accepts this recommendation in principle and
expects to apply it in the case of UEFA high risk matches, the
4 Divisions of the football league, and the national stadia as
recommended.

The application of the recommendation to Scotland and to other
sports cannot be achieved under the Football Spectators Act 1989
but the Government will in any case wish to discuss it with the
sporting authorities concerned. Designated sports grounds under
the 1975 Act include cricket, rugby union and rugby league
grounds which are not all enclosed grounds and which it may not
be practicable to deal with in this way.


ADVISORY DESIGN COUNCIL (Recommendation 5)
The Government supports Lord Justice Taylor’s recommendation
that the football league and Football Association should
establish an Advisory Design Council on stadium design.



NATIONAL INSPECTORATE AND REVIEW BODY (Recommendation 6)
     (a)   The Football Licensing Authority should be created to
           review the discharge of functions by local authorities.
     (b)   The powers of the Authority should be extended to other
           sports and other sports venues.

The Government     supports  the recommendation     that safety
certification of designated grounds should be centrally reviewed
and proposes to bring into force relevant provisions of Part I
of the Football Spectators Act to create and empower the Football
Licensing Authority to carry out these responsibilities in
England and Wales in relation to grounds used by football league
clubs and the international football grounds. Consideration will
be given to introduction of legislation extending the role of the
new authority to Scotland and in relation to other sports grounds
and sporting venues after consultation with the representative
sporting organisations, the local authority associations and
other interested bodies.    Consideration will also be given to
extending the Authority's responsibilities in the meantime on a
voluntary basis.

MAXIMUM CAPACITIES FOR TERRACES (Recommendations 7-10)
7.    Safety certificates to specify maximum number of spectators
      in pens or areas (interim recommendation 1).
8.    Calculations of crowd density:    revised figures (interim
      recommendation 2, revised).
9.    Arrangements to prevent further access to pens     (interim
      recommendation 3).
10.   Turnstile flow rates.

The Government supports these recommendations. Local authorities
with responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
(the 1975 Act) have already been urged to review and amend safety
certificates to reflect reductions in terrace capacities
recommended in the Interim Report.      The adjusted figures in
recommendations 8 and 10 will be drawn to local authorities'
attention. The next edition of the 'Green Guide' will reflect
the new figures.

FILLING AND MONITORING OF TERRACES (Recommendations 11-12)
11.   Statements of intent (interim recommendation 4, revised.
12.   Stewarding or policing of pens (interim recommendation 5).
The Government have already urged police and clubs to enter into
non-contractual statements of intent with the aim of ensuring
that no doubt exists as to the respective responsibilities of
each; and to provide monitoring of terraces accordingly.       The
relaxation in recommendation 12 (b) will be drawn to the attention
of local authorities and clubs.
GANGWAYS (Recommendation 13)
Local authorities will be urged to include in safety certificates
terms and conditions to give effect to this recommendation.
FENCES AND GATES (Recommendations 14-21)
14.   Removal of spikes.
15.   Reduction in height.
16.   Training of stewards (interim recommendation 6).
17.   Emergency gates in perimeter fences.
18., Marking of emergency gates (interim recommendation 7).
19.   Gates normally to be kept open during matches            (interim
      recommendation 8, revised).
20.   Manning    of    emergency      gates      (replaces     interim
      recommendation 9).
21.   Cutting equipment (interim recommendation 10).
The Government supports the recommendations on perimeter fencing.
Local authorities will be urged to amend safety certificates to
include requirements so as to implement recommendations 14, 15,
17 and to note recommendation 19 which varies interim
recommendation 8. The revised recommendations on closure and
manning of gates in perimeter fences at football grounds will be
drawn to the attention of local authorities, clubs and police.
CRUSH BARRIERS (Recommendations 22, 23)
22.   Inspection (interim recommendation 11).
23.   Review of layout (interim recommendation 12).
These are repeated from the Interim Report.        They have already
been commended to local authorities.
SAFETY CERTIFICATES (Recommendations 24-31)
24.   Mandatory conditions in safety certificates.
25.   Variation from terms of safety certificates.
26.   Terms of safety certificates.
27.   Review of safety certificates (interim recommendation 13).
28.Issue of certificates     to    grounds    without   them   (interim
recommendation 14).
29.   Annual   review of    certificates;  annual         renewal   of
      certificates (interim recommendation 15).
30.   Review of arrangements for issuing certificates (interim
      recommendation 16).
31.   Local authority advisory groups (interim recommendation 17
      revised).
                                                                      ,
The Government agrees with the aims of these recommendations.
An order under S.15A of the 1975 Act will be made to implement
recommendation 24. Consideration will also be given to including
within the scope of such an Order provisions which will require
terms and conditions addressing other aspects of safety to be
included in safety certificates.
Local authorities will be urged to ensure the terms/conditions
in safety certificates are clear and unequivocal: they will be
reminded of the need to have an effective review system, the
desirability of a properly constituted team approach to
certification and the desirability of consulting club and
supporters association representatives.
Annual review of safety certificates already exists in effect
because annual inspections of designated grounds in connection
with safety certificates is already required by law.       The
Government will consider whether any change in the law should
be made to make annual renewal of certificates compulsory.

DUTIES OF FOOTBALL CLUBS (Recommendations 32-43)
32.   Measurement of turnstile flow (interim recommendation 18).
33.   Correlation of turnstile      flow   and    capacity   (interim

38.   Co-ordination with the police (interim recommendation 24).

40.   Restriction of all ticket matches to capacity attendances.
41.   Pre match entertainment (interim recommendation 25).
42.   Recruitment of stewards.
43.   Police control rooms.
These recommendations are aimed primarily at football clubs and
are supported by the Government.       Where appropriate, local
authorities will be asked to amend safety certificates to enforce
these recommendations.
POLICE PLANNING (Recommendations 44-53)
44.   Nomination of a Chief      Officer    for    liaison   (interim
      recommendation 26).
45.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 27).

50. Early kick-offs and Sunday fixtures.
51. Control room facilities.
52. Training of senior officers.
53. Charges for police services.
These recommendations, some of which are repeated from the
Interim Report are directed primarily to Chief Police Officers
and police authorities. The Government supports the proposal for
senior   officer training    and the     objective  to   improve
effectiveness of policing at football matches. The Government
agrees that the cost of policing inside grounds should be met in
full by clubs and will consider providing guidance to police
authorities after consultation with relevant representative
associations, to ensure consistency of practice.

54.   Radio communications (interim recommendation 31, amended).
55.   Provision of a command channel.

58.   Illuminated advertising (interim recommendation 34:   advice
      on hand signals withdrawn).
These are largely repeated from the Interim Report which the

to implement. Chief Officers will also be encouraged to use an
additional, discrete channel of communications for police match
commanders.
CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES (Recommendations 59-63)
59.   Co-ordination (interim recommendation 35).
60.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 36).
61.   communication with emergency services.
62.   Arrival of emergency vehicles (interim recommendation 37).
63.   Briefing of police officers (interim recommendation 38).
These recommendations are intended to ensure full co-ordination
and co-operation of the emergency services and are substantially
those covered in the Interim Report which the Government has
already endorsed. The Government will urge all those concerned
to comply with the further recommendation devised to ensure
immediate summons of emergency services.
FIRST AID, MEDICAL FACILITIES AND AMBULANCES
(Recommendations   64-69)
64.   First aiders (interim recommendation 39).

The Government accepts these recommendations and will act on them
with urgency.
CORONER *S INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

The following notes detail in brief the procedure adopted by the Coroner
during the first morning of the hearing (10.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.).

1.   Selection of Jury -
      Jurors related to fans.
      Jurors related to police on duty on15thApril, 1989.
      Jurors related to stewards.
      Any other reason that the jurors may have fornot wanting to take part
      in the hearing.
      Any personal reasons.
      Do the legal representatives wish to raise any items.
      The answer to all the abovequestions was   "no".

2.   The Coroner then read thenames   of thedeceased (in alphabetical order)
      to the hearing.

3.    The Jury was then sworn in and the Coroner instructed that all reserve
      jurors could be released.

A.   Legal Representation -

      The Coroner asked each legal representative to introduce him or herself
      to the Court.

      a)   Mr. Frazer (solicitor), representing the Hillsborough Solicitors
            Group Steering Committee.   This Steering Committee represents
            firms which have been instructce ^ b y ^ne^injured or bereaved. The
            Committee comprises six solicitors and represents upwards of 50
            firms.

      b)   Shaun Smith (Counsel) representing Dr. Alex Forrest (Pathologist)
            Blood Tests.

      c)   Hr. Callahan (Solicitor) Dibb Lupton Broomhead - representing
            Trent Regional Health Authority and the South Yorkshire

                               - 2 -




The Coroner asked if legal representatives were not to attend for the
full hearing would they inform him when they were not to be present.

The Coroner then detailed the arrangement to swear in eight officers of
South Yorkshire Police who will present case summaries - the eight
officers were sworn in together.

The Coroner then pointed out that when the Pathologist comes to give
evidence again all will be sworn in together.

The Coroner then addressed the Hearing and in particular the Jury.   He
gave a background to the function of the Coroner’s Court and pointed out
that it was a Court of record.

He pointed out that the objectives of the Coroner’s Court are detailed
in the Coroner’s Act 1988 and the Coroner’s Rules 1984.   In particular
he made reference to Rule 36.

36 (1) The Coroner’s Court is there to find out who died; how; when;
where did death occur; and deal with the particulars required by the
Registration Act.

36 (2) The Coroner then pointed out that neither the Coroner or Jury may
express any opinion on any other matter.

The Coroner pointed out that the question of "how" would not be dealt
with at this time.   He gave the reason that the DPP investigation is
still ongoing and nothing that would be detrimental to the DPP Inquiry
should be considered at this time.

a)    The Coroner then pointed out that no South Yorkshire Police
      Officers were to be called.   Evidence was to be summarised and
      will be presented by eight officers (police officers).    The
      Coroner pointed out that these officers were not at the Stadium on
      the day but they were simply recounting the evidence before the
      Court.

b)    Post mortem evidence will be given.

c)    Registration particulars will be dealt with.

d)    Visual evidence - this will be by use of plans and notphotos    or
      videos.   The reason for this was the vast amount of photographic
      and video evidence available.    The Coroner felt that it would
      serve no purpose for the Jury to try to consider all this
      evidence.    He had therefore taken the decision to use plans - he
      pointed out that when a plan was used a copy ofthe plan would    be
      bound into the transcripts.

e)    The Coroner then pointed out that today and tomorrow the Hearing
      would take place in the Memorial Hall and on Friday and for the
      rest of the Hearing the proceedings would take place at the Medico
      Legal Centre.   He again pointed out that it was not his intention
      to call police, stewards, club officials etc.

11.   The Hearing Schedule.

      Proposals to start at 9.30 a.m. and take 8 inquests per day.   Lunch
      would be at 1.00 p.m. to 2.00 p.m. and the Hearing should finish daily
      between 4.30 and 5.00 p.m.   The Hearing in total should take
      approximately 14 days, but the Coroner pointed out that he would in no
      way rush evidence and if further time was required, then so be it.

12.   Outline of what happened.

      1.    The Coroner then made references to various gates, these were
            shown to the jurors on a plan which was pinned to the wall.

            i)     Outer perimeter gates.
            ii)    Second gates (turnstiles).
            iii)   Gate C.
            iv)    Internal perimeter gates.
            v)     Fences on terracing and fence gates.
            vi)    The Coroner pointed out the difference between terracing and
                   stands and also pointed to the dividing fences on the
                   terracing which split the terracing into pens.

      2.    The Coroner pointed out that Gate C had been opened at three
            relevant times on the day:

            a)     14.48 opened to let someone out, at this time a small amount
                   of people entered through that gate;

            b)     14.52 opened for five minutes approximately (closed 14.57) a
                   large amount of people entered through the gate at this
                   time;

            c)     14.59 (kick-off took place at 14.49:30);

            d)     15.03 (this time will be referred to in theevidence   and   it
                   is when Peter Beardsley hit the bar);

            e)     15.05:36 game stopped;

            f)     St. John’s Ambulance on the field;   hT-
                                                          - l^jw. *

            g)     The Coroner pointed out that where the gymnasium was located
                   in the Stadium as this had been used as the temporary
                   mortuary.

13.   The Coroner then asked the legal representatives if they had any
      queries.

      a)    Mr. Frazer (the Hillsborough Solicitors’ Steering Committee) asked
            about the video camera which was filming proceedings and also
            asked about the post mortem reports, would a pathologist be
            present.
                                     -   4   -




            The Coroner pointed out that a film record was being made of the
            proceedings.   This was for internal use but also the proceedings
            were being filmed and passed through to a press area.    This was
            happening simply because of the lack of space.

            The Coroner pointed out that a pathologist would be present but he
            intended to extract from their reports the cause of death and
            their justification.   Mr. Frazer pointed out that during the
            proceedings he may like to ask questions about the Pathologist’s
            report.   The Coroner raised no objection to this.

14.   A further question wasasked about the circulation ofcase summaries,
      but  it was pointed out to the Coroner that not all the legal
      representatives would be present for each day of the Hearing and it
      would be greatly advantageous to have a case summary so that they could
      attend on appropriate days.    The Coroner pointed out that this could be
      attended to with a degree of co-operation with the legal
      representatives.

      The Hearing was adjourned at approximately 12.30 p.m. for a five minute
      recess.
West Midlands Police Inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster

At approximately 4.55 p.m. on Monday 23rd April 1990 I spoke to Detective
Superintendent Taylor of West Midlands Police who had called earlier in the
afternoon.

He indicated that the West Midlands Police had been given the job of carrying
out a criminal inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster and had recently submitted
a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions as I probably knew.  I indicated
to him that I discovered this from the local newspaper.

Mr. Taylor indicated that on the D.P.P's instructions I was to be "interviewed
as a witness". I asked him    what this meant. He indicated to me that meant that
he was seeking evidence from me as a witness   and not as a person   who is likely
to be prosecuted.  (I think it will be useful to obtain some further
clarification on this point).

Mr. Taylor inidcated that he wished me to give a statement which would probably
be quite lengthy in connection with the disaster but did not go into significant
detail about what he required.     He said he thought it would probably be useful
to have a preliminary discussion about the statement in the fairly near future
as he was under pressure to    proceed with the inquiry.

 I said I thought this wouldbe a good idea and would get back   in touch with him
-as soon as possible.

Detective Superintendent Taylor's numbers are as follows:- -

021-359-5147 (a direct line) or021-322-6000 extension 6901 to 6904.     I should
explain that I tried to contact   him on the 6000 number and got nowhere.

After having discussions with various people I talked to Mr. Taylor three times
on the morning of Tuesday 24th April and we finally arranged Wednesday 2nd May
1990 at 10.30 a.m. in the Town Hall for a preliminary discussion about the
statement- During the course of the conversation Mr. Taylor indicated that Tie
was interested in my role in relation to*”the other Authorities (for example the
Fire Service) tteo . - tape liLanfr aL Lim. -point --   /L * /h . t*
          I '-9!*'4         A      O     f      Mm   iT T 4 ^

etc. He also specifically mentioned the question of the removal of barrier 144
and whether or not I had the authority to authorise the removal of it. I took
it from the conversation that Mr. Taylor was really interested in all aspects of
the Council's functioning in respect of Safety of Sports Grounds presumably up
until the time of the disaster. He also indicated that he may wish to talk to
other people within the Council structure who had an involvement.

In my original conversation with Mr. Taylor he indicated that a statement may
take one to two days to prepare-I think this is an under estimate. If he
requires full detail then the statement will scarcely be of a lesser length than
the statement I did for the inquiry.

NOTE RE PROPOSED SPORTS GROUND FORllM

30th April, 1990

X.   Interim Taylor Report

      Originally proposals were put forward in line with the Interim Report.
      Basically there would be a Forum Meeting twice a year involving the
      Advisory Group, Club representatives and supporters’ representatives to
      discuss safety of sports grounds.

2.   Final Taylor Report

      The Final Report said that the local authority should consult with the
      clubs and supporters on a regular basis.   Therefore a new report was
      prepared based on the final recommendation and the memorandum from Mark
      Webster enclosing a copy of Councillor Betts’ memo.

      Regular meetings are proposed with individual groups, the clubs and the
      Chief Licensing Officer.

      There is to be a twelve month trial period.

      The Chief Licensing Officer has written to the South Yorkshire Branch of
      the National Football Supporters Association, supporters associations
      from Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United and the clubs themselves
      asking them to contact the Chief Licensing Officer with a view to
      discussing the setting up of regular meetings.

      The proposals we intend to put forward are:-

      a)    Meetings of that group - any relevant points to be put to the
             advisory group and through that group to the Panel.

      b)    The Chief Licensing Officer to attend the supporters meetings   on
             invitation.

      c)    A meeting eve#y six months involving the Chair of the Panel.

3.    Conclusion

      i)    The proposal involves the National Association at district level.

      ii)   The Chief Licensing Officer is asking other parties what they
             would like to see.

      iii) There is a review in twelve months or earlier if necessary.
.HE LICENSING SECTION -- STAFFING ISSUES FOLLOWING HILLSBOROUGH


INTRODUCTION


Following the Hillsborough Enquiry minds will no doubt be focused on the
activities on the Licensing Section particularly in relation to its
priorities, workload and responsibilities.  The assumption is made in this
report that the current duties of the Licensing Section will remain
within it although obviously if this is not to be the case then further
investigation will be required.


Safety of Sports Grounds Work

I estimate that this area of work up until April this year involve</25%-30%
of my time on average. I have to say at this point that the Section does
not operate on the basis of recording manhours applied to particular areas
of work - this means that accurate manhour calculations are not normally
available.

Following Hillsborough the Council's approach to Safety of Sports Grounds
will no doubt undergo considerable refinement and this process is indeed
already under way. It is inevitable that this process of refinement will
resolve considerably more work input particularly from the administrative
side of the safety system. It is very difficult to accurately estimate
the extent of this work as it will depend on a number of factors for
example

The new administrative/inspection system which will result from the
refinement process; the recommendations of    L0iP-T&  Justice Taylor's
enquiry; how difficult or otherwise it will be to encourage clubs to do
required works; how much work will be required in pursuading the different
agencies, etc., to supply the information required in the form required at
the right time; the Council's attitude to safety of sports grounds, etc.

The last point I have mentioned in relation to attitude is important. In
view of the Inquiry it seems to me right that the Council should carefully
review and if appropriate (which I think it clearly is) apply further
resources to safety of sports grounds.   Obviously the extent of that
provision of resources is a matter for discussion at policy level.

I believe that in the short term that is between now and say the end of
July, 1990 it will probably require between 75% and 100% of one persons
time to deal with safety of sports grounds questions. Thereafter,
hopefully a workable and well understood administrative system will be in
effect which should enable a reduction in time to say 50% to 75% of one
persons time. However, the world student games facilities are (as is well
known) currently being constructed and they will have a significant impact
in respect of work on safety of sports grounds - most notably of course
the Don Valley Athletic Stadium. It is difficult to estimate the amount
of work required here but I anticipate that a very great deal of work will
need to be done here in 1990 in relation to the stadium. Obviously the
world student games will also have an impact in respect of public
entertainments licensing as all the other facilities will require such
licences but this is dealt with in the second section of this note.

NOTE OF COURSE

INSTITUTE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES

AFTER HILLSBOROUGH: THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE TAYLOR REPORT FOR LOCAL AUTHORITY/
FOOTBALL CLUB RELATIONSHIPS

11 MAY 1990

David Mould - Home Office

His section not involved in public order.

In consultation regarding new offences.  Condition of ground and how it is run
lies with the operating of the ground. Proposed to implement all seater
stadium.  Football Licensing Authority.  Priority comfort and safety.
Football Licensing Authority - set up by Home Office. Commencement date
1 June 1990. Independent Body - issue licence for ground. Do not expect
local authorities to use safety of sports grounds licence to enforce seating.
Money through football trust.

Planning policy guidance on new/redeveloped grounds. Draft circular out soon?
Recommendation 6 - national inspectorate. Expect to bring into force as soon
as possible. Can direct licence conditions. Intend it to work with local
authorities to establish consistent approach. Football Licensing Authority
restricted to those grounds licensed by it. Consideration to be given to
extending it to other sports.  "Green Guide" - currently revising it. Group
not yet set up. Stood up fairly well but will try and improve.   If want to
put up ideas - send them to the Home Office. Expected later this year
(ideally 1990/91). Will reflect safety recommendations.   13£ reduction in
capacity. Will remain non-mandatory. Mandatory conditions in safety
certificates (as original Act). By order under section 15(a). May also be
other provision. Football Licensing Authority - constitution - experience/
technical background.  Inspectorate.

Questions.  Hooliganism not part of Hillsborough - outside but not inside.
Ban on alcohol? Ban on being drunk in the ground (Scotland). Tighter
regulation in Scotland. Football Licensing Authority - don’t know when
recommendations come out. Will set its own priorities and targets. Non­
regulated grounds - any thought given to that? Not under football licensing
authority. Query roofing - argued that football licensing authority can make
requirement regarding roofing (doubtful).

Not aware of DoE guidelines around grounds. AMA - Football Licensing
Authority - put the point that local authorities should be involved - could
include local authority, fire service, police, building.  Similarly for
Inspectorate.

Meeting Rugby Football Union and Rugby League to discuss - reduction/all
seater. Home Office Circular - don’t reduce seating. Lord Justice Taylor
said should apply. Green Guide - total evacuation on to pitch reflected in
Green Guide - working group may have different ideas on that - support
principles but can it be done? Barrier tests - to be modified in Green Guide.
                                      - 2 -




Gordon McCartney - Association of District Councils

Three local government associations, Sports Council and League set up working
groups.  Feedback - impossible to separate Taylor Report from hooliganism and
social issues.

Safety - solution to problems lies with authority.

Social Community - financial help from local authorities. Likely to be in a
residential area. Goals between club and local community. Have got to work
closely - club and local authority - siting and social policies, etc.

Local Authority Role

Planning Policies. Local Authority have negative attitude. Local Authority
should be going to club to try and plan way out of mutual problem.

1    Site will be capable of redevelopment.

2    Community involvement - facilities other than football.

3    Site not capable of redevelopment - able to use for purpose which will
      raise sufficient capital to build new ground. Where else/other
      residents/green built site. Social, leisure, recreational development.
      Local Authorities should take lead. Squash, banqueting, look at
      cricket.  Not just use of pitch.

(My note -   Co-operation can be interpretated by clubs as being relaxation   -
             over a barrel).

Arthur Sandford - Football League Limited

The new philosophy of football set out in chapter 1 and 2 of the report.
Do n’t react to one disaster to create another. Advisory Design Council
include Football Association and Football League Association with a view to
set it up. Looked at Professor Maunder as Chair (refused). Strategic role -
6 to 8 people - directing on strategic research, design and best practice,
design guidance, data base on football grounds, build up knowledge and
expertise. One and a half new grounds since 1945 - Walsall and Scunthorpe.
Taylor Implementation Committee - looking at restructing of football league -
cost £130 million estimate for seating and roofing too low. Money from
football trust £75 million not new money.

New Football Trust 1990 instead of Football Trust and Football Improvement
Trust.  Two committees - one professional game, one everything else. Extra
£350,000 per week from reduced football pools tax.

Hoping for capital allowance on implementation cost - not so. Repairs tax
deductable, as revenue compare Burnley case. Plant and machinery - write
down.  Terms and conditions of safety certificate - 25Z write down.

All seater enforced under Football Licensed Authority - capital allowances?

Once Football Licensing Authority up and running because don’t want to do
abortive work. Therefore Football Licensing Authority should have flexibility
on implementation of Taylor re all seater. Not asked for start date to be put
back.
                                              -   3   -




        Ask local authority to bear that in mind.  Strictly speaking don’t think local
        authority can alter safety certificate to implement all seater? See Home
        Office guidance.  Grant Aid - can local authority help clubs to tap different
        sources.  Preparing applications. Urban aid, environmental improvements, EEC?

        Community Development. Aston Villa, Millwall.        Taking children to the club.
        Dual use. Educational buildings.

        View to accommodate 150,000 leading to the possibility of the sharing of
        grounds.  If all seater, Liverpool may not be able to accommodate away
        supporters or not many.

        Away supporters go - cause nuisance to be let in without ticket?

    k   UEFA - all matches on grass.  If want all weather pitches must tell them so
J       that they can vote accordingly in football league.

        Conclusion
    i
        Local Authority discuss future with clubs. All clubs being asked to produce
        development plans for the next 5 to 10 years. Can’t afford to waste money.
        Joint use/ground sharing. Relocation.   Grant Aid.

        Questions

        Costs - £1,300 - £2,000 for policing. Authority can reclaim £7,000 from the
        club.  The club recovers £3,500 from elsewhere. Cost £3,500 to the club.

        Should there be better stewarding leading to less police, leading to less
        costs? Stewarding has to be on a professional basis trained by police.

        Councillor Dave Sullivan - London Borough of Lewisham

    >   Press could play their part. Sports development workers based at club.      Over
)       50s club. Schools - coaching male and female - all players involved. Creche
         at every home game. Archery.Sponsorship     - Council logo. Advertising site
         for Council.   Council vantage card leading to reduced prices.  Work with
)        people with learningdifficulties.    School kids finals - male and female.
         Five a Side.

        Practice at same time as practice for first       team.

        Council gave £50,000 sponsorship. They get 400 tickets      foreachhome game
        which are given to local groups. Use of ground and Councillor as a Director.

        Anyone can use the clubs physiotherapists.

        Looking at new stadium. Council makes site available. Disposeassets to have
        community recreational facilities in new stadium. Problem over capital
        financing regulations.

        They have produced a book setting out how the scheme works at Millwall.

Note of conversation between Mr. Barry Devonslde - Hillsborough Support
Group (Liverpool) and Mr. W. J. Derricott

Re: Leppings Lane Terracing Re-opening

Mr. Devonside telephoned at about 11.30 a.m. to the Licensing Office and
was passed through to me as he was querying the re-opening of the Leppings
Lane terracing.  I clarified to him that there had not been an application
by the Club to re-open the Leppings Lane terrace, but there had been
informal discussions over the last week between myself and the Club.

Possibility that the Club may ask the Council to allow about 1,000
spectators onto the terrace in the coming Season.

He asked if the tunnel would   be used for accessing spectators. I said we
would consider it carefully,   but in view of the numbers the tunnel may not
be required.

I also informed him that perimeter fences were to be removed at the
ground.

He asked informally, and off the record, in view of all that had happened
would I like to see the terraces re-opened? I said it ^as not for me to
comment, I would simply provide facts to elected members and they would
decide. I pointed out that the Club also had rights of appeal in certain
circumstances. He asked if members of the public could speak at meetings
of the Panel?  I said, yes, at the discretion of the chair.

Subsequently, during the hearing, I further accorded representation to:
     (viii) Trent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service
            (SYMAS).
and (ix) Dr W Eastwood, consultant engineer to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

  9. Since the circumstances of the disaster raised urgent questions of safety, especially at football grounds,
you indicated at the outset that you would welcome any recommendations, even of an interim nature, which I
might be able to give in advance of the new football season due to commence in mid-August 1989.1 therefore
announced at the preliminary hearing on 28 April that I would conduct an oral hearing with all possible
expedition as the first phase of the Inquiry to discover the facts and causes of the disaster and enable me to
make any im mediate interim recommendations necessaiv in the short term.

   10. The West Midlands Police investigation began on 24 April. A “Freephone” num ber was advertised to
enable members of the public, especially those who had attended the match, to offer their evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this num ber was available for three days on 28 different lines. The response from the public
was such that the lines were continued for a further three days by the end of which 2,666 calls had been
received. There were also many written offers o f help. Some 440 West Midlands officers were deployed on the
Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in Birmingham, Liverpool and
Sheffield and computer technology was used to the full. In all some 3776 statements were taken. There were
also some 1550 letters to Ministers, to the Inquiry and to me personally all of which I read. The police,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the BBC had video cameras filming at the ground on 15 April. In
aggregate, they recorded some 71 hours o f film covering the period before, during and after the disaster. Thus
the material gathered and potentially available for presentation at the oral hearing was enormous. From this
mass it was essential to select only sufficient good and reliable evidence necessary to establish the facts and
causes of the disaster.

   11. Where it seemed likely that any allegation or criticism might be made of the conduct of any person or
party, the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the party concerned
setting out the likely grounds for complaint. This followed the practice established by the Royal Commission
on Tribunals of Inquiry (the Salmon Commission).

  12. The hearing began on 15 May. It continued, sitting long hours, for 31 days concluding on 29 June. In
that period, 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel’s submissions were delivered in writing on 7 July and
on 14 July I heard their brief oral submissions supplementing the written argument.

  13. Witnesses were not sworn. Since this is a departmental inquiry, there was no power to adm inister the
oath but there was no instance of any witness giving evidence which I considered might have been different
had he or she been sworn.

  14. The witnesses called were only a small fraction of those from whom statements were or could have been
taken. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that they were sufficient in number and reliability to enable me to reach the
necessary conclusions. To have called more would have prevented me from presenting an interim report in the
required time and would not have added significantly to the relevant evidence. I have, however, been able to
take into account many written statements in addition to oral testimony.,

   15. Apart from the evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry which was drawn from statements taken by
the West Midlands Police and others volunteered by individuals, each of the represented parties was given full
opportunity to put forward any witnesses they considered should be called. A final submission was made by
Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police that since the investigation by West Midlands Police is still continuing,
all the evidence has not been assembled, and it would be unsafe for me to make findings o f fact. I should
therefore make clear that the investigation continues principally to furnish as much detail as possible to HM
Coroner for the City o f Sheffield as to the cause of death, the precise position at death and the care and
movement of each of the 95 victims individually. I am assured by Chief Constable Dear and Assistant Chief
Constable Mervyn Jones that it is most unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter or add to
the history of events which emerged at the hearing.

  16. I should like to thank all those who made it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
event and for evidence to be efficiently presented and tested so as to give a full and fair account of what
happened in all its aspects without irrelevancy or duplication. I pay tribute particularly to the West Midlands
Police for their speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to all those responsible for processing it.
The most eloquent tribute to the fairness and thoroughness o f the police investigation came from the Secretary
o f the Football Supporters’ Association. He said there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to whether that
investigation would be fair and objective. His Association therefore collected 200 witness statements
themselves. Having heard the opening statement by Counsel to the Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered
by the police, he found that it accorded entirely with his Association’s evidence and the initial anxiety was
wholly dispelled.

   17. Before and during the Inquiry I derived great assistance on a wide range of technical issues from the
Health and Safety Executive who providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research and Laboratory
Services Division) where tests were conducted and reports prepared swiftly and efficiently. This was done
in close consultation with Professor Maunder. I am m ost grateful to the Director, D r A Jones, and to the
Deputy Director, D r C E Nicholson, for their invaluable help.

  18. I wish to commend Counsel to the inquiry, Mr Andrew Collins QC, Mr Alan Goldsack and Mr
Bernard Phillips for their industry, care and fairness in selecting and presenting the necessary evidence; also,
Counsel for all those represented who tested that evidence fully but expeditiously. This Interim Report could
not possibly have been prepared in so short a tim e had I not had the whole-hearted co-operation o f all those
m entioned and many others.

   19. The second phase of the Inquiry will be directed to making final arid long term recommendations about
crowd control and safety at sports grounds. I need to consider in depth information, opinions and arguments
from a wide range of sources and contributors both here and abroad. It was clear from the outset that this
second phase could not be carried to completion before the next football season. However, at an early stage of
the oral hearing I invited evidence from all who wished to contribute to it and specifically from many sporting,
local authority, emergency service and police bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked that submissions
should be in writing and should be made promptly so that the second phase o f the Inquiry could
follow immediately after the first. I shall now proceed to consider the large body of written evidence which has
been submitted. I shall want in some instances to have further oral evidence or discussion in conjunction with
my Assessors. We will also need to make a num ber o f visits and inspections.

  20. I now present my Interim Report and Recommendations. I shall prepare my Final Report and
Recommendations as soon as reasonably possible.

                                                 CHAPTER 1

                         T H E G R O U N D A N D PRE-MATCH ARRANGEM ENTS

Fixing The Venue
  21. On 20 March 1989, the Football Association (the FA) requested that their Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium. The corresponding
semi-final between the same two teams had been held there in April 1988. The arrangements had been
successful in the view both of the police and of the host club. Sheffield Wednesday ( the Club) were therefore
willing to accommodate the 1989 match. South Yorkshire Constabulary were prepared to police it but only if
the ticketing arrangements were the same as those for 1988. Otherwise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
Those arrangements did not please Liverpool or its supporters either in 1988 or 1989. They thought the ticket
allocation was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police requirement was
accepted and the match was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

The Ground.
  22. The Hillsborough Stadium is some 2'/: miles to the north-west of central Sheffield in the district of
Owlerton. The ground was opened in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river Don. The pitch lies
roughly east to west. A plan of the ground and its immediate environs is at Appendix 1.

  23. The west end. with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings Lane end. The
east end abuts on Penistone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river Don and to the north a residential street,
Vere Road, which runs between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North.

   24. Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the Directors’ and players’
entrances, and to the adm inistrative block under the stand. The roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
access between Penistone Road and Leppings Lane, but there are gates which can shut it off at each end. There
is some car parking along this roadway principally for Directors, players and employees of the Club. The south
stand dates from 1914 and is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8.800. 5.500 o f those are
roofed over and 3,300 are uncovered.

  25. The north stand is also all seating and accommodates about 9.700. Behind it is a gymnasium or sports
hail. There are also a first aid room and police room close by.

  26. The east end is all terracing and is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlarged and roofed over in 1986 and
now accommodates some 21.000 standing spectators. There are crush barriers in the Kop running parallel to
the goal line but no dividing fences to prevent free movement from side to side.

   27. At the west or Leppings Lane end of the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. Behind it is the west
stand which provides covered seating and was built in 1965 for World Cup matches, some of which were held
at Hillsborough in 1966. The covered stand accommodates 4,456 seated spectators. The terracing in front o f it
extends higher in the comers between the stands and its total capacity was stated to be 10.100. At both the Kop
end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by perimeter fencing. The fencing is about eight feet high
mounted upon the low wall at the foot of the terracing. At the top of the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
angle for some 15 inches to make it difficult for anyone to climb over towards the pitch. There are gates at
intervals along the perimeter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch. These gates are less than a
metre wide and were designed to be opened only from the pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.
They are marked and numbered on the plan Appendix 1.

   28. Unlike the Kop end. the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line but radial
fences at right angles to it, dividing the area into pens. This division was begun after an FA Cup semi-final in
 1981 when crushing occurred due to overcrowding and gates had to be opened. It proceeded in stages, the final
arrangement being shown on the plan Appendix 1. The first section of the west terracing moving south to north
contains gates 1 and 2 and is known as pens 1 and 2 although in fact constituting only one pen. Next is pen 3
with one gate; next pen 4 with one gate; pen 5. which is extremely narrow, was intended as a sterile area to
divide pen 4 from pen 6. This was to isolate home and away fans on occasions when both might be
accommodated on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west corner. Pens 5.6
and 7 each have a perimeter gate. At the back of the pens, under the from of the west siand. there is a gate in


                                                         4
each radial fence. When those gates are open, the back row o f the terracing is intended to permit access from
pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, when substantial numbers are present, those gateways are not
readily visible or accessible. The present layout o f the pens, fences, crush barriers and gates has resulted from a
series o f piecemeal changes. The nature and effect of those changes must be considered later.

The Turnstiles
  29. Because of the housing in Vere Road there is no access from the north side of the ground. Along
Penistone Road North there are some 46 turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop and to the east
end of the north stand. They are marked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. The 12 numbered 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the north stand but were not used for that purpose on 15 April in order to segregate supporters of the
two teams as appears later. Two of them. 77 and 78. were however used for access to the Kop.

  30. At the south side of the ground there were 24 turnstiles (numbered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
numbered 37 to 42 led to the Kop and the rest to the south stand.

  31. In summary, the south and east sides of the ground accommodated some 29.800 whose access on the
day was through 60 turnstiles.

  32. The other two sides o f the ground, north and west, with a capacity of 24,256 were fed solely from the
Leppings Lane entrance where there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to the Ground
  33. Most supporters were expected to come by road although rail transport was available. Nottingham
supporters travelling by train would arrive at the main line Sheffield Midland Station whence they would be
directed and escorted northwards by the police. They would arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
Nottingham supporters travelling by coach, mini-bus or car would approach Sheffield from the south mainly
on the M 1. Again their arrival at the ground would predominantly be via Penistone Road or Herries Road.

   34. Liverpool supporters travelling by normal rail service would arrive at Sheffield Midland Station just
like their Nottingham counterparts. The police aimed to segregate the rival fans and put them into separate
coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
catering solely for football supporters and situated to the north o f the ground. A police escort was available to
conduct them on foot to the Leppings Lane entrance. Those coming from Liverpool by road would approach
Sheffield either via the M62 and down the M 1 from the north or across the Pennines from the north west. .All
such routes would bring them to the ground via one or other limb of Leppings Lane as shown on Appendix 1.
Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north and west: arrivals from Nottingham
would be from the south and east.

Allocation of Places and Tickets
   35. Experience in recent years has produced a policy of segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
 of rival teams. The need for this policy to be m aintained was endorsed and emphasised by the Popplewell
 Report following the Bradford City disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1988 semi-final the police decided
 that sections of the Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation of
 Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans. The section to be granted to each was determined by the direction
 whence each predominantly approached. Thus, Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides of the ground
 for which access was from Leppings Lane. Nottingham Forest were allotted the south and east sides with access
 from Penistone Road.

    36. The effect of the decision was that for this all-ticket Cup Tie. Liverpool were allotted only 24,256 places
 as against 29,800 for Nottingham Forest. This, although average attendance of supporters at home matches
 was substantially higher at Liverpool than at Nottingham. Moreover, with standing tickets at £6 and seats at
 £12, Nottingham Forest had 21,000 standing places compared with Liverpool’s 10.100. So. Liverpool’s
 allocation was more expensive as well as smaller. Understandably, Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
 o f places and tickets. They sought with some support from the host club and the FA to have it changed in
 1988, but the police were adamant. To switch ends would, in their opinion, have involved rival supporters
 crossing each other’s paths when approaching the ground thereby frustrating attempts at segregation and
 creating a risk of disorder. In 1989, when the same plan was proposed. Liverpool again challenged it. The
 police, however, maintained their view, adding that those who had attended in 1988 would be familiar with the
 arrangements and that any change would lead to confusion.
Access from Leppings Lane
   37. As the plan Appendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck or forecourt at
a bend in Leppings Lane where, coming from the north, it turns to the south-west and crosses a bridge over the
river Don. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north and west of the ground. They
were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs of Leppings Lane and would converge on the
forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line of railings with six sets of double gates. Inside
those perimeter gates is the short approach to the turnstiles. As shown in the photographs Appendix 2. the
latter are in two sections divided by a fence. The northern section consists of turnstiles 1 to 16. Numbers 1 to
10 gave access to the north stand. Thus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9.700 with north stand seats. Their
tickets were marked “Entrance A” and were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
letter A above them and brown boards on the wall.

   38. Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for those with seats in the west stand. Thus 4.456 were served by six turnstiles.
They were the next block to the right of those marked A. However, instead o f these turnstiles and the west stand
tickets being marked B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were marked C. Their colour-code on
tickets and boards was red.

  39. On the other side of the dividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
10,100 with tickets for the west terracing. Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. This was because there
had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the sequential numbering continued from 19 upwards
on the south side of the ground. When the number at Leppings Lane was brought up to 23 the present
arrangements o f 1 to 1-6, A to G and then 19 upwards was adopted to avoid re-numbering all round the ground.
However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. “ Entrance B” also appeared on tickets for the west
terrace. Thus, the three blocks of turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane end read from
left to right A, C, B. The colour-code for west terrace tickets and the boards beside turnstiles A to G was mauve.
To the right of turnstile G is a tubular steel barrier to divide the queue for that turnstile from the roadway to the
south stand.

Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
  40. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. There is an exit gate (marked A
on Appendix 1) between turnstile 1 and the adjacent housing.

  41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 and 7 and the steps to the west stand. There is a
wall dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G. It had been built to segregate home and away fans ata
time when the Club intended they should share the west terrace. That idea was not pursued but the wall
remained. There was, however, a gateway in the wall which did permit access between the two areas. An exit
gate (marked B on Appendix 1) was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

  42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse bounded on the left by the wall just
m entioned and on the right by the wall of the private roadway coming from the south stand to Leppings Lane.
There was an exit gate in the latter wall (marked C on Appendix 1) just inside turnstile G.

  43. All three exit gates, A. B and C. were of concertina design. They could be opened only from the inside
and were not intended for entry of spectators into the ground.

  44. Those entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. They could by
moving to the right go round the south end of the west stand and gain entry’ into pens 1 and 2. They could go
through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse behind turnstiles 11 to 16 and then round the north
end of the west stand into pens 6 or 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting them to take either of
those courses. The obvious way in was straight ahead of the turnstiles where a tunnel under the middle of the
west stand gave access to pens 3 and 4. Above its entrance in large letters was the word “Standing” and a large
letter “B”. Thus B ticket holders were drawn towards the tunnel.

  45. The length of the tunnel is some 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels off but finally descends
towards the terraces at a gradient of 1 in 6. As it emerges onto the terrace, the way ahead is bisected by the radial
fence between pen 3 on the right and pen 4 on the left. A short spur of brick wall projects forward from each side
of the tunnel at its mouth. Those emerging are thus guided straight forward rather than to either side. The
photograph at Appendix 3 shows the west stand and terraces.

   46. As with the layout on the terraces, the configuration of the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the areas inside
 them waseffected by a series o f piecemeal changes. Again, it will be necessary to analyse their resultant effect.

Policing Arrangements
  47. At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been under the control of Chief Superintendent Mole, then
Com mander of F Division within whose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
the FA broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over command of F Division on 27 March to
Superintendent Duckenfield on the latter's promotion to Chief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 March, but on 27 March Mr Mole bowed out and Mr Duckenfield took over. Under him were
Sector Commanders, all Superintendents with much experience of policing football matches at Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular. Superintendent Marshall was in charge of the area outside the Leppings Lane
entrance and the approaches to it. Superintendent Greenwood was in command inside the ground, but this
included the area between the turnstiles and the perim eter fence. They thereby swapped roles from the
previous year. Under Mr Duckenfield’s overall com m and were some 801 officers and men on duty at the
ground plus traffic officers and others from D Division to deal with the influx of supporters into the city centre.
In all, therefore, some 1,122 police were deployed for this match amounting to about 38 percent of the total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the mounted section o f 34 were officers from Liverpool and Nottingham to
assist respectively in marshalling their home supported. The total at the ground was divided into serials
consisting usually of eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. The serials were posted to duties
at various stations in and around the ground in three phases: before, during and after the match. All of this
was provided for in an Operational Order which followed closely the Order drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
and took into account the force’s “Standing Instructions for the Policing of Football Grounds". The Order
described the duties of each serial at each phase. It was supplemented by oral briefings before and on the day of
the match.

Sheffield Wednesday’s Arrangements
  48. The Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile operators for duty on 15 April. The stewards
were briefed as to their duties on the morning of the match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the
ground. They wore yellow tabards. The Club’s control room, situated below the south stand, could
communicate by VHF radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in their control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A computerised counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the running total of
spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end, there would be
separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). When the total for any section was within 15 per cent of its permitted capacity a warning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing that warning would occur when the numbers were within 15 per
cent of the total terrace capacity of 10,100. What the system could not do was m onitor the distribution of fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no warning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

Police Communications
  49. The nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west comer of the
ground between the south stand and pen 1 of the west terracing. The box is elevated and reached by a number
of steps. It has windows commanding views across the pitch and straight along the line of the west perimeter
fence. The box is very small and has seats for only three officers. Superintendent Murray was in control of it
and was advisor to M r Duckenfield as he had been to M r Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant
G oddard who operated the radios. The third seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone
and public address systems. At the back of the box stood Police Constable Bichard who was in control of the
police closed circuit television system operated by a row of consoles on a bench in front of him and behind the
three seated officers.

   50. There were five television screens showing views o f five roving cameras fixed at high points on the
stands and directed both inside and outside the ground. There was also a master screen which flicked in
rotation from one camera view to another and which made a video recording. The cameras have a zoom
facility to close in on any point of interest. Specifically, there were good camera views of the west terracing, o f
the Leppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them of Leppings Lane itself.

   51. The Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
 ground and outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed under the police control box, to relay
 music before the match, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
 speakers or if appropriate to one area only.

I     53. Radio contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside and outside the ground was
|   UHF on channel 25. There was a W1 FU. portable base station in the control box and if it failed there was a
    stand-by station under the operator’s bench. Hand sets were issued to all ranks of Sergeant and above.
    Community Constables on duty would already have their own. Other Constables had no radio.
    Communication was on “talk through” i.e. any message from any source would be heard by everyone tuned in
    and if more than one source spoke messages could become garbled. Ear pieces were issued to some officers in
    an attem pt to overcome the loud crowd noise which made receipt of signals very difficult. There were other
    radio channels open to Sergeant Goddard: VHF to police Headquarters at Snig Hill, channel 35 to FI
    Sub-divisional Headquarters at Hammerton Road and channel 19 used by CID. There was also a set tuned to
    Sheffield Wednesday’s radio system between its control room and the stewards.

                                   15th APRIL: THE BU ILD -U P TO 230pm

Early Arrivals
  54. 15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Saturday. The match was a sell-out, so 54.000 ticket holders
were expected. Others would come without tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain access otherwise.
The following account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western approaches and the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite early in
small numbers. Some brought cans of beer with them and were seen drinking as they walked; others took
advantage of the weather and sat about on walls and open spaces. When the public houses opened, many
resorted there, drinking inside or spilling out into the sunshine. Leppings Lane and its environs comprise a
mixed shopping and residential area. Local residents saw groups of Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
house or off-licence; Many were asking for tickets or “spares”. There were a few touts selling them at inflated
prices. From an early stage, some of the fans were using private gardens and yards to urinate. As the morning
wore on. numbers increased. Requests for tickets and trespass to urinate also increased. Still the prevailing
mood was one of carnival, good humour and expectation.

Public Houses
  55. There were some 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am.
Liverpool supporters did visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great amount of alcoholic drink was
bought there.

  56. Opening time at public houses was in general 11 am. Some remained closed all day. O f the others, some
72. mostly in the city, were frequented by local patrons only. Some 23 public houses, however, served over a
hundred Liverpool supporters each. Another 51 served more than 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
many supporters drank enough to affect their mood. At first excitement: later frustration.

The Gathering Crowd
   57. Towards the end of the morning, fans gathered on and around the bridge near the Leppings Lane
entrance. They seemed reluctant to enter the ground early. All turnstiles were open at 12 noon and one or two
as early as 11.30 am. Some 53 police had been deployed to operate outside the turnstiles and in the Leppings
Lane area. They enquired at random whether fans had tickets. Those who had hot were advised to go away;
nevertheless, many returned more than once. Those who had tickets were guided in the right direction. The
police tried to persuade them to enter the ground early. Officers, male and female, had been posted outside
each turnstile with the duty of searching entrants for weapons, drink or drugs. Once through the turnstile, an
entrant was liable to be searched again by one of a serial of officers positioned just inside.

   58. At about 12 noon Chief Inspector Creaser asked Superintendent Murray whether the pens on the west
terrace were to be filled one by one successively, but was told that they should all be available from the start and
the fans should find their own level.

  59. By 2 pm it was apparent to those inside the ground and those monitoring events in the police and Club
control rooms that the num ber of Nottingham fans in their places greatly outnumbered those from Liverpool.
The Kop and the south stand were filling up steadily, but the north and west stands were half empty. It was
noted about that tim e that the turnstile figures showed only 12,000 had entered as against 20,000 at the same
time the previous year. On the west terraces, although pens 3 and 4 were filling, the wing pens 1,2,6 and 7 were
nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 and 4 to move forward and make room for
others.

  60. There had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. This time, there was only one. It arrived
early, just before 2 pm. at Wadsley Bridge station. The 350 passengers were met by both mounted and foot
police officers who escorted them in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. They were orderly and passed through
the turnstiles into the ground by about 2.20 pm without incident.

  61. By this time the police Traffic Division reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the majority o f
Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. The numbers converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
increasing rapidly. Between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles the crowd became congested. There was no
longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx filling the whole approach area. The foot officers
outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone and had difficulty in searching even selectively.


                                                         9




                                                                                     ~          t   ”           ™
M ounted officers in and outside the turnstile area were having difficulty manoeuvring in such a dense crowd.
The police were beset by fans bemused by the ticket and turnstile labelling asking for directions. Many had
been drinking but up to and just after 2. 30 pm the mood rem ained good.

  62.     Superintendent Marshall was on foot amongst the crowd. He became anxious about the numbers
coming down Leppings Lane and spilling out onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving. At 2.1 7
pm he radioed to control to have m otor traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. This was eventually done at about
2.30 pm. Up to this time, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles and the numbers still approaching, there
was still no panic in the crowd; no perception of crisis by the police. In the control room M r Murray, who could
see Leppings Lane on the video, advised M r Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. Mr
Duckenfield reaffirmed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be ordered only if there was some
major external factor such as fog on the Pennines or delay on the motorway: not if spectators merely turned up
late even in large numbers.
                                                 CHAPTER3

                                    THE CRISIS AT THE TURNSTILES

  63. In the 20 minutes from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm there were crucial developments both inside and outside
the ground. In pens 3 and 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as more fans came through the tunnel to the
favoured area behind the goal. By 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a degree which caused serious
discomfort to many well used to enduring pressure on terraces. The numbers at that time were clearly in excess
of the maxim um density stated by the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 Edn) (the Green
Guide) i.e. 54 persons per 10 square metres. (Although the Green Guide has no statutory or legal force, it is the
only official advice available about safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens 1, 2. 6 and 7, there was still
ample room and bare patches of concrete were visible.

  64. Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As more arrived at the back the crush at the
front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles became more difficult. Their efficiency was impaired and their rate
reduced. Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the build-up increased. The foot
officers outside were unable to function and in danger themselves so they went through the turnstiles and out
again through gate C where they did what they could to relieve pressure by the tubular barrier. The mounted
officers were surrounded by the dense mass of people and became ineffective. Superintendent Marshall was in
the midst o f the turmoil. He extricated himself and stood on a parapet of the bridge to get a clear view. A
drunken fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a mounted officer. But these were isolated acts by
individuals; the menace came from the massive numbers single-mindedly determined to be in for the kick-off
with time running out. At the back of the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack of progress as 3 o’clock
approached. Some, mostly young men who had been drinking, tried to push and force their way forward. At
the front, people were jam m ed together and against the turnstile walls. Some panicked as the pressure
intensified. Some youngsters and women were fainting and in distress. They were helped out through the
tubular barrier by turnstile G or were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans climbed up and over the
turnstile building or on to the dividing fence. This was to escape the crush rather than to gain free entry since
most of them had tickets.

  65. At 2.44 pm M r Marshall radioed for reinforcements, for the Tannoy to request the crowd to stop
pushing and for a vehicle with loudspeaker equipment to come and request the same. Unhappily, at about 2.40
pm, radio com m unication on channel 25 became defective. For a period of two or three minutes the'control
room lost contact-. A communications officer came promptly and switched to the standby station. With the use
of a handset at control, contact was restored. Despite this hiatus, two of Mr Marshall’s requests were received.
The Tannoy was used but with little effect. Reinforcements, including mounted officers from Penistone Road,
were sent. The third request, for a Landrover, was received direct by its driver PC Buxton who arrived at 2.46
pm and urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. This was no more effective than the Tannoy. The
m ounted officers besieged near the turnstiles came outside the perimeter gates. An attem pt was made to shut
them against the crowd outside, to enable the throng inside to be dispersed or at least thinned through the
turnstiles. The pressure from without, however, opened the gates again. Mounted officers, now reinforced to
greater numbers, formed a cordon across the elbow of Leppings Lane from the sweet shop to the bridge, again
with the object of reducing pressure inside the gates. They were successful in this for some minutes despite
desperate individuals forcing their way under or between the horses. However, this exercise was overtaken by a
more dramatic relief o f the pressure.

“Open the Gates”
  66. Between 2.40 pm and 2.45 pm the crowd inside and outside the turnstile approach had swelled to
over 5,000. At the head of the phalanx conditions had become intolerable. Those who got through were short
of breath and sweating profusely. Many complained to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
and asked them in forceful terms to do something. Exit gates A and B were being shaken. It was clear the crowd
could not pass through the turnstiles by 3 pm. Police Constable Buxton radioed from the Landrover to control
asking that kick-off be postponed. The suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

  67. Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had become unmanageable. Although loth to do so, since it
was contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure.
Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. Other senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he
radioed control to permit the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm, whilst Mr Duckenfield was considering the
request, gate C opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
advantage and about 150 managed to get in before a mounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. Mr
Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He repeated it a third time, adding that if the


                                                        11
gates were not opened someone was going to be killed. In the control room, Mr Duckenfield had not made .a
decision. M r Murray asked him “Are you going to open the gates?”. M r Duckenfield gave the order and Sgt
Goddard radioed to M r Marshall “Open the gates”. Neither the Club control room nor any police officers
inside the turnstiles were told of this order before or after it was given or of any action it would require.

  68. At 2.52 pm, gate C was opened wide. Fans behind turnstiles A to G and from the concourse beyond
came round to flow through it in large numbers.

   69. About two minutes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite the gateman’s
objection, for it to be opened. If it was not, he said, “It’ll go and someone will get killed”. Permission was given,
but this time reserve serials were alerted to m onitor the inrush towards the north stand. Gate B was also briefly
opened against the gateman’s wishes and about 200 of those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
left.                                          ■

  70. The largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the five minutes it was open about 2,000 fans passed
through it steadily at a fast walk. Some may have had tickets for the stands. No doubt some had no tickets at all.
The majority had tickets for the terraces. O f these, some found their way either right to pens 1 and 2 or left
through the dividing wall to 6 and 7. But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnel in front o f them.
                                                CHAPTER 4

                                              TH E DISASTER

   71. The initial i-nflux through gate C. augmented by entrants via the turnstiles, came through the tunnel
with great momentum. Fans spoke of being swept through, feet off the ground. The 1 in 6 gradient accelerated
their progress. Upon reaching the crowded pens, some wished to go back but were unable to do so. The new
arrivals found themselves pushed forward and the pressure became intense. At 2.54 pm, shortly after this
influx began, the teams came onto the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. Many were now
acutely uncomfortable and some were in distress. The mass seethed about but voluntary movement by any
individual was difficult: hands down could not be raised and some fans found it hard to breathe. Still the flow
continued through the tunnel causing further surges forward. There were shouts for help and for the gates to be
opened to the pitch. Police officers on the perimeter track did not immediately react. In the deafening noise
from chanting and shouting they did not at first recognise the problem. Realisation came at different moments
to different officers in different places.

   72. Gate 3 sprang open under the intense pressure from within. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
afterwards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. Those seeking to escape were urged and pushed back. Gate
4 was opened by a policeman who noticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it and were directed
to the wing pens where there was still ample room. Meanwhile! gate 4 was closed again and then re-opened. At
gate 3. a Constable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his written orders and radioed for permission to
open that gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon himself to open it.

  73. Just before 3 pm, the match kicked off. At the same time, gate C. which had been closed at 2.57 pm.
was reopened and a steady trickle continued to enter through the tunnel.

   74. To escape the crush, fans began climbing the radial fences out of pens 3 and 4 into pens 2 and 5. Others
tried to get over the front perimeter fence but were at first turned back by police who feared a pitch invasion.
Near the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the point of collapse and in some instances death but
they were held upright by pressure all round. Further back, most were so preoccupied with the pain of being
pressed against barriers and with breathing problems that they saw nothing o f the game. But at the rear there
were many who. although cramped, were watching the football unaware of the distress at the front.

  75. At 3.04 pm, Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. There was a roar from the
Liverpool fans and at the same time a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. The several surges which occurred after
the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens towards the pitch. The force became such as to twist
and break two spans o f a crush barrier towards the front of pen 3. The evidence does not establish with
certainty when this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm. But I am sure it occurred after
the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. When the barrier broke those whom it had
supported were projected towards the perimeter fence. Many fell and the involuntary rush of those behind
pressed them down. The crushing force was transm itted and dispersed so that all along the front of pen 3 fans
were pressed hard up against the low wall and the wire mesh of the fence above it.

  76. In pen 4 no barrier broke. Nevertheless those at the front were crushed against wall and fence. Further
back, two barriers were bowed and some individuals succumbed to the pressure around them.

   77. Surges on terraces are common. Usually, they go forward, then recede. Here, with the weight of
numbers, there was no receding. The pressure stayed and for those crushed breathless by it, standing or prone,
life was ebbing away. If no relief came in four minutes there would be irreversible brain damage; if longer,
death.

  78. In the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything amiss in pens 3 and 4 until the first
tans spilt out onto the perimeter track just before kick-off. Then, the officers in command assumed that there
was an attempted pitch invasion. They called up reserve serials waiting in the gymnasium and all available
officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was made to HQ for dog handlers.

   79. Superintendent Greenwood, the G round Commander, was by the players’ tunnel at the kick-off. He
noticed fans on the track and went to the west end behind the goal. As he approached, he did not think the pens
overcrowded until he was very close and saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
situation "retrievable” if those higher up the pen relieved the pressure. He climbed on the wall below the fence
and signalled with both hands to those behind to move back. Other officers joined him. It was impossible.
Those fans who would have wished to comply were powerless to do so. Behind them, there were still many
unaware o f the crisis, watching the game. The football continued to joyous shouting and singing round the rest
of the ground while those crushed and trapped slowly expired.

   80.   When Mr Greenwood’s signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for the match to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control,.so he signalled with his arms towards the control
box. Mr Duckenfield sent Mr Murray down from the box to have the match stopped via the linesman, the
agreed emergency drill. Before he could do so, Mr Greenwood ran over the pitch to the referee who stopped the
game. It was 5'A minutes past 3.

                                              T H E AFTERM ATH

Rescue Attempts
   81. From 3 o’clock, gates 3 and 4 had been open and remained so. At first, fans had walked or staggered out
winded and faint. But the final surge at 3.04 pm. and the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a horrendous
blockage of bodies. The dead, the dying and the desperate became interwoven in the sump at the front of the
pens, especially by the gates. Those with strength left clambered over others submerged in the human heap and
tried to climb out over the fence. They were now helped by police and other fans who hauled them up and over.
Numbers o f fans were climbing over the radial fences into adjacent pens. At the back, many were hauled up
into the west stand to relieve the pressure.

  82. The steps from the sump at gateways 3 and 4 were so congested with bodies live and dead that each had
to be prised from the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A number o f individual
officers and fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow that only two or three
could get at the entwined bodies Willing hands got in one another’s way. More officers arrived from the
gymnasium and elsewhere in the ground. Many used their own initiative to help those laid out on the pitch, to
assist in getting others over the fencing and to comfort the distressed. But some stood in groups near the
perimeter fence not knowing what to do. They had been summoned in response to what was thought to be a
threat to public order. What they found was a horrific scene of carnage and some young officers were shocked
into impotence by what they saw.

  83. It was truly gruesome. The victims were blue, cyanotic, incontinent: their mouths open, vomiting; their
eyes staring. A pile o f dead bodies lay and grew outside gate 3. Extending further and further on to the pitch, the
injured were laid down and attempts made to revive them. More and more walking survivors flooded out on to
the pitch as the players left. The scene was emotive and chaotic as well as gruesome. As the enormity o f the
disaster was realised, many o f the fans milling about were bitter and hostile to the police, blaming them for
what had happened. Officers were confronted, abused, spat upon and even assaulted. A small number of
hysterical fans had to be subdued.

  84. Adding to the chaos, a number o f press photographers dodged about among rescue workers apparently
avid to secure photographs at point blank range o f those dying through the wire mesh and those laid on the
pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them. Police had to intervene.

   85. At about 3.12 pm, Chief Superintendent Nesbit, Com mander o f the Traffic Division, arrived on the
pitch. He took charge at gate 3 and organised a chain o f officers to simplify and expedite the extraction of
casualties from the pen. In the absence o f any mechanical means, police and fans together pulled and worked
at the wire mesh with their bare hands and their feet to breach the fencing. They succeeded in both pens,
enabling officers to get in and fans to be got out.

   86. By now, some officers of their own initiative went round from the pitch to the tunnel where they met
other officers from the turnstiles and the west stand. Together, they tried to persuade fans at the rear o f the pens
to go back through the tunnel. Some complied, but many resisted, wishing to stand their ground. Casualties
were brought out through the tunnel, and as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
further in and bring out more casualties, dead and alive. They were laid on the ground in the concourse outside
the tunnel and attempts were made to revive them.

First Aid
  87. The St John Ambulance Brigade had some 30 personnel posted round the ground for the match - 25
adults and 5 junior cadets, They were quickly on the scene when the first casualties emerged and sought to
revive them. Their Divisional Superintendent, Mr Wells, tried unsuccessfully to help those pressed against the
fencing by feeding oxygen to them through the mesh until they could be got out.

    88. Dr Purcell, Sheffield Wednesday’s doctor, came from his seat in the south stand and attempted
 resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he moved from patient to patient doing what he could,
 but in most cases it was too late.

   89. At 3.13 pm a St John’s ambulance came onto the pitch at the north-east com er and drove to the
 perim eter fence close to gate 3. There was no call for doctors and nurses on the public address system until
 nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the minutes ticked past, some of them came onto the pitch to help o f their


                                                          15
own accord when they saw the casualties and the ambulance and realised the gravity o f the situation. Many
fans also worked prodigiously in attempts to revive the dead and the dying, in some cases their own relatives
and friends. Artificial respiration, mouth to mouth respiration and cardiac massage were applied by the skilled
and the unskilled but usually in vain. Those capable o f survival mostly came round o f their own accord. The
rest were mostly doomed before they could be brought out and treated.

   90. There was an urgent need to get casualties off the pitch and to hospital. There were six stretchers in the
first aid room and three in the St John's ambulance. They were quickly brought into use. Then the fans
improvised by tearing down the hoardings around the edge of the pitch and against the stands so that lengths of
board could be used as stretchers. Improvising in this way, parties of fans and police ran repeatedly the length
of the pitch bearing casualties to the north-east corner. A num ber were dead on arrival there.

In the Control Room
  91. Mr Duckenfield stayed in the control room. Chief Inspector McRobbie was there in civilian clothes as
an observer. Mr Duckenfield sent him down to the track to tell a policewoman at gate 1 to admit those
displaced from the centre pens. Mr Duckenfield did not realise there were injuries until he saw someone laid
on the pitch. Even then, he did not realise the nature o f the problem or its scale.

  92. Mr Murray returned from his attem pt to stop the match and Mr Duckenfield sent him down again to
clear the pitch and assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear the pitch. This was
because Mr Duckenfield could not from the control room see clearly what was happening for the milling and
increasing numbers.

  93. The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations). Mr Jackson, had attended the match in civilian clothes as
a guest of the Club. He came from his seat in the south stand to ask what had happened. M r Duckenfield was
unable to say: he did not tell M r Jackson that the exit gates had been opened on his authority. Mr Jackson w'ent
down to the pitch to discover the situation.

   94. At 3.06 pm Mr Duckenfield. still primarily concerned about public order, caused a message to be sent
to Headquarters asking for Operation Support. That was a call for all available additional police resources to
come to the ground to strengthen the police presence.

   95. Mr Jackson was told by Mr Greenwood that there were casualties and returned immediately to control
to make sure emergency services were alerted. Meanwhile. Mr Murray had seen the plight of those behind the
fence. He radioed to control that a fleet of ambulances was required. He also asked for a Tannov broadcast to
those in the pens to move back but there is no clear evidence that it was made.

  96. Only when Mr Duckenfield received the request fora fleet of ambulances did he realise the nature and
gravity of the situation. Then, supported by Mr Jackson, he caused messages to be sent converting Operation
Support into calls for the Major Disaster Plan.

 No Information
   97. Apart from the message to clear the pitch and the belated call for medical assistance about 3.30 pm. no
 information or advice was broadcast on the public address system. Mr Duckenfield feared that the crowd
 might turn hostile or might all attempt to leave together thereby hampering the emergency services if they were
 given information about what had happened. The result w-as that apart from those close enough at the west end
 to see the terrible truth for themselves, the majority of the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
 Nottingham supporters in the Kop, still thought there had been a pitch invasion or other misbehaviour by
 Liverpool fans. They continued singing.and chanting incongruously. This infuriated some Liverpool fans who
 were already distraught. A few began to run towards the Kop end. The police feared violence might result on
 top of the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large number of officers to form a line across the
 width of the pitch at the Kop end and advance up to the halfway line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
 moved. There the line stood as an insurance against disorder but doing nothing. Other officers were posted to
 the perimeter track facing the north stand for the same purpose. To those distressed and distraught who
 wanted urgent action, this large contingent of passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
 intensified.

 Misinformation
  98. At about 3.15 pm, Mr Graham Kelly, Chief Executive of the FA. Mr Kirton also of the FA and Mr
 Graham Mackrell. Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday, went to the control room for information. M r
 Duckenfield told them he thought there were fatalities and the game was likely to be abandoned. He also said a


                                                          16




 —     —                                                                                       " 'V r"'~” —         ~
gate had been forced and there had been an inrush of Liverpool supporters. He pointed to one of the television
screens focussed on gate C by the Leppings Lane turnstiles and said “That’s the gate that’s been forced: there’s
been an inrush”. Inevitably M r Kelly was interviewed a little later live on television. He spoke of the two stories
concerning the gate - the fans’ account that the police had opened it. the police assertion that the fans had
forced their way in.

  99. About 3.30 pm there was a further meeting in the Club’s boardroom. Mr Duckenfield went there and
met Mr Kelly, the referee and representatives of the three clubs. ACC Jackson was also there. Mr
Duckenfield indicated the match was likely to be abandoned although no firm ruling was given. He added that
he did not want people to know it was to be abandoned lest the dispersing crowd hamper the emergency
operations.                                                                          -

Public Announcements
   100. Later the managers of the two teams were asked to go to the control room. They were invited there to
make a public announcement to calm the crowd. Mr Kenny Dalglish agreed to do so. He told the crowd that
there were problems and asked them to assist the police and those rendering first aid. He asked for-calm andhis
message was well received. It was then 3.56 pm. At 4.10 pm it was announced that the match was abandoned
for that day. Again that message was received calmly by the crowd most of whom behaved responsibly as they
dispersed..

Fire Brigade
   101. Meanwhile the emergency services had been in action. At about 3.10 pm a request came from the
perimeter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the wire mesh. Sergeant Goddard contacted the police garage
close by without success. At 3.13 pm, PC Bichard requested Headquarters to call the fire service to bring
hydraulic cutting equipment to the Leppings Lane entrance.

       102. There was no arrangement for a fire officer to be present during the match. However, the Major
    Disaster Plan required all emergency services to be alerted. After ’phone messages which must be described
    later, fire appliances arrived at both Leppings Lane and Penistone Road at 3.22 pm. At both entrances their
    arrival surprised police who were uninformed as to why they had been called or where they should go.

      103. At Leppings Lane a police Inspector told Station Officer Swain “I don't really think we need you”.
    Another police officer then asked for more resuscitators as people were dying so Mr Swain radioed for ten fire
    appliances. Each carries oxygen and resuscitation equipment.

       104. At the Kop end, Leading Fireman Housley arrived with an emergency tender and Station Officer
    Fletcher in another appliance, each with a crew. The emergency tender came along the roadway by the south
    stand but owing to its height was unable to proceed further. It therefore backed out and went to the Leppings
    Lane entrance losing some eight minutes. From there, M r Housley and his crew went onto the pitch with
    resuscitation equipment. They rendered help there and later at the gymnasium. Mr Fletcher and his men ran
    along behind the south stand carrying cutting equipment and oxygen cylinders. When they arrived at the
    fence, the cutting equipment was not required as by then the last of the dead and injured were being removed
    from the pens. Mr Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area under the police box and firemen assisted in carrying
    victims as well as rendering first aid on the pitch.

    South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYM AS)
/      105. Before 1986 there had been no SYMAS representative routinely present at Hillsborough matches. The
    Club was content, as indeed are many other clubs, to rely upon the St John’s Ambulance Brigade and a 999 call
    if necessary. From 1986 onwards, after representations, the Club provided two seats in the south stand for
    SYMAS staff at League matches. At one stage it was suggested they would be best placed in the north stand
    close to the gymnasium which had been designated as the casualty centre in the event o f a major incident. The
    south stand seats were allotted as they placed the SYMAS staff closer to the players’ tunnel should a player be
    injured. These seats were, however, not available at Cup semi-finals. SYMAS representatives nevertheless
    attended at the semi-finals by arrangement with the police in 1988 and again in 1989. The SYMAS officers
    stood on the ramp leading to the pitch at the north-east comer. They had one ambulance outside the ground
    and one on standby.

       106.    On 15 April 1989, Officers Higgins and Eason were at the ground with an ambulance and crew. They
    noticed fans on the track and went to the Leppings Lane end whilst the game was still in progress. They began
    to attend to casualties. Meanwhile, at 2.59 pm, th eretiad been a call from Police Constable Waugh at police


                                                            17
Headquarters to the Hillsborough police control asking if ambulances were required. This was on the
instruction o f Chief Inspector Edmundson who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
himself, crowd noise and snatches of speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress and possible injuries. The
reply from the control box was: no reports of injuries but keep standing by. At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
ground that there might be injuries, police Headquarters notified SYMAS that ambulances might be required.
Then, seconds later, Mr M urray’s request for a fleet of ambulances was relayed to SYMAS. They reacted at
once. Ambulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entrance at 3.13 pm and at the Penistone Road
entrance at 3.17 pm. In all, some 42 ambulances attended, 31 of them from SYMAS and 11 from
neighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm, they had conveyed some 172 casualties to the Northern General
Hospital and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

Gymnasium
  107. The gymnasium had been in use for serving meals to the police. When the Major Disaster Plan was
ordered, it was cleared and divided into two. One end became a temporary mortuary: the other was used as a
casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed and improvised, brought in more and more
casualties, the scene was initially and inevitably chaotic and harrowing. There was intense distress amongst
the injured and bereaved; relatives were reluctant to be parted from the dead and sought to revive them. There
were people looking for missing friends and relations; there were recriminations, there were scuffles. Some of
those involved were the worse for drink. Doctors and nurses had followed the casualties in from the pitch and
sought to attend the injured as best they could in the adverse circumstances. Those in most urgent need of
hospital treatment were taken to ambulances as they arrived, triage being employed to determine priorities.
Doctors were requested by the police to examine each person thought to be deceased to confirm and certify
death. A police Constable was detailed to attend and guard each of the dead and a photograph of each was
taken by a police photographer so that relatives coming to identify bodies could be spared the ordeal of
searching amongst all who had died.

The Dead and the Injured
  108. O f the 95 who died, the evidence suggests that at least 16 and probably 21 came through gate C after it
opened at 2.52 pm. That is established by the statements of relatives and friends who came through with them
but survived.

   109. By commendable hard work, a team of pathologists headed by Professor Usher completed
post-mortem examinations on all the deceased within 48 hours. They found that 88 of the victims were male
and seven female. Thirty-eight were under 20 years of age, 39 were between 20 and 29 years and only three were
over 50, In virtually every case the cause of death was crush asphyxia due to compression of the chest wall
against other bodies or fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In all but nine cases that was the sole cause.
In one, pressure on the chest had been so great as to rupture the aorta; in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck or chest; in the remaining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. Thirteen of those were rib fractures. However, one was a fractured femur, one a fractured
radius and the remaining three involved fractures of bones or cartilages round the voice box. These injuries
suggest the victims may have been trodden while on the ground.

  110. Blood samples were taken from the dead. No alcohol was found in any of the females. O f the males. 51
had no more than 10 milligrams per cent in their blood which is negligible; 15 had over 80 milligrams per cent
and six over 120 milligrams per cent.

   111. Although the great majority of those who died were in pen 3, at least five were in pen 4. Most deaths
 occurred at the front of the pens but there were a few fatalities further back.

   112. In all, some 730 people complained.of being.injured inside the ground and 36 outside it. O f the 730.
 about 30% are thought to have entered through gate C after 2.52 pm. The largest category' of injury- was
 bruising, especially to the ribs and chest.

                                          SPECIFIC IN CIDENTS

  113. I have given my findings as to the basic factual background and the main sequence of events in
narrative form. There was very little conflict as to the principal events save as to some timings and numbers.
Indeed, the consistency of the evidence has been a remarkable feature of this Inquiry. The experiences of most
witnesses were unforgettable and no doubt the early hearing helped to preserve accurate memory. Also, the
existence of timed videos and photographs and of logged and taped messages provided reliable checks by
which to prompt and test witness recollection. Accordingly, I have not for the most part burdened the narrative
with citations from the evidence of individual witnesses.

   114. However, there were several instances of detailed evidence and assertions being highlighted by the
media in dramatic and emotive terms during the hearing. Since some of those much-publicised incidents gave
rise to unfair criticism, they ought to be the subject of specific findings. I have therefore dealt with them
individually at Appendix 6.

                                PART II - WHY DIB IT HAPPEN?


                 “Events o f the m agnitude o f H illsborough don't usually happen ju s t fo r one
              single reason, nor is it usually possible to p in the blame on one single scapegoat. . .
              . . . Disasters happen because a whole series o f mistakes, misjudgments and
              mischances happen to come together in a deadly co m b in atio n."
                                                            D r John Habgood. Archbishop of York, preaching at
                                                           the Hillsborough Memorial Service on 23 April 1989.

   115. This disaster was the wdrst in the history of British football. It happened because pens 3 and 4 became
grossly overcrowded. They were uncomfortably overcrowded by 2.50 pm at least to a degree which required
that they should be closed to further arrivals. Even th e numbers coming through the turnstiles in the last 10
minutes would have increased the pressure beyond danger point and there would have been injuries if not
fatalities. As it was, the influx through gate C after 2.52 pm so increased the pressure in the two pens as to
cause fatal crushing.

   116. The overcrowding up to 2.52 pm was due to a number of factors which can be considered broadly
under three heads.
   (i) The layout at the Leppings Lane end.
  (ii) Lack o f fixed capacities for the pens.
 (iii) Lack o f effective monitoring of the terraces.

   117. The crushing and fatalities after 2.52 pm must be considered under a num ber of headings.
  (iv) The build-up at the turnstiles.
   (v) The blunder on opening the gates.
  (vi) The barriers in pen 3.
 (vii) The crushing not recognised.
(viii) The response of the police.
  (ix) The perimeter gates were too small.

                                    THE LAYOUT AT TH E LEPPIN G S LANE END

        118. I have already observed that the layout o f the turnstile area, of the terraces and of the concourse
      between them was the result of piecemeal changes. A brief history o f these changes is now necessary.

      The History
         119. Before 1965, the Leppings Lane end consisted entirely of terracing like the Kop. In that year, the west
      stand was built and the terraces remaining in front o f it were truncated to their present depth, front to back. As
      to width, they consisted of a single standing area with no dividing fences. During the early 1970’s, hooliganism
      and pitch invasions made it necessary to prevent access to the playing area and the perimeter fences were
      therefore erected in 1977.

          120. Section 1 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 empowered the Secretary of State to designate a
       sports stadium having, in his opinion, accommodation for more than 10,000 as a stadium requiring a
       certificate from the local authority. Hillsborough was so designated with effect from 1 January 1979 by SI
       1978/1091. In anticipation of that date, Sheffield Wednesday instructed Eastwood and Partners, a firm o f
       consulting engineers, to act on their behalf especially in their dealings with the local authority. Dr Eastwood,
       the principal of the firm, is a highly experienced civil and structural engineer and has advised several major
      ■ football clubs. He recommended that a num ber of additional crush barriers should be added since those
       already in place were insufficient to comply with the Green Guide (1976 edition). That work was approved
       and carried out during 1979.

        121. The relevant local authority at the time was the South Yorkshire County Council. It set up an Officer
      Working Party consisting of representatives of the police, the fire service, its own building surveyor’s division
      and its own legal and administration department. The Working Party made inspections and consulted with the
      Club and D r Eastwood. A Safety Certificate was issued on 21 December 1979 for an indefinite period. It has
      remained in force ever since and has not been amended.

         122. Schedule 3 of the certificate sets out the maximum crowd capacity for various areas in the ground. The
      figure for the west terrace is 7,200 and for the north-west terrace 2,900. These figures were intended to be in
      accordance with the Green Guide (1976). Paragraph 15.4 provided for a maximum “packing density” o f
      between 54 and 27 persons per 10 square metres depending on the condition of the terrace. Dr Eastwood had
      calculated 8,000 for the west terrace on the basis of 54 per 10 square metres. He thought this a justified starting
      figure in view of his improved system of barriers. However, he reduced it to 7,200 because there were no
      gangways on the terrace and he did not think it feasible to provide any. So, the total figure for the Leppings Lane
      terraces was and is 10,100.

      The 1981 Serai-Finai
         123. As already mentioned, there~was crushing at the Cup semi-final in 1981. The match was between
       Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The police debriefing minutes after the incident
       prophetically refer,

         “ to the late arrival of a large number o f spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane
         enclosure when the match started. The flash point occurred when Tottenham scored” (at the Kop end) “after
         only three minutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was happening and caused a
         crush, which resulted in the injuries”.

         124. Those being crushed called for the perimeter gates to be opened onto the track. There was no
       im m ediate reaction, according to Mr Vaux who was there, but fortunately a police Inspector gave instructions
       and the gates were then opened. About 250 came out onto the track. There were broken arms, legs and ribs and
       38 were treated either in hospital or by the St John Ambulance Brigade. It is clear from the documents (a) that
       the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure o f 10,100 had been exceeded by over 400 (b) that the police
       shut off further access to the terraces because of crushing, and (c) the police view after the event was that the
%,
C,-
       capacity figure of 10,100 in the Safety Certificate was too high. This latter view was communicated to the Club
       by th e Chief Superintendent then in command of F Division but it was not pursued.


                                                               21
Three Pens
   125. After this incident in April 1981-the police requested that the terrace should be divided into sections.
The object was to improve crowd control by reducing sideways movement. Division would enable more even
distribution to be effected when there was a capacity crowd. It would also enable the west end to be used for
both home and away supporters who could be segregated in separate pens, if necessary with an empty pen
between them.

   126. This proposal was agreed by the Club and the Officer Working Party and was approved by the local
authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in November 1981. They are the fence now separating pens
2 and 3 and that now separating 5 and 6. The result was to divide the whole terrace into three pens. Access from
the concourse to the middle pen was through the tunnel and to the wing pens round the sides of the west stand.
D r Eastwood suggested and illustrated an altered layout which would have'provided separate access through
separate banks of turnstiles to the north stand, to each end of the west stand, and to each of the three pens.
Whilst the main object of this was segregation, such a layout would have enabled each of those areas to be
monitored numerically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its maximum capacity was not exceeded. The plan was
not adopted. The maximum capacity for the new centre pen was calculated at 2.200, but no alteration was
made to the Safety Certificate so to limit it nor was there any means mechanically o f counting the numbers
going into that pen.

The 1985 Changes
   127. By 1985, Sheffield Wednesday had been promoted to the First Division and was drawing larger
crowds. The improvement of the Leppings Lane end was raised again by the Club and Dr Eastwood prepared a
num ber of drawings. These illustrated various schemes for achieving segregation by providing more turnstiles
in separate banks and divisions of the concourse. The police wanted further divisions of the terrace itself,
again to improve control and segregation. There was much discussion of these schemes which included
suggestions o f 29 and even 34 turnstiles in total. In the result, the following alterations were carried out in
 1985.

New Radial Fences
  128. On the terraces, two more radial fences were fitted. One divided the existing central pen into the
present pens 3 and 4. Gates were fitted at the mouth o f the tunnel to enable each o f those pens to be closed off.
The second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create the narrow pen 5 intended to be a sterile area. Until
those two fences were added there existed only perimeter gates 1 ,2 ,4 ,5 and 6. The creation of pen 3 requ ired a
new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.

Barriers
   129. The lines of the new radial fences ran across existing crush barriers so that without modification those
barriers would have run through the fencing. The police considered the barriers would be used by fans as
convenient mounting points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating their object. They therefore wished
spans to be removed from the barriers. Had their wishes been met in full the result would have been an
unimpeded run in pen 3 from the mouth of the tunnel down the south side of the new fence to the perimeter. Dr
Eastwood dug his heels in against that proposal which he rightly regarded as dangerous. He did however agree
to some modification to the middle row of barriers in the newly created pen 3, chiefly to facilitate access.
Likewise in the new pen 5. The 1985 modifications to the pens are shown on the plan Appendix 4.

The Turnstiles and Concourse
   130. At the entrance, modification but no increase in num ber was made at the turnstiles. The bank 1 to 16
was divided from A to G by the metal fence now in place and that division, was projected across the concourse
inside the turnstiles in the form of a brick wall. A personnel gate was provided for access through that wall but
was enlarged to its present size at the request of the police. Those alterations were made in the interests of
segregation. The more elaborate divisions which D r Eastwood had suggested, giving separate access to each
sub-division of the accommodation, were not pursued for financial reasons. In May 1985 the Bradford
disaster occurred. The south stand at Hillsborough had wooden decking and the Club realised it would ha-ve to
undertake expensive remedial works there. The cantilever roof of the same stand was also discovered to
require expensive repairs.

   131. In fact, shortly after the new dividing fence and wall had been built at the Leppings Lane entrance and
concourse, the Club, by agreement with Chief Superintendent Mole, ceased to accommodate home supporters
at the Leppings Lane end. There was therefore no longer any need for segregation at that end. but the wall
remained.
        1'32. Also in 1985. electronic counting equipment was installed at all turnstiles. This conveyed the running
     count for each bank o f turnstiles, for example A to G, to a television screen in the Club control room where the
     figures were displayed. In 1986. an electronic eye was installed in each turnstile booth to catch and record
     anyone who climbed over the turnstile.

     Barrier 144
,i      133. In June 1986, the police requested that the crush barrier nearest to the tunnel at the entrance to pens 3
     and 4 should be removed to assist the flow of fans into t he pens. They found it caused obstruction because it
     was in a good viewing position and spectators liked to stand against it in numbers thereby blocking access by
j    others further into the pens. The police also suggested it might hamper effective evacuation through the tunnel
i    especially in an emergency. Dr Eastwood considered the pros and cons o f this proposal and accepted the police
!    view. The Officer Working Party approved the proposal at a meeting on 7 August 1986 on site. Authority was
}    given then and there by Mr Bownes on behalf of the Sheffield City Council which had taken over responsibility
     fortheSafety Certificate from South Yorkshire County Council on 1 April 1986. Two spans of the barrier were
     therefore removed, leaving only one span in pen 4 as shown on Appendix 4.

     Effects of the Layout
      134. The result o f these changes was to divide the terrace into a num ber o f small areas without providing
 I any computerised or mechanical means of limiting entry numerically into any one area if all areas were open
 ! for choice. Before the fences and pens had divided the terrace, the overall figure of 10.100 could be monitored
I via the turnstiles and in theory the crowd could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was not possible strictly to
   ensure compliance with Schedule 3 Part 1 of the Safety Certificate which prescribed a maximum of 2,900 for
   the north-west terrace and 7.200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 of the Safety Certificate
   provides:

       “The num ber of spectators admitted to the Stadium and to the several areas of spectator accommodation
       within the Stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1 of Schedule 3”.

       The Club had to rely upon visual monitoring.

      135. The situation became worse however with the division of the west terrace into pens. Not only were
   there more and smaller.discrete areas but some were likely to attract more than their appropriate share of the
    10,100 total. It is well recognised that the area behind the goal is very popular. Moreover, the position of the
   tunnel vis-a-vis the turnstiles A to G, its labelling and the absence of signposts advertising the wing pens would
   draw to it those with terrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely that pens 3 and 4 would fill to capacity and
 , indeed exceed it unless preventive steps were taken. Had D r Eastwood’s plan for separate turnstile access to
 ^ separate sections with separate toilet and refreshment facilities been implemented, total computerised control
   could have been kept.
                                                    CHAPTER 8

                              LACK OF FIXED CAPACITIES FOR THE PENS

  136. In 1981, when the terrace was divided into three areas. D r Eastwood gave the Club the figure of 2,200
capacity for the centre pen. He based this on the Green Guide, making such allowances as he thought right. No
doubt the numbers could have been counted in via the turnstiles if only that pen was in use o r i f such pens as
were in use were filled sequentially, but not otherwise.
   137. After the 1985 changes, Dr Eastwood did not himself give any figures for the new pens 3 and 4.
Someone on his staff however split the figure 2,200 into 1,200 for pen 3 and 1.000 for pen 4. Those figures did
not even take account of the fact that pen 5 had been carved out of pen 4 which was bound to have a reducing
effect on capacity. Nevertheless,, the figures of 1.200 and 1,000 were put on a drawing emanating from
Eastwood and Partners and the figures have been notionally regarded since as applicable by the Club and the
police. They are in fact too high.
  138.. D r Nicholson, at the Research and Laboratory Services Division of the Health and Safety Executive,
has calculated that the figures for pens 3 and 4 respectively would be 1,015 and 1,036 if the strength and
spacing of the crush barriers had complied with the Green Guide. But they did not.

Departures from the Green Guide
   139. In pen 3, four out of five gaps in the lines o f crush barriers do not conform with paragraph 115 o f the
Green Guide (1986). In pen 4, nine out of ten do not conform. In particular, the spans taken out of the barriers
in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess of the m axim um of 1.4 metres prescribed. One gap was 57% wider than
the Green Guide maximum. Moreover, that gap was in direct diagonal line from the mouth of the tunnel to the
barrier which collapsed. D r Eastwood justified these larger gaps by the absence of gangways. Fans had to be
able to get in and out and standard gaps tended to get blocked up. The effect of his reasoning was that the
absence of gangways, recognised as having a safety function, led to the sacrifice o f a second safety feature,
namely gaps of strictly limited width.

  140. Again, the removal of barrier 144 was bound, as D r Eastwood conceded, to affect capacity In fact it
did more, as I shall indicate later:
   141. Capacity should also have taken account of two further departures from the Green Guide. If. as was
the case, the perimeter gates were not regarded as exits, some 40% of those in pens 3 and 4 were more than 12
metres from an exit (and there was no gangway) contrary to the aim of paragraph 96. Four out of five of the
crush barriers in pen 3 and six out of nine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
were the old barriers which had been repaired and plated where their bases had corroded and fresh concrete
had been applied, raising the level of the steps. The point is not academic since, in the event, many fans were
bent painfully over barriers under great pressure.
   142. D r Nicholson calculated that when all relevant factors regarding the configuration and the Green
 Guide are taken into account, the maximum capacity for pen 3 should have been 822 and for pen 4.871.

 Safety Certificate
    143. Whatever should have been the maximum capacities for pens 3 and 4. the fact is that no figures at all in
 respect of them were put into trie Safety Certificate. Despite all the changes in layout of the fences and barriers,
 the two figures, 2,900 for the north-west terrace and 7,200 for the west terrace, have remained as the only
 maxim a with which the Club has to comply.
   144. Section 2(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 provides, (so far as is relevant):
   “A Safety Certificate shall contain such terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or
   expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in u s e ..
   Section 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):
   “Without prejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety C ertificate-
   (a) shall specify the maximum number of spectators to be adm itted to the stadium:
   (b) may specify the maximum number to be adm itted to different parts of it:
   (c) shall include terms and condM ons-
   ... (iii) as to the number, strength and situation of any crush barriers."


                                                          24
Section 2(2) was repealed by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987, section 19, which
gave power to the Secretary of State to lay down, by order, terms and conditions. No order has yet been
made and guidance from the Home Office has recommended local authorities to approach their
function under section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2(2). (See Home
O f f ic e Circular 71/1987 dated 25 November 1987, Annex A, paragraph 6.)


   145. It is clear that when the certificate was first issued the South Yorkshire County Council went
further than simply to fix the maximum numbers for the whole Stadium. They prescribed figures for
each part of the ground not merely by the four points of the compass but by specified sections.

  146. Section 8(1) o f the 1975 Act requires the holder of the certificate before carrying out any
proposals to alter or extend the stadium or any of its installations while a Safety Certificate is in
operation to give notice of those proposals to the local authority. That obligation is specifically
repeated in Sheffield Wednesday’s certificate at Schedule 2 Paragraph 5(2). The Club complied with
the requirement. Having received notice of the alterations to the pens and the barriers, the local
authority ought, in'my view, to have amended the Safety Certificate accordingly. They did not do so.

Why was the Safety Certificate not Amended?
   147. Although D r Eastwood acknowledged that the various changes to the layout would have had
an effect on capacity, he did not take active steps to see that appropriate am endments were made. He «
says he mentioned from time to time that the alterations would have an effect on capacity and that he
did not realise the Safety Certificate was not regularly updated. However, I find two memoranda in
early 1987 highly significant. Dr Eastwood’s assistant Mr Strange was concerned with queries from
the FA as to Hillsborough’s capacity for a semi-final. Mr Strange recorded these questions in a
memorandum:-

  “Has any account been taken for alterations done on Leppings Lane over the last few seasons? Is the 10,200
  or so figure still correct? I said that in my opinion it needs to be adjusted, better do it now than later.”

   148. Mr Strange’s next memo (a few days later) records as follows:-

  “D r Eastwood says leave the capacity at Leppings Lane end as it is, providing police have gates under West
  stand open so that people can distribute throughout the terrace evenly.”

Although he says the last nine words do not report him accurately, Dr Eastwood accepts the rest of that
message.

   149. In my view the provisions as to capacity in the Safety Certificate ought' to have been reviewed and
altered. The unhappy situation is that the police believed even the overall figure of 10,100 to be too high as far
back as 1981. That was reported to the Club but apparently not to Dr Eastwood. Meanwhile, that global figure
had been rendered academic by the sub-division of the terrace which was not reflected in the Safety Certificate
at all. If proper maximum figures had been inserted in the certificate for each of the pens, the Club and the
police might well have been prompted to find some means o f limiting the numbers entering those pens other
than by visual monitoring. This could have been done by implementing one of Dr Eastwood’s plans for totally
separate sections, turnstile to viewing area. It could have been done by insisting on sequential filling o f pens at
all matches; alternatively, by counting fans into each viewing area.

The City Council
    150. That the Safety Certificate was not amended and individual capacities not reviewed cannot be laid
 solely at Dr Eastwood’s door. He was, after all, consultant engineer to the Club and responsibility for the
 certificate was that o f the local authority. When the South Yorkshire County Council handed over to the
 Sheffield City Council, the latter delegated all its powers and duties under the 1975 Act to its General Purposes
 Panel. Apparently, therefore, the decision-making body on behalf of the Council was that Panel, although two
 specific functions were delegated to the Head o f Administration and Legal Departm ent - the power to issue a
 prbhibition under section 10 of the 197 5 Act and the power o f entry and search under section 11 o f the Act.

   151. In practice. M r Bownes, the Council’s Chief Licensing Officer in the Administration and Legal
 Departm ent, bore the brunt of the Council’s duties under the Act.
    152. The Officer Working Party was superseded by a Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory G roup,'but
 apart from the change o f the name the system continued as before, Mr Bownes attended the inspections
 and meetings o f the Advisory Group together with the representatives of the police, the fire service, the
^department o f health and consumer services, and the building engineer’s division of the Council. The
 latter was an engineer and ou^ht therefore to have been alive to the same issues as Dr Eastwood.

  153. The Advisory Group seems to have worked in a very informal manner. A short passage from M r
Bownes’ evidence gives the flavour of it:-

     “Q.   Who was taking the lead in the working party as you understood it?

      A    That is a good question, sir. Leads were coming from several different directions really.

      Q    Who chaired it, if anyone?

      A    Nobody as such, sir. It was an inspection rather than a meeting as 1understand it.

      Q    Who decided what should be inspected?

      A    Effectively the group itself, sir. it seemed to me. There was also some input from the Club
           representative as to, if you like, an element o f direction as to what should be looked at.

      Q    Apart from the inspections the working party met, presumably, or did they only meet on
           inspections?

      A    No, sir, I have referred to three previous meetings.

      Q    Who took the chair when it met?

      A    I suppose it could be said that I did. to some extent.

      Q    There is no point in having inspections unless you form conclusions as a result of that inspection, is
           there?

      A    That is correct.

      Q    There must presumably have been some meeting following the inspection at which you all sat down
           together and decided what, if anything, should be done.

      A    There was not, to my recollection, no.

       Q    How did you decide what should be done, if anything needed to be done?

       A    There were discussions on the site, particularly in relation to barrier 144. which took place at the
            time.

       Q   Nothing more than that and no record anywhere of anydecisions that were made?

       A   No, sir.”

 The decision to remove barrier 14-4 was assented to on behalf of the City Council by Mr Bownes. It was not
 referred to the General Purposes Panel. W hether Mr Bownes strictly had any power to assent to it is to say the
 least very doubtful. But he himself admits that he was ill-equipped to do so. He knew very little about football
 grounds. He had read the file passed on from South Yorkshire County Council and assumed all had been run
 satisfactorily by them.

   154. It was recorded, however, in a report which Mr Bownes drafted that “the conditions (in the Safety
 Certificate) give some cause for concern as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas”. The
 report to the General Purposes Panel suggested that new Safety Certificate conditions should be drafted.

    155. The task of revising the Safety Certificate was begun in June 1986. In July 1987. a draft was sent to the
 fire serv ice to which they replied in August. In September 1987. the Panel was informed that the redrafti ng was


                                                        26
•'progressing steadily” and should be submitted to the Panel in October. The final draft was not circulated until
30 March 1989.16 days before this disaster.

   156. Meanwhile, the Safety Certificate has remained unamended since 1979. The enlargement o f the Kop
in 1986 increased its capacity to 21,000. Although this was known and agreed by the Council it had not been
the subject of any change in the Certificate which still showed the capacity o f the Kop as 16.850. Mr Mackrell.
Sheffield Wednesday’s Secretary, raised the question o f amendments to the Safety Certificate and in particular
with regard to the Kop in April 1987 with Eastwood and Partners but nothing resulted.

  157. S h e ffie ld United Football Club was designated under the 1975 Acton 3 July 1984. A Safety Certificate
was about to be issued by South Yorkshire County Council at the time it handed over to the Sheffield City
Council on 1 April 1986. No certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United.

   158. The explanation given for these delays was pressure of work. Mr Bownes as Chief Licensing Officer
was responsible for 32 other licensing systems when this one was added to his burden. He had a staff of only
five. I fully accept that the addition of further statutory responsibilities to the already heavy workload o f a local
authority with curbs on its expenditure creates problems. But it is clear that the attention given to this
im portant licensing function was woefully inadequate.

Summary
   159. The Safety Certificate contained no maximum figures for individual pens. There was therefore no
sanction or provision focussing attention as to the need to limit entry to the pens by numbers. The layout at
Leppings Lane as it evolved made electronic or mechanical control over numbers entering individual pens
impracticable if all pens were to be available. Given an important match and a capacity attendance, fans were
likely to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 and 4. Those pens were likely to become overfull well before
warning came from the turnstiles that numbers were approaching the terrace maximum of 10,100. Control
over numbers and the avoidance of overcrowding therefore depended entirely on visual monitoring o f the
crowd.

                       LACK OF EFFECTIVE MONITORING OF THE TERRACES

  160. Monitoring the spectators on the terraces so as to avoid overcrowding involves observing the numbers
and their distribution in each area, making decisions as to when an area is “full”, taking steps to close it off
and moving spectators from one area to another, if necessary. It is a function beset by three problems. 1) Who
should carry it out? 2) When is an area “full”? 3) Fear of hooliganism.

Who should Monitor the Terraces?
   161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be the police? Should it be both? Or should it be by
arrangement, depending upon the ground or section of the ground in question?

   162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a match on its premises for reward is
responsible for securing safety at that event. The Green Guide (1986) provides:

        “ 23. The safety of the public inside the ground is the responsibility of those who stage the event and
              administer the ground in which it is held, ie the “management”. This responsibility applies in
              both normal and emergency situations...

    1    195. ...there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:

              (a)    controlling or directing members o f the public who are entering or leaving the ground, to
                     help achieve an even flow of people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal o f spectators on
                     the terraces or viewing slopes;

               (b)   patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarms or extinguishing
                     fires;

               (c)   manning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which
                     are continuously open whilst the ground is in use;

               (d)   assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control: and

               (e)   undertaking specific duties in an emergency.”

The Interim Popplewell Report
   163. There was considerable controversy in the course of the public inquiry held by Mr Justice Popplewell
in 1985 as to the responsibility of the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 of his interim report, Mr Justice
Popplewell quoted from a report produced for the Minister of Housing and Local Government in 1969 as
follows:-

   “The responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police and the club operating the
   ground. The broad line o f division being that police are responsible for movement of spectators in public
   thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the control of
   spectators once they are on the club’s premises . . . ”                                           ^

 Mr Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observe that in practice the police
 have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph 3.8):

   “It follows, therefore, that as a m atter of practice, while the physical safety o f the building and the
   maintenance and good housekeeping of the ground must always be the responsibility o f the club, the police
   have to take the de facto responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all that entails, during the game . . . ”

 Mr Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation of the ground as a procedure in which only the police
 could bear the responsibility of supervising the organisation of the crowd.

 The Final Popplewell Report
   164. He harked back to this subject in chapter 4 of his Final Report. There, he came down more firmly in
 favour of holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “Because, as a matter of


                                                         28
                                                                                                                                  I




      practice, police officers have regularly attended in large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow been
      assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for control of what goes on inside the ground has passed from
      them to the police. A police presence'is there to assist in the enforcement of law and order. Those responsible
      for organising a private function, however, have the prim ary and continuing obligation and responsibility to
      ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises.” Mr Justice Popplewell ended that
      section as follows: “It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club, or the occupier of the ground
      who is putting on the function, that the primary and continuing obligation rests.”

    ■ ! 165. There remains, however, the question whether there are some grounds or parts o f grounds where the
       jclub may need to rely upon the police (whom they pay to attend) to control filling of pens and monitoring them
       ifor overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the club, they may need,
    ; and by agreement be entitled, to employ the police to act as their agents in certain circumstances. This very
     ' difficult and grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed in greater depth at stage two
        o f this Inquiry.

      Arrangements at Hillsborough
        166. What is clear, however, is that de facto the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibility for
      control of the pens at the Leppings Lane end. The evidence o f the senior officers who had been concerned with
      policing at Hillsborough over the years was all one way on this point. Only Mr Duckenfield, who had not
      policed at Hillsborough for some 10 years prior to 15 April, took a different view.

           167. M r Lock is now security officer at Sheffield Wednesday and was formerly a police Superintendent at
        Hillsborough matches occupying M r Murray’s role. He claimed there had been a formal although unwritten
        agreement between the Club and the police in about 1982, whereby the police agreed to steward the Leppings
        Lane end of the ground. Such a formal agreement is denied by other senior officers and I do not accept that any
        formal agreement was reached. Nevertheless, a practice or arrangement did develop which was known and
        accepted by both Club and police. Its effect was that throughout the ground the stewards were responsible for
        manning exits and entrances, for controlling entry into the stands, for assisting spectators to their seats in the
        stands and for helping to control the exits after the match. They were also responsible at the Kop end on the
        terraces for keeping gangways clear and helping to control the crowd which usually consisted of home
        supporters. At the Leppings Lane end. however, there were no gangways on the terraces and the crowd
        consisted usually (and always since 1987) o f away supporters. Mr Mole and* other senior officers accepted that
     .f it would have been unreal and unreasonable to expect stewards to go onto those Leppings Lane terraces. They
     j would not have been effective there; moreover, they could well have been in some danger from hostile away
     j supporters. The police accepted, therefore, that the proper filling of the pens and monitoring them for
    | overcrowding could and would not be carried out by stewards. Many stewards have tended to be either
    I extremely young or somewhat elderly. They are paid only a modest sum (£9 at Hillsborough) and they are not
        suitable either by physique or by training to cope on a crowded terrace with no gangways.

      Case for the South Yorkshire Police
        168. Notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence from senior police as already mentioned and from the
      Club, Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police continued throughout the hearing to contend that the Club and
      not the police were responsible for filling and monitoring the pens and that this was well known to both parties.
      He m aintained that the police were there essentially to secure and preserve law and order. Quite apart from the
      police evidence to the contrary at this Inquiry, the official stance of the South Yorkshire Police has not always
      been to that effect.

      Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club Limited
          169.                      In March 1986, the South Yorkshire Police Authority obtained a judgement against Sheffield Unit
"     Football Club for money due for police services provided at Sheffield United’s matches. The defence had been,
[     in te r alia, that the police were not providing “special police services”. They were doing no more than
j     performing their normal police duties of securing and preserving law and order amongst a crowd. The police
p     argument was that they had additional duties. In his judgement, Boreham J summarised the instructions for
j     policing as providing for:-

        “(a) the maintenance of enforcement of law and order.

         (b) the enforcement of the Club’s ground regulations, many of which are concerned with law and order;

         (c) the safety and comfort of the spectators, officials and players.”


                                                               29
He referred to the argument of Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police as follows:-

  “Thirdly. here the police were not discharging their own duty to the public: they were in fact discharging the
  Club’s duties to the spectators w hom the Club invited to the ground. The Club chose to invite large numbers
  to their private premises; it was the Club’s duty to provide for their safety, health and comfort. They could
  have employed a security firm as banks and others have to do to protect their interests: they chose to request
  the police to perform those duties knowing that the police expected payment. Fourthly, the police within the
  ground provided services which it was not within the scope o f their public duty to perform. For instance,
  they assisted in crowd management and in the enforcement of such ground regulations as refused entry'to
  those who tried to enter without paying or prohibited spectators encroaching on parts of the ground which
  their entry fee did not entitle them to enter. It may be, submits Mr Bentley, that the maintenance of law and
  order was the predominant aim but there were other services performed.”
                                                                                                   •*
The learned Judge found:-

  “In addition to what may be called their law and order role the police were expected and did take p artin
  crowd management, ensuring the safety of spectators, the enforcement of the Club’s regulations and to be on
  hand to assist in the event of some emergencies such as fire or accidental injury,”

Police Practice at the Leppings Lane End
   170. At League matches at Hillsborough, the police practice was to decide in advance how many and which
pens would be used. If a modest crowd was anticipated only one or two pens might be needed. It was better to
confine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent them running about and (b) to reduce the number of police
required. The practice was then to fill the pens one by one. This involved making a judgement as to when a pen
was full. There would then be a police decision to close that pen and fill another. It was regarded as impractical
and unsafe for police officers (just like stewards) to go onto the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
This meant that monitoring the numbers in any pen had to be done from vantage points outside it. Here, the
police were much better placed than the stewards. There was a good view from the control box and the
television screens there. There were officers on the perimeter track. No stewards were placed there because
having both police and stewards interfered with the viewing. There were also police in the west stand who
could look down on the pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give the police a good appreciation of
the state of the terraces. When it was necessary to shut off access to the pens officers on the concourse could be
informed by radio and could take the necessary steps.

“Find Their Own Level”
   171. At Cup semi-finals, a different approach was adopted. All the pens were opened from the start and the
policy was “to let the fans find their own level”. This phrase was repeated again and again by police officers at
the Inquiry. What it meant was that no specific direction was given to fans entering through the turnstiles.
They were free to go wherever they wished on the terraces. If they became uncomfortable or wished for any
other reason to move their position, then theoretically they could move elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
the fans on the terraces would level themselves out and that distribution would be achieved without police
intervention. On these occasions, the gates at the top of the radial fences were locked in the open position. It
was sought to argue, therefore, that there was freedom of movement from one pen to another enabling fans to
“find their level”.

   172. This argument was bad both in theory and in practice. In theory, the whole object of the radial fences
had been to achieve even distribution by directing fans into desired positions. To say then that they could move
freely from one pen to another would defeat,the object and enable fans to go from a less popular to a more
popular area without inhibition. In practice this did not happen because the position and size of the gates was
such that once a substantial num ber of spectators were in, the gates were unnoticeable and inaccessible
especially to those towards the front who might have most need of them.

   173. The same argument was deployed to suggest that individual maximum capacities for individual pens
need not be assessed since the presence of the open radial gates still meant that the terrace was One area. In
practice this simply was not so. The photograph at Appendix 5 taken from the north stand at 2.59 pm shows
very clearly the congestion in pens 3 and 4 contrasted with the sparseness in pen 6. This gives the lie to the
suggestion that the fans could, if uncomfortable, “find their own level”.

  174. The effect of this policy was that whereas at League matches the police had to make a positive decision
when to close one pen and open another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was much more likely, the police


                                                        30
left it to the fans themselves to "find their own level”. Effectively, they were left to m onitor their own comfort
and safety so as to avoid overcrowding. The police w'ould only intervene when there was some overt sign that an
area was “full”.

When is an Area “Full”?
   175. Over the years, spectators on terraces have come to accept conditions which are often very
uncomfortable and not infrequently downright dangerous. They are subjected to buffeting and squeezing to
get in and out of the terraces. They are packed tightly and exposed to surging and swaying during the match.
They put up with these conditions because they are devoted to the game and because there is little they can do
about them. They believe the discomfort will pass and nothing very untoward will happen. Usually that is the
case and they are reassured by it. Most clubs have not. until very recently, consulted their supporters as to their
grievances or suggestions. The practice has been to pack them in on the assumption that if they are prepared to
put up with it the conditions must be tolerable. Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
in recent years, this has been due principally to the increased proportion of seating as against standing
accommodation. Terraces have still been packed.

   176. It is said that many fans enjoy these features o f terrace viewing. Clearly close proximity, shared
discomfort, weathering sways and surges together and chanting the same songs and slogans en masse do evoke
good hum our and have produced a spirit or cult of the terraces which many enjoy. Equally there are many who
simply endure these things for the football, for a cheap ticket or indeed for the chance o f getting in at all. And
before Hillsborough most fans on the terraces, even if they enjoy the hurly-burly, had not realised the narrow
margin o f safety between an uncomfortable crush and a fatal one.

i 177. The Green Guide sought to improve safety and comfort by laying down criteria for maximum
 capacity, ie defining what is “full”. The standard set was 54 persons per 10 square metres in favourable
 conditions but fewer, down to 27, in less favourable conditions. The tendency may have been to aim off too
 little from the higher figure for shortcomings in the layout. Certainly the figures considered appropriate in
 pens 3 and 4 at Hillsborough were too high, as already indicated.

   178. Even taking the highest figure suggested in the Green Guide, the problem remained that those
supposed to be monitoring pens visually had and have little idea o f what 54 persons per 10 square metres look
like. Mr Duckenfield’s opinion was that when a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be “shoulder to
shoulder and chest to back". That view may derive from seeing the sort of density crowds regularly endure
without injury resulting. But it is much more dense than the Green Guide maximum.

   179. The South Yorkshire Fire Brigade provided the Inquiry with photographs of people standing in an area
o f 10 square metres at various densities of packing. Together with my Assessors and others, I took part in a
similar experiment at the Health and Safety Executive's Sheffield laboratory. We stood in a room of measured
area at densities of 54, 80 and 100 per 10 square metres. It was clear from the photographs and from our
experiment that the maximum density set out in the Green Guide left considerably more room than those
monitoring the terraces would have left before declaring an area "full”.

   180. The tendency has been to allow the pens to fill until the fans complain or show signs of discomfort. If
the density at the front appeared less than at the back, the Tannov would invite the fans to move forward to
make room for more. The evidence before the Inquiry and many anecdotal letters I have received clearly show
there have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caused
discomfort and sometimes, for brief periods, fear. Usually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
eases and the incident passes unrecorded.

  181. After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final. Hillsborough was not chosen again by the FA until 1987.
There was evidence that the central pens were uncomfortably overcrowded on that occasion and again at the
1988 Cup semi-final, although entry to the tunnel was blocked off by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
because the pens were deemed to be “full".

Fear of Hooliganism
   182. Over the last few years, hooliganism at and associated with football matches has strongly influenced
the strategy o f the police. In their plans and management they have concentrated on averting or containing
threats to public order. This is understandable and indeed commendable. But it has led to an imbalance
between the need to quell a minority of troublemakers and the need to secure the safety and comfort of the
majority. In the police Operational Order, the emphasis was upon prevention o f disorder and in particular
prevention o f access to the field of play. There was no express requirement that officers on the perimeter track
or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces. Indeed, the view was
expressed in evid en ce that packing fans close together on the terraces assisted in controlling the unruly since
the less room they had the less scope there was for m isbehaviour.

Summary
   183. Although the police had accepted de f a c t o responsibility for m onitoring the pens, their policy on the
day was to leave fans to “find their own level” and to concentrate .their own attention on possible disorder.
W hilst in theory the police w ould intervene if a pen b ecam e “full”, in practice they perm itted the test o f
fullness to be what the fans w ould tolerate.

  184. By 2.52 pm w hen gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
uncom fortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to cause' injuries; to allow in a large stream was
courting disaster.

                                    THE BUILD-UP AT THE TURNSTILES

   185. The d ecision to open gate C. and subsequently gates A and B too. was forced on to the p olice by the
crowd co n d itio n s w hich developed outside the turnstiles. T he crush was so severe that injuries were being
suffered and deaths were feared unless the pressure could b e sw iftly relieved. W hy the crowd pressure had built
to such intensity was on e o f the principal issues during the hearing. T h e suggested causes must be considered in
turn.

The Physical Layout
   186. I have already described and illustrated the approach to the turnstiles (Appendices 1 and 2). At
P enistone R oad and at many other grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced and with a
sufficient w aiting area for queues to form. N o t so at Leppings Lane. T he building line, the bridge over the Don
and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to perim eter gates set in an arc, and across a short
forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. T he pairs o f turnstiles were close together and the forecourt, especially
as d iv id ed by the m etal fence, provided little space for a w aiting crowd.

The Number of Turnstiles
   187. T he d ecisio n to fill the w hole o f the north stand from the Leppings Lane en d required the 23 turnstiles
there to ad m it 2 4 ,2 5 6 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles (A to G) serving the terraces had to admit
 10,100, ie an average o f just under 1.450 through each turnstile. At the Penistone Road end. 29 ,8 0 0 were
served by 60 turnstiles, or just under 500 per turnstile.

   188. T he G reen G uide recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which spectators can pass through
turnstiles d epends on a variety o f local circum stances but states “in general based on observation and
experience, it is unlikely that the m axim um n otional rate per turnstile w ould exceed 750 per hour”. Since the
sem i-final was an all ticket m atch requiring no cash transactions, the Club considered that a higher rate o f
about 1,000 per hour per turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assumes the turnstiles
w orking at m ax im u m efficiency non-stop, it w ould have taken nearly 1 'A hours to adm it all those with terrace
tickets. At 750 per hour, it w ould have taken nearly two hours.

   189. T he G reen G u id e provides (paragraph 44):-

  “T u m stiles should be o f such numbers as to adm it spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are
  kept w aiting for a d m is sio n . .

   190. T he O fficer Working Party had discussed in 1985 the need, and D r Eastwood’s various schemes, for
im provem ent o f the turnstile arrangements. T he m athem atics are elementary. Both the police and the Club
sh ould have realised that the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the w aiting area outside them would be under strain
to a d m it all the Liverpool supporters in time. Success dep en ded on the spectators arriving at a steady rate from
an early hour and upon the m axim um turnstile rate being m aintained. In fact neither o f these requirements,\
wh ich are inter-linked, was fulfilled. That they m ight not b e so was in my view foreseeable.

The “Late” arrival of Liverpool Fans
  191. Betw een 2 .3 0 pm and 2.4 0 pm the crowd w aiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5,000 and became
unm anageable. T h e case m ade for the police was that large num bers o f Liverpool supporters arrived late; a
high proportion o f them were drunk and unco-operative; a high proportion had no tickets; all o f them were
hell-bent on getting in on tim e. T hey say this was unforeseeable and explains why they lost control.

    192. W hether those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm were “late” was much debated. The ticket
sim p ly requested its holder “to take up [his] p osition 15 m inutes before kick-off”. That may have been
in ten d ed to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it w ould not be unreasonable for a
stand in g spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm. W hether they were “late” or not,
however, there was certainly a large concentration o f Liverpool fans arriving at about 2.30 pm and after.

Traffic Delays
  ■>193. It is unlikely that traffic conditions had any significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
L iverpool traffic routes. There were roadworks on the M 62 which was the recom m ended route. At various
p oin ts the carriageway was reduced from four lanes or three lanes to two, but no serious delays were reported.
On the M 63 there were longer delays due to a contraflow and at its junction with the A 560 there was heavy
congestion due to v olu m e o f traffic. However, the L iverpool routes were clear by 2.20 pm and th o se witnesses
who com plained o f delays en route had nevertheless m anaged to be in range o f the ground in am ple time.

Fine Weather and D rinking
   194. The likeliest explanations for the sparse L iverpool attendance in the ground before 2.30 pm were four­
fold - the warm weather, drinking, d isinclination to enter the ground early and prolong the standing, and a
tendency o f Liverpool supporters to cut it fine.

   195. T he police em phasised that at the 1988 sem i-final there was no comparable build-up o f “late” arrivals.
They claim , therefore, that they had no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988. although the weather
was fine, it was 1 1°F cooler than in 1989. 15 April was the sort o f fine spring day which tem pted fans to si to r
stand about in the sun with a drink. If you had a tick et it w ou ld seem m ore pleasant and sensible to relax in that
way than to enter the ground early and stand on the terrace for an extra hour. Pre-match entertainm ent in the
ground had been advertised but did not take place. Even if it had, it m ay not have been an encouragem ent to
m any fans to enter so early.

W as Drunkenness a Major Factor in the C risis at the Turnstiles?
    196. O f those w ho arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very m any had been drinking at public houses or had
brought drink from h o m e or an off-licence. I am satisfied on the evidence, however, that the great majority
were n ot drunk nor even the w orse for drink. T h e p olice w itnesses varied on this. Som e described a high
proportion as drunk, as “lager-louts” or even as “an im als”. O thers described a generally normal crowd with an
unco-operative m inority who had drunk too m uch. In m y v iew som e officers, seeking to rationalise their loss
o f control, overestim ated the drunken elem ent in the crowd. There certainly was such an elem ent. There were
youngsters influenced by drink and bravado pushing im patiently at the rear o f the crowd thereby exacerbat ing
the crush. But the more convincing police w itnesses, including especially D etective Superintendent McKay
and C h ief Inspector Creaser as well as a num ber o f responsible civilian witnesses, were in my v iew right in
describing this elem en t as a minority. T h ose w itnesses attributed the crush to the sheer num bers o f fans all
an xious to gain entry. There was no criticism o f the crow d by any o f the w itnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm
or even 2.35 pm. What happened then was not a su dd en deterioration in the m ood or sobriety o f these
assem bled there. N o doubt those com ing behind w ould have had m ore to drink and w ould have included the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd becam e packed into a confined
turnstile area and its very density hampered its passage through the turnstiles.

   197. Superintendent Marshall and other officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police
exhortations to stop pushing and to ease back were n ot heeded. H ow could they be? In that crush m ost people
had no control over their m ovem ents at all. Two in cid en ts in volvin g police horses illustrate the point. One
horse was found afterwards to have cigarette b u m s on its rump. Clearly that was the despicable work o f a
hooligan whether in drink or not. However, there were also eyew itness accounts o f a horse being physically
lifted o ff its feet by the crowd. That occurred, as the p olice accepted, without m alice or intent but as an
involuntary consequence o f crowd pressure which th ose by the horse’s flanks could not resist any more than t he
horse itself.

Reduced Efficiency o f the Turnstiles
    198. The labelling o f the turnstiles in the order A, C. B was confusing. A fan with a B ticket who went by
m istake to the wrong side o f the metal fence w ould have had the greatest difficulty in getting back and round to
th e correct side. T h e colour coding was inefficient because the coloured w ooden panels were affixed to the
turnstile walls so low that they were not easily visible through a crowd. The information on the ticket printed by
S heffield W ednesday Football Club was m isleading and its layout unhelpful, as Mr Mackrell frankly conceded.

    199. The result was that in-the early, stages, police officers w ere pestered by fans for help as to where they
 sh ou ld go. Later, as the crowd becam e m ore dense, fans w ere presenting their tickets at the wrong turnstiles.
 There were also Liverpool supporters w ho had acquired tickets for the Kop end but sought entry at Leppings
 Lane. They caused delays in the turnstile operation w hen entry was refused and after a while the police
 instructed the operators to let them through. There was further delay because the crush made it difficult for
 fa n s to get into the turnstile entrances. Once there, the pressure from behind was such as, on occasions, to jam
 th e m in the doorway or against the paddle o f the turnstile. Finally, there were fans without tickets w ho sought
 to enter by offering payment, by seeking to go over or under the paddle or by sliding through with a ticket
 holder. All o f these activities slowed down the turnstile rate w hich at the worst period was only about 600 per
 h o u r per turnstile. T h e waiting crowd therefore expanded an d as the m inutes passed frustration grew. Visitors


                                                          34
w ho had paid for tickets and travelled from afar realised they were making little forward progress. Frustration
increased pressure and induced panic at the front. D eterm ination to get into the m atch was intensified by
determ ination to get out o f the crush.

Were Fans Without Tickets a Major Factor in the Build-Up?
  200. It has becom e a fact o f football life that fans do turn up at all-ticket m atches w ithout tickets. It is not
possible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable estim ate o f the num ber w ithout tickets on 15 April. Police
estim ates varied from about 2 00 to about 2,000. There were certainly frequent requests for tickets or “spares”
during the hours before the build-up. Many o f those warned o ff by the police were seen to return to the area.
Som e were hanging about on the bridge. Again, however, the police w itnesses w ho m ost im pressed m e d id not
consider the num ber o f ticketless fans to be inordinately large. This accords with tw o other sources o f
evidence.

   201. First, there w as a w ide range o f w itnesses w ho observed inside the ground that the Liverpool en d was at
a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 and 4. The north stand still had m any em p ty seats and the wing
pens were sparse. T he match being a sell-out. there were clearly m any ticket holders to com e and they could
account for the large crowd still outside the turnstiles. Had the Liverpool accom m od ation been full by 2.40
pm. one could have inferred that m ost or m uch o f the large crowd outside lacked tickets.

   202. Secondly, such figures as are available from the C lub’s electronic m onitoring system and from analyses
by the HSE suggest that no great num ber entered w ithout tickets. They show that the num ber w ho passed
through turnstiles A to G plus those who entered through gate C roughly equalled the terrace capacity figure o f
 10,100 for which tickets had been sold. The Club’s record showed 7.038 passed through turnstiles A to G.
However, the cou n tin g m echanism on turnstile G was defective, so the HSE did a study using the v id eo film
and projecting figures from the other turnstiles. This gave an assessm ent o f 7,494. with a m axim um o f 7,644
passing through A to G . Again, using the vid eo, the HSE assessed the num ber w ho entered the ground whilst
gate C was open at 2 .2 4 0 with a m axim um o f 2,480. Accordingly, the HSE’s best estim ate o f the total entering
through gate C and turnstiles A to G was 9.73 4 with a m axim um o f 1 0 .1 2 4 .1 recognise that these can only be
rough checks because, for exam ple, som e with terrace tickets were allowed through turnstiles 1 to 16 and there
w ould be other sim ilar factors w hich have not form ed part o f the assessm ent. N evertheless, the figures do
suggest that there w as not a very significant body o f ticketless fans in the crowd which built up.

The “Conspiracy” Theory
  20 3. On b eh alf o f South Yorkshire police, the theory was advanced that the “late" arrival o f so many
Liverpool supporters was planned to buck the system. The suggestion was that fans w ithout tickets conspired
to arrive late and create such trouble as w ould force the police to adm it them to the match. The slender
evidence upon w hich this theory rested cam e from two sources: overheard conversations in public houses and
the antecedent history o f Liverpool supporters at away m atches.

  2 0 4 . O ne w itness said he heard three Liverpool supporters saying, in effect, that they w ould m anage to get
in w ithout tickets by causing trouble so that police w ould open a gate, and that they had done this before.
A nother w itness heard two o f a group o f Liverpool supporters say they had no tickets, that they w ould go to the
ground just before kick-off, that no-one w ould stop them getting in and that they had not been stopped yet.
Statem ents were put in relating to two other small groups talking in sim ilar terms.

Liverpool Supporters at Away Matches
  20 5. The South Yorkshire police prepared a dossier o f reports on the behaviour o f Liverpool fans at away
m atches with the object o f showing a pattern o f troublesom e behaviour by large num bers either w ithout tickets
or w ith forged tickets. W ithout setting out the w hole history, it can be sum m arised as follows.

  2 0 6 . On three o ccasion s Liverpool fans w ithout tickets were allowed into all-ticket m atches upon payment.
(At Watford on 13 February 1988, 1,500 were admitted: at Southam pton on 24 Septem ber 1988, 150 were
adm itted; at Southam pton again on 12 D ecem ber 1988, 750 were adm itted.) At N orw ich on 1 April L989,
Liverpool supporters arrived w ithout tickets but 1.272 tickets had been returned and fans from both Liverpool
and N orw ich were allowed to buy them for cash. A sim ilar situation occurred at W im bledon on 13 May 1989.
There were six other occasion s from 1986 to date, including the Cup finals o f 1986 and 1989, when n u m b e rso f
Liverpool supporters turned up w ithout tickets or otherw ise behaved badly.

   2 0 7 . Four points m ust be n oted, however. On none o f the occasions when ticketless fans were adm itted for
 paym ent was the m atch a sell-out. There was therefore room in the ground on each occasion. A t a sell-out fans


                                                          35
might not expect to be allowed in. even for paym ent. Secondly, no trouble o f the kind alleged was encountered
at the 1988 sem i-final when Liverpool visited H illsborough. Thirdly. Liverpool visited Hillsborough again in
January 1989 w ithout any trouble. Finally, no forged tickets were in use on 15 April apart from three crude
photocopies.

No Conspiracy
   208. I have already found that there was not an abnorm ally large num ber o f fans w ithout tickets on this
occasion. W ith one or two exceptions, the police w itnesses them selves did not subscribe to the “conspiracy”
theory. I am satisfied that the large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm did not arrive
as a result o f any concerted plan. There were. I accept, sm all groups without tickets who were w illing to exploit
any adventitious chance o f getting into the ground. They, together with the m inority who had drunk too much,
certainly aggravated the problem faced by the police. But that m ain problem was sim ply one o f large numbers
packed into the small area outside the turnstiles.

The Police Operation at LeppingsLane
  209. T he Operational Order for 15 April follow ed closely that laid down for the 1988 sem i-final. The
em phasis was on m aintaining law and order. S ide roads were to be blocked o f f to prevent damage in residential
areas. Pairs o f officers were to patrol streets to prevent “clash o f rival supporters”. Officers were to watch public
houses, shops and supermarkets “where lootin g could take p lace”. Outside the turnstiles, officers were to ensure
supporters entering did not have banners, w eapons, m issiles or alcohol.

  210. Unfortunately, hooligan behaviour has m ade all these steps necessary. But the only written provision
aim ed at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was on e enjoining officers “to ensure orderly queues are
form ed” . There was no provision for controlling the entry o f the crowd into the turnstile area.

  211. As long ago as 1924. the Departm ental C om m ittee on Crowds stated:-

  “T he control o f crowds should begin at a point som e considerable distance from the entrance to the ground.
  T he advantages o f an arrangement o f this kind a r e ... in preventing congestion at the entrances to grounds.”

T h is was particularly im portant at Leppings Lane where the turnstile area was so small and awkwardly laid
out. I f a large crowd was perm itted uncontrolled entry through the perimeter gates, the forming o f queues at the
turnstiles and control by officers, w hether on foot or m ounted, w ould becom e impracticable. T hose waiting at
the turnstiles w ould becom e a single growing mass. O nce that happened, it w ould be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

  2 1 2. W hether steps were taken and what steps to avoid this happening was left to oral briefing and a d hoc
instructions on the day.

Previous Experience
  213. T he senior police officers said it had never happened before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two previous o ccasion s when th e Leppings Lane terraces had been used to fill the whole o f the north
and west sides o f the ground were at the two sem i-finals, in 1987 and 1988. In 1987. the match was on a Sunday,
scheduled for 12 n oon, and kick-off was p ostponed for a quarter o f an hour because o f late arrivals.

Policing in 1988
   214.' As to. 1988, there was a very large and consistent body o f evidence that, on the day, the police in
Leppings Lane conducted an efficient filtering exercise designed to keep away those without tickets and
control the flow o f fans towards the ground. I do n ot believe that so many w itnesses without either opportunity
or reason to put their heads together could be m istaken about what they experienced on that occasion. Yet. the
police m aintain that no filtering exercise other than on a random basis was conducted in 1988 and that their
p o licy and practice then were n o different from those o f 1989.

   21 5. The answer to this conflict m ust, I think, be that whilst the policy may have been no different, in
practice the policing in 1988 was m ore efficient and was not put to the sam e test and strain as a year later. There
was not so large a swell in num bers approaching the ground from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm as in 1989.
N evertheless, there had been warning signs in 1988. D etective Superintendent M cKay gave the following
evidence:



                                                          36
 “Q Were you aware o f a build-up o f numbers last year towards the latter stages at the turnstiles?

 A    Yes. . . There was a huge build-up around 10 m inutes to 3 when many, many Liverpool supporters
      cam e at that tim e. They had been drinking, the ones that I saw and there was q u ite a sizeable crush
      built-up - sizeable queue.

 Q    Q ueue o r crush?

 A    C om p acted queue, built-up in the area by the turnstiles which I b elieve are marked A to G. That crowd
      reached back alm ost to the gates. It n ever got any bigger than that and the turnstiles operated relatively
      freely and they dealt with that crowd. Fans were still arriving at about 10 past 3 but by then t h e . . .

 Q    T h is crowd that you have described o f the late arrivals at about 10 to - was it an orderly crowd?

  A    Oh no. N o. T he orderly crowd had gone in, and w hen I say they were not an orderly crowd, obviously
       m ixed am ongst those people w er e. . .

  Q    O f course, but taking it generally?

  A    But by and large they had taken a lot o f drink on board and they were in such num bers that excluding
       them from the ground was com pletely out o f the question.

  Q    Were they standing in an orderly queue or was there som e pushing and shoving?

  A    There was a lot o f pushing and shoving. There was an urgency to get into the ground.

  Q    But fortunately it does not appear to have been in nearly such numbers as this year.

  A    It wasn’t.”

Police Intelligence in Advance
  216. Apart from that experience in 1988, the tendency o f Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
unknown. W itnesses said that they get through the turnstiles at their hom e ground, A nfield. quite quickly and
tend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent tendency to postpone arrival was noted, by the
Sheffield City C ouncil A dvisory Group, with police present, on 23 March 1988. T he m inute reads:-

  “A s far as the turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed o f people arriving som e 15 m inutes
  before the start o f the gam e h oping to gain adm ission. T h is trend may be due to the banning o f alcohol at
  sports grounds w hich could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the football m atch. As
  the available turnstiles operated quite effectively for the majority o f the tim e, and that the late arrival
  problem could perhaps only be dealt with by education o f the spectators” (sic).

  21 7. In so far as L iverpool supporters’ behaviour at away m atches may have been indicative o f w hat police
problem s m ight arise on 15 April, m ost o f the facts should have been available at the planning stage. As in other
forces, South Yorkshire Police had a liaison officer w hose job was to seek, receive and collate relevant
inform ation as to the visiting supporters. T he A ssociation o f C h ief Police Officers’ G u id e to Policing Football
highlights the im portance o f such liaison :-

  “It is im portant that the officer responsible for policing the match determ ines the pre-match planning in the
  light o f the intelligence at hand. W hilst that intelligence can be obtained from a variety o f sources, the prime
  source for football intelligence is the Police N ational Intelligence System which is based on the network o f
  p o lice liaison officers. Sum m aries com pleted by police officers o f the h om e club force are forwarded to the
  visiting club’s liaison officer m aking available intelligence about fans’ behaviour at both h o m e and away
  fixtures. T his inform ation will b e collated and m ade available for future m atches involving that club”.

  2 1 8 . T h e FA had also laid down in a m em orandum issued in the 1985/6 season m easures to be adopted by
the away club w hich included the follow ing:-

  “ It is the responsibility o f the away club to advise the h om e club o f the recent b ehaviour o f their supporters
  at away m atches, irrespective o f whether the behaviour has resulted in disciplinary action by the Football
  A ssociation or n ot” .

   2 1 9 . It does n ot seem that inform ation o f this kind was passed to the Sheffield W ednesday Club or played


                                                           37
any part in the South Yorkshire Police plans. H ad the latter been inform ed o f the history contained in the
dossier and sum m arised above it may well have influenced p o lice strategy in Leppings Lane.

  220. There is presently a proposal that a national com puter-based police football intelligence system should
be set up to m ake the necessary inform ation readily available.

Police Intelligence on the Day
   221. T h e unfilled space in the Liverpool areas in sid e the ground, the figures for entry available from the
Club’s com puter and observations on the v id eo screen sh ou ld have enabled those in the control room to
m onitor the num bers arriving and still to arrive at Leppings Lane. R adio contact with m obile (Tango) patrols
detailed to m onitor licensed prem ises in the district could have indicated the numbers still to com e. But at 2 .30
pm w hen Mr Murray told M r D uckenfield they w ould “get them all in by 3 o ’clock” he seem s not to have
appreciated that in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were m any m ore still to com e. Certainly, M r
Marshall ou tside the turnstiles was not told and could not otherw ise have known that there were still m any
L iverpool ticket holders to arrive.

Mr Marshall and Mr Greenwood
  222. T he division o f com m and between these two officers did not help. Mr Marshall was in charge o f the
serials ou tside the perimeter gates in the Leppings Lane area and in the roads beyond. In practice he operated
inside and just outside the turnstile area. M r G reenw ood’s area as G round C om m ander extended from the
pitch to the perim eter gates. H e in fact stationed h im self near the players’ tunnel. H e was w holly unaware o f th e
growing problem s at the turnstiles and was in no p osition to exercise control over his officers w ho were under
pressure there. N o -o n e in the control room thought to tell h im .

Control Lost
   223. In the result, the large concentration o f arrivals from 2.3 0 pm to 2.4 0 pm pressed unrestrained into
the turnstile area through the perimeter gates w hich w ere fully open. W hen that area was full, later arrivals
swelled the crowd out to the forecourt and even into the road. As already recounted, the foot officers at the
turnstiles b ecam e trapped and endangered and retired through the turnstiles. T he m ounted officers cou ld not
operate am idst such a dense crowd in a con fined space. T h ey cam e out o f the turnstile area. There were then
the belated attempts to close the perimeter gates and prevent m ore fans join in g the m ass until it had a chance to
d im inish through the turnstiles; still later the attem pt to p ut a cordon o f horses across the entrance.

  224. D esp ite knowledge o f the difficult layout, the very large num ber o f fans to be got through so few
turnstiles and the tendency o f fans to arrive in the last h a lf hour, no contingency plans were m ade to avoid a
crush such as occurred. Even on the day, the need to close Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.3 0 pm and the
other available intelligence already sum m arised, should have prom pted those in com m and to take precaution s
against such a crush. I f som e o f the perimeter gates had b een closed and cordons o f m ounted and foot officers
had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow o f fans into the turnstile area could have been
controlled before that area becam e engulfed. It was the crush itself which produced the frustration and the
panic and brought ou t the worst in those w ho had drunk to o much. Earlier control o f entry w ould have
prevented the crush and m aintained the good m oo d w hich h ad prevailed until 2.30 pm.

  225. It should moreover have been ob viou s by 2.40 p m , i f not earlier, that a large part o f the crowd could
not be adm itted until well after 3 pm. H ad a decision to p o stp o n e kick-off been m ade and announced m uch o f
the frustration and with it the im petus crushing the crowd w ould have been reduced. A com bination o f
controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off w ould probably have obviated the need to open the gates.

Postponement of Kick-off
    22 6. A t various stages in h is evidence, Mr D uckenfield gave three accounts o f why he thought it too la teto
p o stp o n e kick-off. O nce it was that on e o f the team s had already co m e on to the pitch. Then it was that a grou p
o f photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the team s were com ing out. Finally, he did not
know w hy h e thought the team s were com in g out. They did not in fact com e on to the pitch until 2.54 pm , two
m inu tes after gate C was opened. Police Constable B uxton had asked for a postponem ent o f kick-off before
gate C was opened. It should not, however, have needed a p o lice Constable in the thick o f the crowd (and there
w ere others o f like m ind) to think o f postponing the kick-off. T h e n eed should have been clear in the control
room .

    22 7. T he truth w as that Mr D uckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with Mr Murray
 K ick -o ff w ould not be postponed unless there were som e m ajor cause for delayed arrivals eg a ja n r o n the


                                                            38
. m otorway or fog. I accept that the thinking behind this policy was not callous or p unitive. If k ick-off is
  postponed w henever a proportion o f fans ch o ose to leave the public houses late, the practice may grow and
  kick-off tim es w ould b eco m e m eaningless. But, a com m and er m ust deal with the.problem o f the day. Faced
  with a situation w hich w as b ecom in g dangerous, crowd safety should have been his param ount consideration.
  K ick-off should have been delayed.

 Summary
    228.    T he layout o f the turnstiles and the num ber they were required to serve left no m argin o f safety against
 an uneven flow o f fans. Because p olice strategy in ad vance a n d on the day did not cater for it, the arrival o f a
 large num ber o f supporters between 2.30 pm and 2.4 0 pm created an unm anageable crush. T he presence o f
 a substantial m inority o f fans w ho had drunk too m uch aggravated that problem. H aving lost control and
 rejected the option o f postp oning kick-off, the police were faced with a serious danger o f deaths or injuries.
 They were left therefore w ith no alternative but to open the gates. Superintendent M arshall was right at that
 stage to ask for it and Mr D uckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects o f so dram atic a step required
 other action.

                                THE BLUNDER ON OPENING THE GATES

  229. T he decision to order the opening o f the gates was n ot accom panied or followed by any other order to
deal with the consequences. W hen gate C w as o p en ed , a steady stream o f about 2.0 00 fans poured through it
over som e five m inutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground som ewhere and unless they were diverted
their likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. N o warning was issued from the control
room that the gate was to be op en ed . Serials on the co n cou rse were n o t alerted. N eith er the Club control room
nor the C h ief Steward at the Leppings Lane en d w as warned. N o t even Mr Greenwood* the Ground
Com m ander, was informed. From 2.47 pm w hen M r Marshall m ade his first request until.2.52 pm w hen M r
D uckenfield acceded to it, there were five m inu tes in w hich orders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was not d one. In evidence, M r D uckenfield began by saying that no officer m ade any
wrong decision but he later con ceded he had erred in this regard. H e said he did not consider where the people
w ould go when the gate opened. Even after it o p en ed , w hen he could see the influx on the television screen, no
order was given to steer the fans to the w ing pens. Mr D uckenfield said it did not cross his m in d to detail
officers on the concourse to shut o f f the tunnel. T h o se officers could not have known from their position how
full pens 3 and 4 were. That was a m atter for the control room to m onitor from its own observations and using
intelligence from around the ground.

  230. Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2 .5 0 pm, the tunnel should have been closed o f f whether gate C was to
be op en ed or not. T he exercise was a sim ple on e and had b een carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the
1988 closure seem s to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not figure in the
debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989.

   231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view o f the
pens and o f the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect
w hen gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty areas o f the w ings and this disaster
cou ld still have been avoided. Failure to give that order w as a blunder o f the first magnitude.

   232. Significantly, when perm ission was given to open gate A, Mr Duckenfield did order serials to go to that
part o f the concourse to m onitor the influx towards the north stand. H e did this because he feared that i f fans
w ent to the north stand w ithout tickets, they w ould not get seats and. there being no perim eter fences at the
north side, they m ight invade the pitch. This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety and the risks o f overcrowding. Because those entering through gate C could n ot get onto the
pitch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to m onitor them. The possibility o f overcrowding sim ply
was not considered.

                                           THE BARRIERS IN PEN 3

Barrier 144
   233. The removal o f barrier 144 in 1986 should have reduced the notional capacity o f pen 3 as already
m entioned. But it did more. In the absence o f barrier 144, the influx o f fans after 2.52 pm m et no retarding
structure as it cam e into pen 3. The pressure created w as free to push fans straight down by the radial fence to
the lowest line o f barriers. T he pressure diagonally from the tunnel m outh down to barrier num ber 124a which
collapsed was unbroken by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down the pen
through the gap in the barrier above it created in 1985.

  234. Inspector Bullas. positioned in .th e west stand, described what he saw looking down on the pens
around 3 pm.

      I saw from the direction o f the tunnel u kind o f m ovem en t down the terracing... the type o f thing that you
  see on the nature programmes, the m olten lead flow ing down the side o f the m ountainside, the m olten la v a ...
  a “river o f people” ... going directly towards the pitch but there again sp reading... ou t.”

   235. Dr Eastwood conceded in evidence that the removal o f barrier 144 was likely to have contributed to
the collapse o f 124a. Later, he sought to resile from that answer, but I think his earlier ad m ission was correct. It
was argued that if barrier 144 had rem ained, the influx from gate C w ould have built up further back and the
tragedy might have occurred in the tunnel or m ight have broken barrier 144 itself. This is speculative and I
think unlikely. W hat rem ained o f barrier 144 in pen 4 did n ot cause a build-up; nor did it collapse. But its
rem aining in p osition may well have accounted for no barrier further down pen 4 collapsing and for the lesser
carnage in that pen.

When did Barrier 124a Fail?
  236. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police sought to argue that this barrier collapsed or m ay have
collapsed at about 2.47 pm. His purpose was to suggest that the opening o f gate C was not causally linked with
the crushing and fatalities resulting from that collapse. I have already found that whilst the evidence d oes not
perm it the tim e o f collapse to be fixed with certainty, it was after 2.52 pm. I now give m y reasons:

  (a) I have several tim es w atched the BBC v id eo tape on w hich Counsel relied. I do not find the incident he
      identifies at 2.47 pm suggestive o f a collapse at that time;

  (b) the evidence o f fans w ho were near or at the barrier was overwhelmingly to the effect that the collapse
      occurred at or after 3 pm;

  (c) the biggest group o f w itnesses was that w hich related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley’s
      “ near-miss” at the Kop end at 3.04 pm;

  (d) the appearance on vid eo and photographs o f fans in the area o f barrier 124a after the incident at 2.47 pm
      and before the final crush is not consistent w ith it having collapsed so early;

  (e) it is highly unlikely that if so catastrophic an event had occurred as early as 2.47 pm, th e police on the
      track and elsewhere w ould have taken until nearly 3 o ’clock to realise som ething was seriously wrong.
      Indeed, if .Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in his tim ing o f the collapse, the failure o f
      the police to respond for so long w ould exp ose them to even graver criticism than that m ade in this
      Report.

Dr Eastw ood’s Testing of the Barriers
  23 7. Two sections o f barrier 124a in pen 3 collapsed as a result o f the overcrowding. That collapse caused a
num ber o f deaths. D r Eastwood and his staff had undertaken the periodical testing o f crush barriers required
by the G reen G uide and by the Safety C ertificate. Barrier 124a had been tested in July 1988 and passed.

   238. The test had been carried ou t in accordance with D r Eastwood’s interpretation o f A nnex C to the
G reen Guide. That requires an evenly distributed force o f 6.0kN /m etre width to be applied for 3 five m inute



                                                          41
 periods, the interval between applications to be as short as possible. A record has to be kept o f the am ount o f
 deform ation during each loading and o f the percentage o f recovery. If the-recovery is less than 50% after the
 third application o f force, the barrier has failed the test. If recovery is between 50% and 75%. there m ust be a
 re-test. The question is: 50% or 75% o f what? Is the recovery to be in relation to the p ositio n o f the barrier
 before the first application o f force or before the third? If the former, a span o f 124a recorded 53% at the 1988
 test and should have been re-tested. If the latter, it recorded 100% and passed. U nfortunately the Green G uide
 is unclear as to the correct interpretation. Dr Eastwood took the latter view and so passed the barrier. He
 justified h is interpretation in evidence. H e said failure to recover to the original p osition could be d ue to a
 “shake-down” effect related to som e giving in the ashes under the concrete or to som e other extraneous factor
 rather than to any defect in the m aterial o f the barrier itself.

    239. I think, after consulting Professor Maunder, that safety ought to have dictated recovery should be by
  reference to the p osition o f the barrier before the first application o f force. I accept, however, that the Green
  G uide is am biguous and D r E astw ood’s interpretation is tenable. It has som e support from the British
| Standards tests on steel structures. Clearly, however, for the future, the Green G uide should be clarified on this
j point.

  Corrosion
    240. Inspection o f barrier 124a, and indeed other barriers at Hillsborough, by the HSE showed
  considerable corrosion o f the m etal at vulnerable p oints where water could accum ulate. D r E astw ood agreed
  that if a significant degree o f corrosion w as observed on visual inspection, a barrier should be condem ned.

    241. The Green G u id e d oes not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides, in te r a l i a :

    “Crush barriers and balustrades should be exam ined for deform ation or any other overt signs o f w eakness”.

  Paragraph 6 o f A nnex C provides:

    “If during any test, even though the b arrier... satisfies the above loading requirements, doubt should arise
    for any reason (including such matters as cracking o f the terracing or distortion o f con n ection s) as to the
    safety o f th e b a r r ie r ... a detailed investigation should be carried out. U nless the results o f this investigation
    rem ove the doubt as to safety o f the barrier... (it) should be deem ed to have failed the test”.

    242. Since corrosion is a likely cause o f deterioration, a revision o f the Green G u id e should make specific
  reference to it.

  Causation
     243. Tests done by the HSE suggest that although barrier 124a passed the loading test in 1988 and probably
  w ould have been able to sustain a force w hich did not exceed the test load, it was unable to resist th e load
  im posed upon it by reason o f the n um bers in pen 3, the excessive gap in the barrier higher up the pen and the
  absence o f barrier 144. Corrosion probably played a part, but the effective cause o f the collapse was the
  excessive and unanticipated pressure to w hich the barrier was exposed.

                                   THE CRUSHING NOT RECOGNISED

Observation from Control Room
   244. As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in the control room could be expected
to keep a close watch on pens 3 and 4. They had a direct view o f them from an elevated position through their
window. Although they had no field-glasses, there was the z o o m facility on the TV camera. The radio w as by
then working again and although reception was difficult d ue to crowd noise and possibly excessive air traffic
on channel 25. attem pts could have been m ade to alert officers on the perimeter track to watch for
overcrowding and report their observations. In the event, p en s 3 and 4 becam e more and more crowded, surges
took place, fans were showing and signalling distress. N o n e o f this was seen or recognised in the control room.

Officers on the Track
  245. The 20 officers detailed to the perim eter track w ere distributed round the pitch so that som e five
officers were at the west end. Their written instructions m ade no reference to the avoidance or detection o f
overcrowding. T he sam e applied to the officers in the w est stand. Mr Greenwood adm itted that his oral
briefings also contained no m ention o f m onitoring the pens for overcrowding.

   246. The Operational Order for 1988 had instructed officers to forbid anyone “access to the track from the
terraces w ithout the consent o f a senior officer (except to receive m edical attention)”. At the en d o f the 1988
sem i-final, there was a m inor pitch invasion. Accordingly, that prohibition was em phasised in the 1989
Operational Order by being put into capital letters. T he com b ination o f no instructions as to overcrowding and
a strong prohibition on opening the gates was likely to m ake police recognition o f crushing slow and their
response reluctant. Small w onder that the growing pressure and congestion between 2.50 pm and 2.59 pm
w ent unheeded or certainly unrem edied. Even w hen officers recognised there was a problem, the rule required
consent o f a senior officer before a gate could be op en ed .

  247. “Senior officer” meant an officer o f Inspector rank or higher. The Inspector in charge o f the 20 officers
on the track was Mr Darling. He stationed h im self by the players’ tunnel, the m ost central position for
supervising his m en. In evidence he said:

  “I w ould on ly take action if I thought crowding had got to such a stage tfiat the fans were in danger. I’d then
  inform ground control and I w ould expect so m eon e deployed to the back o f the stand.”

   That underlines the inhibition against op en ing perim eter gates. So did the evidence o f o n e C onstable w ho
said it had been so drum m ed into officers not to op en the gates that when he saw distress in pen 4, he “debated”
w ith h im self before opening the gate, thinking: “If I’m wrong, I’m going to get a right bollocking for this.”
Naturally, o n e w ould h ope that com m on sense and h um anity w ould make som e officers cut through the rules
and open a gate i f fans were clearly in distress.

  248. This is what happened, but not until officers recognised the distress and even then not im mediately.
H ence, gates 3 and 4, having been opened, were shut again before they were finally op en ed and at first those
seeking to clim b out over the fence were pushed back. This reaction o f the police did not go on for as long as
som e w itnesses believed. They probably m isinterpreted the hand m ovem ents from Mr G reenw ood and others
aim ed at persuading fans to m ove back and relieve the pressure as attempts to stop those clim bing out at the
front.

  24 9. Nevertheless, there was a period during w hich the failure to recognise the problem and the inhibition
against tackling it caused vital tim e to be lost.

                                           THE RESPONSE OF THE POLICE

     The Officers in Command
       250. Even when realisation o f the problem cam e to officers on the track, it was so m e m inutes before it
     reached the control room . W hen spectators first appeared on the track, the im m ed iate assum ption in the
     control room was that a pitch invasion was threatened. T his was unlikely at the beginning o f a m atch. It
     becam e still less likely w hen those on the track m ade no m ove towards the pitch. M r M otson, the BBC
     commentator, recognised and said, well before the m atch was stopped, that the trouble seem ed to be
     overcrowding and not m isbehaviour. Still, the assum ption to the contrary persisted in the control room . Until
     Mr Murray radioed for a fleet o f am bulances, about 3.06 pm , Mr D uckenfield continued to treat the incident
     as a threat to the pitch and to public order. The m essage calling up all available officers m en tion ed a pitch
     invasion. Operation Support w as initiated and dog handlers were requested.
        251. U ntil C h ief Superintendent N esbit arrived, there was no effective leadership either from control or on
     the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. N o orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve
     pressure. Som e officers did this on their own initiative. Apart from the Tannoy request to clear the pitch, no
     attempt was m ade to clear and mark o ff a casualty area where first-aid could be given w ithout hindrance by
     fans and photographers m illing about between the bodies. There was no co-ordination o f the early provision o f
     first-aid or o f stretcher parties or o f the rescue effort through gates 3 and 4. N o request for help was broadcast to
     doctors and nurses in the crowd until about 3:29 pm w hen it was too late. Probably, there was little that could
     have been achieved in m ost cases however soon doctors had been su m m oned, but there were marginal cases
     where earlier attention m ight have m ade a difference.
       252. The plight o f th ose b eh ind the fencing and the existence o f injuries were known to officers at the scene
     from 3 pm. But the M ajor D isaster Plan was not started until 3.06 pm at earliest w hen the am bulance service
     was called. N o request for cutting gear or for the fire brigade was m ade until 3.13 p.m. Again, it is unlikely that
     these services could have saved lives i f they had been called promptly, but it is possible.
     Police on the Pitch
         253. D esp ite the initial lack o f leadership, m any officers d id all they hum anly could to rescue and revive the
     victim s. M an y supporters w ho gave evidence paid tribute to these efforts:- It is also fair to say that the number
     o f officers w ho could at first be usefully involved at the two open gates was necessarily lim ited.
        254. C h ief Superintendent N esb it’s action in deploying a line o f officers across the m idd le o f the pitch has
     already been m entioned. I can well understand the resentment it caused. However, the police assertion that a
     rush by som e fans towards the Kop end raised fears o f conflict are well borne out by the v id eo tape. In my
     judgem ent, C h ief Superintendent N esbit was well justified in using som e o f the m any officers called up
     pursuant to Operation Support to prevent possible violence. To have had open fighting in a ground where
     som e 90 spectators already lay d ead would have been an unthinkable and obscene d e v e lo p m e n t..
     Fans on the Pitch
        255 . Many fans w ho escaped onto the pitch alive were in a state o f collapse or close to it. M ost o f those who
     retained their strength strove m agnificently to assist the victim s. They helped pull them clear; they helped with
     first-aid; they helped carry the im provised stretchers.
       25 6. There were fans, however, who were distraught, angry, drunk, or all three. Their conduct in abusing,
     assaulting and spitting at the p olice was disgraceful, the m ore so since earlier police failures had little to do
     with those officers now doing their best for the injured. In addition, there were abuse and assaults on
     am bulance m en and firem en in the course o f their rescue work. This was probably because their similar
     uniform s caused them to be m istaken for police. However, although the abuse was widespread, the num ber o f
     assaults and spittings was on the evidence com paratively small. In deploring them , on e m ust recognise the
     uniquely horrifying experience w hich those responsible had just suffered and were still suffering.
     False Reports
        257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories reported in the press, and said to have em anated from
     police officers present at the m atch, o f “m ass drunkenness”. It was said that drunken fans urinated on the
     police while they were pulling the dead and injured out, that others had even urinated on the bodies o f the dead
     and stolen their belongings. N o t a single w itness was called before the Inquiry to support any o f those
     allegations although every opportunity was afforded for any o f the represented parties to have any w itness
     called w hom they w ished. As soon as the allegations I have m entioned were m ade in the press, Mr Peter
     Wright, C hief C onstable o f South Yorkshire, m ade a dignified statement dissociating h im self from such grave
     and em otive calum nies. T hose w ho m ade them, and those w ho dissem inated them, w ould have done better to

     hold their peace.

                                                                44

                                     THE PERIMETER GATES WERE TOO SMALL

        258. T h e perimeter gates in the pens were not designed as exits. T hey were intended to afford access by the
      police to co p e w ith any local disorder or w ith an emergency. T he kind o f emergency contem plated was not
      m assive crushing but. for exam ple, the collapse or illness o f an individual. Emergency evacuation o f the pens
      had been considered by the Officer Working Party. A lthough fire risk was m inim al since the terraces, west
      stand and tunnel were o f concrete construction, the fire brigade were the principal arbiters o f evacuation
      procedure. They aim ed to be able to em pty the pens in six m inutes. T he plan was to evacuate spectators v ia the
      tunnel. If for any reason that option becam e im practicable, eg due to a bom b threat, then the alternative route
      would be along the back o f the terraces, through the gates in the radial fences and round the sides o f the west
      stand. T h e fire brigade were satisfied .that each o f these routes w ould enable the pens to be evacuated in less
      than six m inutes, w ithout relying on the gates to the pitch. T h ose gates w ould also be available, but their use
      was excluded from the calculation o f evacuation tim e.

        259. T he need to provide for speedy and large scale evacuation from the front o f the pens to the pitch was
      not anticipated. T he Green G uide (1986) provides as follows:

        “209. A ccess to the pitch must be m ade as difficult as possible in normal circum stances w hile at the same
        tim e ensuring that the police have effective access to the terraces for the purpose o f crowd control and
        enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the event o f serious emergency . . .

        214. . . . at som e m ajor soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd m ovem ent forms a necessary part o f the
        safety measures, it may be necessary to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
        circum stances . . . but allows for access in emergency.

        215. For m ost m ajor stadia, whether used for association football or other sports, the pitch perimeter fence
        will be required either to prevent access to the pitch as m en tion ed above, or at least to discourage attempts
        by spectators to enter the playing area. G ates or other access points (m inim um width 1.1 metres) should
        n onetheless be provided for use in an em ergency . . . Provision o f such gates or access points is particularly
        im portant to allow full access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a place o f safety in
        an emergency.        Such gates or access points should be properly stewarded and                             clearly
        m arked so that im m ediate access to the playing area or perim eter track can be ensured”.

        260. G ate 3 was .82 metres in width; gate 4 was .79 m etres in w idth. There were therefore clear departures
      from the G reen G u id e standard.

         261. T h e Safety Certificate provided (by Schedule 2 Paragraph 24) as follows:

         T h e (club) shall arrange for the Stadium to be inspected by a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer . . . at
         least on ce each period o f 12 m onths . . . and . . . shall as soon as possible after each inspection supply to
         the . . . C ouncil a Certificate by the said Chartered E n gin eeras to the current com pliance ornon-com pliance
         w ith . . . the appropriate provisions and recom m en dation s o f the (Green) G uide o f all structural parts o f the
         Stadium . . .

  I      262. It was argued that there was no breach o f the Safety Certificate since the Green G uide specifically
       provides for flexibility. However, in my view the Safety Certificate cannot and certainly should not be
 j'    interpreted so liberally as in effect to leave such basic requirem ents as the size o f exit gates to the total
I      discretion o f the club and its advisers. O ne o f the matters for consideration at stage two o f this inquiry will be
       whether, and in what respects, the Green G u id e need s to b e clarified and toughened.

 \        263. D r Eastwood explained the small w idth o f the gates by reference to the dilem m a facing the police. They
       w anted a gate sufficient for its intended purpose ie police access and small scale emergencies. On the other
       hand, they did not want a flood gate o f such size as to endanger the prim e principle o f preventing pitch
       invasions. In the light o f Hillsborough, this is perhaps the m ost poignant exam ple o f the difficulty o f achieving
       a b alance between stopping hooliganism and ensuring crowd safety.

 I        264. Even if the w idth o f gates 3 and 4 had com p lied w ith the present Green G uide standard, they would
(j     have been wholly inadequate to relieve pressure and release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the
I      G reen G u id e says nothing about the num ber o f gates required for a pen o f given size. W hilst the Club.


                                                                  45
D r Eastwood, the O fficer Working Party and the local authority can be criticised for failing strictly to conform i
to the G u id e, the real failure was com m on to all those w ho have been responsible for considering safety on the \!;
terraces. T he anxiety to protect the sanctity o f the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk j
o f a crush d ue to overcrowding. Certain it was. that on ce th e crush occurred on 15 April gates 3 and 4 were
w holly inadequate for rescue purposes.                                                                            !</

                                                CHAPTER 16

                                      BRIEF SUMMARY OF CAUSES

  265. The im m ediate cause o f the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the failure, when gate C was      -
opened, to cut o ff access to the central pens which were already overfull.

  266. They were already overfull because no safe m ax im u m capacities had been laid down, no attempt was
m ade to control entry to individual pens num erically and there was no effective visual m onitoring o f crowd
density.

   267. W hen the influx from gate C entered pen 3. the layout o f the barriers there afforded less protection
than it should and a barrier collapsed. Again, the lack o f vigilant m onitoring caused a sluggish reaction and
response when the crush occurred. T he small size and n um ber o f gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So.
in the initial stages, d id lack o f leadership.

  26 8. The n eed to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the turnstiles. That occurred because, as
both Club and police should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large numbers
dem and ed o f it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The Operational Order and police tactics on
the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival o f large num bers should that occur in a short
period. That it might so occur was foreseeable and it did. T he presence o f an unruly m inority who had drunk
too m uch aggravated the problem. So d id the Club’s confused and inadequate signs and ticketing.
                                                                    CHAPTER 17

                                                         THE FA’s CHOICE OF GROUND

                     269. The FA were strongly criticised by the Football Supporters’ A ssociation and others for having
                 im posed the Hillsborough v en u e on L iverpool for a second year running. T he Liverpool supporters had to
                 travel m uch further to Sheffield than their N ottingham rivals. T h e police required that i f the m atch was to be at
                 H iilsborough at all, L iverpool w ould have to have the west and north sid e accom m od ation. T he disadvantages
                 o f that and the disparate num bers o fh o m e supporters o f the tw o clubs have already been set out. Liverpool had
                 had to knuckle under to the arrangement in 1988. They resented having it im posed in 1989. To hold the match
                 at Old.Trafford w ould have been a perfectly good and acceptable alternative. Indeed, the FA nom inated Old
                 Trafford as the venue for the replay should there be a draw at Hillsborough.

                   270. Mr Kelly, the FA’s C h ief Executive, sought to give reasons for preferring Hillsborough, but the only one
                 which seem ed to have any validity was that the 1988 match had been considered a successfully m anaged event.
                 H e adm itted that a telephone call from the C hief Executive o f the Liverpool Club protesting and putting
                 Liverpool’s case had not been m en tion ed to the FA com m ittee w hich finally decided the venue. Mr Kelly
                 frankly conceded that “there was an elem ent o f unfairness” to Liverpool in choosing Hillsborough for a second
                 tim e. I think the d ecision was ill-considered. N o doubt in future the FA will be m ore sensitive and responsive
                 to reasonable representations.

                   27 1. However, it was not suggested that the choice o f ven u e was causative o f this disaster. T he only basis on
                 which that could be said w ould be that, because o f its layout, the Leppings Lane end was incapable o f being
                 successfully policed for this sem i-final. I do not believe that to be so.

                                                        PO L IC E

Choice of Ends by the Police
   272. There was m uch bitterness am ongst Liverpool supporters that they had to make do again for the
second year w ith th e Leppings Lane end. But, cogent as their com plaints were, they am ounted to reasons for
ch oosin g a different ground altogether. G iven H illsborough as the venue, I think the police were right to
allocate the sections o f the ground as they did. T he d irection o f arrival and the need for segregation m ade it
sensible and to reverse the 1988 arrangements w ould have m ade for confusion. As with choice o f venue, I do
not consider ch oice o f ends was causative o f the disaster. H ad it been reversed, the disaster could well have
occurred in a sim ilar m anner but to N ottingham supporters.

Police Planning
  273. T he O perational Order for 1989 left m uch unsaid. Apart from the lack o f any provision for late or
congested arrivals, or any provision for the avoidance o f overcrowding on the terraces, there was a number o f
other o m ission s. For exam ple, there was no specific d ep loym ent o f officers to m an the perimeter gates. The
Order did n ot detail the duties o f the m ounted officers deployed at the Leppings Lane entrance, w ho included
Liverpool officers to assist in marshalling their own fans. T he duties o f Superintendents (especially Mr
G reenw ood and Mr Marshall) were not d efined so as to ach ieve clarity and efficiency. By an oversight, the
provision requiring m obile (Tango) patrols to assist the em ergency services was om itted from the text.

   274. T h e 1988 Order was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the num ber o f officers deployed in
shopping areas and to em phasise in capital letters the em bargo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
w ith the 1988 event led to complacency. That som e thought the pens overfull in 1988 and that the tunnel was
closed o f f on that occasion did not figure in or influence th e plan for 1989.

   275. Mr D uckenfield was prom oted and put in charge o f F D iv isio n only 21 days before this semi-final. The
pre-planning was already in progress under Mr M ole w ho had been in com m and both in 1987 and in 1988. It
m ight have been wiser to have left Mr M ole in charge o f this operation. On the other hand, it is quite
understandable that Mr D uckenfield should have been exp ected to take com m and o f events in his D ivision
from the date o f his prom otion. In view o f his lack o f exp erience at Hillsborough and o f a semi-final match,
however, it was im perative that he be fully briefed and that he should also b rief himself.

  2 7 6. H e was not informed o f the crushing incident in 1981 nor did he m ake inquiries which would have
revealed it. H e did not know the arrangement as between Club and police for m onitoring the Leppings Lane
terraces. H e did not visit and tour the ground before approving the Operational Order. Although he attended a
m atch on 2 April, there was only a small crowd present and he left control o f the game to the Superintendents.

 Policing on the Day
    2 7 7 . O n e o f the regrettable features o f the football scen e as it has d eveloped is the enorm ous expenditure o f
 m oney, tim e and effort in em ploying large numbers o f p olice all over the country to guard against the sort o f
 d isorder and m isbehaviour which have becom e endem ic. P olice m anagem ent o f a game o f football has becom e
 a m ilitary operation. T he problems faced and the responses received m ust be disheartening and m ay have
 ten ded to harden p olice attitudes to supporters in general.

    27 8. It is fair to state that over many years the South Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the
 public. T h ey have handled crowd problems sensitively and successfully at a large num ber o f football games
 in clud ing m ajor m atches, during strikes in the coal industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts.
 Unfortunately, their policing on 15 April broke down in th e ways already described and, although there were
 oth er causes, the m ain reason for the disaster was the failure o f police control.

    2 7 9 . In all som e 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I must report that for the most
 part the quality o f their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank. There were m any young Constables
 w h o as w itnesses were alert, intelligent and open. O n the day, they and m any others strove heroically in ghastly
 circum stances aggravated by hostility to rescue and succour victim s. They inspired confidence and hope.

    2 8 0 . By contrast, with som e notable exceptions, the senior officers in com m an d were defensive and evasive
 w itnesses. T heir feelings o f grief and sorrow were ob viou s and genuine. N o doubt those feelings were
 in ten sified by the knowledge that such a disaster had occurred under their m anagement. But, neither their
 h and lin g o f problem s on the day nor their account o f it in evidence showed the qualities o f leadership to be
 exp ected o f their rank. "'*•


                                                              49
   281. M r D uckenfield leant heavily on Mr Murray’s experience. Between them they m isjudged the build-up
at the turnstiles and d id little about it until they received Mr M arshall’s request to open the gate. They did not,
for exam ple, check the turnstile figures available from Club control or check with Tango units as to the
numbers still to com e. T hey did not alert Mr Greenw ood to the situation at the fringe o f his area o f com m and.
They gave no instructions as to the management o f the crowd at Leppings Lane. Inflexibly they declined to
postpone kick-off.

  282. W hen Mr M arshall’s request cam e, Mr D uckenfield ’s capacity to take decision s and give orders
seem ed to collapse. H aving sanctioned, at last, the opening o f the gates, he failed to give necessary
consequential orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred. H e m isinterpreted the em ergence o f
fans from pens 3 and 4. W hen he was unsure o f the problem , he sent others down to “assess the situation"
rather than descend to see for him self. He gave no inform ation to the crowd.

  283. M ost surprisingly, he gave Mr Kelly and others to think that there had been an inrush due to Liverpool
fans forcing open a gate. T his was not only untruthful. It set o f f a w idely reported allegation against the
supporters w hich caused grave offence and distress. It revived against football fans, and especially those from
Liverpool, accusations o f hooliganism w hich caused reaction not only n ationw ide but from Europe too. I can
only assum e that Mr D uckenfield ’s lack o f candour on this occasion was out o f character. H e said his reason for
not telling the truth was that if the crowd becam e aware o f it there m ight be a very hostile reaction and this
might im pede rescue work. He did not wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell Mr Kelly the truth did not require that he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
although Assistant C h ie f C onstable Jackson was at hand, M r D uckenfield did not d isclose the truth to him
until m uch later.

  284. T h e likeliest explanation o f Mr D uckenfield’s conduct is that he sim ply could not face the enorm ity o f
the d ecision to open the gates and all that flowed therefrom. T hat w ould explain what he said to Mr Kelly, what
he did not say to Mr Jackson, his aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective control o f the
disaster situation. H e froze.

The Police Case at the Inquiry
  285. It is a m atter o f regret that at the hearing, and in their subm issions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
prepared to concede they were in any respect .at fault in what occurred. Mr D uckenfield, under pressure o f
cross-exam ination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But, that apart, the police
case was to blam e the fans for being late and drunk, and to blam e the Club for failing to m onitor the pens. It was
argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate C but was due to barrier 124a being
defective. Such an u nrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to w hether lessons have been learnt. It would
have been m ore seem ly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.
                                                  CHAPTER 19

                         THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE SAFETY CERTIFICATE

   286. T h e perform ance by the City Council o f its duties in regard to the Safety Certificate was inefficient and
dilatory. T he failure to revise or am end the certificate over the period o f three years preceding this disaster,
despite im portant changes in the layout o f the ground, was a serious breach o f duty. There were, as a result, no
fixed capacities for the pens. T he certificate took n o account o f th e 1981 and 1985 alterations to the ground.

  287. A num ber o f breaches o f Green G uide standards were perm itted and persisted eg the spacing o f the
crush barriers, the w idth o f perimeter gates and the gradient in the tunnel (1 in 6 as against the Green Guide
m axim u m o f 1 in 10).

  288. T h e A dvisory Group lacked a proper structure; its procedure was casual and unbusinesslike. Its
accountability to the General Purposes Panel was ill-defined. D ec isio n s were taken informally and too much
was left td Mr Bownes. In particular, the decision to rem ove barrier 144 w asn o t referred to th e Panel and ought
not to have been made.

                                       THE CLUB AND DR EASTWOOD

   289. It should be recorded that in general the Club has over the years adopted a responsible and
con scien tious approach to its responsibilities. It retained th e services o f D r Eastw ood as consultant engineer
and abided by his advice. For his part, D r Eastw ood is skilled and experienced in this field, as already
indicated, and he sought I have no doubt to act efficiently a n d professionally in his advice and practical work.
T he Club also retained Mr Lock w ho had acquired great exp erience and knowledge o f Hillsborough during his
police service. A num ber o f w itnesses described H illsborough as a very good ground, “o n e o f the best in the
country”. T h e police agreed that relations between them and the Club were good. Over the last four years, the
Club had spent som e £ 1'h m illion on ground im provem ents.

   290. N evertheless, there are a num ber o f respects in w hich failure by the Club contributed to this disaster.
T hey were responsible as occupiers and invitors for the layout and structure o f the ground. The Leppings Lane
en d was unsatisfactory and ill-suited to adm it the num bers in vited , for reasons already spelt out. T h e Club was
aware o f these problem s and discussed solving them in various ways betw een 1981 and 1986. In the result,
there rem ained the sam e num ber o f turnstiles, and the sam e problem s o u tsid e and inside them. T he plan for
this sem i-final, in volving as it did the loss o f 12 turnstiles for the north stand and large numbers to be fed in
from Leppings Lane, was on e agreed between the Club and the police. T h e Club knew best what rate o f
ad m ission the turnstiles could m anage and ought to have alerted the p olice to the risks o f the turnstiles being
sw am ped.

   291. T h e alterations inside the turnstiles and on the terraces clearly affected capacity, but no specific
allowance was m ade for them . In that respect, both D r E astw ood and the Club should have taken a more
p ositive approach. Either a schem e such as o n e o f those D r Eastw ood put forward should have been adopted
giving m ore turnstiles and total separation o f areas or at th e very least the capacity o f the new pens and o f the
terraces as a w hole should have been treated m ore cautiously. T h e police view in 1981 that 10,100 was too high
a figure was known to the Club (although D r Eastw ood says not to him ). Yet, despite that and the sub-division
into pens, the figure remained.

   2 9 2. Although the police had assumed responsibility for m onitoring the pens, the Club had a duty to its
visitors and the Club’s officials ought to have alerted the p olice to the grossly uneven distribution o f fans on the
terraces. T h e Club operated and read the closed circuit television and the com puter totaliser. Liaison between
Club and police on the day failed to alert the latter to the num ber o f Liverpool supporters still to com e. The
o n u s here was on the Club as well as on the police.

   29 3. T h e removal o f barrier 144 was the responsibility o f the Club although it clearly acted on the a d v ice o f
D r E astw ood and the A dvisory Group which in this instance was m isguided.

  29 4. Likewise, the breaches o f the Green G uide were m atters w hich the Club should have appreciated and
rem edied.

    2 9 5. Lastly, as already indicated, the poor signposting o n the concourse tended to produce under-filling o f
the w in g pens and over-filling o f pens 3 and 4. Poor signposting outside the turnstiles and the unhelpful format
o f th e tickets also led to confusion aggravating the build-up in the turnstile area.
                                                       CHAPTER 21

                                     FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY SERVICES

    No Fault by the Emergency Services
       296. I say a t the outset o f this chapter that no valid criticism can be m ade o f the response by the St John
    A m bulance Brigade, by SYM AS or by the fire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any
    criticism o f them . T h e only attack on SYM AS cam e from two Liverpool doctors. One claim ed that ambulances
    d id not arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipm ent and that there was a lack o f triage. H e was proved to be
    wrong in all three respects. Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April when he said more
    lives cou ld have been saved i f staff and equipm ent had arrived earlier. Apart from being proved wrong in fact
    as to the tim es o f arrival o f ambulances, he conceded in ev id en ce that it was n ot possible to say whether lives
    could have been saved. H is com m ents on television were irresponsible. The other doctor com plained o f the
    absence o f defibrillators. I am satisfied bn overw helm ing ev id en ce that to attem pt to use a defibrillator on the
    pitch w ith people m illing about w ould have been highly dangerous owing to the risk o f injury from the electric
    charge.

      297. I find that all three o f the emergency services n am ed above responded promptly when alerted, that
    they brought appropriate equipm ent and that their personnel operated efficiently.

I     298. It w ould b e unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium , m edical facilities capable o f dealing with a
    m ajor disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
    eq u ipm en t and m edical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

      299. W hat is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid, for professional m edical attention and for
    am bulance attendance, together with a system o f co-ordination w ith the em ergency services w hich will bring
    them to the scene swiftly in whatever numbers are required. W hat will am ount to an appropriate basic
    provision for the future eg the equipm ent in a first aid room , requires expert evaluation and advice.

       300. On the day, there was no clear understanding betw een the Club and D r Purcell as to his role. He
    b elieved he was primarily there to attend to the players. T he C lub regarded him also as the “physician available
    to attend at the first aid room if required”, as laid down in the Safety Certificate.

      301.- There was insufficiently close co-operation between the p olice and the em ergency services. It is clear
    that SY M A S and the fire brigade should have been called earlier than they were. However, in view o f the nature
    and extent o f the crushing, the tim e when police rescue began and the pathetically short period for which those
    unable to breathe could survive, it is improbable that quicker recourse to the emergency services w ould have
    saved m ore lives.

       302. Finally, there was evidence that an advertising board had to be knocked down at the north-east corner
    o f th e ground to allow an am bulance onto the pitch and that at the top o f the ramp leading to the pitch the
    access for am bulances was inadequate. There was also evidence that the pre-match arrangement for
    am bulances to use the tw o gates from Penistone Road at the north-east end o f the ground as in and ou t routes
    was frustrated by the presence o f vehicles just inside the ground. In the event, n one o f these matters affected
    operations. T h e hoarding was quickly knocked down. T h e difficult access to the ramp was negotiated and
    am bulances used o n e entrance satisfactorily by backing out w hen loaded.




                                                               53

                                          COMMUNICATIONS

   303.      O ne problem which im peded police control and the gathering o f intelligence was the intermittent
failure o f com m unication by radio. There was the period o f two or three m inutes when the control room was
out o f radio contact. Even when that was rem edied, it w as only by using a hand set in the control room . This
meant that control could not override any other m essages. N o effective radio com m unication seem s to have
reached control from the perimeter track at the relevant tim e. Mr G reenw ood ’s request for the m atch to be
stopped and various messages from Constables reporting the distress in the pens did not register. Likewise,
com m unication from Leppings Lane to control was unreliable. U n d ou b ted ly these breakdowns m ade it more
difficult for those in com m and to m ake proper assessm en ts and exercise effective com m and.

                        PART IV - INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS
                                      CHAPTER 23 - INTRODUCTION

Limited Objectives
  304. It is im portant to stress the lim ited objectives o f the interim recom m endations I can m ake in this
Report. M y purpose is to propose instant measures capable o f being im plem ented forthwith and where
possible before the com m en cem en t o f the 19 89/1 99 0 season. They are designed to prevent overcrowding and
crushing on terraces in the short term and to im prove safety procedures. T hey d o not and cannot m eet all the
problem s or address all the issues o f post-Hillsborough football. W ider issues such as m em bership schemes,
identity cards, all-seater stadia, super-stadia and long term recom m en dation s fall to be considered in m y Final
Report. So do a num ber o f other specific matters such as a com prehensive review o f the Green G uide, the
problem o f excessive pre-m atch drinking, fans w ithout tickets and ticket touts. I m en tion these matters lest it
be thought I have d ecid ed no,recom m en dation s need be m ade concerning them . I have not. But before
deciding what if any recommendation's to make about these and other matters, more evidence and study is
required.

  305. Accordingly, the m ain thrust o f these interim recom m endations, as a h olding exercise, is to reduce
num bers on the terraces, to increase vigilance and to achieve a proper balance in crowd control between
prevention o f disorder and m aintenance o f safety.


Perimeter Fences
  306. It w ould be im practical and unwise to recom m end works o f construction or radical structural changes
now, before com p letin g the extensive study and consultation which will form stage two o f this Inquiry. Hasty
interim recom m en dation s o f that kind might well prove to be ill-judged after further study and require to be
changed in a m atter o f m onths.

   307. In particular, I d o not at this stage make any recom m endation as to rem oving perimeter fences or
replacing them w ith structures o f different design. Understandably, there was a wave o f popular feeling against
such fences in the im m ediate aftermath o f Hillsborough. T h e horrifying spectacle o f people being crushed
against the fencing focu ssed blam e for the disaster on the fences them selves. There were pleas to dism antle
them and em o tiv e references to the fans being treated like “caged anim als” . S o m e clubs removed their fencing
straightaway. It was therefore very tem pting to consider at an early stage m aking a recom m endation that the
fences should be rem oved. I confess to being so tem pted.

  308. Regrettably, on ly a m onth after Hillsborough, there were incidents w hich showed that violence and
hooliganism are still liable to erupt at football grounds. O n 13 M ay at Selhurst Park, Birmingham City
supporters in vaded the pitch and fought with supporters o f th e h o m e club, Crystal Palace. Five police officers
and 16 supporters were injured and required treatment at a local hospital. On the sam e day at a match between
Bristol City and S heffield U nited, spectators spilt onto the pitch and there was fighting on the terraces. At the
Cup Final between Liverpool and Everton on 20 May, there was a pitch invasion, albeit a comparatively
benign one.

   309. Even the Football Supporters’ A ssociation (FSA) felt it necessary to say in their final subm ission,

       “ With som e reservations, the FSA accept that perim eter fences are necessary for crowd control.”

   310. Bearing in m ind those matters, and the need to consider further expert evidence, I have decided that it
w ould be unw ise and premature for m e to m ake any recom m endations now either to remove or to preserve or
to alter the structure o f perim eter fences. I shall make recom m endations about them in my Final Report.

   311. For the present, I would em phasise that, although the fencing prevented escape, the real cause o f the
H illsborough disaster was overcrowding and it is against that danger that my interim recom m endations are
prim arily directed. W hilst declining to recom m end the removal o f the fences, I do consider that the gates to the
pitch should be kept op en whilst the terraces are occupied. This will have, I hope, three beneficial effects.
O bviously, an op en gate is a more ready escape route than on e which has to be locked. Secondly, the sight o f
open gates will be reassuring to spectators on the terraces. Thirdly, the existence o f gaps in the fencing by
reason o f the open gates will concentrate the m inds o f police officers or stewards on the track to the need for
careful m onitoring o f those on the terraces.


                                                         55
   312. It will o f course be necessary to have a police presence sufficient to prevent pitch invasion for improper
 reasons through the open gates. However, 1 am encouraged to think that this is not an insuperable problem by
 the fact that, for exam ple at A nfield, Liverpool’s ground, there were no gates in the perim eter fencing before it
 was taken down. There were instead gaps or “access p oints” as they are called in the Green G uide (paragraph
 215). T h eir existence did not, so far as I am aware, prevent the authorities from m aintaining order. Also, the
 gates were open throughout the replay o f this ill-fated sem i-final at Old Trafford on 7 M ay 1989.


 Reduced Numbers
    313. In the assessm ent o f figures for capacity, the criteria in Chapter 16 o f the Green G uide were not at
 Hillsborough, and may not elsewhere, have been applied w ith sufficient rigour. Therefore, in addition to
 rem inding and enjoining local authorities and clubs to m ake all necessary deductions when assessing the
 figure for m axim um capacity in accordance with the G reen G u id e, I recom m end reducing that figure by a
 further 15% as an interim measure.


 Safety Certificate
 ; 314. The Safety Certificate procedure should, i f it is properly administered and enforced, go far towards
/ achieving crowd safety. W hether it succeeds d epends u pon the vigilance and com m itm ent o f the local
  authority issuing the Certificate. I do not know w hether the poor performance o f the local authority at
  H illsborough was typical. Arguments have been put to me suggesting the need for som e national oversight or
  inspection o f local authority certification procedures. T his raises com plex issues which I shall want to consider
  further at stage two o f the Inquiry. For the present, I m ake recom m endations as to the content o f Safety
  C ertificates and arrangements for issuing, m onitoring, enforcing, reviewing, am ending and renewing them.
                                       CHAPTER 24 - THE RECOMMENDATIONS

  315. T h e recom m endations which follow are the m inim u m necessary to ensure that existing football
grounds can for the present be safeiy used, based upon the evidence w hich I have heard at Sheffield and other
inform ation I have received. T hey com plem ent the recom m endations w hich M r Justice Popplewell set out
after his inquiry at Bradford.

   316. T h ose w hich are asterisked should be carried out before the 1 98 9/90 season starts. T he rest should be
started forthwith and com pleted as soon as possible.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
★          1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
         should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

         A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
         another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

★         2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
         Guide (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

         (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
             which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
             in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

         (b) after assessing “the Green Guide figure”, a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
             margin.

★             3. Arrangements should be made:-

         (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
             figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
             ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherw ise, and

         (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


    Filling and Monitoring Terraces
    ★       4, There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
        - responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
          ether terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
          variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

    ★    ‘     5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
             area, d steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
             sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
             period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
             or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
             below, and by radio to the control room.


    Fences and Gates
               6. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
             duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
             crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
             demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
             different crowd densities.

    ★           7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
             different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency Exit”.



                                                                  57
            ★        8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
                -   when spectators are on the terrace.

            ★          9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
                    a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
                    The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
                    stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be able to make radio contact with the control room
                    either himself or via an officer close at hand.

            ★         10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
                    are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
                    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
                    brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decisionofa
                    nominated senior police officer at the ground.


            Crush Barriers
            ★         11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
                    to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

            ★         12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
                    complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessment of the
                    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
                    reflect the fact.


                Safety Certificates
                      13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
                    which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
                    ambulance service and the building authority. Such a reviewshould include an inspection of the stadium. Its
                    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
                    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
                    recommendations in this report.

                      14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
                    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

                       15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
                     Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


                        16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
                     amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
                     accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
                     effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
                     with the local authority’s rules.

                        17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
                     of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives.of the police* of the fire and ambulance services, of
                     the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group’s terms of
                     reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
                     ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
                     and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
                     written reports for consideration by the local authority.


                Duties of each Football Club
                ★      18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
                     inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
                     anticipated.


                                                                          58




                                                                                                                                           ..3

★            .19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
          as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
          turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done,-the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
          accordingly.

★            20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
          reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
          operators for this purpose.

            21. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
          concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

★            22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
          reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
          and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
          area.

★           23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
          the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
          should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

★          24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
          by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
          admitting spectators to the ground.

            25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
          entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.
                           I




    Police Planning
    ★       26. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
          should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
          concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

    ★        27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
          officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
          is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

    ★        28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
           any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
           sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

    ★       29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
           Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

              30. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
           monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record o f any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
           at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
           in the interpretation and use of these data.


        Communications
             31. There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
           received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
           priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be
           used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
           sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.
      32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
    with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

      33. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
    areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
    announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
    noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
    match.

      34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
    Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
    the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
★     35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
    liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

★     36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
    ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
    spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
    concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
    rooms of each of the emergency services.

★     37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
    services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
    within the ground itself.

★     38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
    the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
    they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
★     39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
    club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

      40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
    equipment to be maintained*within them should be specified by the local authorin’ after taking professional
    medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

★    41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
    any medical exigency at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be
    present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
    match. His whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
    contactable.

      42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
    attendance at all matches with an expected crowd o f5,000 or more.

      43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
    be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
    requirement of the Safety Certificate.

M r H icks’ Evidence
    1. M r and M rs H icks’ two daughters died in the disaster. They had arrived early en fam ille but had tickets
fo r different sections. The two daughters had standing tickets; they went into pen 3. M rs Hicks had a seat in the
north stand. M r H icks took up a standing position in pen 1just below and to the west o f the police box at about
2.15 pm From there, he had a view o f the centre pens. H e kept an eye on them as they filled up since he knew h is
daughters to be there.

   2. H is evidence was that by 2.5 0 pm he could see people were in distress. A t about 2.55 pm he and others
called to a senior police officer at the top o f the steps to the control box to draw his attention to the crushing. M r
Hicks was only about 10 feet from the officer. H e described him as wearing a flat cap w ith gold or silver braid
and a light coloured anorak. M r Hicks believed he was the officer who stopped the match. M r Greenwood, who
d id stop the m atch, was certainly'not wearing a light coloured anorak, as can clearly be seen on the video.

   3. M r Hicks says that he and others shouted several times to this officer in attem pts to alert him to the
distress in the pens. Th ere was no reaction although M r H icks believes the officer must have been in earshot.

   4. T h at officer descended from the steps and two cameramen whom M r Hicks believed were from
television came and appeared to direct th eir cameras towards the pens. A nother senior officer appeared two
steps down from the platform . H e was a stocky figure; he also wore a flat cap but w ith black braid. M r Hicks
says that he and two o r three others tried several times to capture this officer’s attention w ithout success. Then
M r Hicks says he shouted “For C hrist’s sake! Can’t you see w hat’s going on? W e can, and you have cameras”. The
officer is said to have replied dismissively “Shut your fucking prattle” .

  5. W hen the disaster occurred the two Hicks girls were crushed. V ictoria was put in an ambulance and M r
Hicks accompanied her to hospital where she was found to be dead. Sarah died at the ground.

   6. M r Hicks was an impressive witness and, despite his grievous loss, rem arkably stoical. H e gave his
evidence clearly and w ith o u t rancour. H e was certainly m istaken about M r Greenwood being one o f those on
the steps and it has not been possible to identify either officer from M r Hicks’ descriptions. H e may well also
have been imprecise as to tim ings. Nevertheless. I see no reason to doubt that what he described did occur in
relation to two officers. As M r H icks generously said him self, the dismissive abuse from the second officer
(although reprehensible) may have been due to his being preoccupied w ith trying to see w hat was happening at
pens 3 and 4 around k ic k -o ff tim e.

T h e Goalkeeper and G ate 4
   7. M r B am brock, a Liverpool supporter, said he went through the tunnel. H e would have liked to have
turned back when he saw how crowded the pens were. H e went w ith his father and 13 year old brother Stephen
towards the front o f pen 4. H e saw the teams come onto the pitch. Conditions at the fro n t were, he said, alright
u n til about 2 minutes to 3. Then the pressure in the pen increased and he and his father became separated. His
feet came o ff the ground. H e shouted to police officers through the fence to get them out and help them . The
police d id not react. T h e Liverpool goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar, spoke to a policem an on the track. The gate
was then opened by a blonde policewoman and about 25 to 30 people went through it. They included the
witness’s father and his brother Stephen who had a broken arm. A police Constable shut the gate. It was then
reopened by the same policewoman, the witness thought, and he got out.

  8. M r Eccleston, a m ale nurse and an impressive witness, was sitting in the north stand. H e noticed pens 3
and 4 were full and realised something was wrong when fans started coming over the perim eter fence but did
not invade the pitch. H e said the Liverpool goalkeeper appeared to notice this too.

  9 . M r Grobbelaar was out o f the country during the In q u iry and was therefore not called. However, he
m ade a statement which was put in as his evidence. In the course o f it he said :-

  “ K ic k -o ff happened and we got into our stride pretty quickly - we forced a com er pretty early on and the ball
  came down to m y end - I rolled it out to the full back once and play went on until Peter Beardsley h it the
  crossbar o f the N ottingham Forest goal from a com er and came back into play. I rem em ber ju st after that
  there were shouts and screams from the crowd just behind me. it was different; not the ordinary crowd noise
  and I turned around to look. W h a t amazed me first was the concentration and squash o f fans in the centre



                                                           63
section, the end areas still had plenty o f space. I t was only then I became conscious that the crowd was
squashing forward and wasn’t able to go sideways and th at’s when I noticed the fencing alongside them
holding them in. I saw fans being pulled up into the stand above the terraces, I saw fans clim bing over into the
empty areas at the side and I saw fans clim bing out over the front onto the pitch which was particularly
d ifficu lt because o f the spikes on th e top o f the fencing b u t they were getting out.
   “ Play was still going on and I was in a terrible p osition trying to concentrate on play and having my
attention taken by what was happening behind me. T h e ball came down to our end and N ottingham Forest
won a comer, it was taken and we cleared our box area and as play was going forward over the centre line I
heard a shout, ‘Bruce - please help’ - a desperate shout from a fan squashed up against the fencing to the
right o f my goal as I looked at Leppings Lane terraces. H e screamed, ‘Please get the fucking gate open - Help,
help’. A ll the people who could speak were pleading fo r help. There were two policemen near the gate right
alongside the fan who had shouted to me and so I shouted to them , ‘Get the gate open’. I was still trying to
concentrate on play and was still having my attention taken by what was happening behind me there were
lots o f fans on the pitch behind the goal area by them too. I called again to the policemen, ‘Open the fucking
gate’ and one just turned away from me and looked back at the crowd but the other went to the gate and
opened it and it was like taking the top o ff a shaken coke bottle - people were everywhere on the play area
around my goal. Play was still going on and it came down towards me again fo r the left hand com er. I t was
a Nottingham Forest throw-in, away to m y left, the ball was out o f play and a fan came up to me on the
pitch and said, ‘Bruce, they’re killin g us’. I said ‘W h o ’s killin g you?’, and he said ‘Th ey’re crushing us-our
fans’. I said ‘G o and get some help’, and then a policem an came on and spoke to this fan. I don’t know
who the fan was, and then he led h im off. It was about this tim e I saw a policeman running onto the pitch
from my right across my box and to the referee who blew up, recovered the ball and told all players to clear
the pitch.”

   10. It is clear from the video th at M r G robbelaar’s recollection o f the sequence o f events, even w ith regard
to the game, is inaccurate in a num ber o f respects. For example, the two N ottingham Forest com er kicks
occurred minutes before Beardsley struck the bar. Further, it seems highly probable from other evidence that
gates 3 and 4 were open continuously well before M r G robbelaar says the fan asked h im to get the gate open. It
seems surprising too that w ith all the noise M r G robbelaar would hear the precise words o f an in d iv id u al fan,
let alone respond twice to them, w hilst the game was in progress.

  11. As to M r Bam brock’s account, the evidence o f P C Fiona Richardson was that she was the only
policewoman on the track in the early stages although others came from the seated area as the incident
developed. PC Richardson began at gate 1 and, although she did go and help people out through gate 3, she
did not go to gate 4, and d id not open it twice or even once. T h e two officers who spoke o f opening gate 4 were
both male.

   12. I th ink M r G robbelaar d id become conscious o f distress in the crowd behind h im and did speak to a
police officer at some stage, probably earlier than he now thinks. N o t to reach that broad conclusion would
involve attributing his whole account to invention o r fantasy and I see no grounds for doing so. However, his
detailed account was not tested in cross-examination and its inconsistencies and errors when compared with
other incontrovertible evidence would make it unsafe to derive m ore than the broad conclusion stated above.
The incident shows how honest witnesses can become confused and their evidence flawed when recollecting
ev.ents experienced under tension or em otion.

   13. As to the opening o f gate 4 there was an apparent conflict o f evidence. PC Illingw orth said that about
five minutes to 3 he opened it and guided fans emerging through it to gate 5,. PC Hooson said that it was he
who opened gate 4 ju st before kick-off. I am satisfied from the evidence o f a num ber o f fans that, like gate 3,
gate 4 was opened more than once. T h e probability is, therefore, that whilst PC Illingw orth was shepherding
fans to gate 5, gate 4 had been closed again u n til it was re-opened by PC Hooson two or three minutes later.

Oxygen
   14. I t was alleged by a doctor that an oxygen cylinder provided to him on the pitch was empty. D r Phillips, a
Liverpool supporter, had been in pen 3 w ith his brother and others. H e came under pressure and clim bed into
pen 2. W hen the disaster occurred and gate 1 was opened, he went through it, injuring his head as he d id so. He
came onto the pitch sometime after 3.10 pm and started resuscitation procedures. H e was given an oxygen
cylinder. H e believes this was from St John A m bulance. It was, he thought, too early to be the fire service. The
cylinder was switched on but D r Phillips says it gave no oxygen since it was empty. There was one oxygen
cylinder on the St John’s ambulance which came to the scene. M r Wells, the D ivisio nal Superintendent o f St
John, took that cylinder onto the pitch. H e said it was effective. In particular, he recalls going to a patient being
treated by D r Phillips and says that oxygen was flowing into that patient. Moreover, M r Wells tested the
cylinder afterwards and found it was still h a lf full. I t has a capacity that w ill last fo r 5 hours 40 minutes on a
high setting.


                                                          64
   15. There was evidence from Assistant C h ie f Fire O ffic e r Hornsby that a M axam an resuscitator had failed
to work properly., I t was delivering an oxygen flow appropriate to a “child” setting rather than a full “adult”
flow. On exam ination, it was found that a retaining nut in the control knob had worked Loose, possibly due to
vibration in transit, and this had affected the flow o f oxygen. The device had last been tested on 10 A p ril 1989.

  16. I accept the evidence o f M r Wells that the St John Am bulance cylinder was charged w ith oxygen and
working properly. In m y view, D r Phillips m ay have been mistaken as to the cylinder o f which he complains
being empty. H e agreed he was under great pressure, in an awkward situation; his head was injured and he
became very angry a t what he regarded then as w holly the fault o f the police. H e conceded that i f the cylinder
was not em pty there was a possible alternative - that the master tank top valve was shut. I t seems u nlikely that
he could have been referring to the fire service resuscitator as he was clear that the bottle he received was a
simple piece o f equipm ent not designed to breathe fo r the patient but merely to supply oxygen.

  17. I conclude that on a balance o f probabilities the evidence does not ju stify a finding that an empty
cylinder was brought to the scene.

C alling the Fire Service
   18. PC Bichard’s call to police Headquarters at 3.13 pm for the fire service to bring hydraulic cutting
equipm ent to cut m etal fences (see paragraph 101 supra) was heard by C h ie f Inspector Edmundson. H e went
into the adjacent operations room to give instructions for the message to be passed to the fire service. There, a
temporary control room assistant was already speaking to the fire service about a house fire. M r Edmundson
interrupted the call and asked the assistant to tell the fire service that cutting equipm ent was wanted at
Hillsborough. There followed a conversation between the assistant and Miss Davies at the fire service in the
following term s:-

   Police          Can we have cutting gear for Hillsborough, please - straight away?

   Fire Control    Just a m inute. R ight - what’s the address?

   Police          C utting equipm ent for Hillsborough football ground - straight away.

   F ire Control   Hillsborough football ground?

   Police          Yes, Hillsborough football ground.

   Fire Control    W h a t road is that on? D o you know?

   Police          J h e re has been a m ajor accident,, all the ambulances are up there.

   F ire Control   W h a t road is it on?

   Police          I have no idea; Hillsborough football ground.

   F ire Control   W h at road is it on? D o you know?

   Police          “Hillsborough football ground - w hat road is it on?” (this was said to someone in Police
                   Force C ontrol) - “ Penistone Road” (to F ire Control).

   F ire Control   Penistone Road.

   Police          Penistone Road, O K .

   F ire Control   Penistone Road, ju st a m inute - w hat’s exactly involved?

   Police          It’s football, a big m atch, Liverpool v N otts Forest.'

   F ire Control   Yes, but why do you want us; you said it was an R TA [Road Traffic Accident].

   Police          N o , no, no; m ajo r incident inside the ground.

   F ire Control   M a jo r incident inside - do you know exactly what it is?

   Police          N o , I don’t; they want all the cutting gear.

   F ire Control   For what - do you know?

   Police          H ang on a sec.

   A t that point C h ie f Inspector Edmundson intervened and spoke for the police. The conversation
 concluded:-

   Police          (M a le voice) - Hello!



                                                            65
  Fire C ontrol   H ello! N ow you w nt some cutting gear - w hat exactly is it for?

  Police          Th ere has been a m ajor accident at Hillsborough football ground where the sem i-final is;
                  the crowds have forced th eir way in, they have broken fences and gates down. I don’t know
                  exactly w hat it is but there are people trapped.

  Fire Control    Right! O K - leave it w ith us.

  T hat conversation took 1 m inute 13 seconds. It was published in a num ber o f newspapers w ith strong
critical comment mostly against the fire service. T h e thrust o f the criticism was that valuable tim e was wasted
by the fire service asking unnecessary questions as to where and why cutting equipm ent was required.

   19. There was a meeting o f the emergency services in August 1988 to discuss procedure in the event of a
m ajor disaster at Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. I t was pointed out and m inuted that “I t was im perative that
the Police Control give the exact location o f any fire or incident and as much detail as possible. N o senior fire
officer is on duty at the m a tc h .. . F ire service w ill attend v ia Penistone Road o r Leppings Lane as directed by
the police.”

   20. T h e message from PC B ichard contained all the necessary inform ation - Leppings Lane end, hydraulic
cutting equipm ent, to cut m etal fences. Regrettably, it was not passed on by H eadquarters in those terms. Miss
Davies had rightly been trained to require a precise location and needed to know the problem which w ould face
the fire service so th at the appropriate response could be made. In fact, there are several football grounds in the
Hillsborough district although clearly Sheffield Wednesday’s ground is the principal one. In the result,
although C h ie f Inspector Edm undson clarified, to an extent, the nature o f the problem , the locus which
emerged in the course o f the conversation (Penistone Road) was not that contained in the original message
from ground control (ie “Leppings Lane end.” ) W hilst on the face o f the conversation the fire service m ay seem
to have been slow in the uptake or perhaps pedantic, in my view the police ought to have been m ore specific.
They had the necessary inform ation to be so.

  21. I am satisfied, however, that the delay o f 1 m inute 13 seconds over the call, and even the delay
occasioned by the cutting equipm ent going to Penistone Road rather than Leppings Lane, did not affect the
outcome. Even had those w ith cutting equipm ent gone directly after a briefer ’phone ca£ll they w ould not have
arrived at a stage early enough to m ake cutting the fencing a helpful exercise.

M r Kenny Dalglish
  22. W hen the Liverpool manager went to the control room and agreed to m ake the announcement
broadcast at 3.56 pm , he says in a statement that he could not get the Tannoy to work. Spectators could see
him trying to address them and indicated to him m anually that nothing could be heard. A n officer pressed
buttons on the m achine and M r Dalglish says he tried again w ith sim ilar lack o f success. H e was then taken
under the police box to the room used by the disc jockey to broadcast pre-match music. There, the microphone
worked and he broadcast his message.

   23. M r Dalglish was not called. There was no other evidence about this incident. I accept it occurred as he
described. W h y the Tannoy could not at that tim e be successfully operated from the police box is, however,
strange and unexplained. U n lik e the radio, it had operated satisfactorily from the police box at the critical
tiihes save that its messages m ay not always have been heard above the prevailing noise. It had worked at about
3.30 pm when it called for m edical staff. I can see no grounds for criticising the police in regard to this incident
and certain it is that the b rie f delay in relaying M r Dalglish’s message can have had no significant effect.

                                        F IN A L R E P O R T O F IN Q U IR Y


                                               IN T R O D U C T IO N

  1. On 17 A p ril 1 9 8 9 1 was appointed by your predecessor, the R t Hon Douglas H u rd C BE, M P to carry out
an In q u iry w ith the following terms o f reference:

  “To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on 15 A pril 1989 and to make
  recommendations about the needs o f crowd control and safety at sports events.”

  2. Two Assessors were appointed to assist me: M r Brian Johnson CBE, Q P M , D L , C h ief Constable o f
Lancashire, and Professor Leonard M au n d er O BE, BSc, P hD , ScD, FEng, F I M ech E, Professor o f Mechanical
Engineering at the U niversity o f Newcastle upon Tyne.

  3. The first stage o f the Inquiry was p rim arily concerned w ith the investigation o f events at Hillsborough
Stadium on 15 A p ril 1989 when 95 people were crushed to death at a Cup semi-final match between Liverpool
and N ottingham Forest.

   4. O ver 31 days between 15 M ay and 29 June, I heard oral evidence from 174 witnesses at a public hearing
in Sheffield. I also recei ved much w ritten evidence by way o f submissions and letters.

  5. On 1 August 1 9 8 9 1 presented an In terim Report setting out my findings as to how and why the disaster
occurred. Also, in accordance with your predecessor’s wishes, I made interim recommendations aimed at
preventing any further disaster and im proving safety in the short term.

   6. The In te rim R eport and its recommendations had o f necessity to be made quickly so that action could be
taken before the start o f the new football season due to open in m id August. Despite all the speed I could
muster, the recommendations left very little tim e for pre-season action, especially in Scotland where the
fixtu re list started earlier than in England and Wales. I must pay tribute to the clubs, local authorities, police
and other services fo r responding so prom ptly and for im plementing the recommendations so wholeheartedly.

   7. In my In terim Report I indicated that it would be necessary to conduct w ider and deeper investigations
before delivering a F in al Report on the needs o f crowd control and safety for the future. Accordingly, I invited
and have considered a large number o f written submissions describing present practices and problems and
suggesting future changes. Those who have contributed are listed at Appendix 1 .1 am extremely grateful to all
o f them for th eir tim e and their views. I expect there are a number o f contributors and correspondents who
may look in vain for comment on each and every point they have raised. I hope they w ill understand that time
and space make it necessary to be selective and to have regard to the main issues.

  8. I have also had numerous inform al meetings with those representing relevant public bodies, clubs and
spectator interests. These have been conducted as private discussion sessions rather than hearings o f oral
evidence thereby enabling controversial issues to be explored and theories tested.

   9. In all o f this I have continued to be assisted by the two Assessors. Each holds a professional appointment
 carrying heavy responsibility and I am deeply grateful to both for devoting so much tim e to assisting me. Their
 contributions have been o f the highest value. W hile the sole responsibility for this report is mine, I am
 com forted in the knowledge that both Assessors agree with it.

    10. A t my request, Professor M aunder chaired a Technical W orking Party to review the technical aspects o f
 the H o m e O ffice G uide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 edition), “The Green G u ide”. Each member o f his
 team has much relevant experience and the team was well qualified for its task. I am most grateful for the
 co-operation and efforts o f each member. The Report o f the Technical Working Party is at Appendix 3.

    11. In the course o f the Inquiry, the two Assessors and I have between us visited 31 sports grounds. They are
 listed at Appendix 2. O f those, 24 were soccer grounds, but we also attended at grounds featuring Rugby
 U n io n , Rugby League, cricket, tennis and golf. I wish to record our thanks to the club officials who so readily
and hospitably facilitated our visits; also to the officers o f local government, the police and the emergency
services who together with club officials conducted us round the grounds, explained th eir operations and
answered our questions fully and frankly. Seeing crowd control and behaviour before, during and after a match
from various sections o f the viewing areas was an essential source o f first hand knowledge. I t brought alive the
written and oral reports we received.

   12. I should like to express my thanks to the H om e Office team who have staffed this Inquiry so welL M r
Robert W halley was appointed as its Secretary. H e has handled all the adm inistrative arrangements
impeccably and has given much invaluable advice and assistance on every aspect o f the Inquiry. He was ably
and diligently assisted by M r Jonathan Sweet, M rs Margaret W ither, M r Tony M oore, M rs Kate Hum phries
from the H om e O ffice and my own Clerk M r Ernest Pott. I also renew my thanks to the West M idlands Police,
and, in particular, to M r Geoffrey D ear Q P M , D L , LLfe, the C h ie f Constable, and M r M ervyn Jones M Sc,
Assistant C h ie f Constable in full-tim e charge o f the investigation, who have continued to provide me w ith
helpful inform ation at this second stage o f the Inquiry.

  13. H aving made my findings as to the events at Hillsborough, I do not in this report say any more about
them save by way o f illustration. I am aware that inquests are still to be held, civil proceedings are in m otion
and the possibility o f crim inal charges is under consideration. However, those are not matters fo r me. I
therefore turn now to broader issues as promised in paragraph 304 o f my In terim Report.

   14. M y terms o f reference are extremely wide. They embrace crowd control and safety at sports events o f all
kinds. However, crowd problems are directly related to the nature o f the event and the numbers attending it.
Realistically, this means that attention needs to be concentrated on events w ith in the scope o f the Safety o f
Sports Ground Act 1975 and the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987. Even more specifically, the
emphasis in this Report is especially upon football. The Hillsborough disaster and indeed other disasters
before it occurred in crowded football stadia. T h e numbers and the atmosphere at a football match have
created special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour not, so far, to be found to a like degree
elsewhere.

   15. That football is a special case has been expressly recognised by the Governm ent in promoting the
Football Spectators Act 1989. The Bill received the Royal Assent on 16 Novem ber 1989. It had commenced its
course through Parliam ent before the Hillsborough disaster. Expressly because o f that disaster and the setting
up o f this In q u iry it reached the statute book under unusual conditions. It was always to be an enabling Act
whose im plem entation would require a Statutory Instrum ent. In order to have the provisions o f the Act in
place as soon as possible, the Government decided to proceed with it forthw ith, notwithstanding Hillsborough
and this Inquiry. T h at decision was subject to an undertaking to bring the m atter back before Parliam ent on
two separate occasions. First, before the appointm ent o f the Football Mem bership A uthority under the Act;
secondly, to debate the scheme which the Act provides should be drawn up by that Authority.

   16. I was expressly told by your predecessor upon my appointm ent that my terms o f reference included
consideration o f the national membership scheme provided for in the B ill. T h a t was confirm ed on numerous
occasions by Ministers in the course o f the B ill’s passage through Parliam ent. I t was made clear that although
the Act would be on the statute book before my Final Report, Parliam ent would have the opportunity to
consider any observations I might make, including any about the national membership scheme. Thus, to take
only two examples, M r Nicholas Ridley, then Secretary o f State fo r the Fnvironm ent, said on the Second
Reading o f the Bill on 27 June 1989:

  “I began by referring to Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry. I w ill emphasise again now what I said at the
  beginning. Parliament w ill have not one but two opportunities to debate and vote on the national
  membership scheme after we have received the report and in the light o f any comments that Justice Taylor
  may make on the scheme. By proceeding with the B ill now, we can put the fram ework for the scheme in place
  and make it possible to move on rapidly with the scheme, i f Parliament agrees that we should do so when it
  has seen what Lord Justice Taylor has to say.”
  (O fficial Report, column 850).

Secondly, at the Com m ittee stage on 6 July 1989, M r C olin M oynihan, the M in ister fo r Sport, said:

  “ I am certain that Lord Justice Taylor will feel in no way inhibited by consideration o f the Bill in our
  suggested form at, because we specifically amended the Bill to provide for the Secretary o f State’s approval o f
  the scheme after the final report       the B ill is amended to enable the House to consider in detail the
  recommendations before we establish the Football Membership A uthority to draw up the scheme                 To
  hypothesise on whether Lord Justice Taylor is in favour o f a national membership scheme or whether he
  may not even comment on it, is totally irrelevant because the B ill provides for the House o f Commons and
  House o f Lords to consider the report before setting up a Football Membership Authority."
  (O fficial Report, column 56).

    17. It must be a rare i f not unique situation forajudge, appointed to conduct an Inquiry, to have w ithin his
rem it consideration o f the merits and provisions o f an Act o f Parliament already i.. place. It cannot be fo ra
judge to opine upon the wisdom or terms o f an Act expressing the established w ill o f Parliam ent. But. where
 Parliament has passed an Act in such terms and upon such undertakings as expressly to provide that the
 In q u iry judge be uninhibited in commenting upon it and that Parliament should have the opportunity to
consider his comments in further debate, then I conceive it to be his duty to express his views. M y doing so
 should not be interpreted as showing any lack o f the respect and deference due to Parliam ent. N ot to do so,
 against the background I have described, would surely be thought surprising i f not pusillanimous.

   18. In Part I o fth is Report I state some lessons to be learnt from Hillsborough, examine the state o f football
today and propose a range o f measures to give it a better future. In Part I I I consider, in detail, measures to
improve safety at sports grounds. Part I I I is concerned with crowd control at sports grounds and various
strategies for dealing with hooligans. In Part I V I consider the provisions o f the 1989 Act regarding the national
membership scheme. Finally, at the end o f the text, I set out my Recommendations. So as to avoid confusion, I
have not set out my In terim Recommendations forthe purpose o f comparison. H ardly any excisions have been
made. W here I have decided to repeat or amend the In terim Recommendations, they are included in the single
list o f Final Recommendations. I hope this Report and the Final Recommendations may be instrumental in
prom oting better and safer conditions at sports grounds in the future.

i. Previous Reports Unheeded
   19. It is a depressing and chastening fact that m ine is the ninth official report covering crowd safety and
control at football grounds. A fter eight previous reports and three editions o f the Green G uide, it seems
astounding that 95 people could die from overcrowding before the very eyes o f those controlling the event. In
January 1986, M r Justice Popplewell, whose report following the Bradford Disaster was the eighth in the
series, summarised those o f his seven predecessors. The Shortt Report o f 1924 followed disorder at the Cup
Final o f 1923. The Moelw yn Hughes Report o f 1946 followed the disaster at Bolton Wanderers ground when
overcrowding caused 33 deaths. In 1966 tne Government commissioned the Chester Report on “The State o f
Association Football”. The H arrington Report o f 1968 drew attention to problems o f crowd behaviour and led
to the Lang Report o f 1969 on the same subject. In 1972, Lord W heatley’s Report on Crowd Safety at Sports
Grounds followed the disaster at Ibrox Park where 66 spectators died. The McElhone Report o f 1977 on
Football Crowd Behaviour o f Scottish supporters was commissioned by the Secretary o f State for Scotland. In
 1984 an O fficial W orking Group on Football Spectator Violence set up by the Departm ent o f Environm ent
presented a further report.

  20. As a result o f the W heatley Report, the first edition o f the Green G uide was issued in 1973, and
Parliament passed the Safety o f Sports Grounds Ac*. 1975. A second edition o f the Green G uide was issued in
1976 and a th ird edition in 1986 incorporated recommendations made by M r Just ice Popplewell.

  21. Introducing his excellent and concise summary o f the previous reports, M r Justice Popplewell said:

  “almost all the matters into which I have been asked to inquire and almost all the solutions I have proposed,
  have been previously considered in detail by many distinguished Inquiries over a period o f 60 years”.

  Because his citations from those earlier reports are still highly relevant, I append his summary o f them at
Appendix 4.

   22. In my In terim Report I set out what happened at Hillsborough and why. That it was allowed to happen,
despite all the accumulated wisdom o f so many previous reports and guidelines must indicate that the lessons
o f past disasters and the recommendations following them had not been taken sufficiently to heart. I
appreciate how easy it is to criticise with hindsight and that a new situation can always arise in human affairs
which has not previously been envisaged. But many o f the deficiencies at Hillsborough had been envisaged.

   23. The M oelw yn Hughes Report in 1924 had stressed the need to start controlling the crowd well back
from the entrance to the ground. The Green G uide required that “Turnstiles should be o f such numbers as to
adm it spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are kept waiting for admission” (paragraph 44).
Chapter 8 o f the G uide required “Arrangements should be made ... to contain pressures before they reach
dangerous proportions” . Chapter 16 laid down m axim um capacity which was grossly exceeded in the fatal
pens at Hillsborough. Both the Green G uide (Chapter 15) and M r Justice Popplewell had stated the need for
gates in the perim eter fencing to be adequate to perm it escape on to the pitch in an emergency. W hy were these
recommendations and others not followed? I suggest two main reasons. First, insufficient concern and
vigilance for the safety and well-being o f spectators. This was compounded by a preoccupation with measures
to control hooliganism. Secondly, complacency which led all parties to th in k that since disaster had not
occurred on previous occasions it would not happen this tim e. But there is no point in holding inquiries or
publishing guidance unless the recommendations are followed diligently. T h at must be the first lesson.

ii. “I t Couldn’t Happen H ere”
  24. Amazingly, complacency was still to be found even after Hillsborough. It was chilling to hear the same
refrain from directors at several clubs I visited:-

      “Hillsborough was horrible - but, o f course, it couldn’t have happened here.”

  Couldn’t it? The Hillsborough ground was regarded by many as one o f the best in the country. It was selected



                                                          4
by the FA fo r the C up semi-final and thought by them to be entirely suitable. The identical fixture had passed
o ff uneventfully the previous year. I have little doubt that i f the disaster scenario had been dcscribcd to the
management at Hillsborough prior to 15 A p ril, they too would have said “O f course, it couldn’t happen here” .
Yet something like it had happened at Hillsborough in 1981, albeit w ith less dire results. Moreover. I am
satisfied from eyewitness accounts I have received that there have been many other occasions when
overcrowding has led, at various grounds round the country, to a genuine apprehension o f im pending disaster
through crushing, averted only by good fortune. I have heard from Police Commanders at a number o f the
grounds I have visited how relieved they are that capacities have been reduced in the interests o f safety.

  25. So, although the operational errors on 15 A p ril were special to one ground and one day, the lack o f
precautions against overcrowding was not unique. I do not believe that sufficient safety measures were being
applied at all other grounds. The lesson here is that Hillsborough should not be regarded as a freak occurrence,
incapable o f happening elsewhere. A ll those responsible for certifying, using and supervising sports grounds
should take a hard look at their arrangements and keep doing so. Complacency is the enemy o f safety.

iii. A B light on Football
  26. Footbali is our national game. We gave it to the world. But its image in our country has been much
tarnished. In my In terim Report I concentrated on overcrowding because it was the cause o f the Hillsborough
disaster. But wider and deeper inquiry shows that overcrowding is only one feature amongst a number causing
danger or m arring football as a spectator sport. T h e picture revealed is o f a general malaise or blight over the
game due to a num ber o f factors. Principally these are: old grounds, poor facilities, hooliganism, excessive
drinking and poor leadership. Crowd safety and crowd behaviour with which I am concerned are closely
related to the quality o f the accommodation and facilities offered and to the standards which are encouraged
and enforced. So I th in k it necessary to consider all these aspects.

O ld Grounds
   27. Because we were first into the field, most o f our football grounds are now elderly. Between 1889 and
1910, 58 o f the clubs belonging to the current League moved into the grounds they now occupy.* M any o f
them are ill-placed on cramped sites boxed into residential areas. When they were built, they were not intended
to cater for the stream o f coaches, vans and cars which now arrive and require parking space. Inside the
grounds decay and dilapidation are often extensive. The terrace accommodation, in particular, is often
uncovered and little has been done to improve the layout in accordance with modern expectations. This is
chiefly because the safety and comfort o f those on the terraces has not been regarded as a priority. In fairness,
lim itations o f space at some grounds make it very d ifficu lt to achieve a layout appropriate to present day
needs. By contrast, clubs in Europe and South Am erica have the advantage o f grounds built more recently on
more spacious sites and planned to meet modern conditions. Where improvements have been made to
our grounds they have often been patchy and piecemeal. This approach is itself a threat to safety. To build a
seated stand over a standing area, to enlarge or d ivide a terrace, to rearrange exits and entrances or to modify
turnstile areas - any o f these measures is fraught w ith safety im plications. Yet often such changes have been
made to achieve one purpose without sufficient thought about the adverse side-effects which could result.

   28. This was exem plified by the sequence o f alterations at the Leppings Lane end at Hillsborough. Radial
 fences were installed to divide up the terraces; this led to a reduction in the system o f crush barriers. The area
 inside the turnstiles was altered for purposes o f segregation. O ld signs were not removed; new signs were
 inadequate. The result was a bewildering complex which contributed to the delivery o f excessive numbers
 down the tunnel into pens 3 and 4.

 Poor Facilities
    29 . Football spectators are invited by the clubs for entertainm ent and enjoyment. Often, however, the
 facilities provided fo r them have been lamentable. A part frQm the discomfort o f standing on a terrace exposed
 to the elements, the ordinary provisions to be expected at a place o f entertainment are sometimes not merely
 basic but squalid. A t some grounds the lavatories are p rim itive in design, poorly m aintained and inadequate in
 number. This not only denies the spectator an essential facility he is entitled to expect. It directly lowers
 standards o f conduct. The practice o f urinating against walls or even on the terraces has become endemic and
 is followed by men who would not behave that way elsewhere. The police, who would charge a man for
 urinating in the street, either tolerate it in football grounds or do no more than give a verbal rebuke. Thus
 crowd conduct becomes degraded and other misbehaviour seems less out o f place.

    30. T h e refreshments available to supporters are often lim ite d and o f indifferent quality. They are sold in

 *Inglis: Football G roun ds o f Great Britain p 10



                                                          5
surrounding streets from mobile carts and inside many grounds from other carts or from shoddy sheds. Fans „
eat th eir hamburgers or chips standing outside in all weathers. There is a prevailing-stench o f stewed onions.
Adequate numbers o f bins for rubbish are often not available; so wrappings, containers and detritus are simply
dropped. This inhospitable scene tends to breed bad manners and poor behaviour. T h e atmosphere does not
encourage pride in the ground or consideration for others. I accept that many fans are quite content to eat on
the h oof when visiting a match, but there is no reason why the fare available shouldnot be wholesome, varied
and decently served from clean and attractive outlets. Fast food establishments meeting these requirements
are readily to be found at railway stations and on high streets; why not at football grounds?

   31. A t most grounds little attempt has been made to provide pre-match entertainment. To do so could have
a double advantage. It would give the spectators more value for th eir money. It could also bring them in earlier
thereby avoiding congestion at the turnstiles in the last few minutes before kick-off. Such entertainm ent as has
been tried has mostly failed to appeal to the spectators. They do not seem drawn by the musical offerings o f the
disc jockey or by marching bands. The football supporters’ organisations complain that supporters have not
hitherto been much consulted about this or about anything else affecting their well-being and enjoyment.

  32. In giving this dismal account o f Ihe football scene, I have taken care to use the words “often”, “at most
grounds” or “at many grounds”. I acknowledge that there are notable exceptions where great improvements
have been effected and I do not suggest that every disagreeable feature I have described is to be found at every
ground. Nevertheless, the overall picture o f conditions and facilities to be expected by a standing spectator is
depressing. It is in stark contrast to the different world, only yards away, in the Board Room and the lucrative
executive boxes. I appreciate that they cater for an affluent clientele and bring in much-needed revenue. No
one would expect or indeed want their plush carpeting or haute cuisine when visiting the terraces; but
accommodation and facilities have often been below the basic decent standard necessary to give spectators
dignity let alone comfort.

  33. It is small wonder that attendances at matches gradually fell o ff from a peak o f 77 m illio n in the season
1949/50 to about 20 m illion in the late 1980s. N o doubt other reasons played their part; for example, the
emergence o f other spectator sports and television. U n til the 1960s most men worked on a Saturday morning
and many went straight to the match in the afternoon. But the 5 day week together with increased car
ownership made Saturday outings for the fam ily a popular activity. On top o f these factors, however, the
prospect o f attending football in the conditions I have described clearly became unattractive to many erstwh ile
supporters. Added to this was the fear o f disorder. So far, I have not mentioned the further indignities endured
by supporters as a result o f hooliganism and the measures taken to contain it.

Hooliganism
  34. D urin g the 1970s, hooligan behaviour became a scourge at and around football grounds. Rival fans
abused and fought with each other on the terraces. The pitch was invaded, sometimes to facilitate the fighting,
sometimes in an attem pt to abort a match by those whose team was losing and on occasions to display anger
and seek to assault a referee or a player who had incurred displeasure. Throw ing missiles, either at a player o r a
policeman or at rival fans, became another violent feature. W hen the police responded by searching fans for
missiles on entry, the practice grew o f throwing coins (which could not be confiscated). Sometimes the coins
were sharpened in advance to make them more damaging.

  35. Mass singing o f traditional songs, some o f nation-wide appeal, some local to the area or the club, had
become a part o f the terrace culture. But the repertoire became augmented and degraded by abusive and
obscene chants aimed at the referee or the opposing fans. A further nasty addition was racist chanting aimed at
any black player o f either team.

   36. Hooliganism outside the ground also became rife. Supporters o f rival teams abused and attacked each
other. Hooligan gangs caused damage to trains, to buses, and to property on their route. Some deliberately
went out o f their way to rampage through local shops, stealing, wrecking and intim idating as they went - an
activity known as “steaming”. A fter a match, rival supporters would attack each other on the way home in the
street, in public transport or in public houses.

Segregation
   37. To contain and control these manifold forms o f anti-social and crim inal behaviour there is now an
elaborate complex o f measures. The policy o f segregation was born in the 1970s. Gradually, it has called for
more and more extreme and expensive strategies by the clubs and the police. As each measure taken has been
circumvented by determined hooligans, further measures have had to be grafted on to the system. Witnessing
the full florid exercise taking place every Saturday afternoon nowadays makes one wonder how anyone could
have contemplated going to such lengths to facilitate the watching o f football. But nobody did; itjustgrew .


                                                         6
   38. Clubs have sub-divided th eir grounds to keep rival fans apart by putting fencing and sterile areas
between them , by screening them from inciting each other, by separate entrances and exits and by perimeter
fences round the pitch. M any o f the fences are very high and are crowned with elaborate spikes and barbed
wire, the top sections being inclined inwards to prevent th eir being scaled. A t some grounds a telescopic tunnel
is extended on to the pitch to protect the teams from missiles as they come on or go off.

   39. The police start and finish th eir segregation exercise well away from the ground. Typically, special trains
or coaches carrying the away supporters are m onitored en route. T h e police meet them and escort the fans with
mounted officers, dog handlers and foot officers, ensuring they go only to th eir allotted section o f the ground.
They are searched at the entrance for drink or weapons (as are the home fans). They are then confined in an
area caged by fencing for the duration o f the match. W hen it ends, the away supporters are often held back for a
quarter to h a lf an hour whilst the home supporters are dispersed. They are then escorted away in the same
m anner as they arrived and put back on to their trains or buses. Although the m ain body o f away supporters
can thus be policed as a group, those who arrive independently in cars or vans have freedom o f manoeuvre.
Occasionally trouble makers get into the wrong area and a violent episode occurs. Again, the further away from
the ground the spectators spread, the less the police can do to prevent sporadic confrontations. By and large
however, the police measures have worked, to prevent violent outbursts in and around the ground.

  40. But at what a price! In addition to the poor facilities I described earlier (which are often worse for away
than for home fans) the ordinary law-abiding football supporter travelling away is caught up in a police
operation reminiscent o f a column o f prisoners o f war being marched and detained under guard. I watched the
escort o f Arsenal fans after a match at Stamford Bridge. They were held in the ground for thirty-five minutes
w hile the Chelsea supporters left. They were then escorted by a substantial body o f police to Fulham Broadway
underground station. There, to avoid overcrowding on the platform , they were adm itted to the station only in
measured groups. Special trains were run to take them non-stop into the centre o f the city to avoid clashes at
nearby stations.

   41. Clearly, the police with th eir great experience o f controlling crowds at the ground considered this
strategy was necessary in the present climate. Th eir views were confirm ed in that despite their efficient and
good humoured management o f the match and its afterm ath, scuffles took place when some fans got into the
wrong section o f the ground. M oreover such police practice is not unique to our country. There are sim ilar
hooligan problems for example in H olland. I witnessed a very sim ilar operation carried out by the Dutch
police at Utrecht to control a train load o f supporters from Eindhoven.

  42. Necessary though such operations may presently be, they do nothing to enhance the image o f football as
a spectator sport followed for entertainm ent and pleasure. I know o f no other sport o r entertainment in a
civilised country in which it is necessary to keep those attending from attacking each other.

  43. A part from their im pact on the spectator, operations to control football crowds have other serious
repercussions. T h e cost in money, manpower and disruption is enormous. Last year, the cost o f policing
football in London was some £10 m illion o f which only £1 m illion could be recovered from the clubs.
According to the Football Trust, who meet one third o f the costs o f police charges incurred by clubs at matches
for the Football League, Scottish Football League and G M Vauxhall Conference, the cost to clubs during
 1988/89 was £4.79 m illion. Since this relates only to costs inside grounds which can be recovered by the police,
the total cost to the police service is substantially more. H e r M ajesty’s C h ie f Inspector o f Constabulary for
England and Wales said, in his annual report for 1988, that:-

   “ Football continues to be a focus for hooliganism ... demands on the police service continued at a high level.
   Typically, 5000 officers may be engaged on football duties on Saturdays during the football season.”

   T h e H om e O ffice estimate that the total cost o f deploying these officers is perhaps £200,000 to £300,000
 each football Saturday. A t many League matches, policing requires some 300 officers in the ground with many
 m ore outside and others performing related traffic duties. A t high risk matches, Cup semi-finals and the like,
 even greater numbers are deployed. A t Hillsborough there were 800 officers in and around the ground.
 Obviously officers deployed to football cannot be performing police duties elsewhere. Although many are
 brought in on an overtime basis (at a consequently heavier cost) police commitments to the community
 elsewhere must be affected by the concentration o f such numbers in one place.

   44. W hen upwards o f40,000 converge on a ground in a residential area the effect on the local community is
 very disagreeable. Large numbers o f fans chant in the streets, often offensively. They invade gardens to urinate.
 E m pty cans arid other garbage are dropped in gardens, yards and in the street. Shops may be pillaged. Traffic is



                                                          7
congested or diverted. Streets are filled w ith parked coaches and cars. Side-streets are cordoned o ff by police to
protect residents. Recently, a police cordon was thought necessary at a half m ile radius round Highbury when
Liverpool visited Arsenal. Residents had to establish their identity. The operation was successful in preventing
disorder but the need to conduct such operations and the resultant disruption contributes to the poor image o f
football in the com m unity at large.

What does Segregation Achieve?
  45. Segregation, which is the m ain feature o f present crowd control policy, aims only to contain and control
bad behaviour, not to elim inate it. Indeed, the very fact that rival fans are separated tends to increase and
polarise their hostility to each other. Segregation breeds an “us and them” attitude. The opposing supporters
can be seen as a physically distinct group upon whom animqsity can be focussed. Again, the knowledge that the
“enemy” is physically restrained from violent riposte may encourage baiting and abuse which caution would
otherwise deter. There is force too in the view that i f people are herded and confined as potential offenders,
that concept may in some cases become self-fulfilling. So, although segregation may have appeared the only
way to m aintain the excitement o f the adversarial atmosphere at football grounds whilst keeping the peace, it
merely controlled the symptoms o f hooliganism. T h e disease remained and may even have been intensified by
the segregation. O ther games have not resorted to it. For example, there is no segregation at rugby league
matches although the catchment sections o f population, from which support is drawn both to football and
rugby league, seem similar.

Who are the Hooligans?
   46. In chapter 5 o f his Final Report, M r Justice Popplewell exploded three popular fallacies about
hooliganism. First that it is something new; secondly, that it is only found at soccer matches and thirdly, that it
is a specifically English disease. H e went on to consider the nature o f football hooliganism, the characteristics
o f the hooligan, possible causes o f hooligan behaviour and experience in other countries. I do not propose to
repeat his analysis. N othing has thrown any doubt on it in the four years since he reported although much has
been written by journalists, academics and others. I agree w ith him that there is no simple explanation for all
the m isbehaviour attached to football and there is no single remedy. It is im portant, however, to recognise the
clear distinction between quite different groups o f hooligans.

  47. There are those who misbehave spontaneously in or around the ground in response to some perceived
grievance - a goal against their team, a doubtful decision o f a referee or taunting from others. But there are
other groups who go out bent on causing trouble for its own sake. The latter were described by M r Justice
Popplewell as “ the new hooligans”. Often they hold down good jobs during the week, dress stylishly and detach
themselves from those fans w ith club scarves who travel on official coaches o r trains. They plan their violence
as a recreation in itself to which the football is secondary or a mere background. Unfortunately, these groups
can fom ent trouble and galvanise support from fans who would not otherwise misbehave. Thus the effect o f
the “ new hooligans” can grow out o f proportion to their numbers.

   48. M r Justice Popplewell summarised his conclusions as to the nature and m otivation o f hooligan groups
at paragraph 5.90 o f his Final Report as follows: -

      “I (a) T h at there has always been a group, albeit a small group who fin d violence attractive; who
         currently fin d the football ground a convenient theatre for their violence and the football match the
         occasion for the display o f their aggressive tendencies which on other days and at other times they w ill
         be exhibiting in public houses, the city centre or elsewhere. Th eir m ain target at football grounds is
         opposing fans. They choose to exercise that violence at a football match for a number o f simple
         reasons. The date and place o f a match are fixed; the nature o f the opposition is known; its presence is
         certain, so is that o f the police. T h eir own support is known. Its presence too is certain. The battle lines
         can be drawn. Thus plans can be made well in advance for the particular acts o f violence that they
         intend to create.

         (b) A nd while there is a good deal o f academic support for the view that violence was at one time the
         prerogative o f the so called “rough” working class that is no longer the complete picture today. A
         m ajority o f today’s hooligans no doubt do fit into that category, but some do not. They come from a
         variety o f backgrounds, many have reasonable jobs and earn a proper living.

         (c) W hether they are m otivated by the same reasons as their predecessors can only be a matter o f
         conjecture; there seems little reason however to believe otherwise.

      I I (a) A second group im itates the first element 1 have identified. Thus those not particularly given to
          violence witness violence in others and see it being exercised, w ithout let or hindrance. People expect
          the spectators on the terraces to behave in an aggressive way and to use foul language. It then
          becomes accepted as the norm and thus becomes a part o f the pattern o f life which would not be
          tolerated elsewhere. This knock-on effect can be seen in violence in the streets o f our cities,
          unconnected with football.

          (b) The feeling o f anonym ity in the crowd gives rise to a loss o f inhibition and self-discipline. The
          association with those o f sim ilar disposition, the enthusiasm and the partisan support for the team,
          which itself causes an atmosphere, all create a situation which can readily give rise to violence.

    I I I Then there is a th ird group (not always separate from the other two groups) who cause violence for a
          reason, either real or supposed. It may be an inability quickly to get into the ground: it may be the
          presence o f rival spectators in a part o f the ground to which the fans think they have a claim.

     IV Finally there are those, the vast m ajority o f spectators, who abhor violence and wish only for an
        afternoon o f pleasure at a football m atch.”

   The oral and written evidence I have received, the studies and reports I have read on the subject and my
own observations lead me to agree entirely with that summary. I would add only one further element -
alcohol.

Alcohol
  49. There can be no doubt that an excited and volatile crowd is more d ifficu lt to control and more prone to
disorder i f it includes numbers who have been drinking. D rin k is not a major factor affecting M r Justice
Popplewell’s group I. T h eir violence tends to be planned coldly and soberly. But group I I is often rendered
disorderly and more readily imitates the violence o f others because inhibitions are removed by drink.
Likewise, group I I I responds to a grievance, is readier to take offence and reacts more impulsively and
violently because o f drink.

   50. D rinking before matches increased in parallel with the growth o f hooliganism. Before the 5 day week,
those coming straight from work to the football ground on a Saturday had little tim e to drink excessively.
D uring the 1960s and 1970s young men in their twenties acquired a new affluence and spending on drink
increased. The advent o f the supermarket with an off-licence provided numerous outlets for the sale o f
canned beer; so it became easy to have alcohol at the match and on the way to it, whether the local pubs were
open or not. Finally, apart from tim e and liquor being available, there has developed an attitude to drinking
in the U K not found to the same extent elsewhere - a cult o f drinking to excess. The spectacle o f young fans,
tanked up with beer, whether near our own football grounds or (more damagingly to our reputation abroad)
at foreign football stadia is all too fam iliar. Yet, for example in Italy, the largest wine producing country in
Europe, football fans and indeed people generally do not drin k to get drunk. Although they have their own
brand o f hooliganism (from the “ U ltras” as they are known) alcohol is not a major factor. Here it certainly is
and it remains so despite legislation banning sales or possession o f alcohol in football grounds and the
carrying o f alcohol on public service and hired vehicles bound for such grounds.

Poor Leadership
   51. The hierarchy inside football has a number o f levels over and above the spectators. A t the top is the
national management o f the game. In England the Football Association is responsible for the administration
and welfare o f all football down to the lowliest amateur club and football in schools. The Football League is a
separate body with responsibility for the 92 professional League clubs. In Scotland and Wales there are
equivalent bodies. Below that top management, each o f the League clubs has its own Board o f Directors.
T hen there are the referees, the managers and the players. Finally there are organisations representing the
supporters - the Football Supporters’ Association and the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs.
One would have hoped that the upper echelons in this hierarchy would have taken a lead in securing
reasonable safety and com fort for the spectators and in enforcing good behaviour by precept and example.
Unfortunately, these hopes have not generally been realised and indeed at times poor examples have been set.

   52. The FA and the F L have not seen it as their duty to offer guidance to clubs on safety matters. In their
w ritten submission they said:-

  “O f course, both The FA and The Football League a:re concerned to ensure that crowd safety standards are
  the highest reasonably practicable. It is felt, however, that neither o f these authorities should be charged
  w ith the responsibility o f setting detailed safety standards or enforcing them .”
They have been much concerned to avoid pitch invasions because they interfere with the smooth progress
o f the fixture list and incur criticism and penalties from the European'football authorities. But advice, for
example, as to turnstile lay outs, the division o f viewing areas and, until recently, on ratios o f seating to
standing areas has not been forthcoming. As another specific example, in selecting Hillsborough as th e venue
for the Cup semi-final, the FA did not consider in any depth whether it was suitable for a high risk match with
an attendance o f 54,000 requiring to be segregated, all o f whom were, in effect, away supporters lacking week
in week out knowledge o f the ground. N o special inspection was made; no consultation w ith Sheffield
Wednesday or the local authority took place.

   53. As for the clubs, in some instances it is legitimate to wonder whether the directors are genuinely
interested in the welfare o f their grass-roots supporters. Boardroom struggles fo r power, wheeler-dealing in
the buying and selling o f shares and indeed o f whole clubs sometimes suggest that those involved are more
interested in the personal financial benefits or social status o f being a director than o f directing the clubin the
interests o f its supporter customers. In most commercial enterprises, including the entertainm ent industry,
knowledge o f the customer’s needs, his tastes and his dislikes is essential inform ation in deciding policy and
planning. But, until recently, very few clubs consulted to any significant extent w ith the supporters or their
organisations.

   54. Encouragement and indeed requirement o f good behaviour by the fans should be a prim e aim of club
management. Here again positive leadership has often been lacking and on occasions counter-productive. It
cannot help to promote good behaviour i f a club chairman has his photograph in the programme presenting a
cheque for £750 by way o f recoupment to a club player fined that sum by the FA for misbehaviour on the
pitch. The same applies to another chairman who extended a V IP welcome to home coming “supporters”
convicted o f misbehaviour whilst attending a match in Greece, even i f he was sceptical as to the fairness o f
the crim inal process.

   55. Then there is what happens on the pitch itself. Long departed are C orinthian Casual standards;
accepting decisions o f the referee w ithout demur; affecting a modest diffidence on scoring a sensational goal.
For many years now referees’ decisions have been regularly challenged by spread arms and entreaties; even an
unsensational goal has caused the scorer to be hugged and embraced all the way back to the centre spot. The
cool self-control o f C orinthian Casuals w ill never return. Perhaps we should not lam ent its departure since
there is no harm in a reasonable show o f joy in success. But, more recently, things have gone further. On
scoring a goal a player nowadays often rushes straight towards the perim eter fencing and either affects to
clim b it or, w ith fists raised and shaking, goes on his knees to excite response from supporters. Little has been
done to stop such demonstrations which are calculated to hype up the fans into hysteria.

   56. A t the other extreme from demonstrations o f joy and trium ph, violence on the field o f play by tackles
aim ed at opponents’ legs, stamping, elbowing and holding is commonly to be seen. U n til lately, the FA’s
response to such violence amongst players has been weak. Negligible fines on offenders, w ithout penalty to
the clubs either in fines or loss o f points, have tended to discredit the FA’s discharge o f its disciplinary role. In
the last couple o f months, prompted by a series o f much publicised incidents and by m edia criticism, z firm e r
line has at last been adopted. These incidents have involved violent conduct by players o ff the ball. A t the end
o f the match between N orw ich C ity and Arsenal on 4 November 1989, a num ber o f players on both sides
were involved in an incident when punches were exchanged. The referee said he was not going to make any
report on the matter. The FA in itially announced that i f there was no report from the referee there was
nothing they could do. However, wiser counsels prevailed; officials o f the FA saw the incident on video and
decided to take action. In the result N orw ich C ity were fined £50.000 and Arsenal £20,000. O ther incidents
occurred w ithin days at three other grounds involving violence on the field between players and, in one
instance, managers.

   57. To complete this survey o f the present football malaise, it is necessary to m ention the media. Football
is highly newsworthy. For the W orld Cup, provision is being made at the San Siro stadium, M ila n for no fewer
than 5,000 journalists. In the domestic U K scene, the long haul throughout the season to become League
champions or Cup winners is followed not only by the millions who actually attend matches but by many
m illions more via the m edia. They watch games and listen to the pundits endlessly discussing them on
television; they read about them in the newspapers and they fill in the football pool coupons. So players and
spectators are exposed to constant scrutiny. W hen scuffles or fights occur, whether on the field or on the
terraces, they are inevitably witnessed by m illions and such incidents o f bad behaviour are aggregated into a
reputation tarnishing the national game as a whole. When our supporters go to Europe, they are preceded by
this reputation. It is expected they w ill behave badly, so whether they do so in itia lly or not they are likely to
meet a hostile reception from their counterparts. Thus incidents are provoked and the syndrome continues.


                                                          10
   58.    I have sought in the broadest terms to identify those features which disfigure football today. But
despite them, and despite the decline in attendances from the peak years, the game still commands massive
public support and interest. Indeed, in the last couple o f years there has been some increase in attendances
for reasons to be explored later. After the horror of Hillsborough and the analysis o f football’s troubles which
it has prom pted, the lesson is surely that now is the m om ent for the fullest reassessment of policy for the
game. Accordingly, before considering detailed recom m endations for securing a basic level o f safety and for
improving crowd control, 1 think it appropriate to consider how the low standards described in this chapter
could be raised.




                                                        11
                                                   CHAPTER 2

                                    A BETTER FU T U R E FO R FOOTBALL

  59. It is not enough to aim only at the m inim um measures necessary for safety. T hat has been, at best, the
approach in the past and too often not even that standard has been achieved. W hat is required is the vision
and imagination to achieve a new ethos for football. G rounds should be upgraded. A ttitudes should be more
welcoming. The aim should be to provide more m odern and comfortable accom m odation, better and more
varied facilities, more consultation with the supporters and more positive leadership. If such a policy is
implemented it will not only improve safety. There will also be an improvement in behaviour, making crowd
control easier.

   60. At some clubs changes have already been m ade towards realising this new concept o f how football
should be. For example, at Ibrox Park, scene o f the appalling disaster in 1971, there has been a total
transformation. The old m ain stand remains and still has some standing areas in front o f it. But three new
stands have been built round the rest of the ground. They are colourful, convenient and are all-seating. They
are constructed so as to provide a covered concourse at first floor level running the length o f the stand. At the
rear of that concourse throughout its length are m odern lavatories for both sexes. At the front are attractive
fast food service points offering a good range o f food and drinks (but no alcohol). The walls are clean; the
flooring is of studded rubber. M ounted overhead, at regular intervals of a few yards along the whole
concourse, are television sets tuned to a sports programme giving information on the day’s fixtures, excerpts
from previous matches and general sports coverage. These arrangements encourage fans to arrive in good
time, to have wholesome refreshments in a clean and pleasant setting, to enjoy on the television the kind of
pre-match entertainm ent which genuinely interests them, to visit a decent toilet, and then to walk: up a few
steps to take their seats for the match. All o f this is under cover and it is enjoyed not just by the affluent but by
the ordinary supporter. Significantly, the facilities are not abused. Occasional graffiti do appear but are
wiped away promptly and the overall impression is that if spectators are offered civilised conditions they
come to respect them.

All-Seating
  61. There is no panacea which will achieve total safety and cure all problems o f behaviour and crowd
control. But I am satisfied that seating does more to achieve those objectives than any other single measure.

  62. It is obvious that sitting for the duration o f the match is more comfortable than standing. It is also
safer. When a spectator is seated he has his own small piece of territory in which he can feel reasonably
secure. He will not be in close physical contact with those around him. He will not be jostled or moved about
by swaying or surging. Small o r infirm or elderly men and women as well as young children are not buffeted,
smothered or unsighted by larger and more robust people as on the terraces. The seated spectator is not
subject to pressure o f num bers behind or around him during the match. He will not be painfully bent double
over a crush barrier. Those m onitoring num bers will know exactly how many are there without having to
count them in or assess the density by visual impression. There will still, o f course, be scope for crowd
pressure on stairways whilst entering and especially when leaving, but involuntary and uncontrolled crowd
movements occasioned by incidents in the game are effectively eliminated.

   63. It is true that at m om ents o f excitement seated spectators do, and may be expected to, rise from their
seats. But the m om ent passes and they sit down again. I also recognise that seating is only regarded as more
comfortable than standing if cover is provided. The consensus is that, although standing on a n exposed
terrace on a wet day is disagreeable, sitting in the rain is worse. So, increased seating does require that cover
be provided.

  64. Apart from comfort and safety, seating has distinct advantages in achieving crowd control. It is
possible to have disturbances in a seated area and they have occurred, but with the assistance of CCTV the
police can immediately zoom in with a camera an d pinpoint the seats occupied by the trouble-makers as well
as the trouble-makers themselves. Moreover, if num bered tickets are issued to named purchasers, the police
have a further aid to identifying miscreants.

  65. Numbered tickets matching num bered seats also help to identify forgeries. Forged tickets for standing
areas may not be discovered. In the past, they simply led to inflated num bers on the terraces at all-ticket
matches. But there can only be one valid ticket for each numbered seat and the existence o f a forgery is
immediately exposed.


                                                          12
  66. The evidence I have received has been overwhelmingly in favour of more seating accom m odation. At
present, the ratio throughout the 92 League clubs in England and Wales is about two thirds standing to one
third seated. But whilst most are in favour o f reversing that ratio, there are those who wish to retain a
proportion o f standing room. Amongst them are the FA and the football supporters' organisations.
Essentially they deploy three arguments.

  67. The first is an em otional one based on a desire to retain the traditional culture derived from th e close
contact of the terraces. “ My grandfather stood here; my father stood here with me; why shouldn’t 1 stand here
with my son?” is a com m only expressed view. Moreover, to many young men the camaraderie of singing
together, jum ping up and down, responding in unison to the nam ing of the players, their emergence on to the
pitch, the scoring o f a goal, an unpopular decision - all of these are an integral part o f enjoying the match.
They like being part o f an am orphous seething crowd and do not wish to have each his own place in a seat.

  68. The second argum ent is that conversion to all-seating will reduce the num bers o f fans who can be
adm itted to the ground; so, many would-be spectators will be disappointed. This assumes a significantly
greater density being perm itted for standing places than for seating. It also assumes that the size o f present
crowds regularly exceeds projected all-seated capacity. But the FA’s own evidence showed that during the
1988/89 season the num ber of occasions when attendances at League clubs exceeded projected all-seater
capacity ranged from nil to 16. The 16 attendances were at Liverpool, who have accepted the need for
all-seating. For only three clubs in the first and second divisions did the attendance exceed the projected
all-seated capacity on more than 10 occasions, and for 21 out o f 44 clubs in these two divisions the
attendance never exceeded the projected all-seated capacity. In only one case (Liverpool) was the average
attendance during the season in excess of the projected all-seated capacity.

  69. Finally, cost. Spectators do not want to pay and, it is argued, many could not pay the substantially
higher price o f a seat as against the cost o f standing.

  70. I am not convinced that the cherished culture o f the terraces is wholly lost when fans are seated.
Watching the m ore boisterous and demonstrative sections at all-seater grounds, 1 have noted no absence of
concerted singing, chanting, clapping or gesticulating in unison. The com m unal spirit is still there an d finds
ready expression. To such extent as the seating limits togetherness o r prevents movement, that price is surely
worth paying for the benefits in safety and control.

   71. Moreover, the maxim um density which experience now shows to be acceptable in standing areas tends
to take the force out o f the first two arguments. If standing density is little more than seating density, the
melded mass previously found on terraces becomes more diffuse and the intensity of the togetherness
becomes little greater standing than sitting. Likewise, at such a density, the difference between the admissible
num bers standing and sitting become marginal. It can be m ade up by having two or more tiers o f seating
where previously there was only one tier o f standing.

   72. As to cost, clubs may well wish to charge somewhat more for seats than for standing but it should be
 possible to plan a price structure which suits the cheapest seats to the pockets o f those presently paying to
 stand. At Ibrox, for example, seating is £6, standing £4 - not a prohibitive price or differential.

 The Trend in the UK
    73. The superior safety o f seating has already persuaded a num ber o f clubs in the U K to convert their
 terraces to seating either totally o r predominantly. Following Hillsborough, Liverpool have announced their
 intention to adapt their famous Kop to seating. In Scotland, Aberdeen’s ground at Pittodrie became all-seater
 in 1978; Clydebank followed suit; St Johnstone’s new ground at Perth is all-seated. Wembley stadium will
 early in 1990 accom m odate 80,000 spectators, all-seated. >

   74. Those opposed to all-seating point out that previous attem pts to introduce it have met with spectator
 resistance. Coventry City was the first English club to install seating throughout its ground in 1981. In 1983
 the club reverted to allowing 2,000 to stand. In 1985, after visiting fans o f Manchester City tore up seats and
 used them as missiles, the ground reverted-to standing. Q ueen’s Park Rangers also moved towards all-seated
 accom m odation bu t removed some seats under pressure from supporters.

   75. Since then, however, Hillsborough has happened; thinking has changed; responsible comment by
 government, football authorities and media has prepared the way for change. Moreover, there are now seats
 available which cannot be manually torn and used as missiles. Those at Utrecht, for example, have
 survived intact for seven years despite usage and deliberate experimental tests of their strength.
   76. It is possible that in the early stages o f conversion there may be instances o f fans standing on the seats
or in front o f them because they are used to standing or in order to register a protest, b u f i am satisfied th a t in
England and Wales as in Scotland and abroad spectators will become accustomed and educated to sitting.
The evidence I have received shows that more recently, where seating has been installed, the fans have come
to accept and like it. At Ibrox Park, for example, the seated areas are the most popular and tickets for them
sell in preference to those for standing. Significantly, trouble from misbehaviour and-physical injuries have
been reduced since most of the crowd became seated. Such trouble and accidental injuries as still occur are
primarily in the remaining standing areas. It is planned to convert them to seating in the near future.

Sir Norman Chester Centre Research
  77. The Sir N orm an Chester Centre for Football Res'earch, attached to the University o f Leicester, is
funded by the Football Trust. In November 1989 the Centre undertook a survey o f registered members of the
Football Supporters’ Association to discover the views o f committed football fans on a num ber of the issues
after Hillsborough which are covered in my Report. The extension of seating was one such issue. Num erous
questions were asked on a num ber o f different hypotheses. The Report states that substantial majorities in
the sample were in favour of m aintaining the status quo on the seats/terraces balance at their own clubs.
However, the Report continues:

  “ 53.6% claimed they would actually support the drive for more seating (sic) if they were reasonably priced
  and covered. The addition o f these last two points - concessions on price and cover - also seemed to have
  dram atic effects in reducing levels o f opposition to the prospects o f all-seated facilities as we shall see
  later”.

W hen all-seating was put to the sample there was a m ajority against it, but the Report goes on:

  “ Finally, and perhaps significantly, opposition in our sample to the introduction of all-seated facilities
  diminishes considerably when one introduces provisos on price and protection from the elements. W hen
  this is done, more people in our sample support all-seaters than oppose them .”

Europe
  78. The trend towards seating is even stronger in Europe and is now being driven by decrees o f both
national and European football authorities.

   79. In Italy the imminence of the 1990 World Cup competition has forced the pace o f progress. The Italian
Ministry o f the Interior decreed on 25 August 1989 that for open air facilities w ith a capacity o f more than
10,000 spectators at football games and for covered ones with a capacity o f more than 4,000 spectators no
standing will be allowed after 30 April 1990. Those facilities must have only num bered seats each not less
than 0.45 metres wide. The San Siro stadium in Milan will by then seat 85,000 spectators; the Olimpico
stadium in Rome will seat 87.000.

  80. In Holland, Utrecht’s ground built in 1982 has seating for 12,000 and standing room for 8,000. The
club already intended to convert the latter to seating. However, on 6 December 1989 the D utch equivalent of
the FA (the KNVB) agreed with the D utch clubs to cut the standing capacity of football grounds by 10% each
year over the next decade so as to render football stadia in the Netherlands in effect all-seater at the end o f the
1990s.

  81. In following this phasing Holland's policy is in accord with a resolution presently under consideration
by UEFA (U nion des Associations Europeennes de Football). The resolution proposes that for the 1990/91
season only 80% o f the standing tickets may be sold, that figure to be reduced every season by 10% until 1999.

   82. FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association) passed a resolution on 26 July 1989
providing that as from the preliminary com petition for the 1994 World Cup (starting in autum n 1992)
“ matches may in principle only be played in all-seater stadia” . The resolution went on “as from 1993 it will
be the duty o f the Confederations and National Associations to hold high-risk matches in their zones only in
all-seater stadia." High-risk matches are defined under UEFA Regulations as follows:

      “ 1 All UEFA final and semi-final ties of the UEFA club competitions as well as final tournam ent
          matches o f the European Football Cham pionship.             \’

      11 W hen declared as such by UEFA on the basis of previous incidents o f supporters of one or both
         team s or of other exceptional considerations.
     III W hen it is expected that visiting team supporters will exceed 10% o f stadium capacity or will exceed
         3,000 persons.

     IV W hen full capacity stadium is expected or m ore than 50,000 spectators present.

     V W hen the m atch is likely to attract a large num ber of emigrants/foreign workers originating from the
       country of the visiting team, who live either in the country where the m atch is being played or in
       neighbouring countries.”

   Thus world and European football authorities are clearly determ ined to enforce the conversion o f stadia to
all-seating, so far as international matches and other matches under their control are concerned. It is true that
their resolutions will not be binding in regard to League or dom estic football matches. But they are a pointer
in the direction o f safety and control and as such have been emulated by Italy and Holland domestically.

  83. Furtherm ore, I am told by the FA that they regard themselves as duty bound to follow, in the domestic
football scene, any Resolution passed by FIFA although strictly such Resolution is binding only in
international m atches o r matches between U K clubs and clubs from abroad. Thus, the FA regard the
Resolution o f 26 July 1989 as effective in relation to the League, Cup and other domestic fixtures from 1993
onwards. The Resolution does not force clubs to install all-seating as a condition o f staging high-risk matches.
There is still the option to use only those parts o f the ground which have seating. Clearly, unless these are
substantial, attendance will be much reduced. One would therefore expect the m ajor clubs to adapt their
grounds to accom m odate the m axim um seating they can manage by the time the Resolution takes effect.
Smaller and m ore im pecunious clubs may prefer to postpone conversion. However, if a small club with little
seating accom m odation draws a large first division club at hom e in the Cup in 1993 (a high-risk match) it will
be able only to use its limited seating accom m odation or the game will have to be played at a better equipped
ground elsewhere.

The Football Spectators Act 1989
  84. The intention to follow this same trend was stated by your predecessor, M r Douglas Hurd, in a
statem ent to the H ouse o f Commons two days after Hillsborough. He added:-

  “T his would involve the disappearance o f terraces at (major) grounds. It might also involve am endm ents
  to strengthen the Football Spectators Bill so that its provisions for the licensing o f grounds matched this
  concept”.

  In the event, m achinery for implementing increased seating is to be found in section 11 o f the 1989 Act.
There, provision is m ade for the Football Licensing A uthority (set up under section 8) to be directed by the
Secretary o f State to include in any licence to adm it spectators a condition imposing requirements as respects
the seating o f spectators at designated football m atches at the premises; “and it shall be the duty of the
authority to comply with the direction”.

Association Football only or Designated Grounds?
   85. In considering seating and standing, I have concentrated so far on association football because it
attracts the largest and most volatile crowds and has been troubled with misbehaviour. But should
recom m endations about seating be confined to association football or should they go further? Wherever a
line is drawn com plaint may be m ade that it is illogical, but two possibilities seem more logical than most;
cith er to confine recom m endations to the 92 clubs in the Football League or to apply them to grounds
designated under the 1975 Act as amended. The latter course would include a num ber of Rugby League,
Rugby Union and cricket grounds. I acknowledge that so {ar, happily, misbehaviour at those grounds has
been m inim al. However, even leaving aside possible misbehaviour, where there are large numbers there is a
risk o f overcrowding. A well attended Rugby m atch of either code may attract numbers in excess of those
attending many Football League matches. There would seem little reason for requiring a fourth division
League club to convert to seating whilst permitting m ajor Rugby clubs to keep their terraces indefinitely.

    86. O n the other hand, proposals for all-seating would clearly be inappropriate in relation to sports events
 at which spectators are accustomed, and should be entitled, to move about. For example, at horserace
 meetings, spectators may wish to view horses in the paddock, place bets, view races from different vantage
 points an d enjoy the other facilities o f what is a social occasion as well as a sports event. O ther examples of
 events at which spectators move about and should be free to do so are greyhound racing and golf
 tournam ents.


                                                         15
   87. T he criteria for designating a sports ground under the 1975 Act as am ended are laid down in section
i(i);

  “T he Secretary o f State may by order designate as a sports ground requiring a certificate un d er this Act (in
  this Act referred to as a “safety certificate”) any sports ground which in his opinion has accom m odation for
  more than 10,000 spectators.”

  Section 1(1 )(A) permits the Secretary of State to substitute such other num ber as he considers appropriate
for the num ber 10,000.

   88. Clearly the purpose o f such designation is to-bring safety of grounds with capacity for substantial
num bers under the control o f the local authority. Whilst some grounds with a capacity o f more than 10,000
may currently have an average attendance of only say 3,000, there is always the prospect o f a visit from a large
club, an attractive Cup draw, or an upturn in fortunes bringing in larger crowds. Safety provisions m ust be
capable o f coping with such events. Indeed, danger is more likely to result if there is an occasional match with
a large attendance than if such matches were regular since those controlling it and those attending it will be
inexperienced.

   89. For these reasons, I think recom m endations to increase seating should be applied to all designated
grounds. I appreciate that the machinery provided in section 11 o f the Football Spectators Act 1 989 can be
used only to regulate the extension o f seating at association football grounds. However, the Secretary o f State
has power under section 6(2) o f the 1975 Act, as amended, to provide for securing safety by regulations and
may prescribe term s and conditions to be inserted in Safety Certificates under section 15A as indicated in the
next chapter. These powers could be used, even,without the provision in section 11 o f the 1989 Act, to
prescribe m andatory rules about seating. So, by, a combination of his 1989 Act powers and his 1975 Act
powers or solely by exercising the latter, the Secretary o f State can require the progressive extension o f seating
at designated grounds.

  90. 1 therefore conclude and recommend that designated grounds under the 1975 Act should be required in
due course to be converted to all-seating. I do so for the compelling reasons o f safety and control already set
out; also, so far as association football is concerned, because the present trend at hom e and abroad and the
rules o f the world and European football authorities make the move to all-seating irresistible.

Phasing
  91. Unless some time factors are specified, progress towards all-seating may well be protracted. This is
recognised in the phasing proposed in the UEFA Resolution quoted above and in the m achinery set up in
section 11 of the Football Spectators Act 1989.

  92. For high-risk association football matches I welcome and endorse the adoption by the FA of the FIFA
Resolution requiring no standing tickets to be sold after 1993 and its application to domestic fixtures.

   93. As to other matches, I consider that without the impetus locally of the World Cup, which is the spur
for speedy change in Italy, and having regard to the present state o f our grounds, it would be asking too m uch
to require conversion in the U K in the next two o r three years. For all grounds designated under the 1975 Act
except for first division and second division League grounds, and national stadia, 1 think a timing along the
lines suggested in the Resolution under consideration by UEFA (and now adopted in Holland) is reasonable ie
th a t standing tickets should be reduced by 10% per year starting with a 10% deduction effective from August
1990 and so be phased out by August 1999.

   94. However, 1 recommend that grounds in the first and second divisions of the League and national stadia
should be all-seated by the start of the 1994/1995 season. It is at those grounds that the larger crowds attend
and, in the interests o f both safety and crowd control, I consider they should have seating for all spectators in
five years rather than ten years. The reduction in standing tickets should therefore be at 20% per annum from
August 1990 and be complete by August 1994. Any club promoted to the second division of the League should be
given a reasonable period in which to comply. A similar approach should be adopted in Scotland.

Planning Ground Improvements
   95. Increased seating and other ground improvements will require expert planning and much finance. As
to planning, it is crucial that before clubs embark upon major work, they should have the best information
and advice on modern ground design. Conversion to seating cannot necessarily be achieved merely by fixing
seating onto existing terraces. For example, sight-lines. access to seats, gangways, roof cover and other factors


                                                          16
may require m ore extensive changes to the layout. Some clubs may be able wholly to redevelop their existing
grounds; others may be limited by space, finance o r crowd needs to more modest alterations. In some
instances, the best course would be to move to a new site either alone or in conjunction with another club.
Ultimate decisions on these options must be for the club management. No doubt, some of the bigger clubs
will be able to engage the foremost contractors in this field to advise them and carry out the work. But even
for them , and certainly for the lesser clubs, it would be of great value to have a body fully apprised o f the latest
developments in ground design, capable of giving expert advice on possible schemes and on ways and means
o f achieving them.

An Advisory Design Council
  96. I therefore support the suggestion of Professor M aunder’s Technical Working Party that there should be
established an Advisory Design Council to fulfil this role. It should, in my view, be set up by the FA and the FL
whose functions should include offering a service of this kind to the clubs. By way o f analogy, in Italy this
function is exercised by the Com itato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano (CONI). After studying many grounds,
including those in M adrid. Vienna and Athens. CO NI produced an excellent pam phlet on “Design Criteria
for Safe Comfortable and Large Sports Facilities" supported by detailed studies showing how they can be
achieved. These, together with models which may be inspected at C O N I’s headquarters in Rome, show how a
m odern stadium can be designed from car park to pitch so as to secure safety and crowd control.

Research
  97. It has come to my attention only recently that the Sports Council published in 1981 a “Handbook of
Sport and Recreational Building Design”, and in 1989, a work entitled “Arenas, a Planning, Design and
Management G uide” . The 1981 work included, in volume three, studies on outdoor sports stadia. The 1989
work concentrated on indoor stadia. It seems that neither of these works was sent to the FA or the FL, nor
have they acquired them. Again, in July 1986, the Institution of Structural Engineers formed an ad hoc
com m ittee “to bring together all current technical knowledge relevant to the appraisal o f sports grounds and
their individual elements. The committee’s task was to establish a fully referenced body of knowledge within
three years which would be com plem entary to the ‘G uide to Safety at Sports G rounds’.” The ad hoc
com m ittee has prepared a fifth draft o f its report which will be finalised after the recommendations in my
Report have been considered.

    98. It is highly desirable that such worthwhile research as I have mentioned should all be brought together
 to achieve m axim um benefit. W ith a formidable building and conversion programme for football grounds
 ahead, an Advisory Design Council set up by the FA and FL could make the best use of all available research
 here and abroad to assist and advise clubs.

 Finance
    99. The scale o f the changes I recom m end will necessarily require heavy expenditure, albeit over an
 extended period. It is not my function to make detailed proposals for financing the work. T hat is for football
 m anagem ent and essentially for the clubs. However, lest it be thought that I have m ade proposals regardless
 o f feasible funding, I ought to indicate sources and methods o f finance which should make the improvements
 practicable, and some of the fiscal arguments which have been addressed to me.

 The Football Trust (FT) and the Football Grounds Improvement Trust (FGIT)
     100. Assistance in financing safety measures is presently available from the FT and the FGIT. The former
 is funded by the three m ajor pools companies (Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters) from the “Spot the Ball”
 C om petition, at the rate of 21% of turnover, yielding over £9 million a year. T he total given to British football
 since 1958 now approaches £120 million. T he Trustees are empowered to use their funds to promote
 m easures for the control or suppression o f unruly behaviour in relation to football; to assist clubs to meet the
 obligations o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975; to lm p ro v e grounds and facilities for those who play
 a n d watch the game and for any other purpose they consider to be a benefit to the game of football in Great
 Britain and N orthern Ireland. The FT allocates just over half its income (ie over £4.5 million) to assisting
 expenditure by League clubs on ground safety and improvements. This is done through the FGIT, a second
 independent trust. The FG IT was established in 1975, the arrangements being modified later in 1979 when
 th e FT was brought into being.

     101. Although it helps to fund m any other works, from those at international grounds down to those at the
 lowliest clubs, the Trust continues to give first priority to assisting expenditure essential to the grant of a
 Safety Certificate for a designated ground. U nder its trust deed, the FGIT is able to make grants of up to 75%
 o f the total cost available to clubs carrying out work as a necessary condition of their being given a Safety


                                                            17
Certificate under the 1975 Act. Accordingly, should my recommendation o f m andatory increases in seating
be m ade a condition o f the Safety Certificate, the work would be eligible for a grant from the FGIT.

    102. However, even at £4.5 million a year, the FG IT fund would be insufficient. A dditional financial
requirem ents fell upon the League clubs on the im plem entation o f the 1975 Act and still m ore after the fire at
Bradford City’s ground in May 1985. By February 1988 over £37 million had been paid out in grants.
Pressures on finance led to the suspension of improvement grants in June 1987. The FGIT was able to
reintroduce improvement grant aid on a limited basis during the closed season o f 1988. However, the range
o f works required to upgrade the League grounds inevitably means that resources o f the F G IT would be
spread quite thinly. They will not be sufficient to finance the kind o f improvements I have suggested, but the
Trust provides a structure for doing so. By way o f example, Sheffield Wednesday received a grant o f £595,000
for the im provem ent o f the Kop end at Hillsborough. This was in addition to some £431,000 given to the club
for a total o f 21 safety projects between September 1978 and October 1988. Even so, funds o f this order will
be insufficient to build new all-seated stands. How then, can additional revenue be generated?

Fiscal Considerations                            v
   103. Three arguments have been addressed to me by the football authorities suggesting alterations in tax
structure to make funds available for ground improvements. Fiscal policy is for government and ultimately
Parliam ent to decide, not for a judge. All I can usefully do is to set out the arguments.

  (a) VAT on the Spot the Ball Competition
   104. T he Football Trust have suggested that if VAT were abolished on receipts from this competition,
some £5 to £6 million would be available. This would am ount to a direct subsidy from the Treasury. It would
be contrary as I understand it not only to present government thinking but to long established principles o f
fiscal policy. If th at is so, a different and perhaps more propitious approach would be for the FA to urge the
Pool Prom oters Association (PPA) to increase their contribution as part o f a strategy to ensure the healthy
developm ent o f the game from which the PPA makes its money.

  (b) Pool Betting Tax
   105. A second case made by the FA is for a reduction in Pool Betting Tax now standing at 42.5%. The
suggestion is a reduction to 40% which would yield some £ 16 million. This, it is said, could be passed o n to
assist ground improvements in one o f two ways: either the Government could continue to tax pool betting at
the current level but make a donation to football equivalent to 2.5% of the tax recovered, o r it could reduce
the tax rate to 40% on the strict understanding that present proposals as to how any reduction o f the 42.5%
might be used were am ended to allow football to derive the entire benefit from the money thus saved by the
pool companies.

   106. T he FA seek to support their argument by reference to the structure o f tax on horse racing. They
claim the com parison shows football to be unfairly treated. In horse racing, the duty on off-course betting is
8%; on-course betting is not now taxed. There is a Horserace Betting Levy which goes to the improvement
and m aintenance o f race courses. However, the comparison between football pools and racing is not o f like
with like. The relationship o f stakes to winnings is different. T he Football League presently receives £14
million a year from the PPA for the use of its fixture list. There is no payment sim ilar to this in racing. Nor is
there an equivalent in racing to the Football Trust or the FGIT. The Horserace Betting Levy is essentially
based on voluntary agreement and is not regarded by the Treasury as a tax. There could be no basis fo ra levy
on football pools unless there were agreement between the PPA and the Football League.

   107. For these amongst other reasons, the racing analogy may not add weight to the FA’s argument on pool
betting tax. However, apart from that analogy, the FA subm it there is a strong case for some reduction o f the
42.5% tax. The Chester Report of 1968 recommended the establishment o f a football levy. The Rothschild
Royal Com m ission on Gam bling recommended in 1977 a reduction in the pool betting tax from the level at
th at tim e of 40% to 37% to establish a levy board. The FA and the FL do not favour the creation o f a football
levy board. They consider that the Football Trust and the FGIT are appropriate bodies to receive and
adm inister any money accruing to football were a reduction made in the pool betting tax. I can only say that
the case fo r a m odest reduction in the pool betting tax which convinced the Rothschild Commission in 1977
is arguably stronger now that the rate stands at 42.5%. It must in general be for com m ercial undertakings to
be self-financing. This applies throughout the entertainm ent industry o f which football clubs are a part. The
football authorities appreciate and accept that they m ust find the necessary funding substantially from their
own resources. Nevertheless, if grounds all over the country are to be upgraded and in some instances
re-located so as to achieve safety for spectators, improvement in the quality of life for residents near grounds
ing          and a reduction in the expensive policc com m itm ent to controlling matches, it can be argued there is a case
             for financial assistance, if not by direct subsidy then by some tax reduction.

rial            108. W hether or not the FA’s argument for tax reduction finds favour, there may well be scope for
: at         reassessing and possibly increasing the contribution made by pools to football. It would not m atter whether
 lis.        such contribution is to be by voluntary levy, by an increase in the present percentage rate on receipts from the
: to         Spot the Ball Com petition or by increasing the am ount paid for the use o f the fixture list.

                110. W hen asked why they seem ready and able to spend large sums, sometimes into millions o f pounds,
             for a single player in preference to spending money on improving their grounds, the clubs usually give two
             reasons.

tax             111. First, the attendance and satisfaction o f their supporters depends essentially on success; so buying a
:ely         brilliant player has priority overground improvement.

             Transfer Fees
                112. They say the popular perception o f transfer fees as excessive and extravagant is mistaken. The
on,          money, I was told again and again, simply circulates round the League clubs. It is calculated to bring on
uld          budding players. The level o f payments is high, but it is forced up by prices continental clubs with huge
5 of
             financial backing (like Juventus from Fiat) are able to pay.
the
thy             113. The “circulation” argument runs like this. First division club A buys an ace player for £1 million
             from club B. This enables club B to buy three players at, say, £250,000 each from three other clubs. C, D and
             E. Clubs C, D and E each buy two up-and-coming but not yet arrived players from lesser clubs for perhaps
             £ 100,000 each. So the process and the prices continue downwards eventually enabling the poorer clubs to
Hie          keep going by cashing in on players they have trained from scratch. Meanwhile, to finance their £1 million
1 to         purchase, club A may sell two or three players who are past their best to lower division ciubs. This analysis
gat          may well have some validity, but there are notable exceptions. For example, when a French club bought a
uce-         player from an English club for over £4 million the money had not been circulating round the League clubs.
5%
the          A Levy on Transfer Fees?
                114. Even if the “ circulation” argument has some validity, the fact remains th at transfer fees have reached
             a level which many regard as grotesque and certainly out o f all proportion to the am ounts spent on ground
 hey         improvement. There is a case for the football authorities imposing a levy on such fees, the proceeds going to
 gis         the FG IT to fund ground improvements. I suggest consideration be given to this.

 likei   )
              Tax “Anomaly”
 £14
 >ris            1 15. Secondly (and this is the tax argument) football clubs have a strong fiscal inducem ent to spend on
 ally         players rather than ground improvements. Payments for players are allowable revenue expenditure.
 evy          Improvements to the ground are not. In Brown (Inspector o f taxes) v Burnley Football and Athletic Company
              Ltd 1983 AER 244, it was held that expenditure on a new stand to replace an old unsafe one did not qualify as
              an allowable deduction whether as a repair or as provision o f plant. It is arguable that a fiscal provision which      J
ool           penalises the redevelopment of grounds whilst encouraging the paym ent o f huge transfer fees is an anomaly,
the           th a t it sends the wrong signals to clubs, and that it encourages them to neglect questions o f safety in favour o f   ,
did           prom oting success on the field. To accede to this argument might fall foul o f the maxim that hard cases make          |
              bad law. But as a m atter o f policy, it is argued that the encouragement o f expenditure on ground
1at
oall          improvements by a fiscal concession may well bear re-examination.

=hat          Club Financing
)11              116. W hatever may come from the Pool Promoters Association via the two Trusts, or from any tax
 s to         concession, in the end the bulk o f the finances for ground improvement m ust be raised by the clubs
The           themselves. Here, clubs are at a disadvantage compared with their European counterparts. On the continent
lieir         m ost grounds are owned by local authorities which lease them to the clubs. They are regarded as providing a
jces          com m unal facility and often the stadium is available for a variety o f sports and other functions; sports
              facilities and offices are built into the stadium complex.


                                                                       19
   117. Nevertheless, there are ways of financing improvements if the club managem ent is enterprising and
resourceful. Sponsorship is one. Presently it brings £17.5 million into football annually. Advertising on
electric score boards and on hoardings round the ground as well as on tickets, programmes and membership
cards is another. Associated companies marketing sports wear and other merchandise with the club’s logo,
the sale o f television rights, the issue o f debentures, and the sale o f shares to the public'are other methods
which can be and have been used. In particular, I would expect the football authorities to seek the highest,
possible price for television rights. U nder current contractual arrangements, the Football Association
receives some £6 million pa from the sale o f television rights for domestic broadcasts, o f which some £2.5
million is distributed to clubs. They also receive between £0.75 million and £1 million for the sale o f                  j
television rights overseas. Separate arrangements apply at Wembley. The Football League contracted some                   ^
two years ago to sell the television rights for League matches for £ 11 million, linked to the Retail Price Index.
T he television companies know that football on the screen has a vast following. They should be expected to               ‘
pay a substantial price for the rights to relay popular matches. For their part, the football authorities should
ensure that this valuable source o f revenue is directed towards improving stadia as a high priority.                     >

   118. The cost o f covered seating throughout the 92 clubs in the Football League has been investigated by
the FA. W hilst the assessment can only be a rough estim ate and is subject to fluctuations due to inflation and          j
other factors, the consultants suggested that to install seating throughout all the grounds might cost about £30
million. To provide cover over all those areas could cost a further £100 million. It should be noted, however,            *
that no breakdown o f that figure is given. Moreover, it assumes “all existing uncovered standing capacity                r
should become covered”. Given current attendances, it would seem unnecessary th at all that capacity should               *
be covered. In many instances, attendances are always well below the permitted capacity o f the ground. In
those cases, a much smaller scale solution involving the rebuilding or redevelopment o f only part o f the
ground would be sufficient. There would be little point in providing covered seating accom m odation                      j
throughout a ground if there is no realistic possibility o f more than half of it being used. Costs may therefore

  119. At m ajor grounds where substantial resources can be generated, vast improvements can be m ade on                  j
existing sites if there is sufficient space. I have seen a num ber o f imaginative examples o f ground                    {

  developed areas and replacing the facility on the urban periphery. The Council believes that opportunities              t*

   121. 1 was impressed by the way this had been done at three particular grounds. At St Johnstone in                     W
Scotland, the solution has been to involve private capital directly. The ASDA superm arket chain bought the               &
site o f the old St Johnstone Football Club in the centre of Perth, redeveloped it as a supermarket, and built
the club a brand new all-seated stadium for 10,000 spectators on the outskirts o f the town. T he site was, in            ^
effect, donated by a local farmer. It is close to a motorway exit and provides for extensive car parks. I accept
that this confluence o f factors might not be easy to reproduce elsewhere. In particular, land prices in some             tf*
areas would be prohibitive and planning permission very difficult to obtain. A greenfield site is likely to be in         of
a conservation or green belt area and the choice o f sites is limited by the need to make the ground accessible           eo
to townsfolk albeit outside the town.                                                                             Su

   122. I saw two examples abroad where these problems had been tackled resolutely. At U trecht an old
stadium on the outskirts o f the town was totally redeveloped on the same site ostensibly at nil cost. The
contracting company which rebuilt the stadium (Ballast Nedam ) is now in consultation with 11 clubs in
England and Scotland with a view to building similar projects in partnership with the Football Association


                                                        20
         and British Aerospace o f which it is a subsidiary. Their concept involves the recognition that in the past, for
and
         all but a handful o f days in the year, a stadium complex has usually and wastefully lain deserted. At Utrccht
; on
         the stadium is owned by the municipality. The space underneath the stands and in the corncrs o f the ground
sh ip
         has been developed to provide accom m odation for commercial use. The rent provides the municipality with
ogo,
         sports accom m odation which pays for itself. Some 6.000 square metres o f com m ercial working areas and
 lods
         24.000 square metres o f commercial offices have been incorporated into the complex. The commercial uses
 hest
         of this accom m odation include office accommodation, snack bars, sports facilities, photocopying and office
tion
         equipment services, a driving school and a hairdresser. The large parking area is used except on m atch days
 £2.5
         as a “park and ride” facility for those working in the more congested areas o f the city. The advantages for
,e o f
         business are that shops and offices enjoy a prestigious high profile address with all necessary services and
pme
         facilities. For the community, the commercial stadium serves as an arena both for trade and recreation.

         Nimes
            123. The stadium a t Nimes in Southern France is also owned by the municipality . It was built recently on
d by
         the outskirts o f the town with extensive parking and good access to road com m unications. The cost was some
 and
         £17 million o f which £16 million came from the municipality itself. The justification for this expenditure o f
 £30
         public funds is the belief that the stadium is a communal asset. It provides not only a stadium for football or
:ver,
         rugby but an extensive range o f other sports facilities built into the complex. These include a gymnastic hall
icity
         capablc of hosting international matches, an “om nisport” hall for tennis, basket-ball and volley-ball, a judo

         hall, facilities for fencing and billiards, and a large exhibition hall which, at the tim e o f our visit, had just

            124. All these three stadia are on a comparatively small scale. St Johnstone seats 10,000. Utrecht
         accommodates 20,000 and N im es about 2 8 ,0 0 0 .1 accept that in the current financial climate and with our
         different approach to communal funding, local authorities are unlikely to be able to provide subsidies for
         such stadia, although local authorities do subsidize, for example, swimming baths, theatres and other leisure
e on     facilities which may serve fewer o f their citizens. However, clubs which wish to move from centre town sites
>und     to new sites on the outskirts of town may well be able to find a purchaser as St Johnstone did with ASDA.
brd,     Likewise, those who wish either to build a new stadium on the outskirts or to redevelop their stadium in town
         may be able to do so in a way which incorporates space for commercial lettings.

: car        125. In such situations, although the local authority may be unable to assist with finance, it could play a
They     useful role in bringing parties together and as planning authority. It could take a favourable view, for
         example, of a planning application which involved the provision not only o f a com m unal sports stadium but
         o f further facilities, whether for sport or otherwise, benefitting the community as a whole. There has recently
i (of    been a num ber o f attempts by clubs to find greenfield sites for new grounds only to be turned down at each
tsely    attem pt on planning grounds. Clearly, an application for a football ground in a conservation area or green
ities    belt poses planning problems. But, although the protection o f such areas is an im portant principle, two other
  thf    considerations may also carry weight. First, that the quality o f life o f residents living adjacent to a football
high     ground in a town would be much improved by resiting it elsewhere. Secondly, that if we want safety and
         improved standards at grounds there are some clubs which will need a new site at which to achieve them. To
         this end, local authorities should surely give what assistance they properly can. One useful example o f the
         m utual assistance which a club and a local authority can give each other is an agreement m ade between
lie in   Millwall and the London Borough o f Lewisham. The latter agreed to pay £70,000 a year to the club which for
[t the   its part agreed inter alia to make the ground available for various activities beneficial to the local community.
 )uilt
 s, in    Ground Sharing
 cept         126. W hether or not income-earning facilities are incorporated into a sports ground, it seems uneconomic
 ome      that the stadium itself should be used by only one club, in effect once a fortnight. The cost to each club both
 pe in    o f upgrading or building a stadium and o f maintaining it could be halved if sensible sharing arrangements
 sible    could be made. But there is resistance to this. A num ber o f cities have two clubs, each with its own ground.
          Such is local rivalry that the idea o f ground sharing seems anathem a to many. Yet, faced with the expense o f
          seating and ground improvement, it would make financial sense. Opposition to sharing an entirely new
          ground may be marginally less than to one club sharing another’s existing ground. Recently M r Peter
i old     Robinson, C hief Executive o f Liverpool FC, was quoted as saying:
 The
            “ If someone,were to build a high-quality stadium on Merseyside, we and Everton would be quite happy to
bs in
            share it - even though the idea might not appeal to the fans at first” .
Ution

                                                                  21
  If two clubs could sell their inner city grounds with planning permission, the resultant capital would go a
long way to building a modern shared stadium on a more suitable site. '                  —

  127. It works abroad. AC Milan and Inter Milan share the San Siro stadium. In Turin, Juventus and
Torino also share. Genova and Sam pdoria provide a third example.

  128. As long ago as 1981, in the Sports Council’s H andbook o f Sports and Recreational Building Design,
Volume Three (O utdoor Sports), ground-sharing was considered in a technical study o f stadia. The author,
M r Faulkner Brown, wrote at page 24:-

  “Several courses would appear to be open to football clubs. One is that they might rationalise their position
  and, wherever possible, jointly use a single stadium . This could happen at Sheffield, N ottingham and
  Bristol. Fulham could move in with Chelsea and Brentford with Queen’s Park Rangers. Inter-Milan and
  AC Milan, for all their deep rivalry, do live happily enough together in the giant San Siro stadium. The
  British clubs could all retain their identity, halve th eir overheads and realise handsomely the value of their
  freehold properties, if they could cope with their fiercely held views o f club individuality and club pride.

    A nother alternative would be, where possible, for clubs to offer unused land adjacent to the stadium for
  development and, in realising the assets from the land, to plough them back into the cost o f stadium
  reconstruction. This, of course, has happened at L ord’s and is having some noticeable effects at the Oval
  and in other county cricket grounds.

    A further alternative is to build additional sports facilities alongside the stadium , not necessarily in
  emulation o f the ancient Greek example (but nevertheless there is a parallel), so that a large num ber of
  sports clubs could use all the facilities. This scheme has been developed to some extent both in the United
  States and on the continent.”

Super-Stadia
  129. So far, I have referred only to club grounds. But there is a case for having a small num ber of
super-stadia capable o f accommodating very large crowds for international matches or m ajor Cup ties. At
present, the only such stadium in the U K is Wembley which will accommodate 80,000 all-seated. Like
Wembley, any other stadia o f large capacity could be available not only for football but for other sports, for
pop concerts and other large events.

   130. A consortium comprising British Aerospace, the FA and Ballast N edam (who built the U trecht
stadium) is presently considering the building o f a new national stadium at Birmingham to accommodate
100,000. There is a suggestion that this project, if carried through, would provide a replacement for
Wembley. However, it may well be that there is room for both. This would give a venue in London and a
venue in the Midlands for major events. H am pden Park has served as Scotland’s international football
ground for many years and when planned improvements are complete it should continue to do so. It is
arguable that one more large stadium may be required in the north o f England but the upgrading o f a ground
such as Old Trafford might well suffice to achieve this purpose.

 Leadership and Example
    131. I turn from stadia and money to one aspect o f football which gives wide scope for improvement at
 very little cost. Much is written about the m isbehaviour o f spectators; but m isbehaviour is often imitative.
 Hooligans in the crowd find others who will copy them. Similarly, incitement from the pitch or bad
 behaviour by players has a malign influence on the crowd. For many fervent followers, the men on the pitch
 are heroes to be revered and emulated. After a goal, when the scorer demonstrates to the fans behind the
 fencing, the resultant surge forward and hysteria is bad for safety and bad for crowd control. It should not
 occur. Worse still, when players fight, the fans follow suit. Lest anyone doubt this, the recent examples o f
 fighting between players bear it out. In two o f the four incidents in November 1989, crowd misbehaviour
 resulted directly from fighting between players. At Highbury, fans came out on to the pitch to join in. At
 Upton Park, scuffles between W imbledon and West H am players provoked surging, fighting and coin
 throwing on the terraces.

    132. It is in the first instance up to the players themselves, then the referees, the managers and the club
 directors to stop both incitement and violence by players whether on or off the ball. The referees, managers
 and directors have power to do this. If and when they fail to use it, the FA must take a firm disciplinary line
 using their very full powers to fine those involved including the clubs and to penalise the clubs in points. If all
 else fails, there is no reason why violence on the pitch should have any immunity from the law o f the land or
 from police action.
go a        133. On the positive side, management could do much to create a better atm osphere in the grounds by
         •.vhat they say and what they write in programmes and magazines. By consulting with supporters they could
         cniist the goodwill an d help of the decent majority to isolate and rebuff m isbehaviour from the minority
 and     raihcr than imitate it. A campaign for better behaviour could be launched by the clubs through their
         literature and backed by managers and players using their popular hero appeal.

            134. I should add that violence on the pitch is not confined to soccer. There has been a growing incidence
         of stampings and punchings in Rugby U nion games even at the highest level. Reaction from referees, clubs
         and even international selectors has tended to play such incidents down. Although spectator behaviour has
         not. as yet, been adversely affected by such incidents, the authorities ought to deal firmly with them before
         that happens and in any event, simply because violence should be put down.

         Family and Membership Areas
            135. Much progress has been m ade at a num ber of clubs recently in bringing women and children back to
         watching football by creating separate family areas. Similarly, partial membership schemes have enabled
         clubs to reserve parts of the ground exclusively to members. This has had the dual advantage o f creating areas
i for    of reliable good behaviour and offering discounts, favourable travel facilities and other benefits to members.
lium     The good behaviour depends on those who pay for membership being more likely to be responsible and upon
3val     their risking loss o f m em bership if they transgress.

            136. At a num ber o f grounds, family areas have been de-segregated in the sense that families drawn from
y Hi     away supporters have been perm itted to share family areas with home supporters. I have already indicated
;r of    how segregation has tended to worsen hostility between rival fans. It is difficult once segregation has been
lited    practised to dispense with it, certainly at a stroke. These joint family areas may prove to be the first step in a
         retreat from segregation. If the process can be extended gradually to allowing members o f the visiting club to
         share the mem bership area o f the hom e club, useful progress will have been made. It will be m ade easier if
         there is seating rather than standing.
r of
   At    The Disabled
Like        137. I received evidence from the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (RADAR) and the
, for    Access Com m ittee for England drawing attention to the opportunity which redevelopment of grounds
         presents to make better provision for disabled people. Many clubs already make provision for the disabled
         but this is by no means universal. Particular attention is needed to the provision o f safe and adequately
,echt    spacious viewing areas for wheelchair users, with a seat alongside for a companion, protected from the
 date    weather, accessible to toilet facilities designed specifically for the disabled, and easily reached from a car park
   for   (with reserved car spaces for Orange Badge holders) by means of ramps. The needs of other disabled people -
 id a    those who have difficulty walking, the partially sighted, and those with impaired hearing - require special
 ;ball   attention, for example by the provision o f handrails, clear signposts, steps painted in bright colours, and the
 It is   use of electronic scoreboards to supplement loudspeaker announcements, if these people are to be able to
 und     attend sporting events enjoyably and safely. I endorse the importance attached to these suggestions and I
         hope that the comprehensive improvements which I am proposing will include careful attention to them.
         Clubs should regard them as integral to their planning, not as an optional extra.

                                                   CHAPTER 3

                                              THE FRAMEWORK

Minimum Standards of Safety
   139. It is a truism that safety and crowd control are inter-dependent. If a crowd gets out o f control safety
will be in jeopardy. Measures to control the crowd, such as fencing, almost always have an impact on safety.
Nevertheless, I shall seek to treat each separately. In this Part I shall deal with managem ent and features of
the ground affecting safety.

    140. I have already stressed the need for football management to give higher priority to the safety and
well-being o f spectators. Clearly, the cost o f safety measures and improvements can m ore easily be borne or
raised by the successful clubs than by those struggling to keep going. But the safety of spectators in-vited to a
ground cannot be left to depend upon the affluence o f the club. There must be prescribed m inim um
requirem ents which have to be fulfilled at any ground if spectators are to be adm itted there. The evidence of
practice pre-Hillsborough and indeed post-Hillsborough, right up to D ecem ber 1989, convinces me that the
provisions presently in place, statutory and otherwise, have not been strong enough to enforce that basic level
o f safety.

Legislation for Safety
   141. T he principal instruments aimed at achieving a framework for safety are the Safety of Sports
G rounds Act 1975 as am ended by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 and the Home Office
G uide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Green Guide); '

    142. The 1975 Act, as amended, requires a Safety Certificate to be issued by the local authority in respect
o f designated sports grounds. It is an offence (Section 12( 1)(d)) to contravene any term or condition o f the
Certificate. Thus the requirements of the Certificate are mandatory but what those requirements should be is
in the discretion of the local authority.

   143. Section 2(1) o f the 1975 Act provides:-

  “ A safety certificate shall contain such terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or
  expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in use for the specified activity or activities,
  and the term s and conditions may be such as to involve alterations or additions to the stadium .”

   144. Originally, certain obligatory terms had to be inserted in Safety Certificates. Section 2(2) provided:-

   “ W ithout prejudice to subsection (1) above, a safety certificate -

     (a) shall specify the m axim um num ber of spectators to be adm itted to the stadium;

     (b) may specify the maximum num ber to be adm itted to different parts o f it; and

     (c) shall include terms and conditions:-

         (i) as to the number, size and situation of entrances to and exits from the stadium o r any part o f it
         (including means o f escape in case o f fire or other emergency) and the means o f access to any such
         entrances or exits;

         (ii) requiring those entrances, exits and means of access to be properly m aintained and kept free
         from obstruction; and

         (iii) as to the number, strength and situation o f any crush barriers.”

    However, when the Fire Safety and Safety of Places ofSport Act 1987 extended the application o f the 1975
 Act from sports stadia to all sports grounds, there was substituted for section 2(2). by section 19 o f the 1987
 Act. a new section 2(2) and a new section 15 A giving power to the Secretary o f State by order to lay down what
 term s and conditions a Safety Certificate shall include. No order has yet been made but guidance from the
 H om e Office has recommended local authorities to approach their function under section 2( 1) in accordance
 with the criteria in the superseded section 2(2). (See Home Office Circular 71/1987 dated 25 November
  1987. Annex A. paragraph 6.)


                                                          24
             145.    So. presently, local authorities are not bound to include terms or conditions on any particular aspect
          of safety in the Certificate. In practice, they no doubt follow the Home Office guidance. They also take
          account of the Green Guide.

          Green Guide
            146. The latter, however, is by way o f guidance only. It provides as follows:-

            “6. Deviations from individual guidelines are possible without necessarily detracting from the overall
fety
            safely of the ground. The variety of type, function and layout of sports grounds and the inter-relationship
fety.
            o f the different parts of them means that a flexible approach should be m aintained to take account of the
:s of
            particular circumstances at individual grounds” .

 and        Such flexibility is obviously highly desirable in relation to some aspects of the guidance. But flexibility can
!e or     bccome degraded. W here a local authority has chosen to incorporate the criteria o f the Green Guide into a
  to a    Safety Certificate there has been scope for considerable deviation from provisions which ought to com m and
 mm       standard adherence. Thus, for example, at Hillsborough where the Safety Certificate required compliance
 :e o f   with certain Green G uide recom m endations and a departure was shown to have occurred, the defence was
 ; the    that the Guide expressly provided for flexibility so that a deviation from its provisions was a m atter o f
 evel     legitimate discretion.

             147. In view o f this and evidence I have received suggesting that the Green Guide may not be followed as
          closcly as is desirable, I consider that when it is revised it needs to be given more effect. At present there is a
          risk o f slackness developing in the absence o f any m andatory provisions. There would appear to be two
iorts
          alternative courses open. It would be possible to make the term s o f the Green Guide m andatory throughout.
ffice
          However, I think that this could be too rigid and in relation to some peripheral matters impractical. The other
          course is to make some of its provisions obligatory inclusions in the Safety Certificate. I prefer this.
pect
             148. There are some requirements of such crucial importance to safety that it should be mandatory for
f the
          Safety Certificates to specify them. I consider those specified in the original section 2(2) of the 1975 Act fall
aeis
          into this category. Moreover, so far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned “shall” should be substituted
          for “ may”. This is critical to ensuring that no discrete area becomes overcrowded.

             149. Accordingly, I recommend that the Secretary of State exercise his specific powers under section 15A
y or      or his general powers under section 6(2) by order or regulation to achieve this. In specifying the requirements
 ties,    m the Certificate, for a particular ground, the local authority should follow the Green Guide criteria: but
          once that is done and the appropriate figures and term s for that ground have been decided no room should be
          left for flexibility. By the stage when the local authority has specified the requirements in the Certificate,
i:-       flexibility has been exhausted.

             150. Where a local authority incorporates any other provision of the Green Guide into the Safety
          Certificate it should make it clear whether th at provision is to be complied with absolutely or with
          discretionary flexibility. For example, paragraph 88 o f the Green Guide provides that a ram p subject to
          heavy crowd flow should preferably not exceed a gradient o f 1 in 10. Should a local authority require in a
          Safety Certificate that a club comply with a Green Guide recommendation as to gradients it should make
          cfcar whether it restricts gradients to a maxim um o f 1 in 10 o r whether it leaves flexibility to the discretion o f
          the club.
o f it
such         151. In putting the responsibility for the Safety Certificate upon the local authority, Parliament no doubt
           had two sound reasons; first, since all sports grounds differ in their layout and environs, local knowledge
           ought sensibly to be utilised in laying down and m onitoring terms and conditions; secondly, a local body can
  free     respond quickly to any problem which may arise. Nevertheless, there are two aspects o f such local
           adm inistration which can cause problems.

              (i) The Advisory Group
4975           152. The issue, review and enforcem ent o f Safety Certificates should be based upon efficient professional
1987       inspection and opinion and should be conducted in a businesslike manner. In Sheffield, the Safety
.vhat      Certificate procedure both for Hillsborough and for Sheffield U nited’s ground at Bramall Lane was
i the      unsatisfactory as I indicated in paragraphs 150 to 158 of my Interim Report. I hope that this was exceptional.
ance       It is important that there should be a safety team consisting of appropriate members of the local authority’s own
fnber      staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services and of the building authority. W hat name
           is given to this group does not in the end matter. At Sheffield it began by being called the Officer Working Party.


                                                                    25
W hen Sheffield City Council took over from South Yorkshire County Council, the name was changed to the
“Safety of Sports G rounds Advisory G roup” , or the Advisory G roup for short. In my interim
recom m endations (N um ber 17) I said an Advisory G roup should be set up. I had in m ind the type of safety
team already referred to. Apparently, in some quarters, it was thought that I was suggesting a second body
called an Advisory G roup to advise the safety team. This was not so. Also, in that recom m endation, I
suggested that representatives o f the club and o f a recognised supporters’ club should be members o f the
Advisory Group. I have reconsidered this in the light o f evidence and advice received. The responsibility for
the Safety Certificate is exclusively that o f the local authority. I therefore think that the correct course is that
representatives of the club and of a recognised supporters’ organisation should be consulted, since they may
have relevant suggestions or criticisms to make, b ut they should not be full members o f the team.

  153. I repeat my recommendation that the Advisory'Group’s terms of reference should encompass all
matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and attendance at matches.
There should be a chairman from the local authority, and an effective procedure. Resolutions should be recorded
and regular written reports should be required for consideration by the local authority.

  (ii ) A Review Body
   154. The other disadvantage o f Safety Certificates being issued locally is that different standards m ay be
applied by different authorities even in practically identical situations. A safety team, or some very
influential m em ber o f it, may be much stricter in one place than the comparable authority elsewhere. I have
had complaints that since Hillsborough measures appropriate to a larger ground have been rigidly and
inappropriately enforced at grounds with negligible attendance. Conversely, it is possible that too indulgent
o r lax an approach may be adopted or develop in a particular locality. Again, simply left to solve their own
problems, there would be little opportunity for local authorities to learn from comparison with solutions
adopted elsewhere. In these circumstances, it has been suggested that there should be a N ational Forum in
which local authority teams could meet periodically to discuss and compare their procedures, and that there
should be a national overseeing and inspecting body to m onitor and review the consistent discharge by local
authorities o f their certificating duties. Having discussed this with local authority representatives b oth in
England and in Scotland I am satisfied that two approaches are not necessary. The better course is to have a
National Inspectorate and Review Body. This is now provided for in the Football Spectators Act 1989 by section
13. It is there laid down that the Football Licensing Authority shall have the function of keeping under review
the discharge by local authorities of their functions under the 1975 Act. The FLA may, having consulted the
local authority and certain local officers, require terms and conditions to be included in any Safety
Certificate. T he section empowers any inspector appointed by the FLA to make inspections and inquiry as
necessary. T he local authority may by notice be required to furnish the FLA with information regarding its
discharge o f its 1975 Act functions.

   155. I warmly welcome the appointment of a national body to conduct these inspecting and reviewing
functions. Assuming it successfully discharges those functions, the effect should be to improve the efficiency
and consistency o f practice with regard to the issue and review o f Safety Certificates. This would be enhanced
if the review body were to circulate, to all local authorities from time to time, advice based upon their
experience o f problems and solutions at various grounds. (See also Recommendation 16 o f the report o f the
Technical Working Party at Appendix 3).

   156. Because the Football Spectators Act 1989 applies only to association football, the inspecting and
reviewing role of the FLA would be exercisable only in relation to Safety Certificates at football grounds.
Nevertheless, this remit of the FLA should be extended to cover all grounds designated under the 1975 Act and
indeed all grounds requiring Safety Certificates or licences under Parts III and IV of the 1987 Act. Should Part
I of the 1989 Act either not be implemented or be substantially delayed, the same functions should be given to
another suitably constituted body to cover all sports grounds.

   157. It has been suggested that the Health and Safety Executive could fulfil this function if necessary or
indeed that it could m onitor spectator safety under the provisions of the Health and Safety at Work Etc Act
1974. However, its resources would need to be increased. Moreover, until now the Health and Safety
Executive, being primarily concerned with the safety of employees pursuant to the 1974 Act, has not
extended its surveillance to include spectators at football grounds. The Home Office evidence on this point is
as follows:

   “The Health and Safety at Work Act could also be used to enforce general spectator safety at sports grounds.
   Section 3 o f the Act is wide ranging in that it places a duty on an employer to conduct his undertaking in
   such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment who may be
   affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their health or safety. A sports or other entertainm ent


                                                          26
“undertaking” would fall within this category. However, it is the stated policy o f the Health and Safety
Com m ission that, as a general principle, they and the Executive wish to avoid duplication o f enforcement
with other authorities. The HSE would not therefore generally attempt to enforce the requirements o f
Section 3 o f the 1974 Act when they overlap with duties im posed by other more specific legislation where
o ther authorities have responsibility for policy and enforcement. The Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 197 5
represents more specific legislation and the Health and Safety Executive does not enforce Section 3 o f the
1974 Act to secure the safety o f spectators at sports grounds. This arrangement is agreed between the
Health and Safety Executive and the Home Office.”
                                                     CHAPTER4

                                          SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS

    158. H aving considered the framework for safety provided by the statutory provisions and the Green
  Guide, I m ust now deal with certain key substantive provisions.

  Capacity
     159. I accept the Technical Working Party’s statement that “the safe allowable capacity o f any viewing
  area whether seated or standing is the least o f (i) its holding capacity, (ii) the num ber o f persons who can leave
  through a norm al exit system within a prescribed time at the end o f an event, (iii) the num ber o f persons who
  can leave through an emergency exit system within a prescribed time and (iv) the num ber o f persons who can
  be adm itted through the turnstiles serving that area within one hour.” The “prescribed tim e” for normal exit
  is said in paragraph 230 o f the G uide to be 8 minutes. The “prescribed tim e” for emergency exit is not
  definitively fixed in the G uide as it will vary from area to area. It will need to be determ ined by the local
  authority on advice from the Advisory G roup and especially the fire service.

    160. Subject to factors (ii), (iii) and (iv), where there is a properly designed seating area, capacity is simply
  determ ined by the num ber of seats. Increasingly, therefore, problems o f m axim um capacity will fade out as
  seating is phased in. But, as long as we have standing areas, grounds will be vulnerable to overcrowding and
  m aximum limits must be set and achieved.

     161. T he G reen G uide provides in paragraphs 221 and 222 fo ra maximum density o f 54 persons per lOsq
  metres assuming a terrace o r viewing slope in good condition. For some reason, not easy to understand, the
  G uide also provides the lower figure o f 27 persons per, 10 sq metres when the slope or terrace “materially
  deviates from the recom m ended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
  packed” . This might be taken to imply that whatever the hazards there is no need to reduce capacity below
  27. In the heading to C hapter 16, the Green G uide emphasises that “account should be taken of the features
  of the individual ground, its configuration, general condition, use and any deviations from the Guide’s
  provisions.”

     162. It becam e clear from evidence before me at both stages o f this Inquiry that not only was the
  m aximum o f 54 per 10 sq metres grossly exceeded at Hillsborough; insufficient was being done generally to
  ensure either by counting o r by inform ed assessment that the Green G uide criteria were observed.
  Accordingly, I reaffirmed the advice in the G uide arid recom m ended that a reduction o f 15% be m ade as an
  interim measure to improve the safety margin. The question now is what should be the final recommendation
  on this difficult subject.

     163. I entirely agree with the Technical Working Party that there is no benefit to be gained from retaining
I the lower figure o f 27 or any other m inim um figure. Indeed, it could be a dangerous suggestion. T he scale of
I permissible density should be from 0 up to the maximum figure applicable only in good conditions. 1 note
  the Technical W orking Party’s view that “ a uniformly distributed density of 5.4/m2 should be safe in static
  conditions in full compliance with the Green Guide". However, the words in italics are crucial to their -view.
  It is one thing to place 54 docile people evenly in an area o f 10 sq metres on a terrace and say they should be
  safe. It is quite another if they are excited, if they sway or surge to and fro, if one end o f the area is a better
  viewing point than the other and if account is taken o f possible incidents in the crowd eg a scuffle or a
  firework. Any o f those factors can cause bunching; bunching can quickly become crushing.

     164. Most clubs have responsibly applied the recom m ended 15% reduction. Some have jibbed at it;
   understandably, in view o f its im pact on revenue. On the other hand, as I have already observed, some Police
   Com m anders expressed relief that nuriibers have been reduced. I must also point out that, even whilst the
   reduction has been in force, events have shown how easy it is for crushing to occur.

      165. At the start o f the 1989/90 season, on 19 August, Coventry were at home to Everton. There were
   complaints afterwards o f congestion and crushing before the m atch outside the turnstiles an d after the match
   as spectators pressed to get out.

      166. Even more worrying was an incident on 9 D ecem ber at Ayresome Park when Middlesbrough were at
   home to Leeds. I have not conducted a full inquiry into the incident having no rem it to do so. But I have
   received a full report from the police. I have also viewed m ore than once a video film o f what happened. It
   was horribly reminiscent o f Hillsborough.
             167. The following facts are clear. Leeds supporters had been allocated, as a standing area, a wedge-shaped
          pen “ D" at the south east corner o f the ground. It was flanked by a narrow sterile area on each side. There was
          a broad gangway running from top to bottom o f pen “D ”. The perimeter fencing at the front o f the pen was
          topped with spikes. There was not a single gate to the pitch. The only way out for those at the front was by a
          gate at each side into the sterile area and thence through another gate to the pitch. Those gates were elosed
          during the match. The capacity o f the pen in accordance with my interim recommendation was 2108. Leeds
          vupporters were adm itted to the pen, families with very young children being put at the front. The gangway
          was not kept clear. Some Leeds supporters managed to get tickets for the opposite home end o f the ground
          causing apprehension of trouble. A num ber of them were taken out and moved into pen “D ” from the pitch
          side. O ther Leeds fans with tickets for the wrong end were also allowed into pen “D ” from the back. Shortly
          after the match started, there was distress am ong those at the front o f the pen. After two surges down part of
          the pen where there were no barriers from front to back, the police had to assist in getting spectators,
          csjx'cially children, out of the pen. This was done principally over the fencing although the side gates were
          opened and shut a num ber of times. In the event, 14 people had to be treated for m inor injuries in the
          am bulance room. Five spectators, three o f them children aged 10, 11 and 12, were taken to hospital with
          chest injuries, lacerations and bruising.

             168. The local authority, the police and the club were clearly shocked by this incident and have taken
          prom pt remedial action. Additional crush barriers are to be installed, additional gates are to be provided
          including one for pen D, the capacity o f that pen is to be halved. Admission to all parts o f the ground, save the
          \ isitors' section (pen D), is to be for m em bers only to prevent away supporters buying tickets for the home
          end. Finally, there is to be a phased program m e which will extend seating to all spectators by 1991/1992.

 0 sq       169. This incident and its afterm ath prom pt the query: does there have to be a disaster or near-disaster at
, the     cach ground to trigger radical action? I hope not.
ially
>sely         170. The perm itted capacity o f the pen was exceeded, although it is not clear to what extent. The police
elow      v icw is that it was only by about 60 persons. In a sense, the smaller the excess the more the point is made that
:ures     danger can occur very quickly on a standing terrace even with moderate numbers. Some argue that reducing
ide’s     num bers and giving spectators m ore room simply enables a surge to gather greater m om entum ; that the
          tighter people are packed together the less the scope for surging or misbehaviour. This was the philosophy
          which allowed excessive numbers to be packed into pens prior to Hillsborough. The only sensible conclusion
 ; the    it that unless both numbers and terrace layouts are strictly controlled, there will always be a risk of crushing
,ly to    on a standing terrace. The com bination o f numbers, excitement and partisanship, even leaving aside
 ved.     misbehaviour, has a potential for danger.
 is an
 ition       171. Com parison with criteria adopted abroad is instructive. France and Belgium adopt the Green G uide
          figure o f 5.4/m2. But in Holland, the m axim um standing capacity is 4/m 2. In Italy, the rule varies between
          municipalities. In Milan the figure is 2/m 2. In Rome it is 4 /m 2. But in Italy little difference is recognised in
ning      principle between the figures permissible for standing and those for sitting.
ile of
             172. Weighing all these factors I do not think it would be right to recommend a substantial departure from
note
          the ctTcct o f the 15% interim reduction. Now, rather than take a figure and deduct a percentage from it, what
tatic
          h required is a specific figure for maximum standing density when terrace conditions are good by Green Guide
 /ie\v.
          criteria. I recommend that that figure should be 47 per 10 sq metres and I would substitute 47 for the figure of
Id be
          54 in the Green Guide. The effect is approxim ately a 13% rather than a 15% reduction from the former figure
jetter
          o f 54. I wish to stress as forcefully as I can, however, that this figure is a maximum and it is for the local
  or a
          authority acting on the recommendation of its Advisory Group to make necessary and realistic reductions from
          (hat figure in respect of any feature of the terrace which deviates significantly from Green Guide criteria or has
it it;    say other significant shortcoming.

t the
              173. It is no use fixing a m axim um capacity for a pen or enclosure unless there are reliable means of
           ensuring it is not exceeded. I therefore repeat my recommendation that the number of spectators entering each
were       self-contained pen or other standing area must be limited electronically, mechanically, by a ticketing
atch       arrangement, by counting or otherwise. The best arrangement is one which makes all facilities for a single
           viewing area self-contained; access should be through turnstiles solely serving that area via a concourse doing
           likewise with its own toilets and refreshment points. This point has already been clearly made in paragraphs
re at      ! 01 and 206 o f the Green G uide:-
have
             “ Each section should ideally be self-contained and should be serviced by its own entrance/exits,
:d. It
             refreshment facilities and to ile ts. . . ”


                                                                   29
  That way the num bers can be accurately recorded at the turnstiles on entry and no extra spectators can get
into the area from elsewhere at half-time or after visiting common toilets o f snack-bars.

  174. Arrangements must be made to close off further access to each pen or area when maximum capacity is
about to be reached and to close the turnstiles leading to the relevant area.

Gangways
  175. The G reen G uide, in paragraphs 97 to 99, makes recom m endations as to gangways as follows:-

  “Spectators should be discouraged from standing in lateral gangways because this disrupts free movement
  about the ground (or within sections o f it). Also, spectators on the terrace steps behind the gangway may
  have their view obstructed, which will cause them to stretch and strain, and so generate dangerous
  pressures within the crowd. Spectators would be discouraged from standing in these gangways if they were
  sunk from 100mm to 200mm and if crush barriers were provided behind but not immediately in front of
  them.

    Similarly, spectators should be discouraged from standing in radial gangways. These are relatively long
  and uncontrolled downward paths through terraces, and are difficult to keep clear, especially when sited in
  popular viewing areas, eg behind the goal area at a football ground. It is helpful to sink them 150mm to
  200m m and to interrupt an otherwise continuously descending gangway by turns along, say, lateral
  gangways.

    W here sinking gangways, lateral or radial, is not thought to be practical, their boundaries should be
  highlighted with paint and spectators advised by signs not to stand there. Stewards may be needed to
  enforce this instruction.”                          /


   176. In my view these provisions need to be much tougher. I agree with the Technical Working Party that
gangways should be kept clear. There is no point in having them, in calling them gangways and in excluding
them from the area used to calculate capacity under paragraph 221 if spectators are allowed to stand in them.
The whole point o f crush barriers on terraces is to prevent unrestrained movement o f large masses o f fans
from back to front down the terrace. It they are allowed to stand in the gangways where there are no barriers,
such movement can occur without inhibition. The incident at Ayresome Park on 9 Decem ber 1989 involved
just that. Two surges causing crushing against the fence came down the terrace unrestrained by barriers.

   177. Whilst paragraph 98 o f the Guide notes the difficulty of keeping radial gangways clear, it can be done.
One way is to fix a radial rail on each side o f the gangway and parallel to it, inhibiting lateral m ovem ent into
the gangway from the standing areas. Another surprisingly effective m ethod which 1 saw used successfully by
Millwall is to put red and white tapes in the same position to indicate the gangway as a no-go area for
standing.

  178. Gangways should be painted in a conspicuous colour (yellow is used most commonly) whether they are
sunk or not. The Safety Certificate should require that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they be
painted.

Fencing
   179. Perhaps the most emotive and disputed topic in this field is what should be done about perimeter
fences. They were installed at many grounds to prevent pitch invasions during th e 1970s. After Hillsborough
there was a strong clam our to take them down. Some clubs did. W ithin weeks o f Hillsborough, however, there
were unruly incidents involving pitch invasions at m ore than one ground, as I noted in paragraph 308 o f my
Interim Report. I deferred making any interim recom m endation involving structural alterations at the
interim stage, confining myself to saying that gates to the pitch ought to be kept fully open.

   180. Since then, whilst visiting grounds. I have seen a full range o f practices from one extreme to the other.
There is no consensus. At some grounds eg Highbury, there have never been perim eter fences. At others, like
Anfield and W hite H art Lane, there were fences but they have been taken down. At other grounds the fences
vary in height and design. Some are fearsome high structures with florid arrangements o f spikes, redolent o f
medieval weaponry. They look more suited to a prison than a sports ground. Com ing down the scale, there
are high fences with only vertical spikes and lower fences without spikes; fences o f wire mesh and fences of
strong metal; fences with a good provision of gates directly to the pitch, fences with only one gate per large
pen (like Hillsborough), and some with no gate at all (as in pen D at Ayresome Park). Again, some clubs have
left their gates to the pitch fully open as I recommended. Some have taken the gates out and left blank spaces;
» m c have opened the gates but put red and white tape across the gap; others have kept the gates open during
the match, but closed them towards its conclusion to stop pitch invasions at the final whistle. Others again
have kept the gates closed and bolted but m anned individually. At Millwall’s ground, an effective procedure
t% followed before each match whereby it is announced over the public address system that stewards will
dem onstrate the gates affording escape to the pitch. The stewards then do so in the m anner of an air
stewardess dem onstrating emergency procedures. The gates are then closed to, but not locked,

   181. This wide variety o f practices is surprising. If a club were concerned only with its own supporters,
divcrgcnce o f practice would be readily understandable. Club A might say: “O ur supporters can be trusted
not to invade the pitch; so no fencing”. Club B might say; “Some of our supporters have shown that given the
chance they will invade the pitch, so we must have high fences to stop them ”. But all the clubs in any division,
including clubs o f type A and B, visit each other; so one has fans of club B, used to being caged in at home,
being given the chance when visiting club A to invade the pitch. They do not seem to make a point o f doing so
with any frequency. However instances do occur, as I have mentioned; they are unpredictable and may
happen at any tim e depending probably upon the occurrence of some incident thought to be provocative.
When they occur, they can cause serious danger. There is risk o f injury to players, to the referee and to the
.police, quite apart from the risk o f injury through fighting between fans. It is true, as is often said, that so far
 no fatality has resulted from a pitch invasion, whereas 95 people died against a fence installed to prevent such
 invasion. But if fighting between fans starts on the pitch area, it is difficult to stop and injuries can be caused.
At Sclhurst Park on 13 May 1989, five police officers and 16 supporters required hospital treatm ent,

   182. Since each club in a League division has to cope during the season with at least some o f the
supporters o f all the other clubs in the division, the widely differing solutions to the fencing problem must be
due to different attitudes rather than objectively different needs. The different attitudes taken by clubs or
local authorities stem from the difficulty in balancing or deciding the priority o f three crucial considerations;

     i.    Fences, especially high, spiked fences, are intimidating, ugly and demoralising.

     ii.   Adequate measures must be taken to prevent pitch invasions for the reasons already given.

     iii. Whatever the measures taken to prevent pitch invasions, there must be adequate provision for
          cscape in emergencies.

   183. At some grounds, point ii. has been regarded as param ount so that i. has had to give way. At others,
either point i. or, especially after Hillsborough, point iii. have carried greatest weight so as to remove or
greatly reduce the fencing.

   184. Is there any way o f achieving a satisfactory balance o f all three considerations? I believe so: that it is
 possible to have sufficient obstacles to pitch invasion without prison-type fences and also to provide for
 escape in emergency. I deal with the three considerations in turn.

   L HiRh Spiked Fences
   18 S. I agree with the view that high, prison-type fences with spikes and overhanging sections should go. The
 spectacle of these huge cage-like fences is inconsistent with a sports ground being for pleasure an d recreation.
 Moreover, I believe such intim idatory fences have an adverse affect on both the morale and the behaviour o f
 fans. They feel badly treated. H aving to stand in a cage for your Saturday afternoon recreation inevitably
 causes resentment. Resentm ent often results in hostility to those controlling the match. A sour relationship
 develops and continues between the fans and those in authority, making the jo b o f police and stewards much
 more difficult. Being inside the cage provokes some to hurl abuse or missiles at those outside, rival fans,
 players or police. T he security o f the fencing (in that the rival fans cannot penetrate it) encourages bravado to
 indulge in such activity. The spiked fences imply an expectation that trouble will or may occur. They also
 hamper a clear view o f the game. To remove them would signal the advent o f a new future for football and
 especially a new attitude from the authorities to the spectators. Accordingly, I consider that when perimeter
 fencing is used it should not exceed a prescribed maximum height and all spike arrangements and top
 sections angled inwards should go. This view is in accord with the recommendation o f the Technical Working
 Party (Appendix 3 paragraph 20). But what should be the prescribed m axim um height? T hat leads to
 consideration ii.
  ii. Adequate M easures to Prevent Pitch Invasions
  186. UEFA regulation B6 of 1988 requires as follows:-

  “Protection of the playing field by means of

  (a)   a fence o f at least 2.2 metres in height or a moat or else

  (b)   a barrier with adequate policing so as to make it impossible for spectators to enter the field of play..

  Fences must have sufficient security gates opening towards the playing field and in the case o f moats or a
combination o f moats and fences adequate other security passages should be provided”.
                                                            *
   187. Inquiries show th at the figure o f 2.2 metres was chosen simply by reference to the height of existing
fencing at various grounds especially in West Germ any and the need to choose a height of fence which would
am ount to “a real obstruction” to pitch invasion. As to the word “impossible” sim ilar inquiries suggest that
the intention was to leave it to the police com m ander to decide what resources he might need. Should a pitch
invasion occur, UEFA would consider all the circumstances before deciding what if any action to take.

   188. In my view a fence should be o f sufficient height to be a serious obstacle to pitch invasion. I t should
provide sufficient obstruction to enable the police to take timely action should pitch invasion be attem pted
without being so high as seriously to interfere with vision or to give a feeling o f im prisonm ent. Although I
appreciate the UEFA regulation says “at least 2.2 metres”, these criteria lead me to recommend that
perimeter fencing should be no higher than 2.2 metres. T hat measurement I take from ground level at the
front of the terrace to the top of the fencing ie the 2.2 metres may consist entirely o f fencing or partly o f wall
and partly of fencing m ounted on the wall. For example, at Ibrox Park the fencing is about 1.45 metres high
but it is m ounted on a wall and the total height o f wall and fence is 2.2 metres.

   189. In making this recom m endation I am merely indicating a m axim um height should perim eter fencing
be used. I do not suggest there must be such fencing or indeed any fencing. Those clubs which presently have
no perimeter fencing may well think it safe to continue that way. Others may emulate them. Still m ore may
consider that they can dispense with fencing or bring it to a lower level than 2.2 metres in front o f thei r family
areas or their seated areas. As the seating areas increase it should progressively be found possible to achieve a
corresponding reduction in fencing. These options, subject to the m axim um height o f 2.2 metres which I
have indicated, should be left to the discretion o f local authorities acting on th e advice o f their Advisory
G roup which will have consulted the club and supporters.

   190. I should make clear that I have thus far referred only to perim eter fencing at the pitch side o f viewing
areas. Different considerations may well apply to the height of radial fencing used to segregate rival fans. The
m axim um height o f such fences should be a m atter for local decision and m ay depend for example on
whether there are sterile areas between pens of rival fans; but I still recommend that no spikes be used.

   191. Some may feel I am being naive or over-optimistic in recommending that fencing be brought down to
a lower level. Hooligans may take advantage of this relaxation to have, literally, a field day. However, I draw
attention to those grounds where fences have already been brought down to or below the level I recommend
and others where there are none at all. If we wish to make progress, some initiative must surely be taken to
stop the cycle of bad behaviour m et with repression inducing worse behaviour.

   192. Besides, there are other ways of deterring pitch invasions than by dauntingly fortified fences. O ne is
to balance the lowering o f the fences with a prohibition against going on to the pitch w ithout reasonable
excuse, I shall deal with that in the next chapter. The other is by alternative physical means.

Safety Corridors
   193. O ne m ethod has been adopted, so far successfully, at Anfield, G oodison Park and W hite Hart Lane.
It involves reserving a safety corridor or dry m oat between the front row of standing spectators and a
perimeter fence or wall o f m oderate proportions. The two photographs Appendix 6 illustrate the Liverpool
and Everton versions o f it. The front few steps of the terrace are sacrificed as a viewing area and left as a
sterile strip. Behind that area, the front row o f crush barriers is filled in and m ade continuous with no gaps.
The Everton version has no fence above the perimeter wall. At Anfield there is a low red rail fence. T hat
arrangement does not absolutely prevent pitch invasion, but it inhibits it. Moreover, anyone or any group
minded to get to the pitch has first to get over the front crush barrier, then cross the corridor, then get up the
steps or over the wall onto the perim eter track. At White Hart Lane there is finally a line o f advertising
hoardings to be scaled. By that time the police should be able to intervene. At high-risk matches no doubt
police could patrol the sterile area.

           Moats
              194.     The safety corridor at these three grounds is not truly a dry moat. But 1 have seen examples both in
           Holland and Italy of a concrete dry moat providing a total obstacle to pitch invasion. At Utrecht, there is a
           deep broad moat; provision is m ade to enable spectators to descend into the m oat and use it as a passageway
           far entrance and exit. A photograph is at Appendix 7. At the San Siro stadium in Milan, there is a similar
           moat at one side o f the ground which will be extended all round. At present there is no provision for access to
ay.

           accord with the Italian regulations.
:s or a
             I*>5. To interpose a full scale moat o f the U trecht or Milan type between the spectators and the pitch
           requires considerable space. It is easier to provide it as an integral part of the design of a new stadium than to
 .
 .isting   mtroducc it as a modification o f an old one. At most U K grounds the space between pitch and spectators is
 would     very limited and to introduce a moat would involve a large loss o f viewing area. Nevertheless, it is a solution
lit that   worthy o f consideration and especially so for a new stadium. Its advantage is that it effectively prevents pitch
  pitch    invasion without impeding vision or importing a prison atm osphere. A few rows back from it. you are not
           even aware o f its existence. Its disadvantage, apart from the space it requires, is the difficulty o f combining it
           »»th access to the pitch in emergencies.
hould
npted        iii Emergency Escape
>ugh I        196. Hillsborough showed conclusively that, if there are to be perim eter fences, there must be sufficient
1 that     §atcs to perm it escape to the pitch and they must be immediately available in an emergency. T h at lesson was
at the     reaffirmed by the recent incident at Ayresome Park. I know there is a school o f thought opposed to access to
f wall     the pitch in any circumstances, preferring that alternative evacuation routes should all be away from the
s high     pitch. Thus, at some grounds (Hillsborough was one) emergency plans did not require gates to the pitch or
           take any such existing gates into account in calculating the tim e required for alternative routes o f evacuation.
           Al Hillsborough, evacuation was to be via the central tunnel, or alternatively through the radial gates at the
:ncing
           back o f the terrace and round the ends o f the west stand. But, if the emergency arises at the front o f the
/ have
           tcrraccs (as it did) those alternative routes cannot and d id not afford timely relief. Presently, although
e may
           emergency access to the pitch could readily be gained at both Anfield and Goodison Park, the plans do not
'amily
           rely on emergency evacuation in that direction. The tragic Bradford City disaster, in which fire swiftly
ieve a
           engulfed a stand, would have caused much greater loss o f life had there not been ready access to the pitch. It
hich I
           can no doubt be argued that inflammable stands with neglected underspaces should not recur, that with
/isory
           m odem stands constructed o f non-inflammable materials there should be no risk o f another Bradford, and
           that if capacities and safety measures are observed no Hillsborough situation should recur. The solemn fact is
iewing     that those two disasters did occur. One cannot predict what emergency may arise to make evacuation away
 5 . The   from the pitch either wholly impractical or too slow.
 >le on
             197. The UEFA regulation cited above recognises that where there are fences access to the pitch should be I
           preserved, I agree with that view and recommend that emergency access to the pitch should be provided.      /
iwn to
 draw         198. How should this be done? There is no significant problem where there are either no fences or none
m end,     higher than crush barrier level. At Anfield or Goodison Park, for example, it would not be difficult to get over
cen to     the front crush barrier into the “dry m oat” and thence to the pitch. That arrangement could be modified to
           in d u d c radial gangways at intervals running straight down to the “dry m oat” through gaps in the front
           burner. This would give even readier access. It must be for local judgem ent to balance the need for ready
)n e is    access to the pitch in emergencies with the need to deter such access otherwise.
nable
              199. The more difficult problem arises at grounds where fences o f up to 2.2 metres are deemed necessary.
           I b such fences there must, in my view, be sufficient gates not less than 1.1 metre in width as approved by the
           Green Guide. It is no use seeking to specify how many gates will be required by reference to the length o f
 Lane,     fencing at the front o f a given pen or other enclosure. The ttength o f the frontage is only one factor. Much will
and a      depend on the depth o f the terrace and the numbers it is perm itted to hold. I prefer, in concurrence with the
[rpool     Technical Working Party (Appendix 3 paragraph 22) to say that the gates should be sufficient in number to
,t as a    enable the pen or other enclosure to be evacuated in the time required for any other emergency evacuation route.
  gaps.    Sach Kates should be evenly spaced along the frontage of the pen to avoid congestion on exit.
  That
group       Th-e Gates at Nimes
ip the         200. One solution to this problem is the system installed in the new stadium at Nimes which I visited
tising      together with the Assessors. There, the fence consists of a num ber o f electrically operated panels which open
doubt       as gates to the pitch, as shown in Appendix 8. There are six sections o f the ground. The fencing in each section
            is governed by a trigger gate which may be operated electrically or manually. The post upon which it is


                                                                    33
m ounted has an electro-magnet which holds the mechanism inside the post in a position keeping th e gate
shut. W hen a button is pressed, the magnet is de-activated, the gate descends in its m ounting and is free to
swing towards the pitch. As it does so, it releases the next gate which is also m ounted on a swivelling device
within its post, operating by gravity to open the gate. This dom ino effect continues throughout the section. It
can be arrested by someone leaning against one o f the gates from the pitch side but how far anyone there
could withstand substantial crowd pressure is doubtful. The trigger gate can be pperated manually bu t this
seemed to require considerable force. To shut the gate again seemed to require considerable force and a lifting
motion. The gates are about nine inches higher than the front floor o f the terrace, but there is no sum p such as
often exists in grounds in the UK. The system could be adapted to U K grounds but there are a num ber o f
factors upon which greater reassurance might be required. If the gates were fixed on top o f a low wall such as
that at Leppings Lane, there would be a danger o f crushing in the sum p or at least o f broken limbs as people
tried to get out. The system has been in operation at N im es for only a few m onths and has not been severely
tested to show that it would be effective un der crowd pressure. Although a firm is licensed to m arket the
system in 34 countries worldwide, our inform ation is that so far they have been fitted only at N im es and
Toulon although one or two other French clubs are interested. In these circumstances the robustness o f the
fencing and the effects of English weather upon it are as yet unproved. At N im es the system operates with a
level walkway on the spectators’ side o f the fencing. Apart from a very small step, the pitch is at the same
level. To achieve this arrangement would require considerable alteration to the layout o f many UK grounds
involving in particular raising the lower part o f terraces to make them level with the pitch and with the
bottom o f the fencing.

Gates Unlocked
   201. I made an interim recom m endation to leave gates fully open when the pen or enclosure was
occupied. This was for three stated reasons; first, to afford instant access to the pitch; secondly, to provide
visual reassurance to fans after Hillsborough that there was an escape route and thirdly, to keep police and
stewards alert to conditions inside the gateway. I also had in m ind that the num bers and size o f gates might at
some grounds be inadequate and I was not making any recom m endation for structural change at that stage.
Along with reduced capacities, provision o f sufficient gates and lower fences, I must now consider w hether to
keep or modify my recommendation to leave gates fully open. I know that some Police Com m anders have
been anxious that to do so is an invitation to pitch invasion; hence the practice at some grounds of closing the
gates near the end o f the game or keeping them shut but not locked. I would still hope that gates would be left
fully open wherever those in command feel this can safely be done. However, I recommend that whether they be
fully open, partially open or closed they be kept unlocked throughout the period when the pen or enclosure is
occupied. They should thus be easily available for emergency exits and spectators should be confident o f this.

  202. I repeat my interim recommendation that all gates in radial and perimeter fences of pens or other
self-contained areas should be painted in a different colour from the rest of the fences and marked “Emergency
Exit”.

Authorising Access to the Pitch
  203. Interim recommendation num ber 9 provided as follows:-

  “ * 9. There should be in respect o f each gate in a perim eter fence (or group o f gates if they are close
  together) a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve
  overcrowding. . . ”

  Despite the much greater alertness to the possibility o f an emergency which now exists, following
Hillsborough, I still believe it necessary to make a recommendation to ensure that proper provision is made
for swift action to authorise the opening o f gates in the event o f an emergency. However, it has been draw n to
my attention that strict observance of this interim recom m endation verges on the absurd where a pen
contains only a handful o f spectators. Moreover, to be bound to provide a police officer at each gate or group
of gates in all circumstances involves a heavy com m itm ent o f police manpower which would be even heavier
with an increase in the num ber o f gates. Accordingly, I have decided to recommend th at although each gate
should be manned when the enclosure is occupied, whether such manning should be by a police officer or by a
steward is for the Police Commander to decide. In either event plans should ensure that the police can authorise
access through gates to the pitch immediately in the event of an emergency.

M onitoring Crowd Density
   204. It is convenient to mention a m odification I think sensible regarding interim recom m endation 5.
T hat provided;-
 e gate     “ * 5. At each match, there should be on the perim eter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
 'ree to    area, a steward (if the club is m onitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are m onitoring it) whose
 ievice     sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
lion. It    period the area is occupied by spectators. W hoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other
   there    steward or police presence. H e should have ready access to the police officer authorised under
 it this    Recom m endation 9 below, and by radio to the control room .”
 .ifting
 ach as       I repeat that recommendation (with a slight change of wording to achieve clarity) but qualify it to avoid
 ber o f   absurdity when numbers are small. The recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other
 ich as    standing area where the spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not
 leopie    exceed one third of the area’s maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, whichever is the lower.
'vereiy
 et the    Cutting Equipment
 ;s and      205. In the im m ediate afterm ath o f Hillsborough, I recommended that suitable and sufficient cutting
 of the    equipm ent should be provided to enable spectators to be released from behind perim eter fencing. Assuming
 vith a    the recom m ended m axim um capacities are observed, that fences are lowered, that sufficient gates are
  same     provided and left unlocked, cutting equipm ent should not be necessary. Something in these provisions would
 Hinds     have to go badly wrong for such equipm ent to be required. Nevertheless, I recommend that the equipment
  h the    should be maintained in case of some unforeseen emergency.

           Functions of Police and Stewards
              206. W hich functions should be discharged by the police and which by the club's stewards is one of the

group        T h e Interim Popplewell Report
iavier
                 163. There was considerable controversy in the course o f the public inquiry held by M r Justice
1 gate
              Popplewell in 1985 as to the responsibility o f the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report,
 r by a
              M r Justice Popplewell quoted from a report produced for the Minister of Housing and Local Government
iiorise
              in 1969 as follows:-

                “T he responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police and the club operating
             th e ground. T he broad line of division being that police are responsible for movement of spectators in
ion 5.       public thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the
             control o f spectators once they are on the club’s prem ises. . . ”

I
                                                                    35
 Mr Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observe that in practice th e
 police have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph
 3.8):

    “It follows, therefore, that as a m atter o f practice, while the physical safety o f the building and th e
    m aintenance and good housekeeping o f the ground m ust always be the responsibility o f the club, th e
    police have to take the de facto responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all th at entails, during th e
    game...”

 M r Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation of the ground as a procedure in which only the police
 could bear the responsibility of supervising the organisation o f the crowd.
                                                                    *
 The Final Popplewell Report
     164. He harked back to this subject in chapter 4 o f his Final Report. There, he came down m ore firmly
 in favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “Because, as a m atter
 o f practice, police officers have regularly attended in large num bers at football grounds, it has somehow
 been assumed by the clubs th at the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed
 from them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcement of law and order. Those
 responsible for organising a private function, however, have the prim ary and continuing obligation and
 responsibility to ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises.” M r Justice
 Popplewell ended th at section as follows: “It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club, or
 the occupier o f the ground who is putting on the function, that the prim ary and continuing obligation
 rests.”

     165. There remains, however, the question whether there are some grounds or parts o f grounds where
  the club may need to rely upon the police (whom they pay to attend) to control filling of pens and
  m onitoring them for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the
  club, they may need, and by agreement be entitled, to employ the police to act as their agents in certain
  circumstances. This very difficult and grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed
  in greater depth at stage two o f this Inquiry.”

  Since Hillsborough was concerned with a disaster on the terraces, I headed that passage “W ho should
m o nitor the terraces?”. But the wider question is: who should control the entry o f spectators, their placing
and movement whilst in the ground and their exit from it? It is undisputed that the club, as a m atter o f law,
has a duty to take reasonable care for the safety of the spectators invited to its premises. There have, however,
been two practical difficulties about the club, rather than the police, being de facto in charge.

   207. First, the club discharges its duty through stewards. They are part-tim e employees or assistants whose
duties are confined to m atch days. Many o f them are seasoned supporters of the club and some tend to be
elderly: others are keen young supporters. Due either to age or youth, many therefore lack the physique to
cope with awkward customers. They are usually not well paid, part of their “rem uneration” (indeed all o f it at
some clubs) consisting o f the opportunity to see the game. As the submission from the Association o f Chief
Police Officers o f England, Wales and N orthern Ireland (ACPO) puts it:

  “(Stewards) are at best casual workers (usually working one day in two weeks), they are probably not people
  who have a supervisory role in ordinary life and are not always equipped or used to giving directions or
  facing obstruction. Many are retired people and pay is not so attractive as to guarantee com m itm ent.”

  W hilst there are exceptions, I have frequently been told that the stewards presently employed at many
clubs are o f limited capacity and reliability.

   208. Secondly, there has to be a police presence at a match to m aintain law and order. Police are trained to
give and enforce instructions. This, together with the uniform they wear and the respect for and fear of the
law which the m ajority of spectators have, gives the police far more authority than stewards. Moreover, if
trouble arises, whether from misbehaviour or from any other cause, the police will inevitably be drawn into
assuming control. They have all the means to do so at their disposal - the control room, the CCTV, the
planned deploym ent of serials o f officers round the ground, a com m unications system to co-ordinate them
a n d reserves on call. The submission from ACPO suggests that in these circumstances, and to avoid
confusion, the police ought to accept prim e responsibility for controlling the crowd. I quote two passages
from their argument:


                                                        36
 "It may be that the ambiguous position o f the police is part of the problem - that is acknowledging the
 club's responsibility for safety on the one hand, whilst routinely assuming all those tasks of stewarding
 which the stewards cannot do, either because o f the truculence o f supporters or the limited talents of the
 stewards themselves, on the other. It has to be said that the present lack o f clarity in these arrangements can
 lead to something of a ‘dog’s dinner’. In some clubs the police actively control the stewards, in others the
 stewards are quite independent and, despite some improvements, standards o f stewarding vary
 considerably with m any being too old or simply unreliable...

   ... It may be better to acknowledge that if trouble is anticipated or if crowd control is going to test the
 ground capacities then, in the interests o f public safety, police should take control over the stewards
 through their supervisory chain”.

   “As to the question o f ‘responsibility’, the m atter o f civil liability should not cause us to resile from our
 decisions if they are necessary. Dual responsibility for safety is a recipe for confusion. The police are always
 going to seize the initiative in a crisis: crowd control is always going to be inextricably linked to criminal
 hooliganism: the police are never going to accept direction from stewards; stewarding will never (at least
 not in the foreseeable future) be able to cope without some law enforcement backup; and finally police do
 ‘own’ most o f the means o f control. In these circumstances the police must accept a leading role and,
 despite the requirem ents and civil liabilities o f football clubs, themselves take on supervision of the overall
 conduct o f events wherever crowd safety is an issue.”

   209. T he question is one o f balance. Carrying delegation to its ultimate, clubs could lean back and leave it
to the police to take over the management o f spectators from street to terraces and back again, with stewards
performing a m inim al role. This would involve a very heavy police com m itm ent and indeed the
com m itm ent at present is very substantial. As already indicated, some 5,000 officers or more are deployed
every Saturday at football matches.

Costs of Police and Stewards
  210. The tem ptation to the clubs to leave it all to the police is stronger if they are not required to make
realistic payment for police services. No charge is m ade for officers outside the ground since maintaining law
and order in the streets is a normal public function o f the police. At the present time, the practice as to
recovering costs o f policing inside the grounds from clubs varies greatly from place to place, different
formulae being used. In some areas, the charge made is the actual cost o f the officers attending in the ground.
At others, it is m ade on a sliding scale dependent on whether the m atch is category A (high-risk) B or C. At
others it is dependent on the size o f the crowd attending. At some, it appears to be entirely arbitrary and at
one ground it is said to be nil. In my view a more consistent and businesslike approach should be made to such
charges. If clubs were to find it more economical to recruit efficient stewards than to delegate duties to the
police, there could be a significant reduction in the num ber of police deployed at football grounds to the
benefit o f the com m unity at large. If this is to happen, stewards must be fit, active and robust. I would suggest
they should be between the ages of 18 and 55. Tfcsy must also be fully trained. Some clubs presently have
efficient stewards whom they recruit individuallyand train fully with the assistance o f the police. Others hire
security firms to bring in a well-trained team of stewards.

Division of Functions
  211. There are clearly many aspects o f crowd control and managem ent which are capable o f being carried
out by efficient stewards. Manning gates, directing spectators to the correct areas and to their seats, keeping
gangways clear, m onitoring the density o f packing in pens or enclosures - indeed, the duties specified in
paragraph 195 o f the Green Guide, as already quoted. At most grounds, and in most parts o f each ground,
these duties ought to be capable of being performed by properly trained stewards. Where that is so, clubs
should require stewards to perform the duties and should not take the option of leaving all to the police.

  212. However, I accept that there may well be particular areas o f a ground, perhaps on visitors’ terraces
and particularly at high-risk matches, which call for the greater authority and resilience o f the police. What
the division o f functions should be must be a m atter for local decision and in the last resort for the Police
C om m ander to determ ine.

W ritten Statement of Intent
  213. I therefore repeat my recommendation that there should be a written document setting out the
respective functions of club and police for crowd safety and control “and in particular for the filling of each
self-contained pen or other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid
all tf r° i " 8’ /I n te r im recom m endation 4). The aim should be for the club through its stewards to perform
       °®e unctions o f controlling spectators o f which they are capable having regard to the quality o f the
s ewar s, the layout o f the ground and the nature o f the match. W here they are not able to discharge any such
 unc ion the police should perform it. As the proportion of seating at grounds increases, control by stewards
should become the norm..

that ^ ' h ^         interim recom m endation 4 , 1 used the phrase “written agreement” . This led to anxiety
       w at was required was a binding legal contract which would deprive the police o f any flexibility in
response to circumstances o f the day. My intention was not to shackle either party by a binding contract; it
c o u i r P y t0 ^3vc a docum ent setting out how functions were to be divided so that no m isunderstanding
t l ^ d 3nSe Whereby one Party thought the other had undertaken some duty and vice versa. I am content that
    e ocument be referred to simply as a “statement of intent”, so that it can be subject to alteration without
   reac of contract should circumstances so demand.

Police Commanders
how ^           ^ tim m e control at any match must be that o f the Police Commander. He has authority to decide
   w many officers he needs and to deploy them in and outside the ground. He has, if necessary, to take such
      ions as to postpone kick-off, to stop the match, to evacuate the ground or any area o f it. Police
,    g a n d e rs tend to remain in post for lengthy periods. They thus acquire skill, experience and special
  now e ge of the problems at their particular ground. However, there must come a tim e for change. It is then
and t h 3 ^ h l '6 nCW C om m ander to have adequate tim e and iraining to acquaint him self with his functions
        e problems o f policing peculiar to the ground. Training for such functions should be the subject of a
so S u 'h 00*11^ 610 *>Cattent*et* ky senior officers presently acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do
           a course would give induction training in the basic strategy of policing football matches and would also
give opportunity | ()r ^ e p00ling o f experience and the solution o f com m on problems.

Rate of Admission
  ^ 1/     .
       • n m iportant causative factor at Hillsborough was the congestion which built up outside the
 urns l es in the last 20 m inutes before kick-off. Twenty-three turnstiles were required to adm it 24,256
spec a ors, only seven turnstiles were available to adm it the 10,100 with tickets for the west terraces. Much
was m a e in evidence o f the late arrival o f the Liverpool fans. However, further evidence at stage two o f the
thoser^-Sy®®ests **lat the late arrival o f large num bers is a com m on feature at many grounds. Apart from

   AC)U)o the I9 ? 5 Act and should therefore be a requirement of the Safety Certificate.

Communications
           e e ttic ic n t deployment and co-ordination o f police and stewards depend u p on effective systems of
com m unication. R at}i0 svstems are susceptible to two problems; excessive air traffic on the channels in use
and the volum e o f noise from the crow d


                                                          38
   220. If large num bers o f officers are issued with radios and are all entitled to use the same channel,
confusion may result should a m ajor incident occur. In such an event, many officers may wish to speak
simultaneously. Especially if the channel is used on “talk-through” (whereby all officers including those in
control give and receive messages w ithout priority) the Com m ander in the police room may be unable
effectively to issue orders. Again, if the level o f crowd noise is high, as it often is, an officer on the perim eter
track may have great difficulty in hearing messages. Although ear pieces are of some assistance, they are not
totally successful in excluding crowd noise and are not usually issued to every officer carrying a radio.

  221. M r Justice Popplewell in his Interim Report recom m ended that “early attention should be given by
the Home Office Directorate o f Telecommunications to consider the practicality o f producing a more
suitable personal radio for the police”. In his Final Report, he returned to the subject at paragraphs
4.102-104. By that tim e, he reported that “a detailed study is being commissioned by the Home Office
Directorate o f Telecommunications into the problem o f personal radios”.

  222. T he Directorate produced an upgraded specification. As a result, supplies o f two new models have
been m ade available. They are the Philips PFX and the Motorola MT600E. These radios have greater range
and clarity than those previously used. They also give access to many more channels. To take advantage of
this, the police have been allocated eight additional U H F frequencies.

  223. Police C om m anders have told me that, in addition to any other channel or channels in use, there
should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate with his senior
officers round the ground. This is o f the first importance since it enables the C om m ander to use the
inform ation coming to him in the control room to deploy his forces promptly and effectively at any part of
the ground without radio interruption. I recommend this should be done.

  224. As suggested by the Technical Working Party, I repeat the recommendations I made in my Interim
Report as to communications, with one exception. A sentence in one recom m endation suggested that
“consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code o f hand signals to indicate to
the control room the existence o f certain emergencies or requirements.” I am persuaded by evidence from the
police that the use of hand signals could create a risk of confusion and I do not therefore repeat that suggestion.

 Other Topics in the Green Guide
   225. I have in this chapter considered specifically a num ber o f key safety factors covered by the Green
 G uide. I have suggested respects in which the G uide should be strengthened or am ended. In addition to those
 topics, the Technical Working Party considered a number of further aspects of safety - crush barriers, stands,
 ingress and egress, stairways and ramps, inspections and testing, Are safety, emergency power and disabled
 spectators. I accept and adopt the Technical Working Party’s Report and recommendations on those matters
 (Appendix 3). W ithout repeating them in this text, I add only a few additional comments.

   226. As to crush barriers, paragraphs 25 to 28 o f their report recommend a sim pler and clearer test
 procedure than that in the current Guide. In particular, the values to be achieved by way of percentage recovery
 after the required loading test will depend upon the material from which the barrier is constructed eg concrete,
 steel or wrought iron. When the Guide is revised, acceptable values for various materials should be specified.

   227. T he G reen G uide does, in paragraph 6 o f Annex C, refer to the possibility o f doubts arising as to the
 safety o f a barrier “for any reason (including such m atters as cracking o f the terracing or distortion of
 connections)”. It does not, however, presently make any special mention o f the need to inspect crush barriers
 for possible corrosion. The evidence from the Health and Safety Executive after their inspection o f barriers
 at Hillsborough suggests that corrosion is a serious threat to the safety o f metal barriers. When the Green
 Guide is revised, the need to inspect for possible corrosion should be specifically mentioned and emphasised.

 Co-ordination of Emergency Services
   228. It is vital that adequate provision should be made for possible emergencies arising from fire or
 accident and from illness o r injuries however caused. I repeat the recommendations I made in my Interim
 Report regarding co-ordination of the emergency services. In addition, although it is mentioned in paragraph
 176 o f the Green G uide, I emphasise that “Joint consultation between management, police, fire, ambulance
 and o th er emergency services should take place in order to produce agreed plans o f action for all foreseeable
 types o f emergency." Such plans should include, for example, contingency arrangements for admissions to
 particular hospitals in the event of a num ber o f casualties and consideration o f possible casualty clearing
 areas at the sports ground. Lines of communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from the police control
 room to the local headquarters of all emergency services should be maintained at all times so that emergency
 calls can be made instantly.
First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
   229. T he scale o f available medical facilities has been the subject o f controversy. After Hillsborough, there
were complaints o f insufficient basic equipm ent such as stretchers. I repeat what I said in my Interim Report
at paragraphs 298 and 299:-

  “298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium, medical facilities capable o f dealing with
  a m ajor disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
  equipm ent and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

   299. W hat is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid, for professional medical attention an d for
  am bulance attendance, together with a system o f co-ordination with the emergency services which -will
  bring them to the scene swiftly in whatever num bers are required. W hat will am ount to an appropriate
  basic provision for the future eg the equipm ent in a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and advice”.

   230. The Scottish ambulance service has developed a “major incident equipment vehicle” designed and
equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties. It is packed with 50 stretchers, blankets, and medical supplies an<l is
in effect a travelling storehouse for such equipment. A vehicle of that type is deployed in addition to other
ambulance attendance at matches with crowds over 25,000. This provision goes a long way towards meeting the
criticism raised after Hillsborough and I recommend that it be adopted elsewhere.

  231. I repeat the Interim Recommendations I made under this heading subject to two variations. First, it has
been sensibly urged that it is unreasonable to require a medical practitioner to be present throughout a match
where attendance is very small. At such a match it is suggested that to have a m edical practitioner on call
would be sufficient. I agree with this and recommend that the full-time presence of a doctor should not be
required where there is no reasonable expectation of more than 2,000 spectators attending.

   232. Secondly, some clubs have told me that they can secure private am bulance services more
economically than those from the appropriate am bulance authority. They accordingly wish to have freedom
to choose. I modify my Interim Recommendation in deference to this argument by requiring at least one fully
equipped ambulance from, or approved by, the appropriate ambulance authority should be in attendance a t all
matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

Status of the Green Guide
  233. I have recom m ended that some safety factors covered by the G uide should be m ade m andatory
requirem ents in Safety Certificates. Those apart, I consider the Guide should rem ain a non-m andatory set o f
guidelines. Sports grounds vary greatly in their layout and fixtures. It must be open to a local authority to
judge the propriety o f deviating in some respect from the Green G uide recom m endations at a particular
ground. However, I agree with the Technical Working Party that where there is a departure from a specific
recom m endation of the G uide, the local authority should be aware of it and should be satisfied that such
departure is justified for good reason.

Revision of the Green Guide
  234. N either I nor the Technical Working Party have sought to revise or redraft the specific wording o f the
G uide. We have simply indicated where and to what effect it should be altered. Detailed consideration o f the
revision must be for a suitably qualified body to be set up by the Home Office for the purpose. The Techn ical
W orking Party, in addition to their report, have prepared detailed supplementary notes on some aspects o f
the G uide which will be available and I am sure useful to those revising it. Accordingly, I recommend that the
Home Office set up a body to revise the Green Guide as a matter of urgency.

Sports Grounds Within Part III of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987
  235. This Part of the 1987 Act applies in relation to a sports ground which is not a designated sports
ground but which provides covered accommodation in stands for spectators. A Safety Certificate is required
where such a stand provides covered accommodation for 500 or more spectators. By section 27(1) the Safety
Certificate:-

   “shall contain such term s and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or expedient to secure
   reasonable safety in the stand when it is in use for viewing the specified activity or activities at the ground,
   and the term s and conditions may be such as to involve alterations or additions to the stand or any
   installations in or serving the stand.”


                                                         40
  236. These provisions appiy to a variety o f sports such as tennis, golf, horseracing, greyhound racing or
m otor racing.

   237. 1 have received a number o f com plaints that local authorities, perhaps in response to Hillsborough,
have sought to apply the full rigour o f my Interim R ecom m endations to sports grounds requiring a Safety
Certificate under these provisions, not being designated sports grounds under the 1975 Act. On occasion this
has been done without regard to the Green Guide or to H om e Office guidance. Examples given are
requirements in relation to greyhound stadia regarding the presence o f a medical practitioner, the size o f a
first aid room, and capacity o f parts o f the stadium other than the covered stand itself.

  238. The Green G u id e provides at paragraph 5 as follows: -

  “The G uide is intended to cover grounds where sporting events o f all kinds are held and where the
  gathering o f large crowds is likely to present a safety problem. However, much o f the guidance has
  particular application to football stadia and this should be borne in m ind when applying the Guide to
  grounds used for other sports and m odifications may prove necessary, because the measures to meet
  problems o f stadia used for association football may not always be necessary at other grounds used for
  other types o f sports. For exam ple, if a ground has no terraced or sloped viewing areas, crush barrier
  requirements are unlikely to be o f concern”.

  A similar approach is appropriate in relation to my Final R ecom m endations. They are essentially directed
towards designated sports grounds. Many are relevant to other sports grounds but will need to be applied
with due regard to the different circumstances at those other sports grounds.

  239. O ne appropriate function o f the inspecting and reviewing body, which I propose should cover all
certificating and licensing o f sports grounds, would be to ensure that recom m endations in the Green Guide
and those m ade in this Report are applied sensibly across the varied range o f sports grounds.

Sports Grounds Within Part IV of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987
   240. T his Part o f the 1987 Act relates to indoor sports licences. It introduced am endm ents to the
London Government Act 1963 and the Local Government (M iscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 requiring
a licence to be granted by the relevant local authority where premises are to be used for “any entertainment
which consists o f any sporting event to which the public are invited as spectators” (a “sports
entertainm ent”).

   241. U nder this legislation, the relevant local authority:-

   “m ay grant to any applicant, and from tim e to time renew, a licence for the use o f any premises specified
   in it for any sports entertainment on such terms and conditions and subject to such restrictions as may be     1
   so specified”.                                  ^                                                                  j

  2 42 . I have received evidence from a number o f bodies com plaining that the procedure followed in
pursuance o f these provisions often requires different applications to be made by different applicants for
different “sports entertainments” at the same premises. Apart from the expenditure o f tim e and effort, such     j
m ultiple applications tend to be expensive to amateur sports organisations which are often impecunious. The      ^
suggestion is m ade that a procedure should be available whereby a licence for a range o f “sports
entertainm ents” at the same premises could be obtained by a single operator periodically. This matter            J
m erits review by the appropriate authorities.

                 PART III - CROWD CONTROL AND HOOLIGANISM
                                                 CHAPTER5

                                  PO L IC E P L A N N IN G A N D C O N TR O L

  243. The role o f the police is crucial to crowd control. In my findings as to what happened at Hillsborough
and why, I criticised the police operation on the day and especially som e senior officers. I did, however,
recognise that the South Yorkshire Police had a good record, that day apart, for handling difficult crowd
problems successfully. I also com m ended many junior officers for their efforts to rescue and assist those
crushed or trapped at Hillsborough.

  244. I should like here to pay tribute to police forces generally for their invaluable work in maintaining
order at sports events and especially in and outside football stadia, Saturday after Saturday. W ithout them,
sports events would be chaotic and indeed many could not be permitted to take place. Their service is often
thankless and not infrequently they are subjectedto abuse and worse from those they are there to serve.

  245. They would be superhuman if on occasions they did not react, at any rate verbally, to the stress and
provocation they have to endure. This leads many fans to feel the police are against them. Moreover, it is
often difficult in the confusion o f a crowded scene for firm police action against miscreants not to impinge
also, or focus by mistake, on the innocent. The latter then feel aggrieved and others becom e aggrieved on
their behalf.

  246. It is therefore vital that police discipline and self-control be o f the highest standard and that friendly
relations with supporters are cultivated. I know and have m yself seen that this is achieved at many grounds,
But there are reports that, at som e places, som e police treat supporters, especially away supporters, with a
measure o f contempt. W hen this happens it unfortunately sours the attitude o f the supporters towards all
police.

  247. Accordingly, Police Comm anders should in their briefings stress the need to balance firm control
with good hum our and patience.

  248. As to the planning of police operations and the techniques to be considered, I repeat my interim
recommendations (numbers 6 and 26 to 30) which are now recommendations 1 6 ,4 4 to 4 6 ,4 9 and 51.

Police Control Room
   249. It is essential to efficient police operations that their control room inside the ground should be well
placed, of sufficient size and well equipped. A number I have seen have been very good. Som e are too small,
however. There should be room for at least the Commander, his deputy and enough officers to man the radios,
telephones and CCTV screens. The room should leave space for others who may need from time to time to visit
the room eg other senior officers, club management or a member of the emergency services. The room should
command a good view of the whole pitch and of the spectator areas surrounding it. It should where necessary fce
sound-proofed against excessive crowd noise. Failure to provide the police with a satisfactory control room is
m isguided thrift.




                                                        42
                                                 CHAPTER6

                                                  A LC O H O L

  250. There can be no doubt that excessive drinking by fans significantly aggravates problems o f crowd
control. Because alcohol tends to remove inhibitions and self control, those who have drunk too much may
becom e aggressive and even violent especially when provoked. Short o f this, however, alcohol can make fans
resistant to sensible and reasonable instructions, more impatient and less considerate o f others. All o f this
increases the problem s for police and stewards in managing large numbers which is difficult enough even
with co-operation.

Legislation
   251. In Scotland, serious crowd misbehaviour, much o f it drink-related, led to the appointm ent in 1976 o f
the Working Group chaired by Mr Frank M cElhone M R The recom m endations o f his report were followed in
the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 which made it an offence to be in. or to attempt to enter, a
designated ground while in possession o f alcohol or to be in. or to attempt to enter, the ground whilst drunk.
It also banned the possession o f alcoholic liquor on public service vehicles carrying passengers to or from a
designated sporting event and by am endm ent this ban was extended to vehicles adapted to carry nine or
more passengers.

  252. I am in no doubt after discussions with senior Scottish police officers that this measure has greatly
reduced the problem o f m isbehaviour at Scottish football grounds. Sectarian violence still has to be
contained, especially at Rangers and Celtic matches. There is still trouble from the “new hooligan” groups,
known in Scotland as “casuals”. But much o f the m isbehaviour o f groups II and III in the Popplewell
classification has abated due to the firm enforcement o f the 1980 Act by the Scottish police.

 2 53 . In England and Wales this lead was followed in the Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985
which made sim ilar provisions.

   254. There is, however, an important difference between the Scottish provisions and those applying in
England and Wales. In Scotland, the ban on alcohol is absolute. N o sales o f alcoholic drink are permitted in
the ground. In England and Wales, section 3 o f the 1985 Act permits Licensing Justices to grant exem ption
from the ban on sales in the ground. This is subject to alcohol not being sold or consum ed at any part o f the
ground from which the sporting event may be directly viewed and to other conditions imposed by the
Justices. It is open to the Justices to revoke or vary an order and the police have power to shut down the sale
o f alcohol at a particular event if they consider it would be detrimental to orderly conduct or safety.


A lcohol Sales in Grounds?
    2 5 5 . It is against this background that I must consider the subm ission o f the FA and others that sale o f
 alcoholic drink in football grounds should be generally permitted without need to obtain an exem ption order.
 T h e argument is that the ban on such sales does not prevent fans from drinking. It merely drives them to
 drink in public houses until a short tim e before the match. They then arrive late, often inebriated and
 truculent, thereby causing congestion and other problems at entrances. Far better, it is said, to make alcoholic
 drink available at the ground so as to bring them in earlier. Since service o f drink inside the ground is slow
 and selling points are crowded it is argued that the visitor will be lucky to buy more than one round. He is
 therefore unlikely to becom e drunk from drinking inside the ground.
                                                              N

   2 5 6 . Ideally I accept that people attending a football match should be able to buy refreshments including
 alcoholic drink just as they can at the theatre or other places o f entertainment. I hope, in halcyon days ahead,
 a better atmosphere at football grounds may justify bans being relaxed. I do not, however, think the present
 tim e is ripe for such relaxation.

   2 5 7 . I have m entioned the great improvement o f crowd behaviour in Scotland where the ban is absolute
 and has been in force now for nearly 10 years. N o doubt other factors such as increased seating have played
 their part in this. The improvement has been recognised by the Government, and is the main reason why the
 Football Spectators Act 1989 has not been applied to Scotland. Thus Mr Moynihan, the Minister for Sport,
 said on the Third D ay o f the C om m ittee Stage (Official Report, colum n 83):

  Scotland. However, it will be able to take action in the future should the p osition deteriorate”.

  In England and Wales, the ban has had only four and a half years to operate and is watered down by the
availability o f exem ptions. Where it is thought appropriate, there is nothing to prevent clubs from applying
to their local justices for an exem ption. There may regrettably be places where the local circumstances,
known to the justices, warrant refusal o f an exemption. At many others, it will be granted as indeed it has
been already at a number o f grounds.

  258. When such exem ptions exist, there is no clear evidence to suggest that late arrivals are greatly
reduced. Indeed, the argument that no-one can get drunk in the ground because o f the problems o f getting
served or because only low alcohol beer is available, seems to m e contradictory to the main argument. Those
w ho wish to drink full strength beer in quantity will not be much attracted by the service offered inside the
ground.                                           ^

  259. In these circumstances I consider it would be a retrograde or at least premature step at this time to
restore a blanket licence to sell alcohol at designated sports events. I do not go so far as to suggest that the
total ban applicable in Scotland should be extended to England and Wales ie that no exem ptions should be
available. But I do not believe it appropriate to relax the present restrictions.

  260. Are there other steps which could and should be taken to reduce problems from excessive drinking?

Arrests
   261. I have referred to the provision in Section 2 o f the 1985 Act making it an offence to be in, or to
attempt to enter, a designated sports ground whilst drunk or in possession o f intoxicating liquor. The impact
o f these provisions clearly depends upon enforcement. Here again there is a contrast between Scotland and
England. In England, although arrests are made, there is a tendency to eject many offenders without arresting
them. In Scotland the police take a firm line. They do not eject offenders; they arrest them. T he English
approach may partly be due to a com m endable desire not to be seen as hostile to football spectators.
However, it is also a matter o f expediency. Making an arrest requires the arresting officer to take the offender
to a police room and go through the prescribed procedure and paperwork. This takes the officer away from
his post for a m inim um o f a quarter o f an hour. At som e grounds (Hillsborough was one) evidence suggests a
much lengthier absence is com m on. Clearly, if a serial o f eight officers is posted to a bank o f turnstiles, three
or four arrests may greatly reduce the team for a significant period. There is a tendency, therefore, to avoid
making arrests save in the worst cases. I do not wish to advocate repressive measures which would be counter
to all I have said about the need for a new attitude towards spectators. On the other hand, it cannot be a good
ground for declining to make an arrest that one cannot spare an officer to do it. I therefore recommend that
consideration be given to streamlining arrest procedures so as to divert an arresting officer from his post for
the minimum time. One m ethod I have seen adopted is for the officer to give only basic details o f the arrest
and be photographed with the offender before resuming his duties. He can then return after the match to
com plete the documentation.

C losing Bars
   262. In som e areas, bars in the vicinity o f the ground are closed either throughout a match day or between
certain hours. This may be required by the Justices or it may be the result o f agreement between police and
publicans. Such a measure may however have limited effect. To close the pubs in a radius o f one or two miles
o f the ground simply diverts drinkers to bars outside that range and may aggravate late arrival. Moreover,
beer from shops with off-licences probably accounts for as much pre-match drinking as that bought in bars.
T h is said, it may well be sensible to limit the availability o f alcohol especially before a high-risk match. How
effective the measure can be depends on the locality. In London or other large cities it could have little
impact; in a more isolated town it could be very effective.

Early Kick-Offs
   263. Traditionally, kick-off at football matches has been at three o'clock. That may formerly have been to
accom m odate those w ho worked on Saturday mornings. By another tradition, permitted hours in pubs led to
a recognised drinking period from mid-morning until three o’clock. The com bination o f these two traditions
often brings fans to a match with too much drink on board. There is therefore much to be said for an early
kick-off especially in a high-risk match. It gives less opportunity for prolonged drinking sessions im mediately


                                                         44
before the game. A mid-day kick-off gives time for away supporters to reach the ground but less time for early
arrivals to kick their heels and lift their elbows in bars.

  264. It is true that an early kick-off will discharge the fans earlier at the end o f the match. Some anxiety
has been expressed as to whether drunkenness avoided before and during the match may have more hours to
build up after the game causing problems for the police and the local com m unity in the evening. This could
be so, but there are two moderating factors. First, drunken behaviour in the town, although a problem for the
police, is less likely to cause serious danger to many people than at a match where it may be com pounded by
excitem ent, partisanship and incidents o f the game and where large numbers are in a confined space.
Secondly, the segregation exercise often results in the bulk o f away supporters being escorted back to their
road or rail transport as soon as the match is over rather than lingering in the town.

Sunday M atches
   265. Sunday matches ought also to be a considered option. On a Sunday, there is less traffic, especially
com m ercial traffic, to com pete with those arriving for the match. Arrival, parking and departure are
therefore easier for them in private coaches and cars. It is true that public transport generally on a Sunday is
less plentiful but special arrangements are often made for major events. Again, bars and indeed many places
o f entertainment being closed on Sundays, there is less incentive to have a night on the town after a Sunday
game.

                                          TICKETS A N D T O U T S
Information on Tickets and Signs
  266. It is vital to good crowd control that those attending a sports event should have clear directions where
to go. It makes for confusion and hence added problems for stewards and police if spectators are m illing
about looking for their appropriate entrances. The congestion at Hillsborough was aggravated by poor
information on the tickets and poor signposting outside and inside the turnstiles. I therefore repeat my
recommendations that tickets and signs should provide simple, clear and consistent information te
spectators.
                                                                   «*

  267. All available measures should be taken in the printing o f tickets to prevent forgeries being produced.
Computer Record o f Tickets
  268. It would greatly help to defeat forgery and theft o f tickets as well as assisting in the apprehension of
those misbehaving in the ground, if clubs maintained a record on computer of ticket sales. This is done in
Italy where season tickets and tickets for all-ticket matches in seated areas are numbered and a record is
maintained o f the names and addresses o f purchasers. Such information is o f great value to the police in
identifying forgeries and tracing offenders. Clearly, season tickets for seats could be made attractive if
favourable terms were offered (especially to young supporters). This would enable the authorities to know for
a whole season w ho was occupying a particular seat. As seating accom m odation increases this would give
greater information and control.
Fans Without Tickets
   269. One problem which creates difficulties for the police is the arrival o f would-be spectators without
tickets at an all-ticket match. Although I found there was not a large body o f such fans at Hillsborough there
undoubtedly were som e. At other matches the numbers have not only been large; they have been determined
to gain entrance by one means or another. If they could not acquire tickets at the ground they have created so
much trouble that the police have judged it best to let them in. Som etim es this has been for payment; on
occasions, even free. The rationale has been that it is better to have troublemakers inside the ground where
they can be m onitored than roaming round the town at large. Obviously, the practice o f adm itting fans
without tickets has a bad knock-on effect. Bands o f fans unable to get tickets believe that if they turn up and
create sufficient clamour the police will admit them.
Police Policy
  270. This must not be allowed to continue. It is intolerable that those with no tickets should be able to
blackmail their way into a ground. “If you don’t let us in we’ll force the gates or wreck your town”, is not a
threat to which a police force should submit. The policy o f admitting such people is also unfair to those who
have taken the trouble and spent m oney to buy tickets. It further involves, at a capacity match, letting in fans
for whom there may be insufficient space. It may also create problems o f segregation. Above all, it is allowing
the m ob to rule.
   271. True, I held that in the crisis which developed at the Leppings Lane turnstiles on 15 April 1989,
opening gate C was justified since life would otherwise have been at risk outside the ground. However, that
was a matter o f life and death. It arose because o f inadequate facilities and inadequate crowd control. I would
hope such a situation will never recur. If anything like it should recur, preservation o f life must clearly t e
paramount. But when the police have an option to let fans without tickets in or keep them out, their policy
must clearly be to exclude them. U nless that rule is firmly and universally applied and known the problem
w ill grow.

All-ticket M atches
   272. All the evidence I have received suggests that great caution should be exercised before m aking a
match all-ticket. To do so can assist in achieving segregation. In general, it should however be d o n e only
where a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected. There should then be little difficulty in selling all the
tickets in advance. The point o f making such a match all-ticket is to prevent the arrival o f greater numbers
than the ground can accom modate. However, if a less popular match is made all-ticket, it may turn out that
only a m odest proportion o f the tickets is sold in advance. If then fans arrive without tickets, they will be
aggrieved at being turned away when there is space available. Moreover, the club will be tempted to give in to
them and sell tickets on the day. This discredits the all-ticket policy and m ay cause breaches o f the
segregation strategy. I therefore recommend that all-ticket matches should be confined to those at which a
capacity or near capacity crowd is expected and that, having so designated them, clubs maintain a firm policy of
not selling tickets at the match.


                                                       46
Touts
   273. The recom m endations in the last two paragraphs are designed to deter those without tickets from
turning up at matches and so obviating any trouble they may be tempted to cause. However, many fans
w ithout tickets turn up at the ground in the hope o f buying them from touts.

   274. During my visits to sports grounds I have found universal condem nation o f touts by all involved in
organising and managing large stadium events. Apart from the obstruction they them selves cause, touts
attract fans without tickets to attend at grounds in the hope o f getting in. Moreover, they sell tickets to all
comers regardless o f their allegiance. Thus tickets for the hom e area at a soccer match fall into the hands o f
away supporters and vice versa. The result is to frustrate the efforts o f clubs and police to achieve peaceful
segregation. Pockets o f alien affiliation planted amongst home supporters form a focus for hostility and often
violence results. Apart from these objections, voiced by the FA, the FL. the police and the clubs, most
supporters also detest touts because they often corner the market for a popular match and offer tickets at
grossly excessive prices.

   275. From all these quarters the plea is to take positive action against ticket touts at football matches.
I am m indful o f the need for caution before advocating a law lim iting liberty to conduct oneself and one’s
business freely and according to established practice. I likewise accept that market forces should, in general,
operate freely in the com m ercial field. Nevertheless, I am satisfied from what I have read, heard and seen
that outside football grounds the presence and activities o f touts have a grossly anti-social effect leading both
directly and indirectly to disorder. Directly, through obstruction and the attraction o f numbers without
tickets. Indirectly, because o f trouble from those so attracted who, in the end, cannot or do not buy tickets
and from those who buy their way into an opposition enclave.

   276. Touts operate, o f course, at places other than football grounds. They are to be found, for example, at
national rugby stadia, at the All England Lawn Tennis Club at W imbledon and at countless other sporting
events. D epending on how one defines “touting”, the activity could include selling unwanted tickets for the
opera, the theatre or concert halls. Touting usually means, however, not just selling at face value a ticket you
cannot use, but selling numbers o f tickets at an inflated price as a com m ercial venture. There is a clear
distinction between the impact o f touting at football grounds and elsewhere. Football is the only sport at
which segregation is practised to prevent violence. This is because it is the sport where violence inside and
outside the ground is, at present, m ost prevalent. There are therefore strong grounds for regarding football as
a special case as the Government has recognised by promoting the Football Spectators Act.

  277. W hatever the policy merits o f freedom to trade and market forces, they must surely yield to the
m aintenance o f safety and the prevention o f disorder. Touts at football matches put both at risk. At other
sports and in other leisure fields the tout does not endanger safety or order to the sam e extent. Accordingly,
whatever view one takes o f him, he can be left to ply his trade there. But so far as football is concerned, in my
view touting should be made unlawful. The fast buck should stop here.

  27 8. At present, police can deal with touts only by somewhat strained and stretched use o f existing laws.
They arrest them for obstruction even if the physical obstruction caused is m inimal. Alternatively, they make
an arrest on the grounds that they suspect the tout o f carrying forged tickets, although the suspicion o f forgery
m ay merely be convenient conjecture. After holding the tout during the match the police release him and the
now valueless but genuine tickets are returned to him. Growing wise to this, many touts now carry only two or
three tickets at a tim e, relying on a runner to bring up more from a “banker** standing o f f with perhaps
hundreds o f tickets in his possession. If the salesman is arrested the merchandise is not all lost. Police should
not have to stretch the law to deal with a public mischief. There should be a specific prohibition which police
can then enforce.

    279 .     H ow to formulate a prohibition against touting at football grounds will require careful consideration
 and drafting. It could be made an offence to sell tickets for and on the day of a football match without
 authority from the home club to do so. Another way would be to prohibit such sales within a specified radius
 o f th e ground on the day o f the match. Yet another would be to prohibit sales o f tickets for a football match at
 m ore than face value. This third alternative would permit any genuine purchaser o f a ticket who found he
 could not use it to recoup his outlay by selling his ticket outside the match. Its disadvantage would be the
 difficulty o f proving a tout had sold at more than face value; ways would also be devised to evade the
 prohibition. I tend to favour the first alternative which is sim ple and capable o f easy proof. The genuine
 ticket holder, finding him self unable on the day to use his ticket, and not permitted to sell it outside the
 ground, should be permitted to return it to the club and recover his money. Clubs should be prepared to
 accept such tickets in the interests o f fairness and o f having a law which defeats touts. If touting outside the
 ground is banned, fans with no tickets for an all-ticket match could have no excuse for turning up outside
 hopin g to get in.

                             POLICE STRATEGIES AGAINST HOOLIGANS

Cautious Optimism
  280. I turn now to ways o f curbing misbehaviour and dealing with hooligans. At the outset, I must record
that there are grounds for cautious optim ism about misbehaviour inside football grounds although the same
cannot be said o f behaviour outside and en route. Evidence I have received from various police forces, from
ACPO, from the football authorities and from the clubs suggests that measures taken in the last couple o f
years have reduced incidents o f violent misbehaviour inside grounds. Also, for the first tim e for decades,
there has been a small but steady increase in attendances at matches in each o f the last three years. This has
occurred despite reductions in capacity. It is attributed by police and football authorities and by supporters’
organisations to greater confidence by the decent majority o f spectators that violence in the ground is under
control.

  281. These welcom e signs must be seen in perspective. Disorder in the ground has been, for the m ost part,
controlled not elim inated. There have still been occasional outbursts o f violence in recent m onths. All that
can be said with confidence is that the police are now much better equipped and informed to deal with
hooligans than they were three years ago and their operations have been more successful in controlling
disorder.

CCTV
  282. In particular, the installation o f CCTV has greatly ,improved police surveillance o f the crowd both
inside the ground and at the turnstiles.

   283. In 1985, after the Bradford Disaster, the Football Trust made funds available to install CCTV at all
first and second division football grounds. Unfortunately, the systems initially installed, although the best
available at the time, proved to be o f inadequate quality for identification purposes. Moreover, operators
initially lacked the training and expertise necessary to make effective use o f the equipm ent.

  284. A number o f clubs now have better equipment and most o f the remainder o f the 92 clubs in the
League have applied to the Football Trust for funding to enable them to do likewise. The Football Trust, not
unnaturally, wish to be sure the m oney will be well spent. They have therefore asked that an agreed
specification should be laid down as to the quality o f the CCTV to be installed. ACPO hope to provide this as
soon as possible.                                                                     ;

  285. In the two years ending June 1989, about 200 operators were trained in the use o f CCTV at matches.
A training video is also available to all police forces.

  286. Already, CCTV has had a major impact on the hooligan problem inside football grounds as well as
proving extremely useful to m onitor safety measures. If any trouble appears on the screen or is reported from
any quarter o f the ground, the CCTV can zoom in on the incident. The police can then record what occurs on
colour video and on hard copy prints. Individuals can be picked out by facial appearance and the colour o f
their clothing. The evidential effect o f such a video recording has proved formidable. It has persuaded
hooligans, who would previously have sought to challenge oral evidence o f identification, to plead guilty.
Hooligans know cameras are keeping a roving watch and their activities in the ground are inhibited by that
knowledge. Police evidence suggest that as a result o f CCTV surveillance and the police strategies it
facilitates, the more com m itted hooligans now concentrate their activities outside the ground, attacking
opposing fans on their way to or from matches.

N ational Football Intelligence Unit
   287. ACPO have for som e years encouraged the developm ent o f an intelligence network nationwide. A
national index o f football liaison officers was set up to collect, record and pass on information about the
behaviour, past and anticipated, o f club supporters, especially the hooligan element. Thus, before a match,
th e police responsible for it can receive information from the football liaison officer in the visiting club’s area
as to the propensities o f the visiting supporters and any known plans any elem ent am ong them may have.
Although this schem e has proved useful, the need was recognised for a central unit equipped with a computer
to gather, record and disseminate intelligence. ACPO, in their written submission, say:-


                                                        48
 “Hooligan gangs operate across a wide area and may o f course be involved in criminal cscapadcs in any
 town between their point o f departure and the venue o f the fixture. Furthermore, in recent times there is
 good evidence that they will often plan criminal violence which has nothing whatever to do with football.
 There is a need to overview such events to identify patterns and recognise what is behind seemingly
 unconnected events.”

  288.     The N ational Football Intelligence U nit has now been set up. It is based in London; staff are in post;
the Unit is being funded by the H om e Office. It is hoped the computer will be installed shortly. The U nit will
then be o f great value in dealing not only with dom estic football-related crime but also with hooligans
travelling to matches abroad.

                                             O F F E N C E S IN T H E G R O U N D

   289. Although incidents o f physical violence inside grounds are now much fewer, there remains an
undercurrent o f unruly behaviour which can and occasionally does result in disorder. Three activities in
particular have this potential: (i) throwing coins and other m issiles (ii) chanting obscene or racialist abuse
(iii) going onto the pitch w ithout reasonable excuse.

    i.    There can be no possible excuse for hurling m issiles at a sports ground. It is not only dangerous in
          itself. It may and often does incite others to do likewise; that may and often does provoke retaliation.
          Violence may then escalate.                                  -

    ii.   N o-one could expect that verbal exchanges on the terraces would be as polite as those at a vicarage
          tea party. But shouting or chanting gross obscenities or racialist abuse ought not to be permitted. If
          one starts, ot hers join in, and to the majority o f reasonable supporters, as well as to those abused, the
          sound o f such chants from numbers in unison is offensive and provocative.

    iii. Running on the pitch often provokes and is the prelude to disorder. This is not just because it
         interrupts the game or because it invades the hallowed turf. It is often done with the intention o f
         attacking som eone. Even if the invasion is not with intent to attack the referee, a player or opposing
         fans, it tem pts others to follow suit. If rival fans com e onto the pitch violence will probably break
         out. Even if they do not, there may well be violent exchanges with police seeking to repel the
         invaders. A fan may run onto the pitch merely to congratulate a goal scorer. But his action could well
         provoke opposing fans (displeased by the goal anyway) to invade the pitch with less benign intent.

  290. Ought not these activities therefore to be made ciim inal offences? This has been raised before. Mr
Justice Popplewell considered the same three activities. After discussing whether they should be made
separate offences, he concluded, on analogy with the Scottish “breach o f the peace”, that a sim ple offence of
disorderly conduct at a sports ground would sweep up not only the three activities m entioned above but other
disorderly activities too. He concluded, at paragraph 4.74 o f his Final Report, as follows:

  “4.74 Quite clearly a new .offence in England and Wales o f disorderly conduct or breach o f the peace on
  the lines o f the Scottish com m on law offence, would be o f substantial assistance in dealing with
  hooliganism. It w ould avoid the problem o f trying to define all the different types o f behaviour which give
  rise to disorder at football matches and would undoubtedly enable the police to take action much earlier
  than they can under the present law. This offence should be confined to sports grounds where the
  disorderly conduct is likely to have such a devastating effect on crowd safety. Disorderly conduct would
  clearly include throwing a missile, running onto the pitch, seeking to clim b over or to pull down a perimeter
  fence, shining a mirror towards a batsman, throwing bottles or cans onto the field o f play, or interfering
  with a greyhound or horse race. I suggest that it should be triable summarily and there should be a power of
  arrest. I reco m m end , therefore, th a t c o n s id e ra tio n s h o u ld be g ive n to c re a tin g an offence o f d is o rd e rly
  co n d u c t a t a spo rts g ro u n d ."

  291. This recom m endation was not taken up. At the tim e Mr Justice Popplewell reported, the Public Order
Act 1986 was in preparation. It created new offences relating to public order but none specifically related to
conduct inside sports grounds. Evidence from the H om e Office gives two reasons for this. First, it was thought
wrong in principle to treat football or sports grounds as a special case. Secondly, it was apparently thought that
the provisions o f the 1986 Act, especially section 5, sufficiently covered the field.

   292. As to the first reason, one must surely look at the nature o f the mischief. The three specified activities
would, o f course, be an anti-social nuisance anywhere. But at a designated sports ground they are fraught
w ith potential disorderly consequences. There is good reason therefore to treat as a special case the
prohibition o f these activities at such grounds. By analogy, having alcohol in one’s blood over a fixed limit
has been made an offence only in relation to driving, because it is dangerous to the public in that special
context.

  293. The second reason requires an examination o f sections 4(1) and 5(1) o f the 1986 Act. So far as is
relevant, these provide as follows:-

  “4(1) A person is guilty o f an offence if h e -

      (a) uses towards another person threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour . . .
         with intent to cause that person to believe that im m ediate unlawful violence will be used against him
         or another by any person, or to provoke the im m ediate use o f unlawful violence by that person or
         another, or whereby that person is likely to believe that such violence will be used or it is likely that
         such violence will be provoked . . .

  5( 1) A person is guilty o f an offence if he -

   (a)   uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour . . .
         w ithin the hearing or sight o f a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby”.

  294. Throwing m issiles could only be caught under section 5 as “disorderly behaviour” if the additional
elem ent were proved that it was “w ithin the hearing or sight o f a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm
or distress thereby”. To adduce evidence o f this last elem ent m ay be very difficult indeed. It should surely be
sufficient to show that the accused threw a m issile at a football match.

     295. As to obscene or racialist chanting similar difficulties arise. Although the chanting may be proved
abusive or insulting it would also have to be shown, under section 4, that it was used “towards another person
. . . with intent to cause that person to believe that im m ediate unlawful violence will be used against him etc”.
P roof o f those elem ents may not be possible.

  296. U nder section 5, whilst again the chanting may be proved to have contained “abusive or insulting
words”, it may be difficult to show that this was done “w ithin the hearing or sight o f a person likely to be
caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby”. The words m ay cause nothing other than disgust.

  297. N or does section 18 o f the Act help. U nder the heading “Acts intended or likely to stir up racial
hatred”, the section provides as follows so far as is relevant:-

  “ 18(1) A person w ho uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour . . . is guilty o f an offence
  if-

    (a) he intends thereby to stir up racial hatred, or

    (b) having regard to all the circumstances racial hatred is likely to be stirred up thereby”.

  298. Racialist abuse o f the kind chanted at football m atches is probably not intended to stir up racial
hatred. N or could it readily be proved that racial hatred was likely to be stirred up. The effect o f such
chanting is to give cheap and ignoble am usement to those participating whilst causing offence and
embarrassment to those abused and to the decent majority o f fans.

  299. For these reasons, I do not consider that the activities w hich Mr Justice Popplewell concluded should
be the subject o f a criminal offence are covered by the 1986 Act. H e set out the arguments for and against
legislation to prohibit them at paragraphs 4.42 to 4.74 o f his Final Report. I do not rehearse those arguments.
I agree with his conclusion that on balance, despite the difficulties o f drafting and enforcement, these
activities should be prohibited. Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that a “catch-all” offence o f disorderly
conduct at a sports ground should be considered. I appreciate the force o f his reasoning. However, I would
prefer to see separate offences in respect of each of the three activities I have mentioned. The object o f the
legislation must be not merely to prosecute offences when they occur but to deter them. If there is a specific
offence o f throwing m issiles at a designated sports ground, a separate specific offence o f chanting obscene or
racialist abuse there and a third specific offence o f going on the pitch without reasonable excuse there and, if
full publicity is given to the legislation, hooligans will know precisely what is prohibited and that they do
those things at their peril.

   3 00. As to going on the pitch, I have a reason for recom m ending prohibition additional to those which
 convinced Mr Justice Popplewell. I have recommended lowering the level o f fences and removing spikes and
 overhanging sections. That relaxation is made in the interests o f the decent majority o f supporters who have
 no yen to invade the pitch. To back up the lesser deterrent effect o f lower fences I think it prudent to have a
 crim inal sanction against pitch invasion.

   3 01 . I appreciate that at som e sports grounds there is a tradition o f running onto the pitch when the game
is over simply from jo ie de vivre or to pat players on the back. At Murrayfield, for example, schoolboys sit on
form s on the pitch side o f the perimeter fencing and run on harmlessly at the end o f the game. Again, going
onto the pitch to escape som e hazard on the terraces in an emergency should, o f course, be legitimate.
Accordingly, the offence should be aimed at prohibiting invasion o f the pitch without good reason or
reasonable excuse. T he police will in this as in many other situations have to exercise sensible discretion and
judgm ent.

                              CLUB STRATEGIES AGAINST HOOLIGANS

  302. Various club schem es to exclude hooligans have been undertaken or suggested.

Luton
  303. In March 1985, Millwall visited Luton with a large contingent o f “supporters”. Widespread disorder
broke out causing injuries to both fans and police. Serious damage was also done in and outside the ground as
well as to trains returning to London.

  304. Following this episode, Luton FC decided to adopt a H om e Only Supporters Schem e excluding away
supporters and allowing only Luton members and their guests to attend matches. I am grateful to the
m anagem ent o f Luton FC and to the Bedfordshire police who explained to m e the history, operation and
merits o f this scheme.                       ^

  305. Applicants for mem bership normally reside within 25 m iles o f Luton. Those further away must
justify why they wish to join. A m embership card entitles the m em ber to buy a ticket for entry, either in
advance or on the day, and to bring in with him up to three guests. The card has a bar-coding and must be
presented to obtain a ticket in .ad vance. To buy a ticket on the day, the card is “swiped” through a
com puterised reader by the m em ber at an outer set o f turnstiles at the Kenilworth Road end o f the ground.
Payment for a ticket is then m ade at another inner set o f turnstiles. Those mem bers w ho m isbehave are
deprived o f mem bership. A banned list is maintained on the computer. It consisted, at the tim e I received
evidence, o f only six names. If entry is attempted by using a banned card, a red light shows and the turnstile
will not open. A steward then escorts the holder to an office outside the turnstiles where the problem is
investigated.

  306. The schem e started in August 1986. The equipm ent installed initially proved unsatisfactory. Some o f
the problem s were: failure through condensation, delay whilst the reader checked the card’s validity, and the
fact that a Barclaycard could do the trick. After a number o f attempts at rectification, this equipm ent was
abandoned and a different firm o f suppliers was engaged. I should m ention that equipm ent from the first
source was installed at Plym outh where it also failed after a number o f attempts and the experiment was not
pursued further.

  307. The second system at Luton has proved effective after som e teething troubles. It has been working
satisfactorily now for nearly two seasons.

Benefits of the Scheme
   308. Both the club and the police are happy with the effects o f the scheme. The exclusion o f away
supporters naturally excludes the hooligan element which they would have included. But it also removes the
focus for the aggression o f any hom e hooligans. With no visitors to attack or bait, it is said that the hooligan
elem ents in Luton have faded away. They have not sought to join the scheme, nor d o they seem to travel to
away games. The town has also benefitted. Shops which previously had to board up their windows now enjoy
a peaceful Saturday trade which has increased by 40%. Arrests at matches have dropped from over 100 per
season before the scheme to nil. Police costs have been greatly reduced. The club accepts that initially there
was a fall in attendances, but claim s they are rising again. In 1985/6. average attendance was 11,100, in
 1986/7 it was 10,300. in 1987/8 it was 8,038 and in 1988/9 it was 10.039.

  309. T he list o f benefits is impressive and there can be no doubt that the schem e has been a success for
Luton. But would it be successful elsewhere?

  310. Luton is, in the football context, somewhat isolated geographically from other clubs, their fans and
their catchm ent areas. In this, its situation differs greatly from, for example, London clubs or those on
M erseyside, Greater Manchester or the Midlands. Hence the assumption that those within 25 m iles o f Luton
are likely to be natural Luton supporters. Luton also differs from clubs in the larger conurbations by size o f
crowds, their average numbers being only about one-quarter o f those at large clubs. The banned list is tiny. An
im portant feature o f the Luton schem e is the use o f outer and inner turnstiles for w hich the ground has ample
room. M any other grounds do not.


                                                        52
  311. At Luton, the card-holder him self “swipes" his card through. The club and the police acknowledge
that, if the card had to be passed to a turnstile operator to “swipe" it through, entry would be considerably
retarded. They also accept that the essential feature o f Luton's success has been the ban on away supporters
rather than the m em bership card scheme itself.

Ban All Away Supporters?
  312. If this is the touchstone o f success in elim inating hooliganism , why not introduce it generally and
have no away supporters at any football matches nationwide? This has been considered before and rejected.
Mr Justice Popplewell in his Interim Report recom m ended that:

  "Urgent consideration should be given to introducing a mem bership system in England and Wales so as to
  exclude visiting fans”.

  However, in his Final Report he m odified this and recom m ended that:

  “Consideration should continue to be given to som e form o f mem bership schem e for Football League
  clubs in England and Wales”.

  313. Clearly the G overnm ent has rejected the idea o f a ban on all away supporters which forms no part o f
the schem e o f the Football Spectators Act 1989.

  314. To exclude all away support would be a draconian step. It would halve the number o f matches fans
could attend. It would seriously dim inish clubs’ revenue and deprive football grounds o f a healthy
atmosphere o f rivalry, which some say is a casualty o f the Luton scheme. But perhaps the conclusive point is
that it would be impractical and possibly counter-productive in the campaign against hooliganism.

  315. To exclude away supporters from Luton is one thing. Those excluded can at least go at present to any
other match instead. But to exclude all away supporters from all matches and especially to exclude them from
“local derby” matches or matches in large cities could cause serious disorder. If Manchester City supporters
could not go to Old Trafford when their team plays there, or Chelsea supporters follow their team to
Highbury or to their neighbours Queen’s Park Rangers, trouble could result. There would be attempts and
devices to defeat the schem e and get into the ground in defiance o f it. There could well be disorder outside
grounds. The more fanatical supporters and the hooligans would be unlikely to stay hom e and play patience.

Away Members Only
  316. There is a halfway house between freedom for all com ers and a ban on all away supporters. This is to
make entry to sections o f the ground for away supporters by ticket only; tickets to be allocated strictly to
mem bers o f the away team ’s travel club and no tickets to be available on the day o f the match. This scheme
builds on an existing practice adopted at som e grounds for key matches, for exam ple the Liverpool v Arsenal
m atch in May 1989 to decide the championship. It also b uilds upon existing club membership schemes.
M ost clubs have a club membership scheme o f som e sort following an agreement between the football
authorities and the Government in February 1987, whereby all clubs were to introduce schemes covering at
least 50% o f each ground’s capacity by the beginning o f the 1987/8 season. Com pliance was patchy and
varied from a membership o f over 40,00 0 at Manchester U nited to one or two clubs which did nothing at all.

    317. The away members only solution encourages the prom otion o f membership schemes offering
discounts, favourable travel facilities and other benefits. It aim s to lim it away supporters to those, in effect,
vouched for by the away club. M isbehaviour would result in loss o f membership and thus exclusion from
future away m atches as well as loss o f other membership privileges. The schem e has the unanimous approval
o f the 48 third and fourth division clubs, given at their annual general m eeting in June 1989.

   318. As with any proposed solution to the hooligan problem, this schem e cannot be watertight. It has to be
recognised that any membership scheme is vulnerable to abuse arising from the loss or theft o f cards and
from the determined activities o f those wlio, for whatever reason, do not possess them. The away members
o nly scheme does at least hold out good prospects o f improving behaviour in the away supporters’ enclosure
since only those vetted by the away club will be allocated tickets there. That may deter others from travelling
but there may still be som e who are determined to travel and get in. On occasion, the FA has ordered that a
clu b ’s supporters having a bad record for causing disorder can be admitted at away matches only if they are
accredited m embers o f their own club. Leeds United is an example. This has, on the whole, proved beneficial.
However, on occasions, Leeds non-member supporters - perhaps those living near the ground Leeds United


                                                        53
are due to visit - manage to get tickets intended for hom e supporters at or from the ground. T hey then get
into the wrong end and cause trouble. This seem s to be what happened at Ayresome Park on..9 D ecem ber
1989. Much therefore depends upon the care and scrutiny given to ticket allocation by the home club. Often
it is too easy for segregation plans to be thwarted by ready availability to all o f tickets from the h om e club
whether at the box office or even by credit card over the telephone. I appreciate the difficulty o f identifying
surely hom e and away supporters but clubs should review their procedures with a view to tightening them.

  319.     D espite its imperfections, I consider the away members only solution has som e merit both in
excluding undesirables from away supporters’ enclosures and in encouraging the growth o f club membership
schem es conferring real benefits on members. It should b e given further consideration.

                       OTHER POSSIBLE MEASURES AGAINST HOOLIGANS

Exclusion Orders
   320. At present, pursuant to Part IV o f the Public Order Act 1986, a court, on convicting a person o f an
offence connected with football has power, in addition to im posing a sentence, making a probation order or
discharging him, to make an exclusion order prohibiting him from entering premises to attend any football
match. The exclusion order must be for not less than three months. If a breach is proved, the offender is liable
to im prisonm ent for one month, to a fine or to both.

  321. This provision has not made much impact. It has not been greatly used by the courts. W hen orders
have been made they have tended to be for too short a period. On one occasion, absurdly, Justices im posed a
three m onth exclusion order on an offender appearing before them in May! A great weakness o f a bare
exclusion order is the difficulty o f discovering whether it is being obeyed or flouted.

  322. By section 27(5) o f the Football Spectators Act 1989, the provisions o f the Public Order Act 1986
relating to exclusion orders shall cease to have effect when the Secretary o f State, by Statutory Instrument,
brings the 1989 Act into effect. So exclusion orders will go, to be replaced by expulsion from the national
m em bership schem e under Part I o f the 1989 Act and restriction orders under Part II, as I shall explain in the
next Chapter.

Enforcing Exclusion by Attendance Centre Order
  323. Were exclusion orders to be retained and used more realistically there are two additional measures
w hich could be taken to enforce them. First, there could be provision for attaching to an exclusion order a
requirement to attend at an appointed centre on the occasions o f designated football matches. Failure to
attend would im m ediately be detected and would render the absentee liable to further penalties including
im prisonment.

   324. Such a measure would have a number o f merits. A mere ban on entering grounds may be flouted
w ithout detection and in any event does not ban presence near the ground. An attendance centre order would
provide a m eans not merely to ban a hooligan from entry to a ground but to keep him physically from going
there. He would thus be prevented from causing trouble outside or near the ground as well as inside it. This
w ould be achieved without adding to the prison population, unless he defaulted, and w ithout any elaborate
schem e im pinging on spectators generally. The provision would be the logical counterpart in the domestic
scene to the provisions o f Part II o f the 1989 Act relating to foreign matches.

Is it Practicable?
    3 25. I appreciate that detaining convicted hooligans during designated matches in the dom estic football
 programme is a bigger undertaking and would im pose a more restrictive penalty than requiring them merely
 to report on the occasions o f English matches abroad. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the present
 structure o f attendance centres, what extension o f it might be necessary, the resource im plications and the
 fairness o f such a measure.

 Attendance Centres
   326. At present section 17 o f the Criminal Justice Act 1982 empowers courts to make attendance centre
 orders for young people under 21 who:

     (a) have been convicted o f an imprisonable offence;

     (b) have defaulted on payment o f their fines etc; or

     (c) have failed to comply with the requirements o f a probation or supervision order.

   A ttendance centre orders may not be used for those who have previously been given a custodial sentence
 except in special (undefined) circumstances. The m inim um length o f an order is 12 hours, except for those
 und er 14. The m axim um is 24 hours under 17, and 36 hours for those aged 17 to 20.



                                                         55
  327. At present there are 137 centres: 111 junior centres for those aged under 17, and 26 senior centres for
those aged 17 to 20 (males only). The senior centres are, for the most part, in-the larger conurbations. The
H om e Office has recently reviewed the use o f the junior centres and som e with low attendance figures are
being closed.

  328. M ost centres are in school premises. They are normally open for 2 (junior) or 3 (senior) hours every
other Saturday, usually, but not invariably, in the afternoon. Each centre is staffed by an officer in charge,
normally an off-duty or retired police officer, assisted by other instructors. Regim es include physical
education and at least on e other activity.

  329. Subject to these factors, attendance centre orders can b ejn a d e at present against those convicted of
football related offences. They cannot however be im posed on anyone over 21, or anyone w ho has had a
custodial sentence.

   330. Effectively to exclude the offender from football grounds, it w ould be necessary to have the centre
open at least on every Saturday afternoon during the season. To try to include week-day evening matches
w ould create difficulties in making centres available and might be thought too oppressive on the offender. If
power to make orders were extended to cover those over 21 and those w ho have served a custodial sentence,
the centre would have to provide for a more challenging type o f offender. It w ould probably be thought
inappropriate to m ix 17 to 20 year old attenders with m ore hardened hooligans.

Resource Implications
   331. Such an extension w ould probably involve an increase in the number and calibre o f staff. Presently,
as indicated earlier, staff include retired and off-duty police officers. More such personnel w ould be required
However, such increases might be m odest in com parison with the police resources likely to be required to
im plem ent the national membership scheme (see paragraphs 420 to 423 infra).

Fairness
  332. I w ould not suggest that the im position o f an attendance order should be a mandatory
accom panim ent to an exclusion order. It would be a discretionary power available to the courts to be used in
accordance with the sam e criteria as apply in Part II o f the 1989 Act, ie no such order could be m ade unless
the court was satisfied that making it in relation to the accused w ould help to prevent violence or disorder at
or in connection with designated football matches (c f section 15(2) o f the 1989 Act). This w ould enable the
courts to keep the numbers o f orders within manageable limits and to apply them only in serious cases where
the offender might otherwise be in danger o f a custodial sentence.

  333. In such situations, if the offender were judged by the court to be a com m itted football hooligan, and
were required to attend for say two hours each Saturday in the football season, to a m axim um o f 36 hours ( ie
nearly half a season) or even 72 hours, he could not surely have any just grievance. The order w ould b e less
harsh than even the shortest prison sentence and, from the public’s point o f view, much m ore effective.

   334. I recognise the practical difficulties in implementing extended attendance centre orders but, if those
difficulties can be overcome, the scheme would have considerable merits. I accordingly recommend that
consideration be given to implementing it.

Tagging
  335. A second possible measure to enforce exclusion from the ground and its environs is electronic
m onitoring or tagging. This device is used successfully in the U nited States. Pilot schem es are presently being
run here by the H om e Office. Accused persons on remand are kept under supervision using anklets with
sm all radio transmitters linked to a central computer. D espite reports o f som e difficulty with the pilot
schem es, Mr John Patten in an answer to a Parliamentary Q uestion on 10 January 1989stated:-

  “It is already clear that the technology can be put to practical use and that the procedures for fitting the
  equipm ent and m onitoring defendants are practicable. It w ould now be desirable to test the use o f
  electronic m onitoring on a trial basis in an area in w hich substantial numbers are likely to be eligible for its
  application as a condition o f bail.”

M oreover, you are reported as having said to the Bow Group on 11 D ecem ber 1989:—


                                                        56

                                                                                                                     1



      “There is a need for courts to have powers to make curfew orders, confining offenders to their hom es at
      certain times. This should not be a 24 hour house arrest. They need to be able to go to work if they have a
      job. attend training courses or probation centres, or receive treatment for alcohol or drug misuse. But some
      types o f crim e - pub brawls, for exam ple, or car thefts - could be reduced by curfew orders. 1 very much
      hope that our experiments with electronic m onitoring will enable it to be extended from defendants on
      remand to sentenced offenders, so as to make a curfew order properly enforceable”.

       336. If the experim ents do enable the tagging to be extended to sentenced offenders, it would be a most
     useful and effective way o f ordering convicted hooligans, excluded from grounds, to remain at home during
     designated matches. Their obedience to the orders could be m onitored w ithout excessive resource
     requirements.

        337. I therefore recommend that consideration be given to using this technology in the sentencing of
     offenders convicted of football-related offences.
                   PART IV - THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS ACT 1989
                                                 CHAPTER 12

                                 OBJECT AND PROVISIONS OF THE ACT

  338. The principal object o f the Football Spectators Act is to break the link between football and
hooliganism. It aim s to do this by a national membership scheme requiring spectators to purchase and hold
membership cards w ithout which they will not gain admission. Those who com m it relevant offences or
otherwise m isbehave in a football context will be deprived o f membership and thus be excluded from
attending matches. It is hoped that by this strategy hooligan activity will be elim inated both inside and
outside football grounds. Thus, Mr Ridley, then Secretary o f State for the Environment, said at the launch o f
the Bill on 17 January 1989:—

  “For the first tim e, there will be an effective and com prehensive procedure to keep hooligans away from
  football matches. O f course there will be attempts to abuse the system but if the scheme is effective, those
  attempts will fail. We believe that it offers the real prospect o f ending football hooliganism both inside and
  outside grounds. If hooligans know that they will not be allowed into football matches, they w ill have no
  incentive to travel to them. The link between football and hooliganism will be broken and football will
  cease to be a focus for violence.”

Provisions of Part I
  339. The Statute is an enabling Act and permits the Secretary o f State to make an order by Statutory
Instrument to bring it into operation (section 27(2)). I do not propose to set out all the provisions o f the Act in
every detail. In the broadest terms, however. Part I o f the Act is to the following effect.

  340. Section 1(5) provides for a national membership scheme (“the schem e”) to restrict “the generality o f
spectators attending designated football matches to persons w ho are members o f the schem e”. Section 1(2)
gives the Secretary o f State power to designate football matches or an individual match.

   341. Two new bodies are to be appointed by the Secretary o f State. The first is the Football Membership
Authority (FMA), a corporate body with articles o f association. The FMA is to be responsible initially for
drafting the schem e (section 4( 1)). The Secretary o f State is empowered to approve the schem e, again by
Statutory Instrument (section 4(3)). The FMA is then to be responsible for the administration o f the scheme
(section 3(1)). Section 7 disqualifies from becom ing or continuing to be a m ember o f the schem e anyone
subject to an exclusion order under section 30 o f the Public Order Act 1986 (after conviction o f an offence
connected with football) w hilst he is so subject. Also, anyone convicted o f a relevant offence, being one o f
those listed in Schedule 1 to the new Act, is likewise disqualified. Anyone so convicted is disqualified for five
years if he receives an im m ediate prison sentence and for two years i f not.

   342. The second body is a quango to be called the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) (section 8). The
FLA is to be responsible for the grant (section 10(1)) or refusal (section 10(3)) o f a licence to adm it spectators
to any premises to watch any designated football match there. It has power to im pose con d itions on the
licence (section 10(4) to (7)), to make inspections and inquiries (section 10(8)) and to vary a licence (section
 10(10)), suspend or revoke it (section 12). In making decisions under section 10. the FLA is to have regard to
w hether the equipm ent, the premises and the responsible persons there are such as to secure com pliance with
the scheme.

   343. The FLA also has ancillary functions, as noted earlier: first, to include in a licence, if the Secretary o f
State so directs, a condition as to seating (section 11); secondly, to keep under review and oversee the
discharge by local authorities o f their 1975 Act functions regarding football grounds and Safety Certificates
(section 13).

Contents of the Scheme
   344. Section 5(2) prescribes as follows:-

   “The scheme must include provision -

     (a) securing that the only spectators permitted to attend at designated football matches are authorised
         spectators;


                                                         58
   (b) providing for temporary m em bership o f the scheme, including (in particular) the temporary
       m em bership o f football club guests;

   (c) providing for the ad m ission as spectators at designated football m atches, w ithout their being
       members o f the scheme, o f -

          (i)   disabled persons, and

          (ii) accom panied children.

          in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as are specified in the scheme;

   (d) securing that persons w ho are disqualified under section 7 below are excluded from membership
       while so disqualified;

   (e) providing for the exclusion from membership, for an appropriate period not exceeding two years
       determined under the scheme, o f persons who are, by reference to circumstances specified in the
       scheme, determ ined under the scheme to be unfit for membership and for notifying persons who are
       excluded from m em bership o f the grounds for the exclusion;

   (f) im posing pecuniary penalties on any persons having functions under the schem e for failure to
       discharge those functions;

   (g) im posing requirements as respects the procedure to be followed in dealing with applications for
       m em bership o f the schem e and requiring that in Wales any application form for m em bership o f the
       scheme shall also be available in Welsh;

   (h) im posing requirem ents on responsible persons as respects the procedure to be follow ed and
       equipm ent to be used in relation to any designated football match to secure that, except in an
       emergency, the only spectators admitted to and permitted to remain on the premises are authorised
       spectators;

    (i)    to such effect, in relation to the adm ission o f spectators to the premises, as the Secretary o f State may
           specify in writing;

    (j)    establishing and m aintaining a central register o f members o f the scheme;

    (k) regulating the form and contents o f membership cards; and

    (1)    establishing procedures for the making and consideration o f representations against decisions made
           under the schem e refusing or withdrawing membership o f it and for the independent review o f the
           decisions in the light o f the representations;

and in this subsection “accom panied children” means persons under the age o f 10 years in the charge o f an
authorised spectator.”

  345. Section 5(3) prescribes, inter alia, that the scheme may make provision for the im position o f charges
for mem bership cards (section 5(3)(b) and by section 5(3)(c)):-

  “for the adm ission as spectators at designated football matches, without their being members o f the
  schem e, o f descriptions o f person specified in the scheme in such circumstances and subject to such
  conditions as are so specified”.

FLA , details o f offences, defences to them and appeals, Data Protection Act 1984 im plications etc.

Provisions of Part II
   347. Before proceeding to discuss the implications o f Part I o f the Act, which are highly controversial, I
sh ould refer to the provisions o f Part II which are not. Although I assume my remit is limited to sports events
w ith in the jurisdiction to which Part I applies, the scheme o f Part II is, I think,, relevant.


                                                            59
 348. The aim o f Part II is to prevent convicted hooligans from travelling to matches abroad including
matches in Scotland and there by misbehaviour causing trouble and damaging our national reputation.

   349. The scheme, again stated in broad terms, is to give courts power to make a restriction order after a
conviction for a relevant offence, in addition to any other sentence (section 15). Such an order is to be for five
years if it accom panies an im mediate sentence o f imprisonment; otherwise for two years (section 16(1)). It
imposes a duty to report at a police station (unless exem pted) on the occasion o f designated football matches
abroad. Failure so to report is an offence punishable on summary conviction by up to one m onth ’s
imprisonment, by a fine or by both (section 16(5)). There is provision in section 22 for making restriction
orders consequent upon convictions in countries other than England and Wales for “corresponding offences”
to those listed in Schedule 1.

   350. Even those implacably hostile to the provisions o f Part I are mostly in favour o f Part II. In my view it
is a sensible and practicable measure to take against a persistent m isch ief practised by a small minority but
with national repercussions. To adapt a famous dictum, never in the field o f sport has so much odium been
brought upon so many by so few. The scheme is. aimed directly and solely at the few whose misbehaviour
abroad brings such odium upon English football supporters generally. I welcom e it.

                                THE NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME

  351. Returning to Part I, it is crucial to a full evaluation o f its likely impact to know the terms o f the
scheme to be approved. At present there is no approved scheme, nor even a draft scheme, since the FM A has
not yet been appointed, although the FA and FL have been offered "first refusal’" for appointm ent as such. 1
do not know therefore how and in what terms such a.scheme would comply with the requirements o f section 5
set out above.

  352. The only guide presently available is the Invitation To Tender (ITT) and the Statement O f
Requirements (SOR) prepared by Ernst & Young, Management Consultants, in conjunction with the
Department o f the Environment. This document is directed to com panies which have shown interest in
tendering for the contract to supply the relevant technology. The ITT was dated I D ecem ber 1989 and
required tenderers to respond by. 19 January 1990. As I write this report that date is still ahead and so the
response is not known. Presently there are seven potential tenderers.

General Requirements of the ITT and SOR
  353. The successful tenderer will be required to set up, manage and operate a company, the “scheme
operating com pany” (SOC) to run the entire scheme. It will work under the overall policy, supervision and
control o f the FMA. At the outset o f the ITT, certain key objectives have been identified as follows:-

  “ 1. M inim ise the turnstile process time and the queuing problems that might occur in large crowds close
    to kick-off and keep them within acceptable limits.

    2. Fund the schem e, taking account o f its costs and also the possible disincentive effect to supporters of
    paying mem bership fees.

    3. Ensure the application process, card production and issue procedures m eet the requirements within
    acceptable turnaround times to spectators.

    4. Deal with invalid card holders at entry points and ensure that offenders against the membership rules
    are dealt with fairly and that any punishment can be enforced.

    5. Keep within manageable limits the size o f the referral file containing banned members to ensure that
    speed o f access to it is acceptable and still have sufficient protection against the use o f lost, stolen, forged
    cards and pass-backs on match days.”

   354. The SOR provides as follows:-

   “ Apart from ensuring financial integrity and acceptability o f the marketing strategy, the FM A will be
     concerned to ensure that:

     1.   the number o f supporters is maximised while recovering the cost o f the scheme

     2.   the scheme does not add to problems outside grounds

     3.   the scheme assists in reducing hooliganism.”
                                                               N


   That the scheme must be self-funding is further stressed in the ITT as follows:-

   “ The Football Membership Scheme will be self-funding, that is, the SOC will be responsible for all costs
     and expenses (including set-up costs) incurred in carrying out its obligations under the contract and
     shall reimburse the FMA for expenditure incurred by the FMA both on the SOC’s behalf relating to the
     scheme and in respect o f the FMA fulfilling the requirements o f the Act.

     The costs o f running the FM A will also need to be recovered from the incom e generated by the SOC.

     The levels o f membership fees including any variations over the period o f the contract, will be subject to
     the prior approval o f the FM A”.


                                                          61
Ground Modifications
  355. As to the cost ofground m odifications, the ITT notes:

  “It is anticipated that there could be a significant cost involved in accom m odating the membership
  validation system at som e grounds. Therefore any m odifications to be made to the existing turnstile
  equipment and the inclusion o f any new turnstiles should be entered against this item .”

Applications for Membership
  356. Applications for membership o f the scheme must be m ade in person, not by post, using a standard
application form. The form will include personal particulars and the type o f application. This may be for
adult membership, renewal, replacement, change o f details, temporary, junior or senior m embership. The
form will state the membership period (normally two seasons), the applicant’s nominated club allegiance,
second club allegiance and national allegiance. It will include a box to allow exclusion from any m ailing lists.
The Post Office and the clubs will act as collection points for handling applications and carrying out an initial
verification process. This will require the applicant to produce evidence to prove identity and one or more
passport standard photographs. The collecting agent will be responsible for checking the form, the
acceptability o f the photographs and their general likeness to the applicant as well as the other evidence o f
identification. He will also accept the fee.

  357. The SOR provides:-

  “Vetting o f applications at the point o f presentation in a collection agency must be consistent and methods
  to ensure that vetting procedures are followed must be employed. The integrity o f the system as an
  anti-hooligan measure will depend on this vetting procedure.”

  358. The SOR states that the major problem in handling the application will be to ensure that the attached
photographs are linked to the application details to enable the subsequent correct printing o f membership
cards.

Validation Procedures
  359. I concentrate on applications for adult, junior or senior membership. In these cases, the SOR
provides two basic validation procedures which must be followed. The first is a “person check”, explained as
follow s:-

  “The purpose o f this check is to stop supporters getting more than one membership card. The reason being
  that a ban on one membership registration would still leave the supporter in possession o f another
  m em bership card. Therefore there will be both a name and an address check against the membership
  registration database (postcoding o f all addresses will obviously make this procedure a lot faster and it may
  be necessary to insist upon postcodes from the start). Also it is not sufficient to undertake a straight name
  and address check due to different ways to spell nam es and addresses. The prime contractor should
  propose m ethods to ensure that adequate checking is undertaken against deliberate multiple applications.”

   360. Secondly, there must be a “referral file check” . The referral file will contain particulars o f the
following:

  “ - persons banned from membership (existing members)

    - persons who are considered to be undesirable due to their past record w ho have not yet applied for
      membership (this will include those with existing exclusion orders against them)

    - lost/stolen membership tards either by direct notification or due to an application for a replacement
      card

    - fraudulent copies."

Provision and Updating of Information to Clubs
  361. The national referral list will be com m unicated to all 92 League clubs. Moreover, the list will have to
be updated weekly during the football season to add fresh instances o f any o f the four categories o f exclusion
m entioned in the last paragraph: also, to remove from the list those no longer excluded eg after a successful
appeal.


                                                        62
  362. Each club will also be given the names of those successful applicants who have claimed allegiance to
the club. From this information the club will be required to keep a register of itsown members.

Exploitation o f the System
   363. The ITT provides for the FMA by itself or a designated agent to be responsible for approving and
co-ordinating the SOC’s commercial exploitation o f the National Membership File and extracts from that
file. This is said to be “in order to protect and promote the reputation o f football to avoid any possible
conflict with existing and future commercial activities at a club and national level". The FMA may also
liccnce clubs to use data relating to members who express allegiance to that club on terms and conditions to
be agreed.

Membership Cards
  364. It is mandatory that the membership card must carry a photograph o f the member, the m em ber’s
name, full m em bership number, the expiry date, club allegiance if any and national allegiance. The
mem bership number must be in a “machine readable form on the card as it is the only m ethod o f rapidly
enough matching the card against the national referral file”.

  365. The card will need to meet standards for size and durability; it will need to last for more than the
normal m em bership period (two years) as this may be increased later.

  366. The security level must ensure that:

  “ - cards are not forgeable

    - photographs cannot be replaced

    - m achine readable membership numbers cannot be changed

    - printed details on the cards cannot be changed

    - supplies o f blank cards are held in a secure environm ent.”

  All o f this assumes that the membership cards “will be the ‘plastic credit-card’ type”.

Entry Checking Procedures
  367. I now com e to requirements having a critical bearing on safety and crowd control. They concern the
checks and procedures at turnstiles. The following six provisions are mandatory:

     i     A spectator must present a valid current m em bership card to the turnstile operator.

     ii    “A spectator must be authorised to hold the mem bership card and be permitted to attend the
            designated match. (Note: it has been accepted that the turnstile operator will not be able to compare
            the photograph on the card with the person presenting the card as well as undertaking electronic
            checking).”

     iii   The card must not be “present on the referral file” and

     iv    can only be used “once per designated match.”
                                                               \

     v     “T he turnstile operator must not let any person into the match without them (sic) producing a
           mem bership card and validating that card using the procedures and equipment provided.”

     vi    “T he system should be capable o f directing members into their permitted sections o f the ground,
           using the primary and secondary'club allegiance field (unless playing each other) in the membership
           number to determine through which entry points the m em ber may pass.”

Turnstile Alarm
   368. If a card fails any o f the six basic checks summarised above, the system must alert the officials
(stewards and/or police). It must also be capable o f alerting the turnstile operator but not alerting the
spectator while in the turnstile.


                                                          63
  369. Three types o f failure are envisaged.

    (1) Referral file check shows the card is subject to a ban; card notified as lost or as stolen; alternatively,
        the card has been used previously at that match (pass-back).

    (2) Equipment/card malfunction, membership expired,temporary card not valid for match.

    (3) Card being presented at the “wrong” turnstile or n o card at all.

Detection
  370. The procedure to be followed in relation to each o f these three types o f failure is mandatory and
important in the evaluation o f the scheme for safety and crowd control.

  371. If the failure is o f type (1):-

  “The suspect should be apprehended and takenno an investigation area either inside or outside the ground.
  These will be situated at convenient places around the ground. It is anticipated that there will need to b e
  one investigation area on each side o f the ground, although this is likely to depend on ground conditions”.

  If the failure is o f type (2):-

  “The card will be retained at the entry point and a receipt for the card given to the spectator. This receipt
  will contain either the membership number or som e m ethod to identify the retained card later. T h e
  spectator will be advised to contact the club after the match when the problem m ay have been resolved”.

  If the failure is o f type (3):-

  “The spectator is turned back from the entry point”.

System Contingency
  372. Systems at turnstiles must be capable o f operating “a degraded service” in the event o f system
m alfunction. This must include replacement o f any malfunctioning unit within five m inutes and alternative
power supplies if the system relies on external power. If cabling is used it must be tam p erproof and more than
on e route must be provided between “every turnstile installed unit” and the processing unit. Turnstile
systems m ust not depend on a single club computer system.

Performance and Environmental Conditions
  373. Finally two mandatory provisions are laid down which are o f great importance to safety and crowd
control.

  374. As to performance the SOR provides:-

  “ It is critical that the conducting o f the six basic checks and any follow-up procedures described in this and
  the next section must give rise to no significant delays to ground entry at turnstiles. The m axim um
  additional tim e which will be considered will be no more than 1 second per entry to the normal ground
  entry rate for a particular turnstile and ground configuration at all tim es”.

  375. As to environm ental conditions, the provision is:-

  “ Any systems installed at turnstile locations will have to operate reliably in the conditions experienced in
  an outdoor, all-weather, all-year environm ent. Power supplies to turnstiles will be unreliable.”

Summary
  376. As with my analysis o f the statutory provisions, this summary o f the contents o f the ITT and SOR is
not exhaustive. It seeks only to indicate how the scheme is intended to work and what is expected o f it.




                                                        64
                                                              CHAPTER 14

                                    A R G U M E N T S R AISED BY CRITICS O F T H E S C H E M E

  377.     Having summ arised the intended objects and benefits o f the scheme and the m eans by which it is
required to achieve them . I turn now to the arguments against the scheme raised by its critics.

  (i) D is p ro p o rtio n a te ?
  First, it is said that the scheme with all its com plex ram ifications is out o f proportion to the problem.
  Setting up the technology and maintaining it secure and in working order, adapting grounds to install it:
  dealing with m illions o f applications swiftly; issuing m illions o f cards, renewing them, coping with lost and
  stolen cards: setting up a referral list, distributing it and updating it; training staff; coping with banned
  cards and other failures at the turnstile; processing offenders; dealing fairly with appellants - these, and
  other ancillary measures, am ount to an enormous undertaking. It is aim ed principally at keeping hooligans
  out o f the ground, but, so it is said, the problem inside grounds is less than it was and could be met by other
  less com plex and less am bitious strategies.

  (ii) U n fa ir?
  In aim ing to exclude a minority o f hooligans from the football scene, it is com plained that the huge
  majority o f decent spectators are to be put by the scheme to trouble and expense. Each fan will have to go
  through the application procedures, presenting his form, proving his identity, purchasing and producing
  photographs. He will have to pay between £4 and £10 a year to join the scheme in addition to paying for
  match tickets. He will have to keep his card, remember it on match days, guard it from loss and theft, and
  renew it from tim e to tim e for further payments. Should he forget it. or lose it, should it be stolen or become
  damaged, he will be put to trouble to replace it and to gain entry to matches meanwhile. It is argued that
  measures against hooligans should target the hooligans only, not inconvenience m illions o f spectators in
  the hope o f weeding out a few.

  (iii) C a s u a l S pe ctators
  There is anxiety that the scheme will, in effect, exclude from football the spectator who attends only on a
  casual basis or for a rare match which takes his fancy. Such a spectator, it is argued, would not go to the
  expense or trouble (especially the latter) o f buying a mem bership card simply to attend an occasional
  match. This category o f spectator is thought possibly to account for som e 20% o f present attendances -
  sizeable numbers to be deprived o f their present freedom to watch football.

  (iv) D im in is h e d C lu b Revenue
  Taking these lost casual visitors together with former regular attenders who may also find the scheme a
  disincentive, the clubs fear their revenue will be severely reduced. For this reason, inter alia, they have been
  strongly opposed to the scheme.

   (v) D a n g e r o f C o n g e stio n a n d D is o rd e r
  There is concern that the am bitious technology, which is yet to be produced and tested, may fail.
  Alternatively, that even if, by persistence and through trial and error, it could in the end be made to
  function reliably, there may be serious failures in the teething period. In either o f these events the fear is
  that congestion at the turnstiles could cause serious danger or disorder.

   (vi) W ill th e S chem e D e fe a t H o o lig a n s ?
   Even if the technology works according to plan, will it^a) exclude determined hooligans from inside the
   ground and (b) also induce them to stay away from the environs o f the ground? The criticism is that it
   may do neither o f these things, especially not the latter.

   (vii) P o lic e Resources
   There is concern, especially from the police themselves, as to the numbers o f police to be deployed and the
   facilities they will need at the ground to cope with problems arising from the scheme at the turnstiles.
   T h ese will involve banned cards, lost cards, stolen cards, unreadable cards and determined hooligans
   trying by various means to buck the system.

 In short, critics say the scheme proposes a sledgehammer to crack a nut; a sledgehammer which may not
 sw ing at all but, if it does, may not swing safely or even reach the nut.
Arguments Relevant to this Inquiry
   37 8. O f the seven arguments I have just briefly summ arised, the first four do not bear directly upon safety
or crowd control. They may have considerable force and (ii) and (iii) do bear upon matters considered in Part
I o f this Report (especially better treatment o f spectators). However, they raise issues o f policy which are
essentially for Parliament. Accordingly, I say no more as to those four points.

  379.    On the other hand, arguments (v), (vi) and (vii) do bear very relevantly upon safety and crowd
control. They are therefore within my remit and I shall explore them in turn.




                                                        66

                                  D A N G E R O F C O N G E S T IO N O R D ISO R D E R

Present R isk o f Congestion
   380. Congestion outside turnstiles and consequent injuries or disorder are already recognised risks. Those
risks are aggravated by the limited number o f turnstiles available and the limited scope for increasing them at
m any old grounds. They are also increased by the late arrival o f a large proportion o f the crowd, which is a
com m on occurrence.

  381. During the last busy 20 minutes before kick-off, queues, or som etim es a phalanx, o f waiting
spectators, tend to build up. If the delivery through the turnstiles is delayed or slowed down, that build-up
grows and its pressure further retards the turnstile operation. The next stage is that those waiting becom e
restive, fearing they will not get in for the kick-off. Crowd noise from the ground, denoting that the team s are
out, increases impatience. There is then real danger o f pressure towards the turnstiles causing injuries and
panic causing disorder. This is what happened at Hillsborough. It is said that it nearly happened again,
despite Hillsborough and the interim recom m endations, at Coventry on the first day o f the new season.

Additional Time to Check Cards
  382. These risks have existed even without a national membership scheme. Since the scheme requires
that all spectators passing through the turnstiles must produce their membership cards for checking, it is
inevitable that som e additional time will be taken for each spectator.

   383. In realistic acknowledgement o f the risk this might create, the ITT states as its first key objective:-

  “M inim ise the turnstile process tim e and the queuing problems that might occur in large crowds close to
  kick-off and keep them within acceptable lim its”.

   The SOR likewise requires the FMA to ensure:-

   “T h e schem e does not add to problems outside grounds”.

   M ore specifically, I repeat the mandatory provision o f the SOR as follows:-

   “It is critical that the conducting o f the six basic checks and any follow-up procedures ... must give rise to
   no significant delays to ground entry at turnstiles. The m axim um additional tim e which will be considered
   will be no more than 1 second per entry to the normal ground entry rate for a particular turnstile and
   ground configuration at all tim es”.

  384. Even if this is achieved, it would reduce the numbers per hour admissible through a turnstile from
the norm o f 500 (m entioned in Appendix 3 at paragraph 33) to about 436.

   385. But can it be achieved? This depends upon two factors: (i) what has to be done at the turnstile; (ii)
 whether the technology can achieve the required rate; not only in favourable conditions but in real life and
 despite attempts to defeat it.

     (i)   P rocedures a t th e T urnstiles
   386. The six entry checks which have to be undertaken at the turnstile (see supra paragraph 367) require
 the spectator to “present a valid current membership card to the turnstile operator”. So, in the normal case,
 there will be a passing o f the card to the operator, a validation o f it by him, and a return o f the card to the
 holder - all o f this to be additional to buying a ticket or (at an all-ticket match) presenting a ticket and having
 the stub returned.

   3 87 . The system as prescribed in the ITT depends upon the operator getting possession o f the card
 because it has to be “retained” at the turnstile i f there is a failure o f type (2) eg malfunction or card expired.
 This requirement is significant when one is dealing with a tim e factor not to exceed 1 second. The schem e is
 unlike that at Luton, for example, which must be quicker since (a) there are two sets o f turnstiles with an
 operator only at the inner set and (b) the m ember swipes his own card through at the outer turnstile. If the
 ITT were to be changed to follow the Luton example, however, what would happen at grounds where there is


                                                            67
insufficient space for two sets o f turnstiles and how w ould the operator get possession o f the card so as to
“retain” it if there were a malfunction?

  388. If the turnstile alarm alerts the operator to a failure o f type (1) - a banned, lost or stolen card or
pass-back - the suspect is to be apprehended. The turnstile operator will therefore have no more to do with
him; but how long it will take to have the suspect apprehended inside or outside the turnstile-will depend on
the police presence to which I shall turn later.

  389. If the failure is o f type (2), apart from retaining the card, the operator is required to give the holder a
receipt for it which “will contain either the m em bership number or som e other m ethod to identify the
retained card later”. Since the operator will be unable to anticipate the card numbers o f those which fail fora
type (2) reason, he cannot have a receipt ready in advance. If he has to make one out, hand it to the entrant
and explain the procedure for redeeming the card later, the exercise would take considerably longer than 1
second - especially if, as would be likely, there is som e backchat.
                                                   S.
  390. It is true that the SOR requirement that the schem e must add no more than 1 second to the turnstile
time, although said to be mandatory and critical, could be changed. However, in m y view the authors o f the
SOR were right to choose 1 second as “the m axim um additional tim e which will be considered”. At 500 per
hour, each entrant has 7.2 seconds to go through the turnstile. A n y additional time could cause difficulty; 1
second is an addition o f nearly 14% to the existing 7.2 seconds and more than 1 second would, as the SOR
says, be unacceptable.

  391. If the failure is o f type (3) - wrong turnstile: no card - the ITT requires that “the spectator is turned
back from the entry point”. The evidence I heard at Sheffield from many police witnesses, and all I have seen
and read since, makes it clear that where there are queues, let alone a phalanx, trying to get som eone who is
wedged in the narrows o f a turnstile back through those waiting is at best a slow, laborious and unpopular
exercise. At Hillsborough, the crush made it impossible.

    (ii) T h e T echnology
  392. It has yet to be shown that a computerised system can be produced w hich is capable, even in
favourable conditions, o f achieving reliably the requirements o f the ITT. So far as I am aware, nowhere has a
computerised system been installed to cope with the m assive numbers o f people, in the short period o f time
and in the all-weather context which will be required by th is scheme, quite apart from the added problems o f
attempted disruption. The scheme therefore invites tenderers to break new ground. The fact that it has not
been done before does not, o f course, show that it cannot be done. But it does require greater caution and a
more extensive testing procedure than if there were a successful precedent.

  393. The only comparable exercise which has been attem pted was a Football Identity Card Schem e in
Holland. That failed in its early stages and has been shelved. However, I should stress that the Dutch scheme
was very different from that proposed under the 1989 Act. It involved only five clubs with a bad history o f
hooliganism and it applied only to the away matches o f those clubs. Only 25,000 cards were issued. Much
depended on careful control o f ticket sales. The scheme was introduced at the start o f the 1989/90 season.
Unfortunately, the opening matches o f the season featured two o f the five clubs hosting two o f the others.
Ticket sales were not controlled effectively, the clubs were hostile to the scheme, away supporters were
admitted without tickets and supporters on both sides com bined to defeat the experiment.

  394. In these circumstances, I do not think that the failure o f the Dutch scheme can found a fair argument
against the totally different scheme proposed in the 1989 Act. What it does show is the need to make any such
schem e p roof against wrecking tactics.


Demonstration
   395. One o f the seven potential tenderers gave a dem onstration to a Parliamentary group using a
laboratory prototype to show the technology they could deploy. That being so. a similar dem onstration was
arranged for m e and my Assessors. We were shown a "smart-card” and how it could be programmed and used
as a football mem bership card. Each "smart-card” contains its own mini-computer. Much information can
be stored inside it. The demonstration showed the holder passing the card over a reader and the possible
responses o f red, amber or green light, depending on whether the card was valid, doubtful or invalid.
Advertising possibilities and other packages o f benefits were also explained and illustrated.


                                                         68
  396. I was extremely impressed by what we were shown. However, this was a single card, at a single
simulated turnstile, in warm, dry, indoor conditions, without a large national referral file to be searched and
without anyone trying to circumvent or wreck the system.

Police Apprehensions
  397. I quote from the written evidence submitted by A C P O :-

  “The question, however, which m ost concerns police officers relates to the efficacy o f the technology. The
  (Act) naturally does not detail how it will work or what is required o f it but, it is clear that, unless it is robust
  and virtually trouble-free, it will be counter-productive. In the worst case it could be massively
  counter-productive. At the least each turnstile must have access to a national database and must be able to
  survey that database almost instantaneously. The m achine itself must be durable against sabotage . . . and
  must work without persistent fa u lt.. . .

  All our experience to date has been that computer salesm en have offered much and delivered little. The
  police feel that they must be involved in the specification for any technology and w ould need to be satisfied
  that it works before support could be given to this scheme. The consequences o f repeated failure, hostile
  queues, interminable delays and the rest, are unthinkable”.

Computer Reliability
  398. The concern expressed in that passage about com puter performance is not unduly cynical. Many
people have personal experience o f com puter failures in one field or another. The com puter “going dow n” at
an airport causing delays at check-in, com puter errors in banks, problems with com puterised entrances to the
London Underground, and, recently, com puter “viruses”, are merely a few examples. These problems
continue to occur from tim e to tim e even with computer systems which have been thoroughly tested, which
are widely used and have long ago passed through what was thought to be the teething period. In many cases
such failures cause delay or annoyance but not danger. The technology for the present scheme, however, has
not yet been through the stage o f teething troubles. Moreover, the scheme could cause dangerous build-ups if
the technology either failed wholly or failed to work at the stipulated rate. In the London Underground,
where build-ups were occurring, a m anned entrance channel has had to be provided at many stations
alongside those which are com puterised, as a safety valve. To have to open extra non-computerised entrances
at football grounds would (unlike the Underground) scupper the system. Its whole and sole point is to exclude
hooligans by com puter checking.

  399. In fact, the Act seem s to leave it open to the FMA to include in the scheme power for a person in
authority to open gates and let spectators in, whether they have membership cards or not, should an
emergency arise (section 2(2), section 5(2)(h), section 5(3)(c) and section 10(12)(a)). If the exercise o f that
power should have to be considered, all the problems which arose outside Hillsborough would arise again
- deciding whether the power should be exercised or not; if so, at what moment and by whom; making a clear
decision and com m unicating it; coping with the,in-rush and the loss o f control and o f segregation it may
cause. If the power had to be exercised, the scheme would be discredited at that place on that day and perhaps
generally.

Relaxation in an Emergency
  4 0 0 . I said in the last paragraph that the Act “seems to include power” to relax the turnstile requirements
in an emergency. But the power is only to be inferred by implication from the four sub-sections I have cited.
N ow here is the power expressly given; nor is it said who shall exercise it or how “an emergency” is to be
interpreted. The adm ission o f authorised spectators only, and only by production o f their membership cards,
seem s to be fundamental to the scheme. Yet there is no stipulation in the Act that cards have to be produced.
N o doubt this could be provided for in the approved scheme. But since anyone other than an authorised
spectator com m its a criminal offence by entering the ground, admitting a non-authorised spectator is a
serious matter and could am ount to aiding and abetting a criminal offence. It is therefore surprising that the
Act d o es not indicate who is to have power to declare an emergency so as to admit all and sundry and in what
circumstances.

 Tests
    4 0 1 . What testing ;s envisaged? T he ITT provides for a “system testing strategy”. This is divided into
 “laboratory" prototypes and pilot system tests. Two clubs have volunteered and been accepted to be the pilot
 sites for the latter form o f testing. They are Derby County and Reading. It is envisaged that at least four
 different levels o f test will be carried out at each o f the two clubs. These four levels are likely to be:
    i     issue membership cards to existing members;

    ii    issue cards to all hom e or away supporters;

    iii   small all-ticket match (hom e and away supporters);

    iv    large (near capacity) all-ticket match.

  402. The ITT provides:

  “Each test will try to sim ulate as close (sic) as possible the live situation with problem cards being used at
  random”.

  403. I foresee two problems which beset this testing procedure. First, the difficulty o f making the test
conditions truly simulate those which will obtain when the scheme is working nationwide. For example, only
two clubs are to be used for the tests “with problem cards being used at random”. U nless the computers at the
two clubs have to search a referral list (whether real or sim ulated) as long as the national referral list may turn
out to be, they will not have been adequately tested for capacity and speed. The estimated volum e of
“banned” cards, according to the SOR, is between 5,00 0 and 20,000 per annum. The estim ate o f stolen and
lost cards is between 2 0,000 and 80,000 per annum. It is not clear whether “per annum ” refers to the
numbers on the referral file in any given year or to the num ber o f fresh bannings, losses and thefts each year.
Taking the more conservative approach, however, they could jointly amount to 100,000 per annum.
Accordingly, for a realistic test, the computers at the two clubs would have to be able swiftly to pick out the
“problem cards” from a list o f up to 100,000 - somewhat different from the Luton list o f six.
                                                             %
                                                             r

  404. The size o f the referral list may have an important bearing on the speed at which the technology can
work. I repeat that key objective number 5 in the ITT stipulates:-

  “Keep within manageable limits the size o f the referral file containing banned m embers to ensure that
  speed o f access to it is acceptable etc”.

   How is the referral file to be kept “within manageable limits"? Its size will surely depend upon the number
o f cards banned, lost or stolen. There can be no management control o f the numbers lost and stolen and the
number banned will depend on the number o f convictions or acts o f misbehaviour m eriting a ban. The only
way o f keeping the number banned “within manageable limits” would be not to ban all those who may
deserve it, which would bring the scheme into disrepute.

  405. The SOR estim ates that the number o f cards which are unreadable or otherwise require investigation
may be up to 3% o f the cards being checked. So at a capacity match with 50,000 present, the test would
require 1,500 m alfunctioning cards to be randomly issued. Presumably, the number o f unreadable cards
would tend to grow during the first two years o f the schem e as the first issue o f cards accumulates damage
from rough treatment.

  406. Again, with pilot tests at only two clubs, the hooligans’ response will be unpredictable. They may try
to sabotage the schem e at the pilot clubs which w ould really put the technology to the test. They may,
however, prefer to m isbehave at som e other ground where no tests are in progress. When the scheme is
im plem ented generally, they will be unable to go to any such “other ground” and may only then make their
attempts to sabotage the scheme.

Human Guinea-pigs
  407. The second problem is that tests can only be carried out by using real spectators. Bank computers and
other com puter technologies can be tested by putting through figures, data and print-outs. This system can
only be tested by putting through people. So in the very testing o f whether the system may cause danger,
danger may be caused.

Disruption and Sabotage
   408. The whole raison d ’etre o f the scheme is the perceived need to eliminate from football a hooligan
elem ent so substantial, and so determined to make trouble, as to justify this enormous undertaking. Since the
schem e seeks to defeat such determined hooligans, it must be assumed that the hooligans will seek to defeat
th e schem e. T hey will see it as a challenge. W recking or circ u m v e n tin g it will a d d a new p iq u a n cy to the
perverse pleasure they d eriv e fro m th e ir activities. M r R idley recognised this o n th e laun ch o f th e Bill, in the
passage I have q u o te d , w hen he s a id :-

  “O f cou rse th ere will be a tte m p ts to ab u se th e system b u t if th e schem e is effective, th o se a tte m p ts will
  fail” .

   409.       Accordingly, th e technology will n o t only have to b e capable o f fulfilling th e req u ire m e n ts o f the
sch em e w ith o u t m a lfu n ctio n , in all w eathers an d a t th e stip u lated speed. It will also have to be resistan t to the
in g en uity a n d d e te rm in a tio n o f th o se w ho m ay seek to sabotage it o r find a way r o u n d it. It will need to do
th ese th in g s n o t ju s t m o st o f the tim e, b u t all o f the tim e. T h is is a very tall order, a n d for the reasons I have
set o u t above, I have th e gravest d o u b ts if it can be m et. S ho uld it not be m et in full, th e safety im p licatio ns
w ou ld b e serious indeed.




                                                                 71

o r th e F M A b a n n in g h im after som e m isbehaviour. But to im p o se a b a n is o ne thing; to enforce it is another.
True, th e b a n n e d hooligan will n o t lawfully be able to e n te r by presentin g a valid m e m b e rsh ip card o f his
own, o n ce h e is on th e referral list. B ut he m ay still e n te r by o th e r m eans.

   412. A serio us defect in th e schem e is th e acceptance th a t th e en try pro cedu re will n o t involve checking
th e p h o to g rap h o n th e card against its presenter. Such checking is preclu d ed by th e n eed for speed. But th e
m a in ra tio n a le o f having a p h o to g raph o f th e m e m b e r o n his c a rd is defeated if it ca n n o t b e relied upon to
exclude so m e o n e else from using th e card an d will be checked only sh ou ld th e u ser la te r b e ap p re h e n d e d for
an offence. So if a b a n n e d hooligan ca n get hold o f a valid card he could gain entry. N o t being scrup u lo us fcy

develop. D esp ite req u irem en ts in th e IT T to p revent such abuses, m u ltip le ap p lica tio n s a n d forgeries m ay

   413. It is n o th in g to th e p o in t to say th a t if a b an n e d -h o o lig a n enters th e g ro u n d by using a stolen or
b orro w ed ca rd a n d is th e re arrested for an assault, he will have c o m m itte d n ot o n e b u t tw o offences, the

th a t if h e so enters a n d is not seen to co m m it a n offence in th e gro u n d , all is well. At th e very least, th e system
is b ro u g h t in to d isre p u te w hen he brags to his m ates th a t he has b ea te n it. Police ev iden ce suggests, moreover,
th a t th e m o re sinister m e m b ers o f hooligan gangs often d o n o t use violence them selves, b u t, fro m a vantage
p o in t in th e grou n d, direct th e activ ities o f others.

    414. I refer again to the su bm ission from A CPO, a bo d y w ith special knowledge o f th e hooligan problem
a n d o f how hooligans are likely to react:-

      ‘T h e success o f th e proposals will eventually be ju d g ed at tw o levels.

      First, th e re is th e q u estio n as to w h eth e r this legislation w ill:-

        (a) progressively rem ove hooligans from the football g ro u n d s an d

        (b) d e te r th e allegiance o f th o se w ho are involved in tro u b le an d violence b u t do n o t necessarily attend

      processing m e m b ersh ip cards thro u g h turnstiles can actually be achieved.

      T h e police view over a long p erio d o f tim e has b een th a t these provisions are, to a g reat extent, m arginal to
      th e p ro b lem , if for no o th e r reason th a n they c a n n o t exclude th e possibility o f frau d by peop le w ho are. t y
      d efin itio n , hell b e n t u p o n d efeating the system, an d because it will take a very lo n g tim e before a significa nt

         (iii) th e gam e will be able to exclude m any o f th e very w orst offenders.

      N on eth eless, th e police view is th a t m any o f th e m easures th a t we have already ta k e n . . . are hav in g a
      significant effect a n d are far m o re critical to the p roblem o f hooliganism ".


                                                                       72

   415. 1 have alread y n o te d th a t hooliganism inside th e g ro u n d has been reduced, largely by CCTV, b u t has
b een tran sfe rred o u tsid e th e g ro un d. I refer again to th e su b m issio n o f ACPO:

   “Two aspects o f con trol have d o n e m uch to ch ange th e n a tu re o f hooliganism . T h e legislation w hich

   416. T his, to g e th er w ith o th e r police evidence I have received, shows th a t although football generally and
a m a tch in p a rtic u la r p ro vide th e occasion an d th e focal p o in t for hooligan activity, m a n y hooligans do not
regard it as essential to be able to en ter th e grou n d . T hey n eed th e converging crow ds an d th e inter-club
riv alry or en m ity o f a m a tch to set th e scene for th e ir violence. T h ey d o not need th e football itself. M r Ridley,
in his o b se rv a tio n s q u o te d above (p arag rap h 338) s a id :-

   “ I f hooligans know th a t they will n o t be allowed in to football m atches, they will have no in centive to travel
   to t h e m ” .

  H owever, exclusion from th e g ro u n d does n o t necessarily rem ove th e incentive for hooligans to tu rn up
there.

    417. I fear it m ay b e m erely w ishful th in k in g to assu m e th a t football hooligans, b an n e d fro m inside
g ro u n d s, will no t, if they are free to d o so, tu rn up a n d cause tro u b le outside, in public houses or in th e town.
It w o uld be su rp risin g if hooligans o f M r Ju stice Popplew ell’s group I (paragraph 48 su pra) were totally to

   4 18. It is argu ed by ad vo cates o f th e schem e th a t e lim in a tin g hooligans from ou tsid e th e g ro u n d , as well as

   420. T h e sch em e envisages th a t th e checking p ro ce d u re at turnstiles will let valid card holders thro u g h but

investig atio n a re a a t each sid e o f th e ground. Presum ably, sta ff th e re will be e q u ip p e d w ith th e m ean s to
investigate th e p ro b le m ca rd fully. It m ay then be necessary for th e suspect to be arrested a n d processed.
W hilst th e officer w ho h as a p p re h e n d e d him is away fro m th e tu rn stile through w hich th e su spect came,

  425. As has b een said m a n y tim es, there is no single m easure w hich will defeat foo tball hooliganism and
even a package o f m easures will tak e tim e to have effect.

  426. T h a t said, th e strategy I w ould suggest is to co n sid er relying u p o n a c o m b in a tio n o f all o r so m e o f th e
following m e a s u re s :-

     (i)   D ev elo p in g th e d etec tio n a n d ev id ential p o te n tia l o f C C T V an d the new N atio n al Football

           football g rounds;

      (iv) U sin g electron ic m o n ito rin g (tagging) for th e sam e pu rp o se.

                                                                    75
                             PART V - FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
All-Seated Accommodation
  1. The Secretary of State should ensure that spectators are admitted only to seated accommodation at
matches played at sports grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 in accordance with
the timing set out in Recommendations 2 to 4 below.

  2. Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the 1993/4 season at high-risk matches as
defined under the U EFA Regulations set out in paragraph 82 above.

  3. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 abQve should apply with effect from the start o f
the 1994/5 season to all matches at grounds in the first and second divisions of the Football League, the
Premier D ivision of the Scottish Football League, and at national stadia, subject to a reasonable extension of
time in the case of a club promoted to the second division of the Football League or the Premier Division of the
Scottish Football League. Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 20% of the
present standing capacity (such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8
below), the first 20% deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1994.

  4. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the
1999/2000 season to all m atches at all other grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 10% of the present standing capacity
(such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8 below), the first 10%
deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1999.

Advisory Design Council
  5. The Football A ssociation and the Football League should establish an Advisory D esign Council whose
functions should be:

    (a) to conduct and marshal research into the improvement and design o f football stadia;

    (b) to dissem inate regularly such information and expertise as they acquire in this field to members of the
        Football League and, on request, to other football and sports clubs in England, Wales and Scotland.

National Inspectorate and Review Body
  6. (a) If Part I of the Football Spectators Act 1989 is implemented, section 13 should be brought into force
giving the Football Licensing Authority the functions and powers therein specified (power to review the
discharge o f functions by local authorities). If Part I of the Act is not implemented or is substantially delayed,
other arrangements should be made for the discharge of the functions and powers in section 13 o f the Act by the
appointment of a body to exercise them.

      (b)       In either event, the body exercising those functions and powers in relation to association football
should also be entrusted with similar functions and powers regarding the discharge by local authorities o f their
certifying and licensing functions in relation to other sports grounds and sports entertainments pursuant to the
Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 and Parts III and IV o f the Fire Safety and Safety of Places o f Sport Act
1987.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
   7. W here a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
 should specify the maximum number o f spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

   8. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 o f the Green Guide
 (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

     (a) the maximum density permitted under paragraphs 221 and 222 o f the Green Guide (when the terrace
         or viewing slope is in good condition) should be 47 not 54;
    (b) the minimum figure specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 (when the terrace or viewing slope materially
        deviates from the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
        packed) should be 0 not 27;

    (c) in arriving at "the Green Guide figure", proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
        which should reduce the permissible density including those specified in paragraphs 220 to 224
        inclusive o f the Green Guide.

  9. Arrangements should be made:-

    (a) to lim it the number o f spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
        figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 8 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherw ise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.

  10. The maximum notional rate at which spectators can pass through a turnstile should be 660 persons per
hour, not 750 per hour as stated in paragraph 47 o f the Green Guide. The maximum rate for any particular
turnstile must take full account o f all circumstances including those given as exam ples in paragraph 47.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
  11. There should be a written statement o f intent, agreed betw een the club and the police, setting out their
respective functions as to crowd safety and control and in particular as to the filling o f each self-contained pen or
other standing area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
variation of the document in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

  12. (a) At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other standing
area (subject to (b) below), a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are
monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress
throughout the period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any
other steward or police presence. H e should have ready access to a police officer who can authorise access
through gates to the pitch under Recommendation 20 below.

      (b)       T h is Recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other standing area where the
spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not exceed one third of the area’s
maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, whichever is the lower.


Gangways
  13. Gangways should be kept clear, in accordance -;*ith paragraphs 97 to 99 o f the Green Guide. Gangways
should be painted in a conspicuous colour whether they are sunk or not. The Safety Certificate should require
that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they be painted.


Fences and Gates
   14. A ll spikes or similar constructions on perimeter or radial fences, and any sections overhanging or
returning inwards towards spectators, should be removed.

  15. Perimeter fencing should be no higher than 2.2 metres, measured from the top o f the fence to the lowest
point at which spectators may stand, and including any wall or other foundations forming part of the perimeter
boundary.

  16. A ll police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the standing areas and especially those with
duties under Recommendation 12 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
crowd densities, to the recognition o f signs o f distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
dem onstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different
crowd densities.

  17. There m ust be provided in any perimeter fence o f a pen or other self-contained area sufficient gates of a
minimum width of 1.1 metres to enable that pen or area to be evacuated onto the pitch in the time prescribed for
an em ergency evacuation o f that pen or area.


                                                          77
   18. A ll gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency E xit”.

  19. Where there is a perimeter fence in front of a pen or enclosure, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully
open during the period when spectators are in the pen or enclosure, wherever those in command feel that this
can safely be done. Whether they be fully open, partially open or closed, they should be kept unlocked
throughout the period when the pen or enclosure is occupied.

   20. Each gate in a perimeter fence affording access to the pitch from a pen or enclosure should be manned by
a steward or by a police officer when the pen or enclosure is occupied. W hether such manning should be by a
police officer or by a steward should be decided by the Police Commander. In either event, the Police
Commander should appoint one or more police officers with power to authorise access through gates to the
pitch immediately in the event o f an emergency.

  21. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there are
perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers o f spectators if
necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. W hether to use it should be a decision o f a
nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
  22. A ll crush barriers should be visually inspected each year for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found to be
affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

   23. The layout o f barriers in each pen or terraced ar.ia should be reviewed immediately (if this has not
already been done following the Interim Report) to ensure that it complies with the criteria contained in
Chapter 9 o f the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessm ent o f the maximum capacity figure for that pen or
terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 8 above, should reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
   24. The Secretary o f State should exercise his powers under either section 6(2) or section 15(A) o f the Safety
o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 so as to make mandatory in Safety Certificates those conditions specified in the
original section 2(2) o f the 1975 Act. So far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned “sh all” should be
substituted for “may”.

  25. In assessin g these mandatory requirements in the Certificate for a particular ground, the local authority
should follow the Green Guide criteria. Once that is done, the resultant figures and terms for that ground
should be specified in the Safety Certificate and no variation from them should be permitted other than by
formal revision.

  26. W here a local authority incorporates any provision o f the Green Guide into the Safety Certificate, other
than one within the scope of Recommendation 25 above, it should make clear whether that provision is to be
complied with absolutely or with discretionary flexibility.

   27. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate (if this has not already been done
following the Interim Report) by the responsible local authority, which should consult the club in respect o f
which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the ambulance service and the building authority.
Such a review should include an inspection o f the stadium. Its object should be to ensure that the operative
conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a
matter of urgency follow ing the findings and Recommendations in this Report.

  28. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports ground designated under the 1975 Act for
w hich no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

  29. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
Certificate should require to be renewed annually.

  30. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
amending and renewing Safety Certificates (if this has not already been done following the Interim


                                                        78
Report). Such review should require that there exists or is provided an accountable administrative structure
whereby the functions o f the local authority are regularly and effectively supervised by senior officers and
elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance with the local authority's rules.

   31. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group (if this has not
already been done) consisting o f appropriate members o f its own staff, representatives o f the police, o f the fire
and ambulance services and of the building authority. The Advisory Group should consult representatives of the
club and of a recognised supporters’ organisation on a regular basis. The Advisory Group’s terms o f reference
should encom pass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and
attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority, and an effective
procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular written reports for
consideration by the local authority.


Duties of Each Football Club
  32. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate o f flow measured (if this has not already been
done following the Interim Report). Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile
remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate anticipated.

   33. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such as
to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the turnstiles
within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity o f that viewing area should be reduced accordingly. Since
this Recommendation includes terms and conditions within the scope o f the original section 2(2)(c)(i) o f the
Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 it should be given effect in the Safety Certificate (see Recommendation 24
above).

  34. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be reached
and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile operators for this
purpose.

  35. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before, throughout and at the end o f a
match.

   36. A ll signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively reviewed (if
th is has not already been done following the Interim Report). It should, in relation to the arrangements for each
match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of
spectators to their appropriate viewing areas. Any redundant signs should be removed.

   37. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, sim ple and clear and should correlate absolutely with the
information provided in respect of each match both ouiiside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs should
contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

  38. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report) by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure
that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting spectators to the ground.

  39. Clubs should consider maintaining a record on computer of ticket sales before the day of the match, for
season tickets and tickets for all-ticket matches for seated areas, containing the names and addresses o f those
purchasing tickets.                                              N

  40. A ll-ticket m atches should be confined to those at which a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected.
W hen a match has been designated all-ticket, clubs should not sell tickets at the match and should take steps to
advise the spectators o f both clubs accordingly.

  41. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision o f pre-match
entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.

   42. Clubs should recruit and retain sufficient competent stewards. They should be fit, active and robust, and
preferably between the ages o f 18 and 55. Clubs should ensure that stewards are fully trained, aware of their
duties under A nnex B of the Green Guide and under the statement of intent (see Recommendation 11) and able
to perform them.


                                                          79
     43. The club should provide a police control room which is:-

        (a) well placed, so as to command a good view of the whole pitch and of the spectator area surrounding it;

        (b) of sufficient size for the commander, his deputy and enough officers to operate the radios, telephones
            and CCTV screens. There should be space for others who may need from time to time to visit the room
            eg other senior officers, club management or a member o f the emergency services;

        (c) well equipped with CCTV, radio and telephone facilities and, where necessary, sound-proofed against
            excessive crowd noise.

      It should be the duty o f the club to provide a room and equipment to the satisfaction of the chief officer
    nominated under Recommendation 44 below.



    Police Planning
      44. The C hief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated sports ground or more
    should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
    concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

       45. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground, and the pre-match briefing of all
    officers on duty there, should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any is
    detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

      46. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground should enable the police to cope
    with any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
    sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

      47. Police planning should provide that ticketless fans should not be allowed to enter a designated sports
    ground except in an emergency.

      48. Arrest procedures inside and outside designated sports grounds should be reviewed so as to keep to the
    minimum the period during which an arresting officer is away from his post.

      49. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
    Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

      50. Consideration in consultation with the club should be given, especially for high-risk matches, to the
    possibility of an early kick-off or a Sunday fixture.

       51. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television monitoring
    outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers at turnstiles
    or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled in the
    interpretation and use of these data.

       52. Consideration should be given to the provision of a specific training course for senior officers presently
    acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do so. Such a course should include training in the basic
    strategy of policing football matches.

      53. Police authorities should review the charges they make to clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so
    as to ensure that realistic charges are made. The H om e Office should take steps to ensure consistency of
    practice, subject to local discretion and the need to have regard to local circumstances.



    Communications
      54. There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
    received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
    priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be used,
    where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves.


                                                            80




I
  55. There should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate
with his senior officers round the ground.

   56. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines with
telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

  57. W ithin the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual areas
outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or w ith the w hole ground. Important announcements should
be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in the ground. This
arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every match.

  58. U se should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
   59. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
liaison concerning crowd safety at each designated sports ground.

  60. Before each match at a designated sports ground the police should ensure that the fire service and
ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of spectators
expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning the
control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control rooms of each o f the
emergency services.

  61. Lines o f communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from the police control room to the local
headquarters of all emergency services should be maintained at all tim es so that emergency calls can be made
instantly.

  62. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated sports ground of emergency vehicles from all three
services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility within
the ground itself.

  63. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for the
arrival o f emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why they are
required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
  6 4 . There should be at each sports ground at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators.
The club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.
                                                    4~


  65 . There should be at each designated sports ground one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms
and the equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking
professional medical advice and should be made a requirement of every Safety Certificate.

  6 6 . (a) At every match where the number of spectators is expected to exceed 2,000, the club should employ a
medical practitioner to be present and available to deal with any medical exigency at the ground. H e should be
trained and competent in advanced first aid. H e should be present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off
and should remain until half an hour after the end of the match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in
the police control room and he should be immediately contactable.

        (b)        A t any match where the number of spectators is not expected to exceed 2,000, the club should make
 arrangements to enable a medical practitioner to be summoned immediately to deal with any medical exigency
 at the ground. H e should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. The arrangements made should be
 known to those in the police control room. -

   6 7 . At least one fully equipped ambulance from or approved by the appropriate ambulance authority should
 be in attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

    6 8 . The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should be
 specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a requirement
 of th e Safety Certificate.
  69.    A “major incident equipment vehicle”, designed and equipped to deal with up to §0 casualties, should be
deployed in addition to other ambulance attendance at a match where a crowd in excess of 25,000 js expected.


Offences and Penalties
 70. Consideration should be given to creating an offence of selling tickets for and on the day o f a football
match without authority from the home club to do so.

  71. Each of the following activities at a designated sports ground should be made a specific offence:-

    i.    throwing a missile;

    ii.   chanting obscene or racialist abuse;

    iii. going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.
                                                  S.


  72. Consideration should be given to extending the courts’ powers to make attendance centre orders for
football related offences on occasions of designated football matches. The provision should be capable of
imposition on an offender aged 21 or over and subject to a maximum of 72 hours in the case of an offender aged
17 or over.

  73. Consideration should be given to the use of electronic monitoring (tagging) in the sentencing of offenders
convicted of football related offences.


Green Guide
  74. A s a matter o f urgency, the H om e Office should set up a body to revise the Green Guide in accordance
with this Report, these Recommendations and the Report of the Technical Working Party (Appendix 3).

  75. In any revision of the Green Guide, the values to be achieved by way of percentage recovery after the
required loading tests on crush barriers should be specified. Acceptable values for various materials should be
specified.

  76. W hen the Green Guide is revised, the need to inspect crush barriers for possible corrosion should be
specifically mentioned and emphasised.

We n o te th a t th e G u id e is n o t co n fin e d to football gro un d s an d sta d ia b u t includes guid an ce o n all spo rts

a n d for th a t rea so n n o t ad dressed in o u r R e p o rt, we recognise th a t efficient a n d effective stew arding is an
integral e lem e n t o f crow d co ntro l an d safety. O u r re c o m m e n d a tio n s com plem ent, r a th e r th a n su p p la n t, the

                                   R E P O R T O F T H E T E C H N IC A L W O R K IN G PARTY

T h e G re e n G uide
    1. T h e T echnical W orking P arty recognises th e valu able co n trib u tio n s o f successive ed itio n s o f th e G u id e
to Safety a t S ports G ro u n d s, co m m o n ly kn ow n as th e G re e n G u id e. Its scope a n d statu s are d escribed in its
in tro d u c tio n as follows: “T h is b o o k le t p rov id es gu id ance to ground m an agem en t, local a u th o ritie s an d
tech n ic al specialists such as engineers o n m e asu res for im p ro v in g spectato r safety a t existin g sports grounds.
It is a v o lu n ta ry guide a n d has no legal force” .

   2. In view o f th e variability o f existing sports g ro u nd s in fu n ctio n an d in scale, there are serious difficulties
in estab lish in g co m p re h en siv e a n d general regulations, b ac k ed by legal force, to cover all th e co m p lex details
o f d esig n a n d co n stru c tio n . A d heren ce to th e sta n d a rd s se t by B uilding R egulations should p rov ide a
m e a su re o f u n ifo rm ity in respect o f new w ork a t sports g rounds. N evertheless, th e T echnical W orking P arty is
stro n g ly o f th e o p in io n th a t a m u c h higher degree o f sta n d a rd isa tio n th a n presently prevails sh ou ld b e sought
in p ractice.

   3. It c on sid ers th a t a revised issue o f th e G reen G u id e sh o u ld form th e basis o n w hich a designated g round
o r s ta n d is certified by the certifying authority, a n d re c o m m e n d s th a t any d ep a rtu re s fro m its gu id an ce on
te ch n ic al p ro visio ns th a t m ay arise fro m local circum stan ces should be fully defined a n d sh o u ld be subject to
ap p ro v a l in w ritin g by th e certifying authority.                '

A C e n tre o f E x p ertise
   4. T h e G re en G u id e covers a w ide range o f m aterial, m u c h o f w hich concerns the physical ch aracteristics
o f g ro u n d s. Its successive issues have been p u b lish ed in response to a n u m b e r o f serious accid en ts a t football
g ro u n d s. T h is process has led to in c re m e n tal adv ances in the G u id e as experience h a s grown, b u t the
T ech n ical W orking P arty d oes n o t believe th a t such a process, although essential, is by itself sufficient to cope
w ith p rese n t-d ay req u irem ents.

    5. M an y B ritish football gro un d s were first co n structed a long tim e ago, an d im p ro v e m en ts have been
 in tro d u c e d largely o n a n in d iv id u al basis. A cen tral b o dy o f knowledge applicable to th e com plex design o f
such grounds has b ee n conspicuously ab sent alth o u g h a start h as now b een m ade. As a result, progress has
been piecemeal.

   6. T h e Technical W orking P arty considers th a t th is is a serious defect. A c o n tin u o u s a n d e x p a n d in g body
o f public knowledge, d raw n fro m th e relevant professional fields, is req u ired to p ro v id e a basis fo r good
individ ual designs a t m o d e rn stan dards. At a tim e w h en su b stan tial im p ro v e m en ts are u n d e r co n sid eration ,
including a h igher p ro p o rtio n o f seated ac c o m m o d a tio n , it is im p erativ e to establish a n d -to d issem in ate
rigorous sta n d ard s o f design i f ex p ectatio ns are to be fulfilled. T h e w ork o f o rganisations in o th e r countries,
including the C o m ita to O lim p ico N az io n ale Italian o (C O N I), can p ro vide a valu able reference. T he
Technical W orking P arty recognises, too, th e im p o rta n t w ork u n d e rta k e n in this co u n try by th e Sports
Council. Its recent guide to th e planning, design an d m a n a g e m e n t o f in d o o r aren as is a n o tew o rthy a ttem p t
to draw together a con sid erab le body o f research an d p rac tic al experience. Similarly, o th e r w ork o n o u td o o r
stad ia has tak en place a n d is currently p roceeding u n d e r th e C o u n c il’s aegis. It is im p o rta n t th a t resulting
p ublications should be w idely d issem in ated an d th a t any gu id an ce on o u td o o r stad ia sh o u ld m ak e p articu la r
reference to th e stru ctu ra l aspects o f safety, co m fo rt an d crow d control.

   7. T h e Technical W orking P arty therefore re c o m m e n d s th e fo rm a tio n o f a central body, u n d e r a title such
as th e A dvisory C o u n cil for S ports G ro u n d s, to p ro v id e an au th o rita tiv e source o f know ledge fo r all those
involved in th e design a n d co n stru c tio n o f o u td o o r sta d ia . A d etailed specification o f its stru c tu re and
fu nd ing is n o t p ro p o se d a t th is stage b u t, as envisaged, its m e m b ers w ould be d raw n from th e relevant
professional fields a n d w ould co m m issio n specialist a d v ic e w hen necessary. It w ould be in d e p e n d e n t o f any
Inspectorate. T h e rela tio n sh ip o f such a body to o th e r o rg an isa tio n s is a m a tte r for fu rth e r discussion, b u t it

th e B ritish tra d itio n o f sta n d in g o n terraces ru n s co u n ter to these in te rn a tio n a l requirem ents.

th e Technical W orking P arty recognises th a t, w hilst sta n d in g a c c o m m o d a tio n is n o t in trin sically unsafe, the

   10. In ad d itio n , it m u st be recognised th a t th e re are m a n y sp o rts (horse, g reyhound, m o to r racing a n d car

    11. T h e Technical W orking P arty recognises th a t the safe allowable capacity o f any viewing area, w h eth e r

Separation of Viewing Areas and Pitch
    17. T h e T echnical W orking P arty recognises th e im p o rta n ce o f physical b arriers as d eterren ts t o pitch

    18. T h e general p rincip le o f se p aratio n en do rsed by th e T echnical W orking Party is th a t th e m eans

im m e d ia te a tte n tio n sho u ld be given to the e lim ination o f this hazard.

    20. T h e T echnical W orking P arty rec o m m e n d s th a t the m a x im u m height o f p e rim e te r fences s h o u ld be

    21. A fo rm o f sep aratio n increasingly a d o p te d in new sta d ia is th e d ry m o at. To be effective, a d r y moat

S h o rtt K C to form a C o m m itte e to in qu ire, am o ng st o th e r things, into arran g e m en ts m a d e to deal w ith the
ab n o rm a lly large a tte n d a n c e s o n special occasions, especially attend ances at ath letic grounds. T h is arose
from d iso rd e r w hich o ccu rred a t W em bley S tad iu m o n th e occasion o f th e first C u p F inal on 28 A pril 1923.
T h e C o m m itte e re p o rte d o n 13 M a rc h 1924. T h e R e p o rt w as presented to P a rlia m e n t a n d p u b lish ed as
C o m m a n d P ap er 2088 at th e princely sum o f 6d.

   2.3 A b o u t resp on sibility for co ntro l inside gro un ds th e R e p o rt h ad this to say:

   “A s regards the general question o f the apportionment of responsibility inside the ground as between the
   police and the ground authority, the principle to be followed should, in our judgment, be that the police should
   be responsible for all matters appertaining to the preservation of law and order and that for arrangements for
   the convenience o f the public the ground authority should be responsible. It is, however, most important not
   only that the police arrangements should be under the control of a single officer, but also that the duties for
   which the ground authority is responsible should be assigned to a definite individual, who should be
   competent to give instructions and to deal with any incident which arises. If responsibility is definitely
   allocated in this matter it appears to us that, in ordinary circumstances, there need be no difficulty in this
   division of duties and that no disadvantage need result from the existence of dual control so long as the closest
   co-operation is maintained between the two authorities at all times. We are of the opinion, however, that if any
   emergency arises or there appears to be the slightest probability of a disturbance, it is essential that control
   should pass into the hands of one individual, and we recommend that, in the case of grounds providing
   accommodation for more than 10,000 persons, on all occasions when specially large attendances are
   anticipated or for other reasons unusual excitem ent is to be expected, arrangements should be concerted
   beforehand by which one individual can at any moment take control of the situation.”

   2.4. T h a t p ara g ra p h o f th e rep o rt c o n tin u e d :   f



   “T h e question in such circumstances would have become one of the preservation of law and order and we
   therefore have no doubt that the control should then pass into the hands of the senior police officer present,
   and we consider that such officer would be justified in any circumstances, whether in accordance with a
   pre-arranged schem e or not, in assuming control if he considered it necessary for the purpose of the
   restoration of order. A s part of the arrangements for this purpose we think that, in the very large grounds,
   there should be a central control box in telephonic communication with all parts of the ground and that the
   principal police and ground officials should be stationed there so that they may be in constant touch with the
   situation.”...(Paragraph22).                                -v

   2.5 A b o u t stew ards th e R e p o rt said:

   “W e understand that there is no uniform practice with regard to the employment of stewards at sports
   grounds, that in som e cases they are only used to show spectators into the seating accommodation, and
   that, in cases where stewards are employed for packing of the standing room, they are only employed when
   there are specially large crowds. We consider it desirable in the interests of safety that, for the purpose of
   handling a crowd, stewards should be employed in any case where the crowd is likely to approach the capacity
   o f the ground. For seating accommodation stewards should always be employed. It is in the highest degree
   important that any such stewards should be properly trained in their work and intimately acquainted with the



                                                                         97
  part of the ground placed under their charge. We doubt whether it is practicable to secure suitable men for
  this purpose unless they are given continual experience in the work, and we therefore recommend that every
  ground with a capacity exceeding 10,000 which provides terraced accommodation for its spectators should
  maintain, or have a call upon, an adequate staff of efficient stewards, and should ensure that they keep
  proficient by requiring them to perform duty at frequent intervals. Stewards should be organised as a
  disciplined body and should act under the control and supervision of their own officers. They should wear a
  distinctive badge of authority, which they should not be able easily to discard.” (P arag rap h 27).

  2.6 T he R e p o rt h a d this to say a b o u t p rec au tio n s ag ain st fire:

  “We have been somewhat surprised to find that in many cases Ijttle or not precaution is taken against the risk
  of fire in stands. We do not suppose that either the risk or the consequences of fire would be so serious in an
  open stand as in a closed building, but we consider it m ost important that adequate arrangements should be
  made to deal with any outbreak which might occur.” (P arag rap h 40).

b u t concluded generally:

  “We are assured that these governing bodies are only too anxious to secure that their sport is carried on under
  conditions which will promote the public safety, and we feel that at this stage it is safe to leave the matter to
  them.” (P aragraph 47).

The Moelwyn H ughes Report
  2.7 T he next rep o rt (published as C m n d 6846) aro se o u t o f th e d isaster at B o lton W and erers’ Football
G ro u n d o n 9 M arch 1946. M r R M oelw yn H ughes KC w as a p p o in ted by the then H o m e Secretary to co n d u ct

50.000 h ad b een expected. Because o f the press o f peop le in an enclosure two b arriers collapsed an d 33
people were killed.

  2.8 It is interestin g to observe th a t the previou s best atte n d a n c e at Bolton in the 1945-46 season h a d been
43.000 an d it was am p ly policed by a force o f 60. O n th is occasion there were 103 police to con trol 85,000
spectators, w hich is a b o u t 1/10 th o f the p resen t ratio o f police to spectators at football g ro un d s b o th inside
an d outside th e g ro un d .

  2.9 M r H ughes m a d e a n u m b e r o f rec o m m e n d atio n s. H e said:

  “Burnden Park is typical of most home grounds of the leading football teams in the country. They have grown
  stage by stage from humble beginnings on sites acquired when the large gates o f these days were not
  anticipated, or when the clubs had not achieved eminence. It would be idle to suggest that the grounds, or
  large sections of them, should be rebuilt, but if they are to be made reasonably safe and if the risk of repeating
  the tragedy of Burnden Park is to be avoided, then, I have formed the clear view that the following steps must
  be tak en . . . ” (Page 10).

   2.10 T h e re c o m m e n d a tio n s in clud ed inspectio ns o f th e enclosures, scientific c a lcu lation o f the m a x im u m
n u m b e r to be allowed entry, co un tin g th ose e n te rin g th e ground by m ech anical m eans a n d central
co -o rd in atio n o f th e system, all to ensure th e a d m issio n o f a safe n u m b e r o f spectators.

  2.11 So far as fu tu re regulation was co ncern ed the R e p o rt said:

  “The preceding safety measures cannot be secured without legislation. A Departmental Committee reporting
  on Crowds to a previous Hom e Secretary' in 1924 (Cd 2088) anaemically recommended that adequate
  provision for safety be left to the pressure of the governing bodies in sport. The most important of these was,
  of course, the Football Association, which had not deigned to appear before the C om m ittee. . .

  The legislation should empower the Home Secretary to issue general regulations for different kinds of
  grounds and the broad conditions necessary for safety.

   N o ground of any considerable size should be opened to the public until it has been licenced by, I suggest as an
   appropriate licensing authority, the local authority. T he issue of the licence would depend upon satisfying the
   authority as to the construction and equipment of the ground, its compliance with regulations and the
   proposed maximum figures of admission to the different parts."
  2.12 M r H u ghes w ent on to say:

  “Compliance with the recommendations of this Report will cost money. They will involve grounds in a loss of
  gate money on popular d a y s . . . The insurance for greater safety for the public demands a premium.”

M r H u ghes e n d e d h is re p o rt by saying:

  “I earnestly hope that, if the proposals I have made in this Report, or similar suggestions, commend
  them selves to you, Parliament will not be slow in granting you the necessary powers.” (Pages 11-12).

The C hester Report
   2.13 M r H ug hes’ w o rd s fell o n d e a f ears. It w as a n o th e r 22 years before there w as a fu rth e r rep o rt
co m m issio n ed by th e G o v e rn m e n t o n th e p ro b lem s o f football. In Ju n e 1966, th e th e n Secretary o f S tate for
E d u ca tio n an d Science a p p o in te d M r N o rm a n C h ester CBE, as he th en was (W arden o f N uffield College,
O xford), to c h a ir an Enquiry. H is te rm s o f reference were:

  “To enquire into the state o f A ssociation Football at all levels, including the organisation, management,
  finance and administration, and the m eans by which the game may be developed for the public good; and to
  make recommendations.”

   2.14 M r C h ester m a d e th is o b se rv a tio n a b o u t crow d behaviour:

   “In recent years there has been an increase in disorderly behaviour by spectators. During the period
   1946-1960 there were 195 cases brought to the attention o f the FA, an average o f 13 per season. In the
   following six seasons 148 cases were reported, an average o f 25 per season. The matter was discussed some
   time ago at a meeting between representatives of a number o f police forces (including the British Transport
   Police), the Football Association and the Football League. Both these governing bodies have been very
   concerned at this development.”

   2.15 T h e R e p o rt c o n tinu ed:

   “We have not been able to devote the tim e and resources to the study o f this problem which its complexity
   deserves. We very much welcome the initiative o f the Birmingham Research Group, of which D r J A
   Harrington is Research Director and have been fortunate enough to see the Group’s preliminary report. We
   are sure that its findings will be of value to all concerned.” (Page 97).

The Harrington Report
   2 .16 T h is was m a d e to th e th e n M in iste r o f S p o rt.1 It observed:

   “S om e spectators carry knives, hammers, sticks and spikes, choppers, and other offensive weapons like
   powdered pepper which are not necessarily used for violent purposes but may be used in threatening displays.
   There is also the problem o f singing or chanting bawdy or obscene songs and phrases som e of which are also
   threatening and provocative.” (Page 8).

   2 .17 A b o u t rio ts th e R e p o rt said:                ^

   “W h ile such riots must be regarded as almost unknown accompaniments o f football in this country, their
   potential seriousness and danger were exem plified recently by football riots in Turkey, where many people
   were reported killed. W hile comparable riots seem unlikely here, it would be foolish to rule out the possibility
   of much more serious crowd disturbances at football matches than we have yet experienced.” (Page 9).

   2 .18 T h e R e p o rt regretted inactiv ity th u s far:

   “T h e question o f public safety and crowd control at football matches was dealt with by a departmental
   com m ittee report published in 1924 (Cond. 2088) and the inquiry into the disaster at the Bolton Wanderers
   Football Ground in 1946 (Cond. 6 9 4 6 ) . . . Unfortunately the most helpful suggestions in these reports have
   often been ignored, though the committee’s recommendations do carry some weight with boards of football
   clubs”.

   2 .1 9 T h e R e p o rt w ent on:

   “T h e absence o f national legislation outlining minimum standards o f safety and amenity at football grounds
   m eans that som e club managements do not feel obliged to put their grounds into a state considered by the
   police to be necessary for crowd control.” (Page 33).

 ' “Soccer Hooliganism: A preliminary Report.” Bristol: John Wright and Sons Ltd 1968.



                                                                   99
  2.20 And continued:

  “We feel that improved ground facilities would not only help to deal with the hooligan problem but do
  something towards its prevention. Clubs often seem keener to spend money on the purchase of players than to
  undertake any major spending on ground improvement which would increase safety and make hooligan
  control easier. The loss o f revenue which a club may suffer from alterations may be the determining factor.
  There is of course no obligation on a club to convert a ground which can accommodate 50,000 to one which
  takes a sm aller number in conditions o f greater safety and comfort. Letters from members o f the public
  suggest that already some are staying away because o f their dislike o f poor facilities, overcrowding, and
  disturbances, so that the neglect o f ground improvement may ultimately be self defeating.” (Page 34).

  2.21 So far as responsibility is concerned, th e R e p o rt said:              -

  “We think that those responsible for club management and the governing bodies of football should accept far
  more responsibility for keeping their crowds in order. T h is applies not only within the stadium itself but to
  club supporters travelling in groups to and from m atches. O ne gets the impression that som e clubs disclaim
  any responsibility for the behaviour o f their supporters and if the atmosphere of a Roman holiday is not
  deliberately fostered it is looked on with considerable tolerance. Football matches are commercial enterprises
  conducted for profit on private premises and clubs have therefore a heavy responsibility for keeping order and
  safety for the public on their premises.” (Pages 35-36).

  2.22 In its su m m a ry th e R e p o rt concluded:

  “The solution o f the problem of hooliganism in the football stadium is ultimately the responsibility of
  individual clubs who must each deal with it in the light o f local circumstances. W hile a few clubs are
  exemplary in their attitude to the problem others are laissez-faire and need persuasion to take a more active
  role in trying to control hooliganism in their own grounds. T his laissez-faire attitude does not help the police
  in their attempts to deal with the matter.” (Page 56).

The Lang Report
   2.23 Shortly thereafter, a W orking Party u n d e r th e c h a irm a n sh ip o f S ir J o h n Lang G C B a n d in c lu d in g a
n u m b e r o f d istin g u ish ed m em bers, was ap p o in ted by th e th e n M in iste r w ith special responsibility fo r S port

  2.24 By way o f in tro d u c tio n it said:

  “The Working Party was dealing with a subject which has been discussed almost ad nauseam during recent
  years. N ot unexpectedly the Working Party has not found a single sim ple solution for a problem which is
  often due to a combination o f factors. . (Page 3).

     2.25 T h e m e m b e rs o f th e In q u iry w itnessed th e d e m o n s tra tio n o f C C T V e q u ip m e n t a n d reported:

     “. . . the view was formed that closed circuit television could be o f value in the general subject o f crowd
     control and . . . would be an important factor in preventing misbehaviour by spectators at grounds. It was a
     refinement which most of the top class clubs could be expected eventually to have as a matter o f course.”
     (Page 9).

   2.26 A b o ut alcoh o l th e R e p o rt said:

   “There can be no doubt that consumption o f alcohol is an important factor in crowd misbehaviour, both
   because it stim ulates quarrelsomeness and because empty bottles are dangerous m issiles. There would be no
   advantage in refusing licence facilities to football club grounds - this would merely stimulate spectators to
   bring their supplies from outside.” (Page 14).

  2.28 On 16 M arch 1972 Lord W heatley completed his Report and it was presented to Parliament and
published by H M S O as C m nd. 4952.

  2.29 The R eport con tained a technical Appendix. Following the Report, the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act
1975 was passed . A licensing system involving the issue o f a safety certificate for designated grounds was
introduced and su p p ortin g guidance (the Green Guide) was published. In his Report Lord Wheatley said:

  “I recognise th at a decision to introduce a licensing system for grounds along the lines I have recommended
  may cause a n x iety to som e football clubs and football administrators. A s I see it, their misgivings are
  associated w ith a fear that such stringent conditions might be attached to the granting o f a licence that
  many clubs m ay not be able to afford the cost and some may have to go out o f business.” (Paragraph 66).

  2.30 “M y an sw er to that is this. M y task was to consider the problem o f crowd safety at the grounds. Clubs
  which charge th e public for adm ission have a duty to see that their grounds are reasonably safe for spectators.
  That is a prim ary consideration. It is accordingly necessary that some standards should be imposed and
  observed. T h is h as been recognised by the football authorities themselves . . . I have canvassed all the
  alternatives th a t have been proposed or which I personally thought were reasonable to consider, and the one
  which I decided was best to m eet the situation in the interest of the public is the licensing system by a local
  authority. T h ere is nothing new in this proposal. It has been mooted for alm ost fifty years. It can come as no
  surprise to th e football world, and in the light of happenings over the years the demand for an independent
  appraisal and determ ination o f the safety of grounds becomes almost irresistible. I certainly cannot resist it.”
  (Paragraph 67 ).

  2.31 Lord W h ea tley en d ed his Report by saying:

  “I trust that th is Report may be o f assistance to you in deciding what should be done to solve this
  important q u estion o f crowd safety in football grounds. One thing is certain. The public demand for
  som ething to be done has been growing over the years. I am sure I am reflecting public opinion when I say
  that som ething m ust be done now. T h e evidence certainly supports that view.”

The M cE lhon e Report
 2.32 In O cto b er 1976 the then Secretary o f State for Scotland asked Mr Frank McElhone MP to chair a
Working Group o n Football Crowd Behaviour.

  “to consider th e problem s caused by some Scottish football supporters and to make recommendations to
  the Scottish F ootb all A ssociation and other organisations concerned.”

  A m on g the m em b ersh ip o f the Working Group were representatives from the football authorities, from the
football clubs a n d the Strathclyde Police.

   2.33 In the in tro d u ctio n to the Report2, Mr McElhone said:

  “T here is no sim p le solution to the problem; it is but one of the m anifestations o f anti-social behaviour
  besetting society in general today. We have however in our findings arrived at a number o f conclusions and
  recom m endations which we hope, given a commitment to implement them on the part of all those most
  closely concerned, w ill go som e way towards reducing the problem of hooliganism at football matches and
  by so doing turn football grounds once again into places o f entertainment where parents can take their
  children to enjoy, in relative comfort and safety, the pleasures of our national game.”

   2.34 The R ep ort observed that:

   “A hooligan is a hooligan no matter where he operates and the fact that h is behaviour is conspicuous at a
   football match h a s very often nothing to do with the game itself.” (Paragraph 4).

   Mr M cE lhon e saw the problem as one o f trying to reduce, or at least contain, the incidence o f hooliganism
at football m atch es w ith o u t restricting the pleasure o f the majority o f supporters.


2Report o f the W orking G roup on Football Crowd Behaviour: Scottish Education Department/HMSO 1977.


                                                           101
  2.35 So far as drink was concerned, the Report recom m ended that it should be an offence for a spectator
to carry or attempt to carry alcohol into a football ground; that is should be an offence to be in-possession of
alcohol w ithin the ground or to attempt to gain adm ission while drunk. The Report recom m ended that more
people w ho were physically capable o f carrying out the duties o f enforcem ent would have to be recruited and
suggested that, in their recruitment o f stewards, clubs should look to their supporters’ clubs to assist in
providing the kind o f m en required for the job. So far as transport was concerned, the R eportrecom m ended
that it should be an offence for anyone to be in possession o f alcoholic liquor on a vehicle hired specifically
for the purpose o f carrying passengers bound for a football match; or to allow any alcoholic liquor to fee
carried on a public service vehicle being used for the purpose o f carrying passengers to football matches; or to
allow the carriage o f any drunken person on such a vehicle bound for a football match.

  2.36 So far as the separation o f supporters was concerned the Report recommended:

  “That in the interests o f crowd control and safety, separation o f rival supporters at turnstiles should be
  carried out if the police, in consultation with the club, consider such a step to be necessary; that for matches
  where larger than average attendances are expected, sufficient turnstiles should be opened timeously in order
  to achieve speedy adm ission.” (R ecom m endation 13).

  “In order to protect players, match officials and the pitch, access to the playing area should be made as
  difficult as possible. To prevent an invasion o f the playing area by spectators ... the erection o f a physical
  barrier in the form o f a fence not less than 1.8 metres in height with access points to allow the pitch to be used
  if necessary for the evacuation o f spectators in an emergency.” (Paragraph 53).

  2.37 A further recom m endation was that:

  “the Courts should make full use of the higher fining powers under the Criminal Law Act 1977 in respect of
  common law offences which include malicious mischief, breach o f the peace and assault, these being the most
  common offences associated with football hooliganism, and in respect o f persistent offenders, should
  normally impose imprisonment without option.” (Recom m endation 19).

  2.38 The' Report recom m ended that:

  “The police should have statutory powers to search for any containers ... in the possession of any person
  entering or attempting to enter football grounds.” (Recom m endation 24).

but went on to point out that the clubs must bear their share o f the responsibility for the behaviour and
conduct o f their staff at all levels:

   2.39 A m ong other observations the Report says this:

  “We recognise that many football grounds in Scotland are very old; some could even be described as primitive
  in that not only do they lack any kind o f comfort for spectators but they also lack basic amenities including
  adequate toilet accommodation. T h is primitive environment encourages some people to react in a primitive
  manner. Moreover there is a strong case for more seating accommodation. In our view it would go a
  considerable way towards reducing hooliganism; potential trouble spots could be more quickly recognised and
  identification o f troublemakers by police would be made that much easier.”

T he Report therefore recommended:

   “that clubs should consider the provision o f additional seating accommodation. In addition clubs must
   provide adequate toilet facilities for men a n d women and generally improve am enities for spectators.”
   (Paragraph 88).

   2.40 T his Report also recom m ended that:

   “players should be encouraged by the clubs to extend their voluntary public relations work in the community
   including personal appearances at youth clubs etc and coaching sessions in schools with the objects of
   promoting the game and the concept of good sportsmanship.” (Recom m endation 37).

C CTV was recom m ended and supporters’ clubs encouraged. The Scottish Football A ssociation was
recom m ended to take appropriately firm action against clubs.


                                                         102
Department o f the Environment Working Group
  2.41 T he m ost recent Government publication on the subject o f football is the Report o f an Official
Working Group on Football Spectator V iolence set up by Departm ent o f the Environment, which was
published by HM SO in 1984. The Working Group was set up following incidents o f violence involving
British supporters at England’s soccer matches in Luxembourg and France in N ovem ber 1983 and February
1984 respectively. It dealt party with problems arising out o f international football.

  2.42 However, as regards dom estic football the Report said:

  “the Group reaffirmed the importance o f consistent planning, preparation and co-ordination; o f building on
  experience; and of the need to consider afresh all possible measures, including those previously thought to be
  impractical or unnecessary.” (Paragraph 5.1).

  “We recommend therefore that the FA reviews and better defines its powers and procedures and the
  responsibilities o f the clubs. If their powers prove to be inadequate, the Association should consider
  enhancing them .”

T he Report went on:

  “T h is would better equip the FA to implement some of the recommendations.” (Paragraph 5.5).

  2.43 The Football Association had issued a “blueprint” detailing the precautions which league clubs
should take against violence, which was circulated to clubs at the beginning o f the 1983-84 season. The
Working Party Report said that it:

  “... has not been rigorously adopted by all clubs. Since it represents the collective wisdom of football clubs,
  many of whom have successfully countered serious threats of violence, its implementation should have
  prevented some of the violence in grounds last season.” (Paragraph 5.7).

  2.4 4 The Report observed that the enforcement by the Football Association o f its “blueprint” occurs after
the event when the deficiencies in a club’s planning has becom e apparent. The Report recom m ended that:

  “improved means should be found for ensuring that clubs adopt the provisions o f the “blueprint” in a way
  appropriate to their own grounds and matches.” (Paragraph 5.7).

The Report went on to recom m end that each club should produce a detailed set o f plans to be submitted to
the football authorities for endorsement. T his would prevent som e clubs from avoiding their responsibilities
and might ensure also a more co-operative and com m itted response.

    2.45 T he Report recom m ended that m atches between high risk clubs should be programmed so that the
 risk or threat o f violence could be reduced. The Report said:

   “It is more likely to take place at the beginning and end o f the season and at holiday periods, particularly at *
   seaside fixtures when other groups of young people som etim es also clash with football supporters.”
   (Paragraph 5.13).

   2 .4 6 T he Report went on to recom m end the introduction o f club membership, the introduction o f CCTV
 and closer links with the com m unity. It did not recom m end that alcohol should be banned in grounds and
 concluded that in the absence o f clear evidence that the introduction o f legislation along the lines o f the
 Crim inal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 would reduce violence at English soccer matches, it could not
 recom m end such action. Furthermore, said the Report:

   “legislation of this kind would be unwelcome to many; the majority o f football clubs are untroubled by
   violence and would unnecessarily be penalised financially and the vast majority o f non-violent spectators
   would suffer for the actions o f the few.” (Paragraph 5.34):

 The Working Group did not recom m end additional measures for banning alcohol on trains or on football
 coaches.
Conclusion
  2.47     A study o f all these reports (and there are num erous reports and discussion papers b r o th e r bodies)
shows that the following are m easures which have been frequently recommended:

  1.   Closed Circuit Television
  2.   M em bership Cards
  3.   Segregation
  4.   More seating at football grounds
  5.   Encouragement o f supporters’ clubs
  6.   A ban on alcohol
  7.   Involvem ent o f the clubs with the com m unity
  8.   Heavier penalties

I too shall argue for these and related m easures. It is to be hoped they will be more vigorously pursued by the
appropriate bodies than in the past.

I a m employed by Sheffield City Council as the Head of the A dm inistration and

Legal Department.           I have held this p osition since 18.10.89.         Prior to that

date, w i t h effect from 1.12.78 I held the p osition of Assistant Head of the

Ad mi nis tr at ion and Legal Department      (Legal) but held ••the rank of Acting Head

of Department from 24.1.89 to 17.10.89,              during the absence of the Head of

Depart me nt on sickness leave.          As Ac ting Head of Department and Head of

Department,      I had and have overall responsibility for the Licensing Section.

As Assistant Head of the Department,           I h a d line management    responsibility for

the Licensing Section,         in theory,   but in practice the Head of Department,

Mr.    Pensam,   took a personal interest in this area of work and therefore the

C h i e f Licensing Officer,     David Bownes,    invariably reported to Mr.       Pensam.

                                                                  STATEMENT OF WITNESS
                                             (C.J.     Act 1967,*.9; M.C. Act 1980, *.102; M.C. Rules 19S1, r.70)


         C ontinuation of statem ent o f                    M a rk         W e b s t e r




Ar ra n g e m e n t s for the discharge of functions by local authorities are specified

in Section 101 of the Local Government Act,                                                             1972.               The Section provides that

a local authority m ay arrange for the discharge of their functions by a

committee,            sub committee or an officer of the authority.                                                                It is therefore

pos sib le       for a council to delegate its decision m ak ing powers to a committee,

sub cc mmittee or officer.




Whilst      a n a m e d officer, who w o u l d usually be a chief officer, was the officer

n o m i n ate d to fulfil the delegated functions of a local authority in

appropriate circumstances,                                    as a m a t t e r of practice,                                 such schemes   actually

operate by the relevant chief officer authorising one of his officers to take

action on his behalf.                                 Thus an individual officer can take a cti on in the.name

of the chief o f f i c e r of that department.                                                        The case of R. v Southwark London

       Continuation of statem ent of   M a r k W s b s t s r




In order to establish a framework w i t h i n w h i c h Sheffield City Council could

exercise the functions w h i c h it was to acquire on the 1st April,                          1986, David

Bownes,      the Chief Licensing Officer,               pre pa r e d    a report w h i c h was submitted

through the Head of Department to the                       General Purposes Panel w hic h was a sub

committee of the Mu ni cipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee

(referred h ere after as MEGS) w h i c h is                 in turn a committee of the City Council.

The report was         submitted to the Panel               on 3rd March,            1986.




The   report     "recommended that the following delegations be approved

        a)       all the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of

                 Sports Grounds Act,            1975 be delegated to the General Purposes

                 Panel;

       b)         the emergency procedure powers u nder Section 10 of the 1975 Act be

                 delegated to the Head of the Ad min is tr ati on and Legal Department

                  in consultation w i t h the Cha ir man or Deputy Chairman of this Panel

At its meeting on the 3rd March,                  1986,     the Panel adopted the recommendations

in .the report.           In accordance w i t h usual practice,                 these were   subsequently

app rov ed by MEGS on the 17th March,                 1986 and approved by the full Council at

A   second report was prepared by David Bownes w h i c h was again submitted through

the H e a d of Department to the Panel on the 6th May,                               1986.     The Panel resolved

(amongst other things)                      "that

         a)         the broad outlines of the administrative                           system organised by the

                    former South Y or kshire County Council under the Safety of Sports

                    G r oun d Act,          1975 be noted and authority be given for the

                    continuation of such system for the time b e i n g . "




This    resol uti on took effect immediately since by virtue of                               the resolution of

the P anel at its meet ing                    on the 3rd March,         1986, the Panel       had full delegated

powers     to deal w i t h this               issue.




As a m a t t e r of practice,                 the minutes of the Panel were seen by                MEGS and the

City Council.               The administrative system therefore operated in accordance

wi t h those resolutions between 6th May,                          1986 and 7th September,           1987.   During

this period,          the system in operation                   was a common one throughout this local

au th ority and other local authorities.                            The basic principle operated on is

that if there is disagreement betw een the parties or a m att er of policy

requires determination,                      then the issue should be referred to the appropriate

committee or sub committee by w a y of a report from the relevant officer.

Where    there is a consensus of opinion bet we en the parties,                               an administrative

de ci s i o n can be taken not to refer the m a t t e r to the relevant committee or sub

In the instance of the removal of part of barrier 144,                                 I believe that

professional advice was                received from all the statutory consultees and that

the C l u b ’s engineers were also present,                     given that there was apparently

consensus between all parties                regarding the action to be taken,                  then the

correct administrative decision was taken not to refer the m a tte r to the

General Purposes Panel.




In September,       1987,      a report was       submitted to the Panel through the Head of

the Ad mi nis tr ati on and Legal Department.                     This   report reviewed the operation

of the administrative system relating to Safety of Sports Grounds.                                      The Panel

The minu te s         of the meeting were c onsidered as a ma tter of practice by MEGS                             and

M y interp re tat io n of the phrase               "routine matters" means                to operate the day to

day running           of the licensing system.              It is a m a tt er for individual            judgment

                                         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER




I am employed by Sheffield City Council as the Head of the Adminis tr ati on and

Legal Department.            I have held this position since 18.10.89.               Prior to that

date, w i t h effect from 1.12.78 I held the position of Assistant Head of the

A d mi nis tr ati on and Legal Department           (Legal)   but held the rank of Acting Head

of Department       from 24.1.89 to 17.10.89,           during the absence of the Head of

Department on s i c k n e s s ' l e a v e .    As Actin g Head of Department and Head of

Department,      I ha d and have overall responsibility for the Licensing Section.

As As sistant Head of the Department,               I h ad line management responsibility for

the Licensing Section,            in theory,     but in practice the Head of D e p a r t m e n t , .

Mr.   Pensam,    took a personal interest in this area of w or k and therefore the

Chief Licensing Officer,            David Bownes,      invariably reported to Mr. Pensam.




Ar ra ngements     for the discharge of functions by local authorities are specified

in Section 101 of the Local Government Act,                   1972.    The Section provides that

a local authority may arrange                 for the discharge of their functions by a

committee,      sub committee or an officer of the authority.                   It is therefore

po ssible for a council to delegate its decision making powers to a committee,

sub committee o r officer.
Wh il st a n a m e d officer, w h o w o u l d usuall y be a chief officer, w as             the officer

no mi n a t e d to fulfil the d e l e g a t e d functions of a local a u t h o r i t y in

ap propriate circumstances,           as a m a t t e r of practice,         such schemes a ctually

operate by the relevant c hi ef o f fi ce r authorising one of his officers to take

a c tion on his behalf.            Thus an individual officer can take action in the name

of the chief offi cer of that department.                    The case of R. v So uth wa rk London

Borough Council,         ex-parte B a n n e r m a n and Others,    reported in "The Times" L a w

In this instance,         D avi d Bownes,      the Chief Licensing Officer,          was a u t h o r i s e d to

take action u n d e r the powers d ele g a t e d to the Head of A d m i n i s t r a t i o n and Legal

Department.       The a ction to be taken was of an adm in is tra ti ve nature as

Mr Bownes w a s and is an a d m i n i s t r a t o r as opposed to a t ec hn ica ll y q u a l i f i e d

expert.     The Safety of Sports G r o u n d Act,           1975 requires c o n s u l t a t i o n to take

place w i t h techn ic all y q u a l i f i e d experts,     ie.the Building Surveyor,           the Fire

A u t h o r i t y and the Police.

The report   "recommended that the following delegations be approved:-

       a)     all the powe rs and duties of the Council u n d e r the Safety of

              Sports Grou nds Act,       1975 be delegated to the Gene ral Purposes

At its m e eti ng on the 3rd March,       1986,    the Panel adopted the recommendations

in the report.      In a ccordance w i t h usual practice,          these w e r e   subsequently

approved by MEGS on the 17th March,            1986 and approved by the full Coun ci l at

its meet ing on the 9th April,         1986.




A second report was p r e p a r e d by D avi d Bownes w hic h was a g a i n subm it ted through

the Head of D epa rt me nt     to the Panel on the 6th May,         1986.      The Panel    resolved

                                          4 -




This resolution took effect immediately    since by virtue of   the resolution of

the Panel at its meeting on the 3rd March, 1986, the Panel      had full delegated

powers to deal with this issue.




As a matter of practice, the minutes of the Panel were seen by MEGS and the

City Council.   The administrative system therefore operated in accordance

with those resolutions between 6th May, 1986 and 7th September, 1987.       During

this period, the system in operation     was a common one throughout this local

authority and other local authorities.      The basic principle operated on is

that if there is disagreement between the parties or a matter of policy

requires determination, then the issue should be referred to the appropriate

committee or sub committee by way of a report from the relevant officer.

Where there is a consensus of opinion between the parties, an administrative

decision can be taken not to refer the matter to the relevant committee or sub

committee, and action is taken in line with the consensus of opinion..




In the instance of the removal of part of barrier 144, I believe that

professional advice was received from all the statutory consultees and that

the Club’s engineers were also present, given that there was apparently

consensus between all parties regarding the action to be taken, then the

correct administrative decision was taken not to refer the matter to the

General Purposes Panel.

In September, 1987, a report was submitted to the Panel through the Head of

the Administration and Legal Department.         This report reviewed the operation

of the administrative system relating to Safety of Sports Grounds-          The Panel

resolved that:-

      a)   "the details contained in the report now submitted regarding the

            operation of the Council’s certification function for the Safety

            of Sports Grounds be noted.

1ST DRAFT STATEMENT



 MARK WEBSTER’S STATEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE CRIMINAL, INQUIRY INTO THE

                               HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



I am employed by Sheffield City Council as the Head of the Administration and

Legal Department.     I have held this   position since

Prior to that date, I held the position of Assistant Head of the

Administration and Legal Department (Legal) but held the rank of Acting Head

of Department from                        to                         during the

absence of the Head of Department on sickness leave.       As Acting Head of

Department and Head of Department, I had and had overall responsibility for

the Licensing Section.      As Assistant Head of the Department, I had line

management responsibility for the Licensing Section, in theory, but in

practice the Head of Department, Mr. Pensam, took a personal interest in this

area of work and therefore the Chief Licensing Officer, David Bownes, often

reported directly to Mr. Pensam.



Arrangements for the discharge of functions by local authorities are specified

in Section 101 of the Local Government Act, 1972.         The Section provides that

a local authority may arrange for the discharge of their functions by a

committee/sub committee or an officer of the authority.         It is therefore

possible for a council to delegate its decision making powers to a committee,

sub committee or officer.




Whilst a named officer, who would usually be a chief officer, was the officer

nominated to fulfil the delegated functions of a local authority in
                                       - 2 -



appropriate circumstances, as a matter of practice, such schemes actually

operate by the relevant chief officer authorising a more junior officer to

take various forms of action on his behalf.        Thus an individual department

can take action in the name of the chief officer of that department.         The

case of R. v Southwark London Borough Council, ex-parte Bannerman and others,

reported in    The Times Law Reports on the 12th     October,1989, confirms that

this isa proper decision making process within the terms of       Section 101 of

the Local Government Act, 1972.     In this instance, Mr. Bownes, the Chief

Licensing Officer, was authorised to act in this fashion on the basis that he

was an administrator and not a technically qualified expert, hence the

statutory requirement in the Safety of Sports Ground Act, 1975 for

consultation with the Building Surveyor, the Fire Authority and the Police.



In order to establish a framework within which Sheffield City Council could

exercise its functions which it was to acquire on the 1st April, 1986, David

Bownes,    the Chief Licensing Officer, prepared     a reportwhich      was submitted

through    the Head of Department to the General     PurposesPanel      which was a sub

committee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee

(referred hereafter as MEGS) which is in turn a committee of the City Council.

The report was submitted to the Panel on 3rd March, 1986 and I produce that

report (Ref HMW)   (EX).



The report "recommended that the following delegations be approved

      a)      all the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of

              Sports Grounds Act, 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes

              Panel;

      b)      the emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be

              delegated to the Head of the Administration and Legal Department
                                        - 3 -




            in consultation with the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of this Panel

            or of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme

            Committee as appropriate,

      c)    The power to authorise officers under Section 11 of the Act be

            delegated to the Head of the Administration and Legal Department."



At its meeting on the 3rd March, 1986, the Panel adopted the recommendations

in the report.   In accordance with usual practice, these were subsequently

approved by MEGS on the 17th March, 1986 and approved by the full Council at

its full meeting on the 9th April, 1986.



A second report was prepared by David Bownes which was again submitted via the

Head of Department to the Panel on the 6th May, 1986.     The Panel resolved

(amongst other things) "that

      a)    the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

            former South Yorkshire County Council under the Safety of Sports

            Ground Act, 1975 be noted and authority be given for the

            continuation of such system for the time being."



This resolution took effect immediately since by   virtue of the resolution of

the Panel at its meeting   on the 3rd March, 1986, the Panel had full   delegated

powers to deal with this   issue.



As a matter of practice,   the minutes of the Panel were seen by MEGS and the

City Council.    The administrative system therefore operated in accordance

with those resolutions between 6th May, 1986 and 7th September, 1987.      During

this period, the system which operated, as described by Mr. Bownes in his

statement, was a common one in operation throughout this local authority and
                                                                                            '!

                                             - 4 -
[


     other local authorities.   The basic principle operated on is that if there is

     disagreement between the parties or a matter of policy requires determination,

     then the issue should be referred to the appropriate committee or sub

     committee by way of a report from the relevant officer.        Where there is a

     consensus of opinion between the parties, an administrative decision can be

     taken not to refer the matter to the relevant committee or sub committee.



     In the instance of the removal of part of barrier 144, I believe that

     professional advice was received from all the statutory consultees and the

     Club’s engineers, given that there was consensus regarding the action to be

     taken, then the correct administrative decision was taken not to refer the

     matter to the General Purposes Panel.



     In September, 1987, a report was submitted to the Panel through the Head of

     the Administration and Legal Department.        This report reviewed the operation

     of the administrative system relating to Safety of Sports Grounds.         The Panel

     resolved that:-

           a)    "the details contained in the report now submitted regarding the

                 operation of the Council’s certification function for the Safety

                 of Sports Grounds be noted.

           b)    The revised administrative system set out in the report, including

                 the establishment of a proposed Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

                 Group comprising representatives of the Building Surveyor, the
f
[                South Yorkshire County Fire Service, the South Yorkshire Police
l:
                 and the Director of Environmental Health and Consumer Services, to

                 advise the Council on matters relating to the Safety of Sports

                 Grounds be approved and
      c}      authority be delegated to the Head of the Administration and Legal

              Department to deal with all routine matters in connection with the

              administrative system."



The minutes    ofthe meeting were considered as a matter of practice by MEGS    and

the Council    atits meeting on the 7th October, 1987.



My interpretation of the phrase "routine matters" means to operate the day to

day running    ofthe licensing system.   It is a matter   for individual judgment

taking accountof the relevant factors at the time.In practice,        I would

expect that matters about which there were disagreements or matters of policy,

FILE NOTE


RE: Hillsborough Disaster - Criminal Investigation

A meeting took place at Graysons, Solicitors, on the 25th July, 1990 in
connection with the statement of Arthur Butler, the Building Surveyor.
Present at the meeting were Simon Davis from Graysons, Arthur Butler,
Surveyor from the Department of Land and Planning from Sheffield City
Council, Frances Woodhead from the Administration and Legal Department and
Superintendent Taylor and Sgt.           from West Midlands Police.

Arthur Butler had prepared a draft statement which he had forwarded to
Superintendent Taylor.  Superintendent Taylor was happy that it covered
the areas he required. There were one or two issues he wanted to discuss
however.

1.   The statement needs to be typed on C.J.A. paper.

2.   Page 2, he would like to refer to Mr. Sheriff by name and name Arthur
     Butler's predecessors, either Mills or Roberts as appropriate and the
     fact that they are now retired.

3.   Page 2, there were substantial references to the wording "additional
      requirements by the Working Party".  Superintendent Taylor would like
      some reference to the Green Guide and the regard had to this by the
      Building Surveyors and their involvement in the application of the
      Green Guide.

4.   Page 3, with reference to the 1981 incident, Superintendent Taylor
      asked whether the Building Surveyors had had any access to the old
      County Council files when the City Council either took over the matter
      or subsequently.    It was agreed that additional wording should be
      added to clarify   the matter as follows

     "It was not noted or drawn to my attention that there had    beensuchan
     incident.  I did  not inspect any other files (for example   the filesof
     the Administration and Legal Department) where it may have been
     recorded."

5.   With reference to page 4, according to the minute, Mr. Sheriff had
     attended the meeting. Superintendent Taylor would like this referred
     to by name.

6.   With reference to page 5, Mr. Atkinson attended this meeting on behalf
     of the Building Surveyor's Division and again Superintendent Taylor
     would like this referring to specifically.

7.   Page 6, in connection with signing, there was some discussion about
     who would have been responsible for the issue. It was agreed that the
     wording should be amended to say that there was no file reference to
     indicate the question of signing on ingress had been considered by the
     Working Party.

8.   It was agreed that the words "or subsequently" should be added in
     paragraph 2.

At the conclusion of the meeting, it was agreed that Arthur Butler would
arrange to have the statement typed in C.J.A. format and it would be
collected by West Midlands Police when it was ready.


F. Woodhead
20.7.90
HB8AAP/JJJ
Hillsborough Disaster - Criminal Inquiry
Meeting at Graysons - 22nd June 1990____

Present at the meeting were Superintendent Taylor and Sergeant McCrombie of West
Midlands Police, Arthur Butler from the Buil’ding Surveyors Division of
Sheffield City Council, Frances Woodhead from the Administration and Legal
Department of Sheffield City Council and Simon Davies from Graysons.

The purpose of the meeting was to have a preliminary discussion with Mr. Butler
prior to a statement being made by him concerning his involvement in Safety of
Sports Grounds issues.   Superintendent Taylor produced a typed list of the areas
he wished to       explore. The numbering in this note is     by    reference to thenumbers
in that list of Superintendent Taylors.

1.   Mr. Butler confirmed that he started work for the City Council in 1985 and
     was involved in the inspection which took place in 1986. He now regards
     himself as a member of the Advisory Group post the disaster but pre-disaster
     regarded himself as a representative of the Building Surveyors Division.
     Other people from the Building Surveyors Division attended
     meetings/inspections. Mr. Butler produced a list of the personnel who had
     attended each individual meeting. He said he was an adviser from the
     Building Surveyors Group. He explained that the Building Surveyors Division
     was part of the Land and Planning Department. The department deals with
     Building Regulation consent and within it have three teams of structural
     engineers each headed by a Principal Building Surveyor. Mr. Butler heads
     and headed the Site Supervision Team. The work in relation to the Safety of
     Sports Grounds was structural and those issues were referred to the
     structural engineers. It also involved site supervision and meetings were
     therefore attended by two members of staff. Each principal surveyor is of
     equal status. Don Sheriff was for the structural side. The Building
     Surveyor was an adviser. Day to day matters would be referred to the
     principal surveyors.

     Upon the question of effectiveness, Mr. Butler commented that the system
     worked reasonably well, that decisions were made by agreement.  If it was
     impossible to reach agreement, then the issues would be talked through.   In
     his statement, he will deal with his duties on coming to the Council, when
     he became involved in the Advisory Working Party and how he sees his
     relationship to the Working Party with reference to the sub division of
     functions amongst the Building Surveyors Division and the other parties who
     attended.

2.   This is linked to 1. Mr. Butler said that he regarded himself as a
      professional adviser to the group.

3.   Upon appointment, Mr. Butler confirmed that he went through the 1976 Guide.
      The Guide was re-issued in October 1986. A lot of work at Sheffield
      Wednesday   Football Clubwas, however, carried out under the 1976 Guide. He
      would talk over schemes with structural building surveyors. He has a good
      knowledge   of the Guide.In 1986, he did not read the files in their
      entirety.    He confirmedthat Admin and Legal would have the administrative
      files but the Building Surveyors kept separate files concerning their own
      involvement. He did not feel that it was necessary to read all the files to
      appraise the current situation.

4.   He said there was little on the Building Surveyors' files about the
      incident. The 1981 crushing incident was before his time. He was aware
      that work took place on the Leppings Lane terraces as a result. He was also
      aware of the problem of segregation and control of fans which led to works
      to achieve greater control facilities whilst considering safety factors.
Mr. Butler said he was not involved in those issues.

The inspection in 1986 was one of the bi-annual inspections. He has some
recollections of who was present at that meeting. He assumed that notes
were being taken by Admin and Legal by way of minutes. His role was to
consider the issue and given an opinion. The Police raised the problem and
wanted barrier 144 reducing. Mr. Butler confirmed that his advice that it
would be safer to remove the barrier.  It would not be relevant in respect
of Building Regulations. He would consider the implications of spectator
safety. The Green Guide 1976 edition was then the relevant guide. He
considered the explanation of the problem by the Police and balanced that
with the fact that a radial fence had been put in which had caused the crowd
to split into two. There was good reason for the installation of the
radial fence. He considered the effect on capacity and the overall
configuration of barriers. He was asked whether or not he considered the
height and type of barriers but did not address that issue in detail. There
was also some discussion about the consideration given to the location of
barrier 144 in relation to barrier 124A. He was asked by Superintendent
Taylor, "What factors did you consider?". He responded that he considered
the purpose of putting radial fences in. Superintendent Taylor then
discussed the creation of pen 5 and   the effect upon capacity and the fact
that the Safety Certificate was never amended.    Mr. Butler said that the
pens were put in to make the ground safer. It was put to him that
consideration of these issues was not reflected in the documentation. Mr.
Butler said that the removal of a barrier does not necessarily have an
effect on capacity. He said that the Police had said the reason for its
removal was because people were stopping at the barrier and this was
undesirable. Therefore the reason for the barrier was negated in terms of
capacity.

With reference to the other factors considered, Mr. Butler said that the
question of whether people were going to stop at the point was considered.
Where a crush may occur (i.e. in the tunnel) was considered.    It was pointed
out that the removal of barrier 144   was more likely to cause a crush on the
next barrier down rather than 124A.    It should also be born in mind that the
considerations were within expectation of a crowd flowing at turnstile speed
rather than through large open gates. Numerous factors were considered i n
deciding whether to remove barrier 144, the length and height of the tunnel
was important vis-a-vis the avoidance of crushing in the tunnel.
Superintendent Taylor asked whether there was any documentation which would
show the consideration given to the question of capacity and how that was
affected by the installation of radial fences.

This issue is linked to the last issue and will be covered in Mr. Butlerts
statement. The removal of barrier 144 was considered taking account of
general issues. The Green Guide and the additional fact of the professional
judgment were taken into account.

Superintendent Taylor asked for Mr. Butler's comment upon the Building
Surveyor's Department involvement in the application of the Green Guide in
relation to barriers, tunnels and terrace development, with the width of
gates and the signing in the West Terrace. He asked about the the Building
Surveyor's awareness of the County documents in connection with the division
of duties. Mr. Butler did not seem to be aware of this document.

With reference to the directional signs, not fire exits etc., the Building
Surveyor was not responsible for this issue. This was an issue for the Tire
and Police.
9.   This was dealt with bya prior authority and   it was therefore assumed that
      the issue was properly addressed.

10. Mr. Butler said that he did not believe thatthe removal of barrier 144     had
     an effect on capacity.  He said that hewould still hold that view.
     Superintendent Taylor asked Mr. Butler to develop that argument.

11. With reference to the position post 1987, consideration needs to be given by
and Mr. Butler to the simplification of prime responsibilities, the Building
12. Surveyor's involvement and how he regarded his role in that group, how it
    worked and how effective it was. Superintendent Taylor indicated that 11
    and 12 could be dealt with together.

13. Concerning the involvement of Eastwoods, Mr. Butler said that Eastwoods
    were Consulting Engineers used to working in building design function and
    not just a safety of sports grounds function. They act on behalf of the
    Club in connection with design work and as their retained advisers upon
    Safety of Sports Grounds issues. Eastwoods deal with the Building Surveyors
    directly in respect of Building Regulations and also with the Council in
    respect of the licensing functions. He would have expected that Eastwoods
    being involved in the removal of barrier 144 would have notified the Club of
    the 'risks' of removal.

     Mr. Butler was not sure when the Police asked the Club about the removal of
     barrier 144. It may have been after the inspection. The Club would then,
     issue an instruction to do the work after the implications had been
     considered by the Working Party. The Police, according to Mr. Butler,
     raised the issue with the Working Party at the bi-annual inspection where
     Eastwoods were present. Eastwoods acted as the professional advisers and
     agents of the Club. Mr. Butler said that he would have expected Eastwoods
     to flag up issues of reservation and use their professional judgment. The
     opinion of Dr. Eastwood was that it was safer to remove the barrier although
     he had reservations.

14.Communication was by telephone calls, memos and letters.

At the conclusion of the meeting, it was agreed that a draft statement would be
prepared by Mr.Butler dealing with all the aforementioned issues. It was
recognised that it may be necessary for a further statement to be taken from
someone else concerning the position pre 1985 or concerning issues of which Mr.
Butler had no direct personal knowledge. The draft statement will be finished
by 18th July. A further meeting will take place at Graysons at Paradise Square
at 11 o'clock.  I agreed that I would arrange to prepare a first draft in
consultation with Arthur Butler which we would let Simon Davies have for
consultation with Arthur by 13th July.

N.B. This note consists mainly of a record of the responses of Mr. Butler to
     questions asked by Superintendent Taylor and is designed to act as an "aide
     memoir" whilst preparing Mr- Butler's written statement.

           —     ’’the Home Office had said that the m a xi m u m flexibility had to be m a intained

                in the case of existing structures and differences in such matters as age,

                size and mode of construction had to be taken into account".                      It is no ted

                that the Home Office had not p ro v i de d any guidance for the r e a s on i n g of

                the widths of gangways.         In r e l a t i o n to the fourth po int the following is

                Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places                    of the terracing

                in small areas near to the stand. The cross-fall on the steps on the Korth

                West corner exit wo uld also require at t en t i o n as it tended to throw people

                forward. The height of the crush b a r r ie r s mentioned in regard to the Spion

                Kop   (ie. below the reco m m en d a t io n s of the "Guide") also applied.              It was

Tnroughout tne period of consideration of radial barrier installations on

the West Terrace, the County Council document was in vogue w.iich indicated

primary ano. consultation Authorities for various tsurxioses in the

implementation of the sports grounds legislation. It is clear from the

list of suspects that the Building Authority was primarily responsible

for all the structural aspects of the grounds, including tk-s spacing of

crusn carriers, and that the Fire Authority was primarily responsible for

all calcu] ations for means of escape.

  Whilst considering the effectiveness of the recently installed radial ■

  fences on the terracing,       it was reported to the g r o ^ ^ t        fans were

  coming out of the tunnel and. stopping behind barrier 1 H             rather than

  travelling further into the,terrace area. This was causing a crowd                  V

 movement problem to the Police, particularly in pen 3 , although similar ^

 problems were occuring in pen if to a slightly lesser degree. The Police

 Representative, therefore suggested .the removal of parts of barrier 1 A 4 . .

 Corroboration of the problem is contained in paragraph k S              of Dr. Eastwood’s

 statement to the Taylor Inquiry, which states, "Spectators tend to                   " "

 congregate at the top of the West' Terrace rather than at the bottom by

 the perimeter f e nc e.because their view will not be obscured by the small

 mesh of the perimeter (fence)".

 The request for my comments provoked considerable thought, since I was

 aWare °f                 6 e s i r a b i l i ^ > o have a barrier in this position, yet

officers who regularly manned that area were informing the croup that it's

presence was causing concern for the safety of spectators.

              mouth, and as such, the space between the barrier and the rear of the

              terrace acted as a continuity of the entrance/exit route, for which there

              snoulo. not have been an initial capacity calculated. Indeed the reason

              for ohe discussion on that day was the requirement .of the Police to keeD

          that area clear of spectators. Other barriers appeared to have been

          reasonably spaced for the purposes of the "Guide" and in retrospect the

          SCIUal harrier spacing was proven to be less than, the dimensions., permitted.

     During September 1 9 S 6 , discussions took place within the Division to

review the procedure for implementing Safety of Sports Grounds matters.

determined that the General Assessment Unit v/ould adopt the primary

co-ordinating role and agree in consultation with the Site Supervision Unit

and the Structural Assessment Unit                    (at Principal or Assistant Principal

level) matters of compliance with the Green'T^&^e. Where the proposal would

not require Building Regulation consideration, the Site Supervision Unit

would adopt the primary co-ordinating role, would conduct any necessary

liason with external Departments and bodies, and would agree in consultation
                                                                                  .   .   .   .   .                        •1

Green "Gtxje.

     In November 1 9 S 6 , the Home Office issued the revised version of the

"Green Guide'1. This document was distributed to the three relevant Units

of the Division. The two versions were compared and the apparent differences

                          As it's name implied,            it has been an advisory group with the constituent

                          One of the effects of this change, was that each of the Authorities

                  were requested to carry out site inspections and prepare their individual

                  reports. The group have therefore rarely met at the stadia for the purpose

                          The Internal Divisional Memorandum was revised in October 1958, to

NOTES FOR CONSIDERATION




MEETING AT:      Graysons, Solicitors.

WITH:            Detective SSuperintendant Taylor
                  Detective Sergeant MacCrombie
                  Arthur Butler
                  Francis Woodhead
                  Simon Davies

REGARDING:       West Midlands Police Investigation of the Hillsborough
                  Disaster

DATE:            Friday the 29th June 1990.



This brief consists of notes taken at the above meeting, and is meant to be

used in conjunction with the "agenda", handed out by Detective Superintendant

Taylor of the 29th June.     Therefore, the numbers in this brief correspond

to those of the agenda.     It should read as an expanded guideline as to

what should be inserted into the draft statements, and nothing more.



1 and 2:          (a)      Arthur to explain when he joined the council, and

                           give an explanation    of the duties given to him.

                   (b)     Involvement with the officer working party.

                           When Arthur first involved;

                           Joined the group;

                           And input to the group.

                   (c)     Arthurs relationship to the party:

                           Involved in any sub-divisions?

                           Receive any delegated work from the party?

                           What ocher   representatives were'in attendance at
                           this time?

                           What was thier role?

                   (d)     Did Arthur agree with his terms of   reference?

                           How did he see himself in relation to the group?
Brief outline of knowledge of Green guide.

Has Arthur read it, made notes on it? etc.

Is he aware of important recommendations within it?

(Suggest answering this briefly, without dwelling
on the application of the guide).

Were these incidents logged in council files?   If so,
were they read?

Arthur stated here that he had not read the councils
main file, ie. The Administration and Legal Department's,
but had read his own department's file. This of course
was of a more technical nature.

Not much in files about earlier incidents.

(Suggest reasonable outline of Arthur's knowledge here -
provided it doesn't show something wasn't known, which
should have been - but this is doubtful).

Superintendant Taylor accepts this was prior to Arthur's time
and therefore, Arthur will not be able to answer in a   .
particularly full manner.

This is where Arthur becomes "involved".

Arthur stated, re: meeting of party, that he remembers
some people who were present, but no minutes were seen
by him. He assumed somebody weefe making notes and therefore
did not take any personally. 1/4#^



Outline required of Arthur's input to the decision taking
role.

(Did he have one?   Surely he offers advice only).



(a)   The considerations given as to whether barrier 144
      should be reduced.  In particular:

       (1)   How did the decision arise, and what was the
             reasons for it?

       (2)   Was consideration given to the overall picture
             of the pens, as aposed to considering 144 in
             isolation?

       (3)   Were the implications of crowd capacity
             considered, and was the Green Guide consulted
             on this matter?

       (4)   Arthur's professional judgement.   On what
            grounds was his professional judgement based?
            (Superintendant Taylor expected as Arthur had
            no experience in this area, to hear that he
            had consulted the Green Guide. Arthur refused
            to concede that removal of the barrier had any
            major implication on crowd capacity, although Arthur
            did say that he had considered capacity).

      (5)   Radial fences      the 1979 Safety Certificate.

            Why wasn't the crowd capacity siteated=5& the
            certificate ammwralgd?

            Superintendant Taylor stated that erecting
            Radial fences and crash barriers reduces the
            square metres of standing capacity. However,
            it would appear that no amendments of the
            standing capacity in the penned area was made.
            Why wasn't, this matter addressed?



Did anyone take account of points a to d (on the Superintendant's
agenda), and advise the council about possible dangers etc.,
because of the variation between actual structures and
guidelines in the Green Guide.

A short answer is expected here, reflecting a common sence/
practical approach. The Superintendant stated he was
fully aware of financial implications.



Self explanitory.    Not expanded upon greatly.



The schedule was shown. It was stated that it was part
of the building surveyors function, to advise the licensing
officer.

Would Arthur expect to give advice on this?

Arthur answered if considered necessary.



Arthur to explain:

(a)   Involvement in new group.

(b)   Role/terms of reference.

(c)   How the new -group worked - was there any differences
      to the old group?

(d)   How effective the new group was, in comparison to
      the old group.
                                                                1


                -4-



12:   Incorporate into paragraph 11.




13:   (a)   Explain Dr. Eastwood's role.

      (b)   What was the input of Eastwood's company, into
            the discussions about removing 144.

      (c)   Would Eastwood have been expected to tell Arthur,
            if he had any reservations about safety.

            Arthur replied that he would, and explained how
            Eastwood was responsible for issuing maintainence
            contracts.



14:   Self explanatory.
STATEMENT of ARTHUR BUTLER

Date of birth - 13th April 1948

To WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

Regarding THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER, 15th April 1989



I am employed by Sheffield City Council in the Building Surveyors Division of

the Department of Land and Planning.   Since canmencing employment with the

City Council in November 1985, I have held the positicn of Principal District

Surveyor.

I am the service manager of the division's Site Supervision Unit, currently

consisting of 24 staff, whose main functions are to carry out inspections of

building works in progress within the City boundaries, enforce Building

Regulation requirements, and to carry out inspections of licensed premises and

to advise on their constructional and structural suitability.

The Division also incorporates a General Assessment Unit for the examination

of deposited Building Regulation applications, a Structural Assessment Unit, a

Public Safety Unit, and a Geotechnical Services Unit.   Each Unit is headed by

a Principal Surveyor or Principal Engineer, and all are directly responsible

to The Building Surveyor.

I am a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Building, a fellow of the

Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors, and a member of the

Institute of Building Control.

My first involvement with Safety of Sports Grounds was in mid March 1986, when

I attended a meeting to discuss the transfer of duties (on the first of April

1986) from the South Yorkshire County Council to the City Council.   Specific

involvement with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club began in early July 1986,

when I attended a meeting of the Officer Working Party, where the predaninent

discussion was of the new construction to cover over and extend the Spicn Kcp,

the construction of which had already commenced.
                                       -   2   -


On tooth these occasions, the Principal Engineer from the division's Structural

Assessment Unit also attended.    This officer had been involved with the

subject of Safety of Sports Grounds since 1976.    He had acted- as the

Division's liaison officer with the County Council, on behalf of the Building

Surveyor, who was nominated by the City Council to be the officer representing

the Building Authority, and hence a member of the Officer Working Party.

The Principal Engineer had attended most of the meetings of the officer

working party, with either one of my two predecessors or relevant members of

my staff who dealt with the geographical area of the City appropriate to the

sports ground under discussion.    During this period, it was seen to be

appropriate that site inspections and meetings were attended by members of

both the Structural Assessment Unit and the Site Supervision Unit, since many

of the works required to be carried out for Safety of Sports Grounds purposes

also required Building Regulation approval and supervision.    The role of the

district surveying staff was to ensure that proposals could comply with

Building Regulations, and that they were constructed soas to comply with that

legislation and any additional requirements made by the Officer Working Party.i^

Many issues were discussed by that group concerning works required and

proposals relating to the football stadia in the City.    Discussion and

agreement by the group was reached before works were undertaken and proposals

implemented. During that time there was never a case where consensus was not

reached by the Working Party.

The minutes of the meeting of the Officer Working Party dated 12th February,

1979 (Ref AB1) discussed four items of relevance to the West end of the

Hillsborough ground -

1.   The reasonableness of applying the "guide".

2.   The unknown reasoning for the 1.1 metre width of gangways?

3.   The requirement for an additional stairway to be provided to the West

     Stand;

4.   Regarding the West Terrace, the minutes read, "In view of the lack of

     depth of this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the spectator limit to
                                         -   3 -

   7,200, and the discharge time to 6.6 minutes, the Working Party AGREED

    that it would be unreasonable to insist that gangways or additional exits

   would be provided.     However, even if the existing crush barriers were to

   pass the tests, the Working Party AGREED that the barriers would require

    special attention in view of the apparent sharp edges, corrosion etc."



At a further meeting on 30th March 1979, (Ref AB2) the discussions on the

above four points were developed.    Regarding the reasonableness of applying

the guide, "the Home Office had said that the maximum flexibility had to be

maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in such matters

as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account".    It is

noted that the Home Office had not provided any guidance for the reasoning of

the widths of gangways.    In relation to the fourth point the following is

minuted, "As well as the condition of the crush barriers, the Building

Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the terracing in

small areas near to the stand.    The cross-fall on the steps on the North West

corner exit would also require attention as it tended to threw people forward.

The height of the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the Spion Kcp (i.e.

below the recommendations of the "Guide") also applied.    It was AGREED that

all these points must be drawn to the Club's attention.    In accordance with

the Home Office recommendations, flexibility in the use of the "Guide" was

used in the subsequent detailed discussions held between the Club's engineers

and staff of this Division since the height of the crush barriers remained

unaltered. The General Safety Certificate for the ground was issued on 21st

December 1979 by the South Yorkshire County Council.

The minutes of the Officer Working Party dated 8th June 1981, (Ref AB3)

state:-

"Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were

considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the (West)

Stand.    An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party"would be

consulted when these had substance". This is the only reference in the

Division's files to an incident an the terraces in 1981.
The design work for the installation of radial fences to the West Terrace was

carried out by the Club's engineers, and was submitted to the officer working

party with covering correspondence on 2nd September 1981, (Ref AB4) and was

discussed at a meeting on 11th September 1981.   The minutes of that meeting

(Ref AB5) state:- "Whilst there are drawbacks to the division of the terrace

into approximately three equal areas, each served by it's own entrance, the

Working Party felt that increased control on the terrace should result frcm

the proposals.   For instance there could well be problems with opposing fans

mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit gates, but the

police considered that they could cope with any problems of this nature.    The

adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of the

radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the existing gates

in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the terrace".

One of the conditions of acceptance of the proposals by the Working Party was

that the new gates at the rear of the Terrace be under police control.

In 1985, the Club submitted further proposals to subdivide the West Terrace,

by the installation of additional radial fences.   The minutes of the meeting

held on 18th April 1985, (Ref AB6) state, :- "The Police representatives

pointed out that the proposals had been prompted in the main by comments they

had made to the Club".   The main purpose of the proposals was to segregate

heme and visiting supporters at the West end of the ground.   At that meeting

the proposals appear to have been discussed in detail, and it is minuted

that :-

"The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the

Police representatives, subject to:- (a) additional gates being provided

between turnstile no. 16 and the wall of the inner access road; (b) the

central area of the terrace (indicated as a neutral area or visiting

supporters' terrace) being divided in half by a new central radial fence

running frcm the tunnel entrance to the pitchside security fence with gates

erected so as to permit entry to be diverted to either half as appropriate
                                       -   5 -

 (the proposed new secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence

 indicated on the plan to be abandoned); (c) the right hand area of the terrace

 (indicated as hane supporters' terrace) also to be divided inr half by a new

 central radial fence running frcm back to front with two gates (the existing

 radial fence dividing the present two terrace areas - neutral area and heme

 supporters - to have a second gate installed; (d) the existing pitch perimeter

 fence to have additional exit gates installed - one in the neutral area and

 one in the hone supporters area.   The County Fire Service saw no objection to

 the proposals, subject to more detailed investigation of tpe7means of escape

 aspects, and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to

 submission, of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of Sports

 Grounds Act and Building Regulations".     It is apparent that discussions on the

 proposals took place outside the formal meetings of the Working Party

 subsequent to that date, since the proposals had been modified (to those

 actually installed), by the time they were next discussed at the meeting on

 29th July 1985, (minutes included as Ref AB7) where the scheme was accepted

 subject to the installation of a further pitch perimeter gate.

 Throughout the period of consideration of radial barrier installations on the

 West Terrace, the County Council document (Ref AB8) was in vogue which

 indicated primary and consultation Authorities for various purposes in the

 implementation of the sports grounds legislation.     It is clear frcm the list

 of subjects that the Building Authority was primarily responsible for all the

 structural aspects of the grounds, including the spacing of crush barriers,

 and that the Fire Authority was primarily responsible for all calculations for

 means of escape.

 In retrospect, it is known that the drawings of the West Terrace used by

 members of the Working Party were dimensionally incorrect, shewing that the
                       n
^terrace was deeper that it's actual dimension.     It is also known frcm minutes

 of meetings that the original capacity of 7,200 was an agreed reduction from

 the computed capacity, and that the works carried out in 1981 and 1985 were
                                       -   6   -


 done to increase safety, to reduce the danger of lateral surges, and to

 facilitate more efficient police control of insurgents.

 Signs appear to have been considered by the Working Party in respect of

^indicating exit routes, particularly for means of escape.        Whilst this was

 clearly within the remit of the Fire Authority, the Building Surveyor's

 representative is on record in correspondence dated 21st March 1980 (Ref AB9)

 as commenting .that exit signs were not clearly displayed.       This is a clear

 example of the professional interaction of members of the Working Party.

 Coincidental to the transfer of duties under the sports grounds legislation

 frcm the County Council to the City Council, a number of factors were

 appreciated within the Building Surveyor's Division which had an effect on the

 future representation at meetings.   The recent ill health of the Principal

 Engineer, and a knowledge that further hospitalisation was imminent played a

 major part, however it was also a time when an internal restructuring process

 was being considered in anticipation of a major increase in workload due to

 the regeneration of the Sheffield economy and the anticipation of staging the

 World Student Games.   A third sports ground in Sheffield was also expected to

 be designated for the purposes of the Act, and it was appreciated that a

 considerable input would be required in this respect.        In order to achieve

 continuity and apply similar standards to all the grounds, my role in the

 representation of the Division changed over a period of months as I became

 increasingly involved with the reconstituted Working Party.        During this

 initial period of involvement, I had reviewed consultative documentation from,

 the Heme Office on the Fire Safety and Safety at Sports Venues, and had read

 the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds for that purpose, and for the resolution

 of issues in connection v/ith the ongoing construction of the extension and

 roofing over of the Spion Kcp at the Hillsborough ground.

 Regarding the removal of parts of barrier 144, this matter was raised by the

 Police representative whilst carrying out         the bi-annual inspection of the

 ground on the 7th August 1986.   This inspection was attended by
                                      - 7 -

representatives frcm the Police, Fire Authority, Administration & Legal

Department of the Council, Building Surveyors Division of the Department of

Land and Planning of the Council, and the Club's engineering consultants.

Whilst considering the effectiveness of the recently installed radial fences

cxi the terracing, it was reported to the Working Party that fans were catling

out of the tunnel and stopping behind barrier 144 rather than travelling

further into the terrace area.   This was causing a crowd movement problem to

the Police, particularly in pen 3, although similar problems were occuring in

pen 4 to a slightly lesser degree.   The Police representative therefore

suggested the removal of parts of barrier 144.   Corroboration of the problem

is contained in paragraph 46 of Dr. Eastwood's statement (Ref AB10) to the

Taylor Inquiry, which states, "Spectators tend to congregate at the top of the

West Terrace rather than at the bottom by the perimeter fence because their

view will not be obscured by the small mesh of the perimeter (fence)".

The request for my comments provoked considerable thought, since I was aware

of the normal desirability to have a barrier in this position, yet officers

who regularly manned that area were, informing the group that it's presence was

causing concern for the safety of spectators.

My comments to the group were favourable to the removal of the parts of the

barrier, since I considered that it would alleviate the problem of spectators

backing up within the tunnel, that any incoming crush would be seen on the

terracing rather than be hidden inside the tunnel, that any problems on the

terrace could also be easily seen from the police control box which was

relatively near, that the means of escape from the area was excellent from

both pens, at that point, due to the existance of the tunnel, and that it was

understood that the area of the tunnel mouth would be kept clear throughout

the duration of the game by the Police, who in that position could easily

monitor and resolve any incidents of overcrowding and localised crushing.

I believe that I expressed a reservation that the removal of the barrier could

cause the next barrier directly in front of the tunnel mouth to receive a

greater loading, and it was therefore necessary for the spectators to be
                                        -8 -

  encouraged to spread into the other areas of the pens.    I am also of the
                                   %
 belief that I suggested marking out the area to be kept clear in front of the

  tunnel mouth with painted hatching.

 The effect of the removal of the barrier was to be the subject of future

 monitoring by the Police, since installation of new barriers and the

  alteration of others may have been required if they had thought it necessary.

 No adverse comments were made by the Police, Fire Authority or the Club's

^engineers representative at the time/v and I advised that it was appropriate

  for action to be taken to remove the relevant parts of the barrier.

  It must be appreciated that it was assumed that spectators would be entering

  the areas at turnstile speed only.    It was never envisaged that an external

  gate would be opened to allow a mass entry of spectators.    The recent

  disaster at the Bradford City Football Club ground had the effect of

  considering the effects of mass evacuation, not mass admission of spectators.

  These notes of that inspection are produced from memory only since it was

  assumed that the items raised at that inspection were being noted and minuted

 by the representative from the Administration & Legal Department of the

  Council.   No personal notes were taken at the time.

  As far as I am aware, no further discussion took place on this

  matter, involving any officer from the City Council.     I am also unaware of any

  subsequent correspondence seeking or granting consent for the works which were

  carried out.

  At the time of the inspection, it was not considered necessary to make any

  adjustment to crowd capacity in consequence to the removal of parts of

  barrier 144.   This barrier was positioned across the line of the tunnel

  mouth, and as sucih, the space between the barrier and the rear of the terrace

  acted as a continuity of the entrance/exit route, for Which there should not

  have been an initial capacity calculated.    Indeed the reason for the

  discussion on that day was the requirement of the Police to keep that area

  clear of spectators.   Other barriers appeared to have been reasonably spaced

  for the purposes of the "Guide" and in retrospect the actual barrier spacing
                                       - 9 -

was proven to be less that the dimensions permitted by the "Green Guide" for

that gradient of terracing. The height and type of the remaining barriers were

not reconsidered at this time, since it was assumed that such a

consideration had been part of the process of acceptance of the scheme to

carry out the recent works on the terrace.     The possibility of crowd movement

effecting barrier 124A, as a result of removing parts of barrier 144 was never

envisaged.

The implementation of the barrier removal was arranged by the Club's

engineers. A contractor was subsequently instructed by the engineers to carry

out the work. I am sure that if the Club's engineers thought this or any other

proposal to have had a detrimental effect on spectator safety, they would have

made suitable representation before giving instructions, on behalf of their

clients, to any contractor. During September 1986, discussions took place

within the Division to review the procedure for implementing Safety of Sports

Grounds matters.    A Divisional Memorandum was produced and issued in October

1986, (Ref AB11) indicating which of the Units of the Division would take the

primary co-ordinating role.

Where a Building Regulation consent was necessary for the work, it was

determined that the General Assessment Unit would adopt the primary

co-ordinating role and agree in consultation with the Site Supervision Unit

and the Strutural Assesment Unit (at Principal or Assistant Principal level)

matters of compliance with the Green Guide. Where the proposal would not

require Building Regulation consideration, the Site Supervision Unit would

adopt the primary co-ordinating role, would conduct any necessary liason with

external Departments and bodies, and would agree in consultation with the

Structural Assessment Unit and the General Assessment Unit (at Principal or

Assistant Principal level) matters of compliance with the Green Guide.

In November 1986, the Hane Office issued the revised version of the "Green

Guide".     This document was distributed to the three relevant Units of the

Division.    The two versions were compared and the apparent differences were

discussed.
                                     -   10   -


There was a review of the administration system undertaken by the

Administration and Legal Department*, which in September 1987 established a

Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group to replace the Officer Working Party.

This change was also coincidental to the formalisation of an advisory input

from the Department of Health and Consumer Services of the Council, and the

simplification of the areas of responsibility of each of the constituent

Authorities of that Group.   The responsibilities of the Building Surveyor

then became:- All matters relating to the structure of stadia, including crush

barriers, walls, etc.

The South Yorkshire Fire Authority were given the responsibility of Fire

precautions, fire alarms, means of escape, emergency lighting, stadium

capacity.

As it's name implied, it has been an advisory group with the constituent

members providing professional advice for discussion by the group.   An

example of a document giving such professional advice frcm the Building

Surveyors Division to the Advisory Group was 'the Report of the Works

required to be carried out to satisfy The Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975,'

in relation to the Sheffield Sports Stadium, Owlerton, Sheffield, Ref AB12).

One of the effects of this change, was that each of the Authorities were

requested to carry out site inspections and prepare their individual reports

on a submitted proposal or a required inspection.

The group have therefore rarely met at the stadia for the purpose of a joint

inspection since that time. At site meetings, various members of the Working

Party/Advisory Group have discussed matters together as they have inspected

the various stadia, and scsae of these matters have been discussed and

resolved, although not agenda items or minuted. At more formal meetings agenda

items have been followed, and therefore unlisted items of interest to the

group appear to have been missed.   In this context, I refer to crushing

incidents in 1987 and 1988 which do not appear to have been brought to the

attention of the Group.
                                        -   11   -


  Throughout this period I have been conscious of the fact that I should act as

  a professional advisor to the Working Party/Advisory Group and not be a

  decision maker.   Being employed by the same body as the Certificating

  Authority, I have been aware that any personal decision which was contrary to

  the thoughts of other members of the Group/Working Party could have caused

  embarassment for the Authority and confusion to the recipient of such a

  decision.   To this end, I have usually made informal communication with the

  other external constituent members of the Group/Working Party and the clubs

  through the Licensing Section or have advised than informally (personal

  discussion or telephone call) of such a liaison.

^ It must however be appreciated that in respect of many of the schemes I have

  had two roles; the enforcement of Building Regulation requirements as a

  statutory duty; and the provision of advice to the Advisory Group/Working

  Party.   In many instances the club's engineers have designed the building

  proposals and have acted as agent for their clients in the implementation of

  the schemes.   In this respect contact with the engineering consultants has

  professionally been unavoidable and care has been exercised to separate those

  two roles as much as possible.

  The Internal Divisional Memorandum was revised in October 1988, (Ref AB13) to

  take account of the Building Surveyors role in the Advisory Group.    The

  document states:- "The role of the Building Surveyors Division is that of "

  Building Authority", as defined in the Act, and will normally be represented

  at the advisory group meetings by the Principal District Surveyor or the

  Principal Engineer as seems appropriate for the case in question, or by

  both".

  The latter statement was modified by an internal memorandum from the Building

  Surveyor to the Administration and Legal Department, dated 29th September,

  1989, (Ref AB14) where the last paragraph includes:- "Except where I attend

  Advisory Group in person, I am content that Mr.    Butler, represents the

  Division.   Where it is necessary, however, he may be substituted by another
                                     -   12   -


appropriate officer, or be accompanied by another officer, for example,

Mr. Levers or Mr. Sheriff".

Whilst I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of this statement, I reserve

the right to append, amend, or clarify any of the matters at a later date.

JL._____Purpose of Meeting

Follow ing the Working P arty's m eeting with the representatives of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December, 1978, the
Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January, 1979) circulated a
B ep ort, together with P lan s, drawn up by D r. W. Eastwood of Eastwood
and P a r tn e r s. The Secretary had a lso suggested a meeting on Friday,
16th February, 1979, to d iscu ss the docum ents.

The purpose of today's m eeting w as to consider the views which the Working
P arty should put to the Club on the 16th February.

2.     P lan s

(a)      W hilst the "Notes for the Guidance o f Applicants" stated that detailed
plans at 1:100 sc a le should be supplied of all buildings aiid other accommodation
for sp e cta to rs, som e of the plans supplied w ere to 1:200 sca le . The F ire
S ervice felt that the latter siz e w ere acceptable provided a ll of the plans were
to the sam e s c a le , and it was AGEEED that the "Notes for the Guidance of
Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

(b)        The site plan at 1:500 sca le had not been supplied a s required by th^
N o tes, but Eastwood and P artners had undertaken to prepare this in tim e for
F rid a y 's m eeting. The firm had also prom ised that all site fixtures would be
Indicated on that plan.

                                              1.
(c)      It was AGREED that theplans supplied hadin accuracies         and
inadequacies. In particular, they lacked indications of c r e s s sectio n s,
p ro files, structural stab ility, position of handrails and b alu strad es, width
of stairw ays, etc. Where appropriate, these could, a s an altern ative, be
described in a Report.

(d)     The County.Council's hope w as that, in view o f lim ited r e s o u r c e s in
the A rchitectural & Building S erv ices D ivision, the plans supplied and finally
accepted by the Working Party could form the b a sis of the C ertificate
D rawings.
                                        %

3._____Report

(a)    General

It w as recognised that the c riteria s e t out in the Home Office "Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds .(Football)" required new work or reconstruction
to be to a standard not low er than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
in existing situations the criterion w as that of a reasonable degree of safety.
A s the Guide stated, it would be unreasonable, even if it w ere practicable,
to se e k the absolute safety, of everyone attending a ground.

With these factors in mind, both the F ire Service and the P o lic e felt that
the flow of spectators w as the m ost important criteria to be adopted.
W hilst not disagreeing with this viewpoint, the Building Authority suggested
it would be useful to know the reasoning behind the recom m endation in the
Guide that gangways should not be l e s s than 1 .1 m etres w ide. The County •
Council AGREED to try to find this Information out, and the F ire Service
AGREED they would contact their colleagues in other a r e a s who had been
Involved in the C ertification p r o c e s s to ascertain how nearly the 1 .1 m etre
gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations in their
resp ectiv e a rea s.

A t the request of the F ire S erv ice, the County Council a lso AGREED to try
and find out if there was any g en eral recommendation on reduced
ad m ission if a ground w ere used at a night time instead of during the day
tim e.

 (b)     Front Cover

W hilst it was probably a typing m ista k e, it was AGREED that the wording
on the Front Cover should read "REPORT TO_ SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY
COUNCIL" and not "REPORT OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL".
  The Working P arty agreed with the Club's view that, with the existing three
  e x its, there w as no way that the recom mended discharge time of 8 minutes
  could.be m et. Where they disagreed w as that an evacuation time of I l f
  m inutes should be regarded a s acceptable. If no m ore exits w ere to be
. provided, the Working Party AGREED that a crowd lim itation of 11,040
  on the.Spion Kop should be imposed.

 The ex istin g exit at the North end p assed under a bridge with a headroom
 below agreed by the Club to be le s s than the recommended value of 8ft.
 A s this w as in fact some 6'6", the Working Party AGREED that the Club
 be informed that in their view it is e ssen tia l that the floor be lowered to
 rem ove this danger to spectators.

 The ex it at the South side would a lso require widening, and possibly flow
 b a r r ie r s would need installing.

  The area at the back of the Kop would a ls o require close attention.

  If new e x its w ere to be provided by the Club, it was AGREED that at least
  TWO would be required. The m ost econom ical way o f providing one would
  be to u se the g a tes in the existing b a rrier, provided these w ere lined up with
  the gangw ays, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other would
  require to be a com pletely new exit.

  The Building Authority felt-that the m ajority o f the crush b a rriers would fail
  the te s t s , and consequently any n e c e ssa r y re-sitin g would probably not be
  too much of a problem . Certainly the suggested additional b arriers would
• require careful consideration.

  For the p u rp oses of crowd control, the P olice suggested there should be som e
  form of lateral separation. The Working Party AGREED, and it was suggested
  that three m eta l fen ces sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
  to the gangways) should be provided, with a c c e ss between each lim ited to a
  padlocked gateway under the control o f the P olice.

  A s recen t a d v erse weather conditions had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
  could cau se p rob lem s, and it was AGREED that Paragraph 11 (4) of the draft
  C ertificate should be amended so a s to require the Club to take steps to
  clear the Kop of ice and snow before a gam e was played.

  The Building Authority pointed out that information was s till required from
  the Club on profile and step dim ensions and.the slope of the Kop.
 (d)     The West T e r r a c e , (pages 4&5)

  In view of the lack of depth of this ter r a c e , the Club’s offer to reduce the
  spectator lim it to 7 ,2 0 0 , and the discharge time of 6. 6 m inutes, the
t Working Party AGREED that it would be unreasonable to in sist that
I gangways or additional exits m ust be provided.

 However, even if the existing crush b a r r ie r s w ere to p a s s the t e s t s , the
■Working Party AGREED that the b a r r ie r s would require sp ecial attention
 in view of the apparant sharp ed ges, corrosion , etc.

 (e)     The North W est Corner R einforced Concrete T errace              (pages 5 & 6)

  The Working Party AGREED there w ere no real problem s h ere, but the
  Building Authority pointed out that a s w ell a s the crush b a r r ie r s, the
. existing corrugated sheeting would require to p ass the appropriate t e s t s .

 (f)     The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

 W hilst the flow rates and discharge tim e s w ere probably satisfactory (the
 construction and width of the ram ps being such that they could quite properly
 be regarded a s elevated roadways), the fact remained that the gangways in
 the North Stand w ere only 640mm w ide for much of their length, compared
 w ith the recom m ended width of 1 .1 m e tr e s .

 Additionally, observations had shown that hvo-thirds of the spectators u sed
 the upper exit, w hilst the rem ainder used the lower exit. An ideal would be
 to provide additional exits at the top o f the stand but, In view of its can tilever
 construction, the co st would be prohibitive.

 A s an alternative, the Working Party AGREED that consideration m ight be
 given to removing a row of sea ts from the top of the stand down each gangway
 to the upper e x its, with a physical b a rrier a c r o s s the stand below the upper
 ex its to ensure m ore equal u se of both upper and lower exits by sp e cta to rs.
 If this would cause difficulties, a b a rrier in the gangways only below the upper
 ex its might be considered.

 So far a s the Wire Mesh b a rriers under the stand w ere concerned, the
 Working Party AGREED that these m u st either be rem oved or made of a
 permanent construction.

 <g)     The West Stand

 W hilst the ex its w ere adequate and w e ll spaced and the discharge tim es
 w ere acceptable in view of the type o f stand, the F ir e Service felt that
the m ean s of escap e “/e r e not adequate as the o n ly m eans of e g r e s s was
by way of two s ta ir c a s e s . The Working Party AGREED that it w as essen tia l
that another sta irca se be provided, and one on the south-w est corner w as felt
to be the m o st acceptable.

(h)     The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

So far a s the seating arrangem ents w ere concerned, the Working Party
felt that it w as the front, open air part which caused the concern. Because
of the bad in g r e s s /e g r e s s , the Working Party AGREED that two additional
ex its would be required. It was suggested that the m ost econom ical way of
doing this w as by m eans of one discharging at the Spion Kop end and the
other by breaking through the w all by the Tea Bar.

Additionally, the penning arrangem ents of the seating would need to be
looked at c lo se ly .

A s the balustrades and handrails w ere constructed of tim ber, the'Building
Authority considered they would be likely to fail the appropriate te s ts .
A ls o , a s the sta irca se was a 24 instead of the maximum 12 r is e r recommended
in the Guide it w as probable that this would have to be reconstructed.

Contrary to their initial reaction, the F ire Service felt that, provided that the
n e c e s s a r y Increased fire r e s ista n c e m ea su res w ere carried out, the stand
would not be the problem from a combusiability point of view that they had
anticipated.

The Building Authority ex p ressed concern a s to the corrosion of the steel
w ork of the stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

The P o lic e ex p ressed concern about the u se of the car park behind the
Stand. P e r so n s entitled to u se this ca r park frequently arrived ju st before
the start of a m atch and drove through the spectators attempting to gain
a c c e s s to the ground. A s they left imm ediately afterw ards, the sam e thing
occu rred at the end of a m atch. T his practice had to be stopped, either by
banning the u se of the car park entirely on match days or imposing some sort
of tim e restrictio n on its u s e before and after a m atch.

1 .______ P u rp ose of Meeting                               ^

Follow ing the postponem ent of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
w eather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
date, the purpose of the m eeting was to review the position sin ce 12th February,
1979, p rior to the re-a rra n ged m eeting with the Club which was now to take
p lace on 2nd A pril, 1979.

2 .______ P lan s

The plans at 1:500 s c a le and indicating all site fixtures w ere, it was s till understood,
to be supplied by Eastwood & P artn ers at the meeting with the Club.

3 .______ R eport
(a)       General

The County Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
inform ation additional to that contained in their various C ircu lars. B asically,
they had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not
low er than that s e t out in the Guide. However, the maximum flexibility had
to be maintained in the ca se of existing structures and differences in such
m a tters as age, s iz e and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

The F ire S ervice had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
and only in one ca se had the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
adhered to.
(b)      Spion Kop (pages 2, 3 & 4)

Additional to the points^ mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
e x p r e sse d by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
and the lo o s e and broken concrete at the bottom in particular. If attention
was not given to this, it was AGREED that it would be n ecessary to r e s tr ic t
ad m ission to the Kop, additional to the restriction to 11,040 if the extra
e x its are not provided.

On the question of exits, it was again AGREED that it was esse n tia l to lin e
up the gates in the existing barrier with the gangways.. Of the existin g two
ex its, concern was ex p ressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on
the embankment at the exit at the r e a r . A fter discussion, it was AGREED
that the b e st com prom ise was to lea v e things as they existed, provided
handrails are provided on the stairw ays, taking into account the
d esirab ility of maintaining a sm ooth flow .

The F ire Service queried the exact form of the lateral separation d iscu ssed
at the m eeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
bearing on the means of escape recom m endations. After d iscussion, it
was AGREED that the metal fen ces should not be of the clim b-proof type,
that it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
in consequence the padlocked gateway recom mendation should be dropped.
H ow ever, it was AGREED that it was s till d esirable to seek 3 x 2 central
b a rriers but, if the Club realty r e s is te d the suggestion, 2 x 2 could
reluctantly be conceded. The Building Authority stre sse d that whatever
b a rriers w ere provided would have to p a ss the appropriate strain t e s t s .

The fa ct that the height of many of the existin g crush barriers was below the
recom m endation in the Guide, in som e c a s e s w ell below, was pointed out by the
Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the la st m eeting was
a lso reitera ted . It was AGREED that these points must be drawn to the
Club’s attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

(c)       The West T errace (pages 4 & 5)

A s w ell as the condition of the crush b a rriers mentioned at the la s t m eeting,
the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in p laces of the
terra cin g in sm all areas near to the stand. The c r o s s -fa ll on the step s on
the n orth -w est corner exit would a lso require attention as it tended to throw
people forward. The height of the crush b arriers mentioned in regard to tlie -
Spion Kop also applied. It was AGREED that all these points m ust be drawn
to the Club’s attention.

 (d)      The North W est Corner R einforced Concrete T errace (pages 5 & 6)

Having now had the opportunity of having a c lo se r look at the existing corrugated
sheeting., the Building Authority confirm ed that it would require alteration to
m eet the requirem ents of the Guide.

                                   2.
          The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

The rem oval of a row of sea ts from the top of the stand down each gangway
to the upper exits and the rem oval of four seats at those exits was
con firm ed as being a reasonable com prom ise to put to the Club.

A s the a sb e sto s sh eets at the top of the stand were protected, the Building
Authority f e lt that these could be accepted, and confirmed that the glazing
at the ends of the stands was not g la s s and so would not shatter.

(f)      The W est Stand (page 7)

C onsideration was given to the Building Authority's suggestion of la teral
gangways and the segregation of e x its but, after discussion, it was AGREED
that the additional sta ir c a se agreed at the la s t meeting should be confirm ed.
So long as it was of 4-unit exit width, it was AGREED it was not n ecessa ry
to in s is t it should be on the sou th -w est co rn er . Such sta irca ses could be
bought ’’off the p eg” and, if not in stalled in the close season, it was
AGREED that a £ reduction in capacity would be n ecessary.

(g)      The South Stand '(pages 7 & 8)

A s m entioned at the la s t m eeting, the penning arrangements of the seating
and the num bers of se a ts In the row s caused problem s. Bearing in mind the
need for reason ab len ess and to make the situation better, it was AGREED
that, ev en though not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the best
com p ro m ise was to s e e k the rem oval of the existing barriers and their
re-a lig n m en t, togeth er with the widening of the gangways at the position
of the w in g s.

The F ir e S ervice pointed out and it was AGREED that F ire R esistin g Doors
would be required leading to the D ir e c to r s ' seating, and 1 hour fire
r e s is t a n c e would be required for all problem areas under the stand. This
could be reduced to § hour if automatic detection equipment were to be
in sta lle d .

F or th e ir part, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
c o rr o sio n of the steelw ork of the stand, and also pointed out the concrete
spalling which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the balustrading,
b a r r ie r s and guardrails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
It was AGREED all would need to be given attention by the Club.

(h)       G eneral R equirem ents (pages 8 & 9)

A s w ell a s the F ire Service pointing out that the p resent temporary
stru ctu res u se d for p olice and fir s t-a id purposes would need rem oval
fro m a m eans of escap e point of view if the capacity of the North Stand
was not to be reduced, the p o lic e stated that they w ere read y to d iscu ss
with the Club the fa c ilitie s they would requii*e. Briefly, they envisaged
a p e rm an en t stru c tu re alm o st twice as larg e as the existing tem p o rary
s tru c tu re , and expected communications, detention, toilet, p a ra d e room ,
e tc .fa c ilitie s .

So f a r as F irst-A id was concerned, the Sheffield A rea H ealth A uthority
had confirm ed th e ir willingness to provide advice on F irst-A id and
Medical F acilities, but the p erso n nominated (Dr. H. Bailey - S p ecialist
in Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
2nd A pril, 1979. He had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd A pril, but it was recognised that p ossible practical difficulties m ight
p re v e n t his doing so.

           D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           D.I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 ._____ Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2 ._____ Inspection of   Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)     South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be gi^ven.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)     'West Stand

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).

Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.
(c)      North-West Terrace

The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

It was also n o t e d 1that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been protectively wrapped.

(d)      North Stand

The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kop) had been made good.

(e)     Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
be attended to shortly.                                                     '
                                                                            ■
The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of th'e
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

(f)      General

It was n o t e d :-

(i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the.
rear of the Butcher’s Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan.


 Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                  Radial Fences'at Leppings "Lane End

               We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
 installation of two radial fences,on the terrace at the
 Leppings lane end of the ground.

               It is intended that these fences are so positioned
 that they divide this section of the terrace into
 approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
 entrance.

         *          By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
should result.                             A visiting team with only a few followers
will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
retained by the home supporters.

               Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
dictate.

               A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
during a game.                            The gate could be left open, but fastened
back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones

                                                                      R e g istered in E n g la n d -   N o. 1 1 3 4 5 3 1
EASTWOOD £f PARTNERS




   are accupied by supporters of the same team.     When establishing
   the height we have considered that the views to the corner
   flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
   present by the perimeter fence.     We therefore propose that the
   top of the fence should be approximately 1680mm above the
   terrace.

        This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
   but should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
   Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James’s
   Park, the home of Newcastle United.

        We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
  within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

        Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at-
   various locations around the north stand.     Now the gymnasium is
   open to the general public security toother parts of the ground
   must be maintained.     11 is proposed that gates are provided at
   the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
   gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
   stand.     A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
   prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
   Leppings Lane.

        Six copies of our drawing 3563/1 together with two copies
   of our drawings 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.


                                         Yours sincerely,

1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners on behalf of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
gymnasium was open to the general public..

2.    Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any problems
of this nature.

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Terrace.

It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the proposals to instal
two 1680mm hi g h radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

       (i)-       the further calculations required by the Building
                  Authority being satisfactory;

                                                                    DEPARTif'ifiT Of rL;

3.____ Security Gates around North Stand

N o w that the gymnasium was open to .the general public, the Club wished to
erect security gates at the top of -the ramps at both ends of the North
Stand, w i th additional gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road
end of the Stand.    A .separate gate would also be placed behind the West
Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Leppin^Lane.

These gates would .be fastened when the gymnasium only was in use so as to
provide security for the rest of the ground. However, on match days they
would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access.!

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
gates around the'North Stand, subject to* the gates and/or their supports, '
hinges, etc not impinging :on the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

4.    Police and First Aid Facilities

It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid
facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim basis'.
The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
position to the existing timbered facilities during the 1980 close
season.  Whilst some progress had been -made in discussing details of the
facilities, no firm, indication had yet been given as to when they would
actually be provided.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr..D, Vaughan should press the Club and/or its
Consultants   for a firm indication as to when the new police and first
aid facilities are to^-be provided.

5.    Lottery Ticket Boxes

Attention was drawn to the blocked egress which could result if the
timber lottery ticket boxes presently si'ted close to the ramps were to
be tipped over or ignited, either:accidentally or deliberately,

IT WAS AGREED that Mr, Vaughan should draw the Club’s attention to the
desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.

                     Purpose of Meeting
I        /■’   The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated. 9th April
         (     and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of

I              the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
               turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
               segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
               Hillsborough Stadium.
I
               2.    Consideration of Proposals


a              The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals hac? been
               prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
               time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
B              for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
               at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
               home supporters as well.

I              The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
               Police representatives, subject to:-

               (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
                     and the wall of the inner access road;

               (b)   the   central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
ft                   visiting supporters’ terrace) being divided in half by a new
                      central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
                     pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
I                     to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
                      secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
                      on the plan to be abandoned);
I              (c)   the   right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
                      terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence

I                     running from back to front with .two gates (the existing radial
                      fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
                      home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

I              (d)   the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
                     installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
                     area
ft
The County Fire Service saw no objection in principle to the proposals,
subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

3.   Action

IT WAS AGREED

(a)  That             should investigate as a matter of urgency the means
of escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan know the
outcome.

(b)  That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions of the South
Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of the
necessary detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

The purpose of the meeting was'to consider the detailed plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was
recalled that consideration of outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some of the work had actually
 commenced, Messrs. Eastwood'aid P-axtnaejrs had apologised by ’phone that
 submission of the detailed proposaTs for. Safety of Sports Grounds Act
 approval had'apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
-holidays. The plans also included details of repairs to.certain crush,
barriers on the Spion Kop.      . . .... J.                      .

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

I would refer to your letter dated 14th March in connection with the above and
enclose a list of consents on outstanding matters primarily concerning the
Building Authority.

There will, of course, be scaoe overlap of responsibilities and the items are

game if adjacent areas were to be occupied by supporters of the

same    team.          Approval     for the installation of the two radial

fences was given by S. Y. C. C. in their letter of 14th September

1981    (pages 76-77).             The approval was subject to the condition

(paragraph       I.e.    at page 76) that the gates at the- rear of the

fences should be under Police control.



46.     The     installation         work       was    carried      out   by     a    firm    of

Contractors,           Blessvale,        in    October       and   November      1981.        In

places    the crush barriers passed through the radial fences and

there     was   discussion between Mr Strange and Mr England about

this,     as recorded in the memorandum of 4th November 1981 (page

79).       There       was    further         discussion      between     them       about   the

relevant barriers             on 13th November 1981 (page 81).                   The Police

wanted     those       barriers     which passed through the radial                      fences

removed       because        otherwise        spectators     might use them to climb

over     the    radial        fences.         Neither the Club,           nor    Mr    Strange

wished the barriers to be removed because to do so might have

affected safety.              If the relevant barriers had been removed, an

uninterrupted           " channel"       would        have   been    created         along   the

radial     fence from the top of the terrace down to the perimeter

 fence.        Also,    spectators tend to congregate at the top of the

west terrace rather than at the bottom by the perimeter fence

because        their view will           not be obscured by the small mesh of

the     perimeter.            It   was        agreed   in    the    discussions        on    13th

 November       1981    that the barriers would remain in position for

 the next match to see what happened.




                                                - 18 -
47.     The next discussion between Mr Strange and Mr England took

place following the match on 17th November 1981 (page 82).                                          The

Chief       Constable          had    seen     the    barriers         in    position       and     was

content       that       they     should       remain      because          there    had    been     no

problems       at    the       match.        It     was,     therefore,        agreed that the

barriers      would        remain in position passing through the radial

fences as they are today.



48.     I    wrote        to    S. Y. C. C. . on      14th     December         1981       (page    83)

updating       them       on    progress        regarding the installation                    of the

radial       fences       and     security gates.              S. Y. C. C.     replied on 20th

January       1982       (pages      84-85).        That letter recorded doubts still

being voiced by the Police concerning the crush barriers which

passed       through           the    radial        fences.        I    therefore           wrote    to

S.Y.C.C. ‘on 26th January 1982 (pages 86-88) with my views as to

why I felt that the relevant barriers should not be terminated

short of the radial fence.                        I pointed out the aspects of safety

and segregation which were involved and felt that what had been

done        was      a     "reasonable              compromise         between        the     various

interests".              These matters were discussed at a meeting of the

working party held on 4th February 1982 (pages 89-91).                                         It was

 agreed      at     that       meeting    that it was preferable                     from a safety

 point of view to retain the crush barriers which passed through

 the radial fences.



 4 9.       The installation of two further radial fences in the west

 terrace       were        considered          in    1985.       These        were     part   of     the

 reorganisation            of the west terrace which I shall refer to' in

         procedures in addition to the recognition of spectator dangers, and
         should be deployed at agreed positions.

2.0      IMMEDIATE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

2.1      INTRODUCTION

2.1.1    The requirements detailed in this section of the report are required to
         be carried out immediately.

2.1.2    The items relate directly to ingress, egress and general safety
         requirements to ensure reasonable safety. However, seme of these,
         measures are short term and will require further works which are
         covered in later sections to bring them upto a satisfactorystandard.

2.1.3 The report is based on the retention of allthe existingseating and
       terracing (except the South Terrace). The provisions of the report are
       however only applicable if a walkway is maintained for the spectators
       use through the South Terrace area.

2.1.4     For clarity gates have been identified by letters A to I inclusive,
          starting fran Lowther Road and working anti-clockwise around the
          Stadium.                     ,

          In the interests’of safety and maintenance, a permanent identity board-
          should be mounted on or adjacent to each gate to assist identification
          to unfamiliar persons.

 2.2     GATE A

 2.2.1    Paint yellow box with diamond cross hatching, immediately outside
          gates, projecting 3.0 metres by full width of gates, and provide
          adequate stewarding to ensure that obstruction of the gateway is
          prevented when spectators are in the stadium.

 2.2.2    Fit suitable panic bolt, able to be opened by any person, from inside
          the stadium (in an emergency situation) without delay or need for
          additional equipment, e.g. keys.

 2.2.3    Carport structure adjacent to Gate A to be demolished. This structure
          consists of timber posts, timber roof purlins and asbestos cement
          sheeting to the roof. The timber roof members are considerably-under­
          sized for their span and are showing excessive deflection. Snow
          loading could cause collapse.

 2.2.4    Inside turnstile 3A adjoining Gate A, the light switch on the wall is
          loose and is considered a danger. The turnstile equipment appears not
          to have been used for seme time. It is therefore suggested that the
          turnstile be permanently sealed up.

 2.3      GATE B

 2.3.1 Paint yellcw box with diamond cross hatching, Immediately outside
        gates, projecting 3.0 metres by full width of .gates, and provide
         adequate stewarding to ensure that obstruction of the gateway is
         prevented when spectators are in the stadium.

2.3.2    Fit suitable panic bolt, able to be opened by any person, from inside
         the stadium (in an emergency situation) without delay or need for
         additional equipment, e.g. keys.

2.3.3    The wicket door in these gates is not accepted as being suitable for a
         means of egress or emergency egress, when spectators are in the
         stadium.

2.3.4    Positive stand open catches, .positioned so as not to create a trip
         hazard, ar*d of sufficient strength for the size of the gates, need to
         be fitted.

2.3.5    Loose materials on roof of ladies and gents toilets, iirmediately inside
         Gate B, to be removed.

2.4       GATE C

2.4.1     "NO PARKING" sign to be placed on external face of gates.

2.4.2     Provide adequate stewarding to ensure .the gates are unobstructed at all
          H ttv^ that spectators are in the stadium.

2.4.3     Fit positive stand open catches, positioned so as not to create a trip
          hazard, and of sufficient strength for the size of the gates.

2.4.4     Barbed wire'on top of gate not to be within 2.4 metres of adjacent
         • ground level.

2.5       GATES D, E AND F

2.5.1     Paint yellow box with diamond cross hatching, projecting 3.0 metres by
          the full width of all three gates and turnstiles, on the surface of the
          ground outside the stadium. Additionally NO PARKING should be painted
          along the front edge of the box.

          If after an initial trial period of 3 months, the yellow box system is
          ineffective in prohibiting parking of vehicles in this area, a physical
          barrier of concrete bollards or other suitable means must be provided
          to ensure unrestricted egress from any of the gates is maintained at
          all tines during the use of the stadium.

2.5.2     All of these gates to remain unlocked and permanently stewarded whilst
          any spectators are in the stadium.

 2.5.3 Positive stand open catches, positioned so as not to create a trip
       hazard, and of sufficient strength for the size of the gates, need to
       be fitted. •

 2.5.4    Barrier recently installed outside Gate F, to segregate parking area
          fron entrance area, has already been damaged by vehicular impact. The
          barrier needs to be repaired, strengthened and satisfactorily bedded so
          as to achieve the desired stability.

 2.5.5 On the top of the external walling between the stadium and the car ­
        park, barbed wire has been installed, and is at approximately 1.3
        metres above car park level iirnvediately adjacent to Gate F. All
        barbed wire to be minimum 2.4 metres above adjacent ground level.
2.5.6    Although the gates at D, E and F have been altered so as to be capable
         of opening outwards, it is found on close inspection that one of each
         of the double gates needs first to be opened inwards in order to
         release the second gate in each pair. Having released the second gate
         by its vertically mounted hoop handled bolt, both gates can then be
         opened outwards. - This process is unsatisfactory for a major means of
         escape route.

         Further structural alterations are required so as to achieve readily
         available opening outward facilities for both gates in each pair.

2.6      GATE G

2.6.1    Fit suitable panic device, able to be opened by any person frcm inside
          the Stadium,-in an emergency situation, without delay or need for
          additional equipment, e.g. keys. This need only apply when spectators
          are in the Stadium.

2.6.2    Building adjacent to Gate G appears to be in a delapidated condition.
         Loose roof tiles must be removed and broken windows mast be boarded up.

2.7      GATE H

2.7.1    Fit suitable panic bolt, able to be opened by any person from inside
         the Stadium, in an emergency situation, without delay or need for
         additional equipment, e.g. keys.

■2.7.2   Area inmediately inside Gate H presently used for storage of plant and
         materials. This area should not be open to spectators, and must be
         adequately fenced off and gated. When recovery plant is being used for
         stock car racing, the opening to this area must be adequately stewarded.

 2.7.3   Partially buried barbed wire in this area to be reaoved.

 2.8     GATE I

 2.8.1   Identification plate "I" to be positioned on inside of gate.

 2.8.2   Barbed wire over top of gate to be removed or increased in height to
          minimum 2.4 metres.

 2.9     STOCK CAR PADDOCK AREA

 2.9.1    Provide additional floodlighting to paddock area and track access road.
          The level of illumination must be sufficient in all parts of the
          paddock and the access road, to enable the ground surface and any other
          potential hazards to be seen.

 2.9.2   Make good to paddock ground surfaces to form an even walking surface.

 2.9.3   Provide fire fighting appliances, at a suitable position or positions,
          of such type and number so as to be suitable for extinguishing a
          vehicle fire.

 2.9.4    When vehicles are being refuelled, the stadium management must devise a
          safe system to ensure that a NO SMOKING rule is enforced for both
          competitors :and spectators who may be near to that operation.

 2.9.5    Spectators attending events other than stock,car racing should not have
          access to this part of the ground.
2.9.6      Spectators attending stock car events must not be allowed to -use the
           banking to the rear of the East Terrace as an access to, or egress
         . fran, the stock car paddock area.

2.9.7     Loose barbed wire to wall between Gates H and I to be removed. Any
          barbed wire must be a minimum of 2.4 metres above adjacent ground
          level.

2.10      EAST TERRACE

2.10.1    Refix or replace loose timbers to advertising hoardings along rear of
          terrace.

2.10.2    Provide adequate fence, capable of withstanding 3.4 KN/M, along.the

2.10.5    Provide 1200 mm high fencing with gate(s) across the ends of the East
          Terrace abutting the track access road. The construction should be
          strong enough for its purpose and have vertical balusters at 100 nm
          maximum centres. The gate(s) must be steward controlled during stock
          car events, but may be left open during other events where the track
          access road is not used. The width of the gate(s) should satisfy means
          of escape requirements fran the East Terrace for spectators to use Gats
          H in an evacuation.

2.10.6    Fix Warning Notices each side of track access road in clearly
          illuminated and visible positions, stating BEWARE VEHICLES CROSSING.

2.10.7    Provide new gate for opening in perimeter wall midway along terrace,
          and ensure it isin position and locked during every event.

2.11      SOOTH TERRACE

2.11.1    This terrace requires extensive re-building to make it safe to-use,
          therefore, it must not be used for spectators until such works have
          been carried out.

2.11.2    To maintain full access around the stadium, the terrace w ill require a
          path with a smooth even surface to be constructed so as to connect the
          Greyhound Terrace to the track access road adjacent to Gate H. The
          path must be of a width capable of satisfying means of escape require­
          ments fran the Greyhound Terrace and be not less than 1500 mm wide.
          Throughout its length it should be adequately balustraded and
          illuminated.
2.1 1 .:   Provide 1200 irm high fencing with gate(s) across the end of the South
           Terrace abutting the track access road. The construction should be
           strong enough for its purpose and have vertical balusters at 100 irm
           maximum centres. The gate(s) must be steward controlled .during stock
           car events, but may be left open during other events where the track
           access road is not used. The width of the gate(s) should satisfy means
           of escape requirements frcm the Greyhound Terrace for spectators to use
           Gate H in an evacuation.

2 . 11..   Remove shale overspray from terraced passage in front of Greyhound Bar.
           Hake good to any uneven surface.

2 .11.5 Clean out any drainage gulleys which are blocked.

2.11.6 The perimeter wall or other suitable structure must be continued
           between the site of the former totalizator board and the track access
           road, (if this is adjacent to the site of the pathway through the South
           Terrace) so as to prevent any spectator gaining unauthorised access to
           the greyhound track or any of its operating mechanism.

2 .11.7 The access gate from the greyhound terrace should be removed.

           spectators.

 2.11.
     ,11 The extensive areas of thistles and nettles in the vegetation to the
            back of this terracing is considered to be very dangerous.

 2. 11.,12 Exit from this terracing towards Gate G is very uneven and overgrown
            with vegetation. It is very dangerous for this route to be used in the
            hours of darkness.    ?                                *

 2.12       GREYBOUND TERRACE '

 2. 12..1 Ranove, and prevent the use of, crates on the terrace. Loose materials
            such as these should not be allowed to be used as seats or for standing

            surface ana better drainage.
2.12.6    Fix any loose wiring to prevent it being pulled or further damaged.
          - Any electrical connections or joints must be within approved junction
          boxes.

2.12.7    The concrete terracing to the northern end is cracked, and sane parts
          are loose. - satisfactory repairs must be carried out.

2.12.8    The top riser of the terracing is greater than other risers on the
          terracing. Particularly outside the Greyhound Bar this could cause
          a trip hazard. The edge of this nosing needs to be highlighted in
          yellow or white paint.

2.12.9    ’Pit,' area at south end of terrace is constructed on the line of the
          track perimeter wall.- The perimeter wall adjacent to this needs to be
          increased fran 800 mm to approximately 1000 mm. The opening in the
          periireter wall requires to be gated.

         pitch line of terracing.

 2.14      SPORTSMAN TERRACE

 2.14.1 Barbed wire within 2.4 metres of terrace level should be removed from
        around the low roof of the building of the southern end of the terrace.
          This most however be replaced by other materials which prevent this
          roof from being used as a "vantage point" by spectators.

2.14.2    Remove projecting screws from wall in front of the low roof referred to
          in 2.14.1 above.

2.14.3    Re-hang steel gate, between the terrace and the greyhound track access
          road, to-swing outwards from the terrace. The hinges of such a gate
          most be on the track side of the gate opening. It should be ensured
          that the gate is capable of being held in the open position and that it
          is unlocked at all times during any event.

2.14.4    Clean out all yard gulleys to terrace front, and replace any damaged
          gratings with screw dcwn type gratings.

          reach. These cables most be increased in height to at least 2.4 metres
          over this area.

2.14.7    Wires at eaves level to the back of the terracing is hanging down and
          now within easy reach of spectators - it is suggested that all wiring
          in these areas should be trunked.

2.14.8    Steel purlin in 6th bay of roof (frcm to southern end) is badly
          corroded and considered to be in need of urgent replacement.

2.14.9    Sloping coping to top of wall outside entrance to "Sportsman Tavern" to
          be extended to end of wall.

2.14.10 Guttering to entire length of sportsman terrace to clean out and clear
        of vegetation.

2.14.11 Materials and plant to be removed frcm rear access road. This is a
        dedicated means of escape route and should not be obstructed in any
        way. Any permanent plant storage adjacent to the roadway should be
        adequately balustraded 'to form a separate area.                          ,

2.14.12 Openings to underfloor void of betting booths to be sealed - Adequate

4.0      WORKS REQUIRED TO INCREASE CROWD CAPACITY

4.1      INTRODUCTION

4.1.1    Before any consideration is given to increasing the crowd capacity
          above the present figure of 4000, all the works in Sections 1.3,
          2.0 and 3.0 must be carried out.

4.1.2    Any increase in crowd capacity must be considered in the light of
         legislation and knowledge current at the time of the request.

4.1.3    Due to the diversity of activities at the Stadium, it iray be necessary
         to design requirements to cater for a specific spectator group, and not
         to increase capacity for all events.

         the two parts of the ground, the provision of refreshment facilities in
         each part, and separate turnstiles of adequate numbers to cater ,for
         estimated demand.

4.2.3    An increase in crowd capacity for this purpose would also necessarily
         involve the installation of properly designed and positioned crush
         barriers in any used terrace areas.

4.2.4    Proposals for this purpose would need to be the subject of very
         detailed discussions between all members of the SSGA advisory grouD.

DIVISIONAL MEMORANDUM NO 26 (Revised)                             October 1988




SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

1.    Powers and Responsibilities

1.1   Following the demise of the County Council, the im p le r r e n ta tio n of
      of this Act became the full responsibility of the City Council on
      the 1st April 1986. Its implementation rests with the Administration
      and Legal Department (Chief Licensing Officer) assisted as necessary
      by the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group, which is a panel of
      officers drawn from various Departments, other statutory
      authorities, and external sources as required.

1.2   The 1975 Act has been amended by the Fire Safety and Safety of
      Places of Sport Act 1987, and currently covers sports grounds at
      which either Association Football, Rugby League Football or Rugby
      Union Football is played, and having a ground capacity, in the
      opinion of the Secretary of State, in excess of 10,000. Future
      commencement orders may bring operational Part III of the 1987 Act,
      which will introduce a system of safety certification for stands
      with covered accommodation for 500 or more spectators (Regulated
      stands).

1.3   In connection with the above powers, the following have been agreed
      as being the general areas of responsibility for the participating
      authorities.

              Authority                         Area of Responsibility

       The Building Surveyor            All matters relating to the structure
                                        of stadia, including crush barriers,
                                        walls, etc. .

       South Yorkshire County           Fire Precautions, fire alarms, means
       Fire Service                     of escape, emergency lighting,
                                         stadium capacity.

       South Yorkshire Police           Stadium policing, evacuation
                                         procedures, access of emergency
                                         vehicles and emergency planning.

       Department of Health and         An advisory input on aspects of
       Consumer Services                general safety, general safety
                                         management of stadia and first aid.

1.4    The role   of the BSD is that of "Building Authority", as defined in
       the'Act,   and will normally be represented at the advisory group
       meetings   by the Principal District Surveyor or the Principal
       Engineer   as seems appropriate for the case in question, or by both.
1.5   Basically there are two cases where the views of BSD will be sought
      or will have to be put forward:-

      CASE A

      Where alterations or new work is proposed where in addition to the
      need to satisfy requirements under the Act ("Green Code" requirements),
      approval under Building Regulations will be necessary, irrespective
      of what stage it will be sought, or

      CASE B

      Where work is proposed or is to be required to satisfy the Green
      Code, but which will not require approval under Building Regulations
      or planning permission.

      NB.   It will usually have been the case that the Chief Licensing
            Officer will have disseminated any appropriate information,
            including plans, at or between meetings of the Advisory Group.

2.    Procedure within BSD

2.1   Where CASE A applies GAU will adopt the primary co-ordinating role
       in the Division, will conduct any necessary liaison with external
       Departments and bodies, and will agree, in consultation with SSU
       and SAU at Principal or Assistant Principal level, matters of
       compliance with the Green Code.

2.2   Such consultation will also take place where for example any
      details are submitted in response to a conditional approval or where
      amendments are submitted to the scheme, even if such details appear
      to be of interest only to one of the BSD Units concerned.

2.3   Where CASE B applies SSU will adopt the primary co-ordinating role
       in the Division, will conduct any necessary liaison with external
       Departments and bodies, and will agree, in consultation with SAU and
       GAU, at Principal or Assistant Principal level, matters of
       compliance with the Green Code.

2.4   Generally all observations relating to the Green Code requirements
      and any other matters relating to the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
      should be in writing, and sent to or via the Chief Licensing Officer
      of Administration and Legal Department. All meetings should be
      properly minuted as appropriate,-using central files as follows
      which are kept by the Building Surveyor's secretary:-

            Sheffield Wednesday         -        File   73
            Sheffield United            -        File   72
            General SSGA matters        -        File   71
            Owlertcn Stadium            -        File   96

      Other files will, be created as necessary for additional sports
      grounds or designated stands.

3.    Planning Permission

3.1   Large improvements require planning permission and this may have
      been sought in advance of approval under the Green Guide or Building
                               -   3 -




Regulations. In order that the position under s.55 SYA 1980 (access
for fire brigade) is safeguarded it is essential that the provisions
of the section are brought to the notice of the applicant when the
planning permission is issued.

Safety at Sports Grounds
Advisory-Group frfegtings


I refer to your msuDrandum of 25 September concerning the perimeter walls
of Sheffield United Football Club and the question of the membershiD of
the Advisory Group.

Mr Butler is currently indisposed and therefore a full reply concemina
the walls will be sent after his return. However, may I draw your
attention to;my report to you dated 24 toy, 1989 (for" the attention of
Mr D Ecwnes) wherein the condition of these walls was infact noted (at
item 6.5) and that further investigation would be needed in order to
determine appropriate action.

As to the membership cf the Advisory Group, I note your intention to
invite .Mr B J G Levers to future meetings. As a matter of principle I do
not think it is necessary for an authority or department to'be represented
by more than one person. To do otherwise is to invite the Advisorv-Grouo
to become again an unwieldy body consumed by indecision.

Clearly, however, there will,be occasions when such a representative micht
wish to be accompanied by other officers of the same department to give"
advice to him/her as may be necessary on particular issues. I see no
problem in that.

Except where I attend an Advisory Group in person, I am content that
Mr Butler represents the Division. Where it is necessary, however, he may
be substituted by another appropriate officer or be accompanied by another
officer, for example, Mr Levers or Mr Sheriff. I trust that I make m/self
clear on this point.

THE HILLSBOROUGH CRIMINAL INQUIRY -
TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH SUPERINTENDENT TAYLOR ON 24TH MAY, 1990 BETWEEN
APPROXIMATELY 9.15 A.M., AND .10.00 A.M._______________________________________


Superintendent Taylor first of all mentioned that he had been on holiday CHIU.
that was the reason for him not coming back to me sooner.  He said he had now
had the opportunity of reading the statement which I had prepared and it seems
to answer a lot of his questions.

He does however want to make an arrangement to take a formal statement from me
covering various areas which are still outstanding including a number of those
which he mentioned on the last visit.

I explained that I had done some work on the basis of the questions he had
raised last time and that I thought these would assist the process considerably.
We then went on tp discuss at some length some of the issues raised and I think
I managed to explain a bit further about the   delegation      procedure although Iam
convinced that Mr.   Taylor is still not clear about it. It is clear that he
wants to resolve the delegation question entirely and he indicated quite plainly
that he wished to interview people involved in this delegation process.    He
specifically asked about Mr. Pensam and I explained the situation as
diplomatically as possible.  He also mentioned the Chair of the appropriate
Committee.

Mr. Taylor went on to indicate that the procedure which he proposed to adopt was
to get something down in writing at a meeting in order to provide him with a
basis for his discussions with other people.   He thought that perhaps it may not
be possible to get   a signed statement on the day of his      visit but he hoped that
something could be   committed to writing with a view to having      it drawn up asa
statement in due course.

It is clear that Mr. Taylor is anxious to proceed with his enquiries and we
swopped around a few dates and came to the conclusion that possibly Tuesday the
5th June or Friday the 8th June would be most appropriate for an interview date.
I promised him that I would get back to him as soon as possible.

I talked briefly to Mr. Webster about this issue and we discovered in
Mrs • Bashforthfs Diary that there was apparently nothing on Friday t tic 8th Juiiu »
although Tuesday the 5th was booked for something else.

       I am employed by Sheffield City Council in the Admin and Legal

Department as Chief Licensing Officer.                          I have been employed by the City

Council since September 1971 and have held my current post since 11 July

1977.      I have a HNC in Public Administration.

      My job entails the management of the licensing section which deals

with 33 licensing systems including taxis, private hire vehicles,

operators and drivers, cinemas, theatres and places of public

entertainment as well as the safety of sports grounds licensing system.

       In the course of these duties I prepare written reports for Council

Committees, the job involves liaison with other departments and outside

agencies such as Fire and Police.

       On 1 April 1986 South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council ceased to

exist by virtue of the Local Government Act 1985.                                The County Council had

responsibility for the discharge of functions under the Safety of Sports

Grounds Act 1975, these were to be taken over by Sheffield City Council in

respect of sports grounds within Sheffield, including Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club.          This entailed the City Council making arrangements to take

over this function.

      I recall that in February/March 1986 I spoke to Mr VAUGHAN of the

County Council then dealing with the Safety of Sports Grounds, at his

offices in Barnsley.             I also spoke to Police and Fire Officers in

Sheffield.

      In order to establish a framework within which Sheffield City Council

could exercise its functions which would be acquired on 1 April 1986 I

prepared a report which was submitted through the Head of Department.                                   The

report was submitted to the General Purposes Panel which was a sub

committee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme

Committee (referred hereafter as MEGS) which is in turn a Committee of the

City Council.          The report was submitted to the Panel on 3 March 1986.                           I

produce that report, (Ref DMB1) (Ex                          ).

      The report recommended that all the powers and duties of the City

Council under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the

General Purposes Panel.              Further that the powers under Sections 10 and 11

of the Act which deal with Emergency Procedure Powers and the Power to

authorise Officers respectively be delegated to the Head of the Admin and

Legal Department.             The power under Section 10 had a consultation

recommendation.

      At its meeting on 3 March 1986 the Panel resolved in accordance with

the report.         The minutes of the Panel were subsequently, approved by MEGS

at its meeting on 17 March 1986.                 In turn the minutes of MEGS were

approved by the City Council at its meeting on 9 April 1986.                               I produce an

extract from the Council Summons dated 9 April 1986 (Ref DMB2) (Ex                                          ).

      The effect of this decision making process was that as from the 9

April 1986 the delegations approved by the Panel came into full legal

effect.

      All the County Council files in relation to Sports Grounds in

Sheffield were handed over to me on the demise of the County Council.

Consequently I was able to examine their administrative system more

thoroughly before making a further report to the Panel.

      The Council now having acquired the functions, it was necessary to

establish an administrative system within which they could fulfil its

functions under the legislation.                 To achieve this I prepared a further and

more detailed report which was submitted via the Head of Department to the

Panel.      I produce the report (Ref DMB3) (Ex                            ).

      The Panel considered the report at its meeting on 6 May 1986 and

resolved, "that

      a)      the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

              former South Yorkshire County Council under the Safety of Sports

              Grounds Act 1975 be noted and authority be given for the

              continuation of such system for the time being.

      The resolution also deals with other non material matters.

      As the Panel had full delegated power to deal with this issue the

resolution took affect immediately.

      As a matter of routine the minutes of the Panel meeting were seen by

MEGS and the City Council.               I produce an extract from the Council Summons

(Ref DMB4) (Ex                 ).

      The administrative system adopted was based on the formal County

Council system and comprised two main components.                               These were bi-annual

inspections of sports grounds and meetings of an officer working party.

     Dealing with the bi-annual inspections these were carried out by

representatives of, Police, Fire Service, Building Surveyors, Division of

the City Council.

     Also in attendance could be myself and representatives of the Club.

It involved a thorough inspection of the stadia and the identification of

any defects.        Any defects found were brought to the attention of the

Safety Certificate holder and his technical representative if present.

Depending upon the nature of any defect steps were then agreed for

rectification.

      The officer working party meetings comprised of representatives of the

same organisations but representatives of the Club or their technical

advisors were not invited as a matter of course after 1 April 1986.                                    Dr

EASTWOOD or a representative of his firm and a club representative were

present at inspections carried out by the officer working party.

      Examination of officer working party minutes pre 1 April 1986 show

that on occasions either Dr EASTWOOD and/or his representative and/or a

representative of the club attended meetings.                        I am unable to comment upon

the extent of the involvement of Dr EASTWOOD and his company in the

working party system prior to 1 April 1986.

      The officer working party, post April 1986, considered all aspects of

safety of spectators at sports grounds, acting as a co-ordinating body

which attempted to ensure that a balanced and consistent approach was

maintained to current issues ie provision of disabled facilities in the

North Stand at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, which involved the

construction of ramps etc.

      In adopting the administrative system from the County Council the role

of the constituent agencies was divided and defined in accordance with a

schedule drawn up by the County Council.                         This gave responsibility for the

terraces, structural and means of escape to the Building Surveyors

Department and Fire Brigade respectively as the prime authorities.

      The Building Surveyors Department was also the prime authority for the

spacing of crush barriers and the strength of those barriers and perimeter

walls.      The Council was the prime authority for estimation of safe ground

capacity.        I produce the schedule (Ref DMB5) (Ex                       ).

      As part of the administrative arrangements the officer working party

in addition to making agreements (for example in respect of work to be

carried out) could make recommendations to the Panel.                          Recommendations

could cover any issue in relation to safety of sports grounds, examples of

issues in which the working party did make recommendations to the Panel

involved the South Stand roof and the Spion Kop at Sheffield Wednesday.

      If the working party were unable to reach agreement on any matter then

it would be referred to the Panel.                   If the Club refused to implement

something agreed by the working party then this would be referred to the

Panel.

      Minutes of the officer working party were taken by me due to my

position with the Council.               So far as my involvement with the working

party is concerned I acted as Clerk/Secretary and took the lead as the

occasion demanded although in practice this did not arise very often.

      Regarding the removal of Barrier 144, this arose at the bi-annual

inspection attended by the various agencies at Hillsborough on 7 August

1986.      Representation was made by the Police for two sections of the

barrier in the North Central Pen to be removed so that persons entering

the terrace from the tunnel would not be obstructed by it.                           According to

the Police some difficulties had arisen in this area.                         Following

discussion it was agreed by the officer working party that the barrier be

reduced.       In attendance at the time that the discussions were taking place

were representatives of EASTWOODS on behalf of the Club, although I am

unable to name the individual.

      During the course of the discussion in regard to the reduction of the

barrier I am unable to recall whether any mention was made on the question

of crowd capacity of this part of the ground.                        My personal notes taken at

the time are not available.

      So far as I am concerned the working party arrived at an agreement

which was wholly consistent with past practice and the administrative

procedures briefly described in the report of 6 May 1986 and in accordance

with the resolution 4(a) of the General Purposes Panel meeting held on 6

May 1986.

      In the period after May 1986 a review was carried out by my department

of the administrative system relating to safety of sports grounds.                                      As

part of this review consultation took place with Police, Fire, Building

Surveyors Department and Health and Consumer Services Department (of the

Council).        This lead to a draft report being prepared and circulated to

these authorities on 3 August 1987 for their comments.                          I produce a copy

of the letter circulating the draft to the Fire Brigade (Ref DMB6)

(Ex           ), letters to the other agencies followed the same format.

      Following receipt of replies from the agencies a report was submitted

to the Panel via the Head of Admin and Legal Services Department on 7

September 1987 which reflected the consultation process.                             I produce the

report (Ref DMB7) (Ex                   ).

      A resolution was passed by the Panel on that date and took full legal

effect immediately.             The minutes of the meeting were passed to MEGS and

the Council for information only.                 I produce an extract from the Council

Summons dated 7 October 1987 (Ref DMB8) (Ex                                ).   The purpose of the

review was to update the administrative system and to try to clarify and

simplify the system.

      The Panel resolved that:

      a)      the details contained in the report now submitted regarding the

              operation of the Councils Certification function for the safety

              of sports ground be noted.

      b)      the revised administration system set out in the report,

              including the establishment of the proposed Safety of Sports

              Grounds Advisory Group comprising representatives of the building

              Surveyor, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service, the South

              Yorkshire Police and the Director of Environmental Health and

              Consumer Services to advise the Council on matters relating to

              the Safety of Sports Grounds be approved and

      c)      authority be delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

              Department to deal with all routine matters in connection with

              the administrative system.

      It will be noted that there are minor differences between the

resolution and the recommendations in the report.

      The significant changes arising from the review are that the Health

and Consumer Services Department now have a role, the inspection system

altered to annual not bi-annual and included inspections during specified

activities.         The practical affect of the change to the inspection system

was that written reports were submitted by each authority to me following

an inspection.          The officer working party ceased to exist and it was

replaced by the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group.                           This would

function as a forum for discussion between officers, its most regular use

would probably be the discussion of items of advice to the Council before

they are finally formulated by the advising authority.

      Meetings of the Advisory Group would be held at the request of the

agencies and on the receipt of a request the Admin and Legal Services

Department would arrange a meeting and circulate a list of items to be

discussed.

      At the conclusion of the meeting a further list of items would be

prepared and the details of action agreed to be taken by each agency would

be noted.        It is then anticipated that detailed written advice would be

provided by those agencies and be acted upon as appropriate.                              Copies of

correspondence were retained by the Admin and Legal Department.

      The roles of the various agencies were also simplified from those

previously laid down in the schedule referred to (Ref DMB5).                               Thus the

Building Surveyors Department had responsibility relating to the structure

of stadia, including crush barriers, walls etc and South Yorkshire County

Fire Service were responsible for amongst other things, means of escape

and stadia capacity.             The Health and Consumer Services Department had an

input on Health and Safety matters including First Aid.                           Built into the

system was a general provision for flexibility.

      The situation so far as Eastwoods and the club were concerned remained

the same as the officer working party post April 1986.

      Dealing with the delegation given by the Panel to the Head of Admin

and Legal Services Department in relation to routine matters.

Interpretation of the phrase "routine matters" is a matter for individual

judgement in the circumstances in a particular case.                                       Generally the

operation of the delegated power is very similar to that in other

licensing systems, operated by the Council.                                 Taking account of my

responsibilities as Chief Licensing Officer, I operated the day to day

running of the system on behalf of the Head of Admin and Legal Services

Department.         Mr PENSAM, now retired, was the Head of the Department during*-

1986/87 and his assistant Head of Department was Mr WEBSTER.

      This administrative system was in force at the time of the

Hillsborough Disaster on 15 April 1989.

      As far as 1 am concerned the Officer Working Party and subsequently

the Advisory Group were regarded as the Council’s source of professional

advice in relation to Safety of Sports Grounds matters.                                          The methods of

communication between the authorities comprising the Advisory Group were

general ones, telephone, meetings, memos and letters and this would

include liaison with the Building Surveyors Department.

      Communication with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was on the same

basis as with the other authorities.

      Dealing with the relationship between the Football Club, the Advisory

Group and the Council, I would describe this as reasonably satisfactory.

The impression I have is that the Club were reasonably safety conscious

and generally complied with requests made of them.                                      I am aware that a

number of issues involved more discussion than others but eventually

agreement was reached.

      Post April 1986 when the City Council took possession of the files

from the County Council in regard to the Safety of Sports Grounds I did

read through them including the file on Hillsborough Stadium.                                              I also read

about this time the Green Guide on Safety at Sports Grounds 1976.                                                  There

was a very large amount of paperwork and I cannot specifically recall any

particular issues and this includes the erection of radial fences in the

West Terraces in 1981 and 1985 or the crushing in the terraces in 1981.

On 1 April 1986 bearing in mind that the Safety of Sports Grounds system

had been operated for a considerable length of time by a responsible body

(South Yorkshire County Council), I was reasonably entitled to assume in

the absence of any contrary evidence, that the sports grounds in

Sheffield, including Hillsborough Stadium, were reasonably safe.

             MR BOWNES TO DRAFT INTO STATEMENT SOMETHING TO COVER KNOWLEDGE OF

             THE ELEVATION IN TUNNEL INTO CENTRAL PENS, BARRIER CONFIGURATION

             SCHEDULE 3 OF SAFETY CERTIFICATE.

      The method by which I arranged for reasonable safety to be monitored

at Sports Grounds in Sheffield contained three main elements.                                              The first

element is inspections of Sports Grounds by professional officers, these

are well documented in the files.                     The second element was the written

communications to working party members in early 1987 asking for their

views on sports ground safety in Sheffield, all communications are

available if required.               The third element was the review of the Safety

of Sports Grounds system covered in the report to the General Purposes

Panel in September 1987 (Ref DMB 7) (Ex                            ).

      Had any of the experts identified any issues relating to reasonable

safety then the system I have outlined should have encouraged them to do

so.      I am aware that the Green Guide does have a relevance to reasonable

safety issues.

      Regarding amendments to the Safety Certificate my view is that it is

not necessary to physically alter or amend the original certificate

document.        Where amendments are made by the council in accordance with

legislation it is sufficient that notice procedures as specified are

followed.        This involves notifying by letter various parties involved and

notices in the Press.             With regard to the increase in capacity for the

Spion Kop this procedure was followed with the exception of the notice in

the press.

      As part of the third element referred to previously the Safety

Certificate conditions were reviewed on two separate occasions, the second

and most detailed draft being circulated to the authorities for comment on

30 March 1989.           I produce the letter, to the Chief Fire Officer, together

with the draft conditions (Ref DMB 9) (Ex                               ).   A similar letter and

draft were sent to the other authorities.

      The Council as the licensing authority have a duty to enforce within

their area the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and

regulations made under it and for that purpose, to arrange for the

periodical inspection of designated Sports Grounds.                            In carrying out tlie

functions I have described I consider that they, the Council have

fulfilled their duty.

              1ST APRIL 1986 WHEN SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL FIRST TOOK OVER THE

      A written submission was prepared by me and submitted to Lord Justice

TAYLOR’S enquiry               on behalf of Sheffield City Council.           This submission

deals in detail with many of the                 issues dealt with          in this statement and

should be read in conjunction with it.                      I produce a copy of the submission

(Ref DMB 10) (Ex                   ).

      Subsequent to the submission, I gave evidence to the TAYLOR enquiry on

27 and 28 June 1989.               I produce a copy of the transcript of my evidence

(Ref DMB 11) (Ex                   ).

      The transcript is the truth although some points needed clarification

which I have made in this statement.                    I am content that the submission and

transcript be used in any proceedings.

This entailed the City Council making arrangements to take over this

function.

      I recall that in February/March 1986 I spoke to Mr VAUGHAN of the

County Council then dealing with the Safety of Sports Grounds, at his

offices in Barnsley.               I also spoke to Police and Fire Officers in

Sheffield.

      In order to establish a framework within which Sheffield City Council

could exercise its functions which would be acquired on 1 April 1986 I

prepared a report which was submitted through the Head of Department.                                     The

report was submitted to the General Purposes Panel which was a sub

committee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme

Committee (referred hereafter as MEGS) which is in turn a Committee of the

City Council.            The report was submitted to the Panel on 3 March 1986.                           I

produce that report, (Ref DMB1) (Ex                           ).

       The report recommended that all the powers and duties of the City

Council under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the

General Purposes Panel.                Further that the powers under Sections 10 and 11

of the Act which deal with Emergency Procedure Powers and the Power to

      As the Panel had full delegated power to deal with this issue the

resolution took affect immediately.

      As a matter of routine the minutes of the Panel meeting were seen by

MEGS and the City Council.                   I produce an extract from the Council Summons

(Ref DMB4) (Ex                   ).

       The administrative system adopted was based on the formal County

Council system and comprised two main components.                                    These were bi-annual

inspections of sports grounds and meetings of an officer working party.

       Dealing with the bi-annual inspections these were carried out by

representatives of, Police, Fire Service, Building Surveyors, Division of

the City Council.

       Also in attendance could be myself and representatives of the Club.

It involved a thorough inspection of the stadia and the identification of

any defects.           Any defects found were brought to the attention of the

Safety Certificate holder and his technical representative if present.

Depending upon the nature of any defect steps were then agreed for

rectification.                                                ' *>

      As part of the administrative arrangements the officer working party

in addition to making agreements (for example in respect of work to be

carried out) could make recommendations to the Panel.                          Recommendations

could cover any issue in relation to safety of sports grounds, examples of

issues in which the working party did make recommendations to the Panel

involved the South Stand roof and the Spion Kop at Sheffield Wednesday.

      If the working party were unable to reach agreement on any matter then

it would be referred to the Panel.                     If the Club refused to implement

something agreed by the working party then this would be referred to the

Panel.

      Minutes of the officer working party were taken by me due to my

position with the Council.                 So far as my involvement with the working

party is concerned I acted as Clerk/Secretary and took the lead as the

occasion demanded although in practice this did not arise very often.

      Regarding the removal of Barrier 144, this arose at the bi-annual

inspection attended by the various agencies at Hillsborough on 7 August

1986.      Representation was made by the Police for two sections of the

barrier in the North Central Pen to be removed so that persons entering

the terrace from the tunnel would not be obstructed by it.                                According to

the Police some difficulties had arisen in this area.                           Following

discussion it was agreed by the officer working party that the barrier be

reduced.         In attendance at the time that the discussions were taking place

were representatives of EASTWOODS on behalf of the Club, although I am

unable to name the individual.

       During the course of the discussion in regard to the reduction of the

barrier I am unable to recall whether any mention was made on the question

              operation of the Councils Certification function for the safety

              of sports ground be noted.

      b)      the revised administration system set out in the report,

              including the establishment of the proposed Safety of Sports

              Grounds Advisory Group comprising representatives of the building

               Surveyor, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service, the South

              Yorkshire Police and the Director of Environmental Health and

               Consumer Services to advise the Council on matters relating to

              the Safety of Sports Grounds be approved and

      c)       authority be delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

              Department to deal with all routine matters in connection with

              the administrative system.

      It will be noted that there are minor differences between the

resolution and the recommendations in the report.

      The significant changes arising from the review are that the Health

and Consumer Services Department now have a role, the inspection system

altered to annual not bi-annual and included inspections during specified

activities.          The practical affect of the change to the inspection system

was that written reports were submitted by each authority to me following

an inspection.            The officer working party ceased to exist and it was

replaced by the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group.                            This would

function as a forum for discussion between officers, its most regular use

would probably be the discussion of items of advice to the Council before

they are finally formulated by the advising authority.

      Meetings of the Advisory Group would be held at the request of the

agencies and on the receipt of a request the Admin and Legal Services

       I am employed by Sheffield City Council in the Administration and

City Council since September 1S71 and have held my current post since 11

July 1977.          I have a HNC in Public Administration.

       My job entailed the management of the licensing section which deals

with 33 licensing systems including ta x i s , private hire vehicles,

operators and drivers,                cinemas,      theatres and places of public

entertainment as well, as the safety of sports grounds licensing system.

outside agencies such as the Fire Service and the Police.

Hillsborough.           This entailed the City Council making arrangements to take

over this function,

       I recall that in February/March 1986 I spoke to Mr VAUGHAN of the

County Council who was then dealing with the Safety of Sports Grounds, at

his offices in Barnsley.                  I also spoke to the Police and the Fire Service

and Building Surveyors about Safety of Sports Grounds.                                     I did not receive

any information to the effect that any serious safety issues were

outstanding.

       In order to establish a framework within which Sheffield City Council

could exercise its functions which would be acquired on 1 April 1986 I

prepared a report which was submitted through the Head of Department, to

the General Purposes Panel which was a sub committee of the Municipal

Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee (referred hereafter as

MEGS) which is in turn a Committee of the City Council.                                     The report was

submitted to the Panel on 3 March 1986.                           I produce that report,            (Ref DMB1)

(Ex           ).

       The report "recommended that the following delegations be approved

(a)           All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of

               Sports Ground Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes

               Panel;

(b)           The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975                                    Act

               be delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department

               in consultation with Chairman or Deputy Chairman of this Panel or

               of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme

               Committee as appropriate.

 (c)          The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act                                    be

               delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department."

       At its meeting on 3 March 1986 the Panel resolved in accordance with

the report.            The minutes of the Panel were subsequently approved by MEGS

at its meeting on 17 March 1986.                              In turn the minutes of MEGS were

approved by the City Council at its meeting on 9 April 1986.                                                 I produce an

extract from the Council Summons dated 9 April 1986 which contains these

minutes       (Ref DMB2)          (Ex              ).

       As from the 9 April 1986 the delegations approved by the Panel came

into full legal effect.

       All the County Council files (which consist of some thousands of

documents and plans) in relation to Sports Grounds in Sheffield were

handed over to me on the demise of the County Council.                                              Consequently I was

able to examine their administrative system more thoroughly before making

a further report to the Panel.

       The Council now having acquired the functions, it was necessary to

establish an administrative system within which it could fulfil its

functions under the legislation.                              To achieve this I prepared a further and

more detailed report which was submitted via the Head of Department to the

Panel on 6 May 1986.                    I produce the report (Ref DMB3)                        (Ex              ).

       The Panel considered the report at its meeting on 6 May 1986 and

resolved (amongst other things),                            "that

        a)      the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

                former South Yorkshire County Council under the Safety of Sports

                Grounds Act 1975 be noted and authority be given for the

                 continuation of such system for the time being."

        The resolution also deals with other non material matters.

        As the Panel had full delegated power to deal with this issue the

 resolution took effect immediately.

      As a matter of routine the minutes of the Panel meeting were seen by

MEGS and the City Council.                      I produce an extract from the Council Summons

dated 4 June 1986 which contains these minutes (Ref DMB4)                                       (Ex                     )•

       The administrative system adopted was teased on the former County

Council system and comprised two main components.                                   These were meetings of

an Officer Working Party at which bi-annual inspections of sports grounds

were carried out and meetings of the Working Party on other occasions to

discuss various matters.

       Dealing with the bi-annual inspections these were carried out by

representatives of the Police, the Fire Service and the Building Surveyors

Division of the CiL/ Council.

       Also in attendance would be myself and representatives of the Club.

Inspections' involved a thorough check of the stadia and the identification

of any defects.                  Any defects found were brought to the attention of the

Safety Certificate holder and/or his technical representative if present.

Depending upon the nature of any defect steps were then agreed for

rectification.

       The Officer Working Party meetings comprised representatives of the

same organisations but representatives of the Club or their technical

advisors were not members of it.                         Dr EASTWOOD and/or a representative of

his firm and/or of the Club could of course be present during inspections

and during General Purpose Panel meetings when relevant issues were being

discussed.            I do not recall inviting Dr EASTWOOD etc. to attend Working

Party or Advisory Group meetings.

       Examination of Officer Working Party minutes pre 1 April 1986 show

that on occasions either Dr EASTWOOD and/or his representative and/or a

representative of the club attended meetings.                                I am unable to comment upon

the extent of the involvement of Dr EASTWOOD his company or Club

representatives in the Working Party system prior to 1 April 1986.

       The Officer Working Party, post April 1986, considered all aspects of

safety of spectators at sports grounds, acting as a co-ordinating body

which attempted to ensure that a balanced and consistent approach was

maintained to current issues.                     For example the             provision of disabled

facilities in the North Stand at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, which

involved the construction of ramps etc.

       In adopting the administrative system from the County Council the role

of the constituent agencies was divided and defined in accordance with a

schedule drawn up by the County Council.                             This gave responsibility for

"the carrying out of inspections, re inspections and making final

technical recommendations..." to ’primary authorities’.                                      For example the

’Primary Authority’ for the spacing and strength of barriers and strength

of perimeter walls and terraces (structural) was the building surveyor and

for terraces (means of escape) the Fire Service.

       The Council was the prime authority for estimation of safe ground

capacity.            I produce the schedule which was in force until 1987 (Ref DMB5)

(E x            )•
       As part of the administrative arrangements the Officer Working Party

in addition to making "agreements"                       (for example in respect of work to be

carried out) could make recommendations to the Panel.                                      Recommendations

could cover any issue in relation to safety of sports grounds, examples of

issues in which the working party did make recommendations to the Panel

involved the South Stand roof and the Spion Kop (both of which are at the

Hillsborough Stadium).

       If the Working Party were unable to reach agreement on any matter then

it would be referred to the Panel.                              If the Club             refused to implement

something agreed by the Working Party then this                                         would be referred tothe

Panel.

       Minutes of the Officer Working Party were taken by me due to my

position with the Council.                        So far as my involvement with the Working

Party is concerned I acted as Clerk/Secretary and took the lead as the

occasion demanded although in practice this did not arise very often,

owing to the smooth operation of the Working Party.

       Regarding the reduction of Barrier 144, this arose at the bi-annual

inspection attended by the various agencies at Hillsborough on 7 August

198&         Representation was made by the Police for two sections of the

barrier in the North Central Pen to be removed so that persons entering

the terrace from the tunnel would not be obstructed by it.                                                    According to

the Police some difficulties had arisen in this                                         area.       Following

discussion it was agreed by the Officer Working Partythat the barrier                                                         be

 reduced.         In attendance at the time that the discussions were taking place

were representatives of EASTWOODS on behalf of the Club, although I am

 unable to name the individual(s).

        During the course of the discussion in regard to the reduction of the

 barrier I am unable to recall whether any mention was made on the question

 of crowd capacity of this part of the ground.                                       My personal notes taken, at

 the time are not available.

        So far as I am concerned the working party arrived at an "agreement"

 which was wholly consistent with past practice and the administrative

 procedures briefly described in the report of 6 May 1986.                                                Such

’agreements’ were expressly authorised by resolution 4(a) of the General

Purposes Panel meeting held on 6 May 1986.

       In the period after May 1986 a review was carried out by my department

of the administrative system relating to safety of sports grounds.                                                    As

part of this review consultation took place with the Police, the Fire, the

Building Surveyors Department and the Health and Consumer Services

Department (of the Council).                        This led to a draft report being prepared

and circulated for their comments to these authorities on 3 August 1987.

I produce a copy of the letter circulating the draft to the Fire Brigade

(Ref DMB6) (Ex                    ), letters and memoranda to the other agencies

followed the same format.

       Following receipt of replies from the agencies a report was submitted

to the Panel via the Head of Admin and Legal Department on 7 September

1987 which reflected the consultation process.                                   I produce the report (Ref

DMB7) (Ex                  ).

       A resolution was passed by the Panel on that date and took full legal

 effect immediately.                 The minutes of the meeting were passed to MEGS and

 the Council for information only.                         I produce an extract from the Council

 Summons of 7 October 1987 which includes these minutes (Ref DMB8)

 (Ex             ).     The purpose of the review was to update the administrative

 system and to try to clarify and simplify the system.

        The Panel resolved that:

        "a)      the details contained in the report now submitted regarding the

                 operation of the Councils Certification function for the safety

                 of sports ground be noted.

        b)       the revised administration system set out in the report,

                including the establishment of the proposed Safety of Sports

                Grounds Advisory Group comprising representatives of the Building

                Surveyor, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service, the South

                Yorkshire Police and the Director of Environmental Health and

                Consumer Services to advise the Council on matters relating to

                the Safety of Sports Grounds be approved and

       c)       authority be delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

                Department to deal with all routine matters in connection with

                the administrative system."

       It will be noted that there are minor differences between the

resolution and the recommendations in the report.

       The significant changes arising from the review were that the Health

and Consumer Services Department now had a role, the inspection system was

made annual (instead of bi-annual) and included inspections during

specified activities.                      The practical effect of the change to the

inspection system was that written reports were submitted by each

authority to Head of AdminAand Legal Department following an inspection.

The Officer Working Party ceased to exist and it was replaced by the

Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group.                                     As the report says:                 This:-

        "would function as a forum for discussion between officers; its most

regular use would probably be the discussion of items of advice to the

 Council before they are finally formulated by the appropriate Authority.

Meetings of the Group would be held at the request of one or more

Authorities and on receipt of a request the Head of Administration and

Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a list of items to

be discussed.           At the conclusion of the meeting a further list of items

would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be taken by each

Authority would be noted.                    It is then anticipated that detailed written

advice would be provided by each discipline and be acted upon as

appropriate.

      In addition the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keep

copies of all relevant correspondence which will be available to all

participants in the Group."

       The roles of the various agencies were also simplified from those

previously laid down in the schedule referred to (Ref DMB5).                                         Thus the

Building Surveyors Department had responsibility relating to the structure

of stadia, including crush barriers, walls etc. and South Yorkshire County

Fire Service were responsible for amongst other things, means of escape

and stadia capacity.                The Health and Consumer Services Department had an

input on Health and Safety matters including First Aid.                                     Built into the

system was a general provision for flexibility.                                    There was no role in the

Advisory Group for Clubs or Eastwoods.

       Dealing with the delegation given by the Panel to the Head of

Administration and Legal Department in relation to "routine" matters.

Interpretation of the phrase "routine matters" is a matter for individual

 judgement to be exercised in the circumstances of a particular case.

Generally the operation of this delegated power is very similar to that in

 other licensing systems operated by the Council.                                   It is in no way

 exceptional flaking account of my responsibilities as Chief Licensing

of the Department during 1986/8^) and his assistant Head of Department -was

Mr WEBSTER.

      This administrative system was in force at the time of the

Hillsborough Disaster on 15 April 1989.

      As far as I am concerned the members of the Officer Working Party and

subsequently the Advisory Group were regarded as the Council’s source of

professional advice in relation to Safety of Sports Grounds matters.                                            The

methods of communication between the authorities comprising the Advisory

Group were general ones, telephone, meetings, memos and letters and this

would include liaison with the Building Surveyors Department.

       Communication with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was on the same

basis as with the other authorities.

       Dealing with the relationship between the Football Club, the Advisory

Group and the Council, I would describe this as reasonably satisfactory.

The impression I have is that the Club were reasonably safety conscious

and generally complied with requests made of them.                               I am aware that a

number of issues involved more discussion than others but eventually

agreement was reached.

       Post April 1986 when the City Council took possession of the files

from the County Council in regard to the Safety of Sports Grounds I read

through them including the file on Hillsborough Stadium.                                  I also read

about this time the Green Guide on Safety at Sports Grounds 1976.                                           There

was a very large amount of paperwork and I cannot specifically recall any

particular issues raised in the files and this includes the erection of

 radial fences in the West Terraces in 1981 and 1985 or the crushing in the

 terraces in 1981.

Continuation o f statem ent o f   David Malcolm BOWNES



       On 1 April 1986 bearing in mind that the Safety of Sports Grounds

system had been operated for a considerable length of time by a

responsible body (South Yorkshire County Council), I was entitled to

assume (in the absence of any contrary evidence), that the sports grounds

in Sheffield, including Hillsborough Stadium, were reasonably safe.

       I have been asked to comment on my knowledge of the following issues

in relation to the Leppings Lane terraces of the Hillsborough sports

ground

(a)             The elevation of the tunnel beneath the West Stand;

(b)             The configuration of crush barrier on the terraces;

(c)             The^gates in the perimeter fence;

(d)             The reduction of barrier 144;

(e)             The capacity on the West terraces;

(f)             The capacity on the Safety Certificate;

 (g)            All these issues with regard to the Green                             Guide;

 (h)            All these issues pre and post 1 April 1986.

       My comments have been sought on the basis that some or all of issues

 (a) to (e) involved variation from the Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds -

the Green Guide.

        It is necessary for me to re-state the following three facts

 (i)            I am not technically qualified;

 (ii)           I was not involved in safety of sports grounds prior to 1 April

                 1986;

 (iii)           I am an Administrator.                    It follows from these facts that I cannot

                 authoritatively comment on any technical issues or on any issues

       Bearing in mind my comments, issues (a) to (g) are technical issues

upon which I cannot comment.                      Issue (d) I have commented on elsewhere in

this statement and in my submission to the Inquiry - and I have nothing to

add.      With regard to issues (e) and (f) I am aware that allegations have

been made that the certificate should (for exampleV have specified

capacities for the pens on the terraces.                            At no time prior to April 1989

has anyone suggested to me that capacities should be imposed in respect of

the pens.           Had such a suggestion have been made I would have taken

appropriate action (as I did for example in relation to the Spion Kop).

Those changes that had been made, in particular I am thinking of the

erection of radial fences in the West Terrace, in 1981 and 1985, which

could have an effect on capacity, were not brought to my attention either.

        I have also been asked to comment on the questions, "Did the Council

undertake a full survey of each sports ground in Sheffield after 1 April

1986 to discover the extent of compliance/non compliance with the Green

Guide?         If not why not?"

        Up to 1 January 1988 the duties of the Council were set out in the

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (as amended).                                  These duties were

 summarised in Annex ’A ’ to Home Office Circular 7 of 1986 (Ref DMB12)

 (Ex               ) which I produce.              No mention is made of inspections.                   The 1976

 edition of the Green Guide suggests that annual inspections are

 appropriate.              (Paragraph 4).

        From 1 January 1988 two more duties were added

 Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.                               These are a duty to

 enforce the legislation and to carry out inspections.                                  The Home Office

 issued statutory guidance on annual inspections, see Home Office Circular

72/1987 (Ref DMB13) (Ex                          ) which I produce.                The Guidance clearly

refers to a limited inspection.

       Bearing in mind these facts there is clearly no obligation on the

council to carry out the type of survey envisaged in the question.

       Bearing in mind that the same authorit'y/personnel were involved pre

and post 1 April 1986 it would also have been unreasonable to carry out a

survey.         Also no authority has indicated that such a survey would be

appropriate.

       The method by which I arranged for reasonable safety to be monitored

at Sports Grounds in Sheffield contained three main elements.                                             The first

element is inspections of Sports Grounds by professional officers, these

are well documented in the files.                          The second element wfer.e the written

communications to working party members in early 1987 asking for their

views on sports ground safety in Sheffield, all communications are

available if required.                    The third element was the review of the Safety

 of Sports Grounds system covered in the report to the General Purposes

 Panel in September 1987 (Ref DMB 7) (Ex                                     ).

        Had any of the experts identified any issues relating to reasonable

 safety then the system I have outlined should have encouraged them to

 raise them and have them resolved.                          There are examples of such issues on

 the Advisory Group notes.                     It is also relevant to note that it is the duty

 of professional officers involved in _ ^ Licensing System to bring safety

 issues to the attention of the Licensing Authority.                                      I am aware that the

 Green Guide does have a relevance to reasonable safety issues as does

 other guidance.

        Regarding amendments to Safety Certificates my view is that it is not

necessary to physically alter or amend the original certificate document.

Where amendments are made by the Qouncil in accordance with legislation it

is sufficient that notice procedures as specified (in the Safety of Sports

Grounds Regulations) are followed.                        This involves notifying by letter

various parties involved and notices in the Press.                                     With regard to the

increase in capacity for the Spion Kop this procedure was followed with

the exception of the notice in the press.

       As part of the third element referred to previously the Safety

Certificate conditions were reviewed on two separate occasions, the second

and most detailed draft being circulated to the authorities for comment on

30 March 1989.               I produce the letter, to the Chief Fire Officer, together

with the draft conditions (Ref DMB 9) (Ex                                    ).    A similar letter/

memorandum and draft were sent to the other authorities.

       At the time the second draft which considered crowd capacity was

circulated no amendment to the crowd capacity in the West Terrace was

proposed.           Obviously officers comments on the draft, which may have

included reference to capacities, were not made prior to the disaster

occurring on the 15 April 1989.

        The Council as the licensing authority have a duty to enforce within

their area the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and

regulations made under it and for that purpose, to arrange for the

periodical inspection of designated Sports Grounds.                                     In carrying out the

functions I have described I consider that they (the Council) have

fulfilled their duty.

        A written submission was prepared by me and submitted to Lord Justice

TAYLOR’S enquiry on behalf of Sheffield City Council.                                      This submission

deals in detail with many of the issues dealt with in this statement and

should be read in conjunction with it.                        I produce a copy of the submission

(Ref DMB 10) (Ex                  ).

      Subsequent to            the submission, Igave evidence                 to the TAYLOR enquiry on

27 and 28 June 1989.              I produce       a copyof thetranscript                  of my evidence

(Ref DMB 11) (Ex                  ).

      I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the transcript.                                      I am

conscious however that some points referred to in the transcript require

clarification.            Some of these issues are referred to in this statement and

clarified; I reserve the right to clarify other points.

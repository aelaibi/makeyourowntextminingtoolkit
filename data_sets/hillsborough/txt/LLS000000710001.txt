 Dear Mrs Wright

 Thank you for your letter of 10th May with the helpful information
 contained therein.

 I enclose a copy of                  the schedule with our client's name added and                               also
 a copy of >his proof                 of evidence.

 I confirm that I have written to the three potential Defendants as in
 your suggested proof form.

 Can you confirm whether or not the scheme for each firm to £100. into
 the central fund is yet operative and to whom a cheque should be made.
 As a matter of interest I also attach copies of press photographs
 showing my client pressed against the front of the barriers in case th
 is helpful in identifying his position.   I have ringed his face.
 Although living in Nottingham he is a devoted Liverpool fan !

 Yours sincerely,

on a      coach.

The      coach         parked        in the           Industrial              estate          on C l a y w h e e 1 s L a n e .         We

parked         at      12.30 and           there         were       police          around         telling       the       coach       driven

where        to     park.

They      did       not      come a n d          speak        to    us    on       the       coach.

iiy m a t e       and       I then        got      off    the       coach,          there        were     many       pol^^tT a r o u n d

shepherded              straight           from        the      coach         to    the       ground.        Bu t     here        we   were

j us t    allowed            to    roam        the     streets.

We     went       to a       pub by        the        roundabout              of    the/A61          a n d C l a y w h e e 1s Lane,               It

looked         closed and               boarded          up at          the    f/o n t .         I saw       people       walking

around         th e     side,        so    I followed.                   I then          saw a bouncer               on    the     s i de

door.          He wa s        charging            an     entrance             fee     to      thjr pub of £.1 e a ch.                  I paid

a    pound        and went           in.         It w a s       full      of L i v e r p o o l        supporters             at    12.35pm

when      we      first       entered           we Jrtad to w a i t y f Q                minutes        to    get     served.

There        must       h a ve     been        ar c o u p l e      of    hundred             Liverpool       fans         in the       pub.

There        were       a group/of               four     people          on our             coach who        di d    not       have

tickets,            they were             in the         pub       looking          for       spare     tickets.

There        were       a few        fans       who      were       happy          having        had a       couple        of     pints      but

you would              not    cl ass       t h e m as         t o ta l    drunks.

We     left       the              at     1.30pm,         at       this       time       the     bouncer       had        stopped

letting           people          in as        it wa s        full.

          and worrying                 for m y s e l f       at     this        st ag e .

          I was          then       forced          towards        these        bodies         and    I ha d         to    clamber             onto          them

          to     pull      myself           o nt o    the    fence.             I was       then a s s i s js & a          over          the    fence          by

          a few          p o lice.          I got       caught        on    the       spikes                   got    slightly             cut       on my

          I did          not     see      the       barrier       break         I was       not      in    t ha t     pi

          I got          onto       the     pitch an d           fell      li g h t      headed and             dazed.              I crawled

          across          the       pitch        until      I was a bou t             half      way       between          the       penalty             area

          and     centre            c i r cl e ,     then    I collapsed with                     exhaustion.                   I was          here          for

          5-10 mins              before          some      policemen            t o ok    me    to    XptG p e r i m e t e r             track. I then
                                                                 OVT"            ^TDV^u&piS its J O r                                          r<> CbrS
          regained             my    composure.              Then        I assistedy£x\               carrying             someone             on        ^

          I then          returned             to    the    pitch and/felt                  tired         again       so       I went          and       sat       :

          Two    St       John*? c re w             then    come     and        took      me    to    the       first          aid       room.           This

          was    a hc^peiessly                   inadequate          room,         tbe      size      of a n a v e r a g e               lounge          with

          They       lay me          on the          bed    h e r e land had a              coffee.             I wa s         here       for       about

          10-15 minutes,                    before         two    policemen assisted                       me    back          to    the       coach

          arriving             here       at     5pm.

          I ><!onsider              factors          which       caused         deaths         and    inbifies             are       t h at     there          wa s

          who    would           have       been      better        deployed             outside.              The    p o l i c e at           first

          thought          it wa s          an      invasion and            I    saw a         policemen             push       one       or    two          fans

          back       into        the      terracing          when        they were             tr,j<Tng to           clirnb the            fence.              Th e

          pol i ce        d id      not     realize         what     was        going/*on q u i c k             en o u g h .

                                                                                                                              SI 4 7 5

             After     the   game was         stopped          and   people        realised      what    wa s    going       on   the

             emergency       services         acted       as    be s t   they      could,   but    there        was    a great

             lack    of m e d i c a l   facilities.

             There     seemed     to     be   no    organisation             by    the   police    at all.            They    were

             just    walking      around        with      the    fans,       not    controlling         them.

             I did     not   attend       the      cor r e s p o n d i n g   fixture      last    y ear,    and       cannot

             therefore       draw       comparisons.

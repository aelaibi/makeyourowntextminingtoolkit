Dear Sir,


         I   write in my capacity as Secretary             of   the    A.C.P.O.    Sub-
    Committee on Hooliganism at sporting events.

         To assist in the formulation of the A.C.P.O.'s written evidence
    to be submitted to     Lord Justice Taylor it would be of great
    assistance if all Chief Constables whose Force areas include football
    grounds could provide the following information.

         Details of problems     that have      occurred    during      the past    two
    seasons involving:

    (a)   late arrival of spectators and/or drunkenness;

    (b)   spectators without tickets arriving at all ticket matches;

    (c)   spectators subject of attendance restrictions               arriving;    (e.g
          Leeds United, Wolverhampton and Cardiff City)

    (d)   other serious problems at turnstiles.


         Your early attention to this matter would be appreciated as the
    requirement for submission of this evidence is immiment.


                                Yours faithfully




                          Assistant Chief Constable.

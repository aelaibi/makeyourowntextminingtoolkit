            Even at this early time fans from both teams were                                   in attendance,

            walking around the area and making their way to the ground.                                          A number

            of fans asked for directions to the ground and the location of cafes,

                Upon leaving the cell bus PC Ward             and myself were directed to go to

                the pitch immediately.            We ran to   the entrance to the pitch in       doing

                so we saw behind the Leppings Lane end goal members of the crowd,

                s pilling onto the pitch and Police Officers were scaling the fence.

                We ran towards the goal together with other officers,                running behind

                an ambulance.

                I ran straight to the gate behind             and to the left of the goal.        At

                this time a number of bodies were             lying on the floor obviously dead.

                A number of PC *s ambulancemen,          St Johns and otherwise were      conducting

                resuscitation on bodies           laying on the pitch.       I assisted in the

                removal     of bodies through the gate.           These were placed on make shift

                CAUSED THIS, SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE MERSEYSIDE M UR DE RE RS. ’               These

                shouts continued throughout the rescue operation.

                Together with other officers,            I was directed to form part of two lines
                                                                                       PAGE     3

               in order to carry bodies from the pen behind the goal.        During this

               time a young frail female who was white and blue was passed out of the

               pen.    I picked her up in doing so I could not find a pulse or detect

               breathing.     I carried on running through the crowds on the pitch and

               through a line of police near the halfway line.       Both fans and Police

               opened up to let me through with the female.        I carried the female to

               the gym and placed her on the floor in the second part of the gym

               behind the net.      I then returned to the Leppings Lane end.    Upon

        '^    arrival,, after a short time,     I was directed to form part of a cordon

               on the half way line, with other officers.        At this time a number of

              Liverpool     fans who were obviously agitated,,   charged towards the

              Nottingham Forest end but were eventually turned back and attempts

              were made to try and calm them down.       I spoke with a number of the

               fans and tried to console them.

              We we re then directed to leave the pitch at which time I went to the

              area outside the gym.      When there 1 went on patrol    in a van in the

              area outside the ground with other officers from other divisions.            On

               completion at this patrol     I returned to the ground and then went to

              Cla yw he e1s Lane.

            States:

            Further to the recollection I made and submitted after the FA Cup

            Semi-Final at Hillsborough on 15th April                    1989 (150489),        I would like

            to make the following further                points.



            After I had dealt with the prisoner ____________                      and I       yent out tothe

            Leppings Ln end of the ground,                I would estimate the yt ime would be

C/VT       between 3,20pm (1520) & 3.35pm (1535),         When I go p                  :o (the >mall    gats
Or^VTfeS           ---------------------------------------
fifT'      giving access to Pen 3, I was one of the                                    lice officers who

            were helping to take the collapsed fans out                                pen,    I was about

            4th in line on the side nearest to the goa4' post



            I suppose I handled about 5/6 people who at the tin'                                       to me to

                                                                                     S2300A

             Ids dead or dying,       I wouLd not be able to describe    any of the until   I
{£.1 /o/was
        g~~aware                     /y
                           of a sma i1 ^rrail female.   I remember she   was wearing jeans &

             ankle boots,      I noticed M r   as she had been placed on the ground in
                             ^ just afterwards a very heavily built man was placed
            ~ front of me, apid

             virtually on top of her.        It was then that I picked her up.     I was

             able to hold her with one arm and checked for a pulse with the other.

             I found no pulse and so just started to run across the pitch carrying

       7     her in my arms.        I took her towards the corner of the ground near the

             Gym.



             I have a recollection of an ambulancema/f cdmivog to me as I ran

             across the pitch and he did I think try to take the girl off me, but

             I'm sure I never       let him take her off me.   i took ythp g^r 1 into the

             Gym, and as far as I remember she was the first one to arrive,

             maybe,     however,   that another body was brought   in at just about the

             same time.



             After putting the girl       in the Gym I returned to the pitch and had no

             further     contact with her.

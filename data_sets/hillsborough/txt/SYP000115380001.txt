positions             around         the     ground.

Constable             Lindsay          and       my    section              Constable             Evans          and. E d g e           walked

around         the      ground,         Constable                 Lindsay             showing          us       the    Hillsborough                       Park

area       which        we     were     to       patrol           after          the       game.

We    later         returned           to    the       D i r e c t o r s ’ Car              Park       and       we    awaited              the

arrival          of     both        teams        coaches.               During             the    afternoon                a     large        number

o f ■b o t h     Liverpool             and       Nottingham                 Forest          fans       gathered                in     this       area.

It    appeared               that    all     fans        of       both       teams          were       in       good       spirit           and       well

behaved.              On      arrival        of       the     team          coaches             both       teams       were           seen       into

myself         and      my     colleagues              were                                      the

the     Directors*              Car     Park,          along           past          the    South          stand       to        a     temporary

barrier,,

     saw    that        on     the     other          side        of    this          barrier          was       a    vast           crowd       of

"Leppings             Lane",         towards           the        blue       iron          gates       a n d on        into           the

turnstiles.                   I estimated              this        crowd             to    be    in    the       two       to        three

t h ousands.

I then         pushed          my    horse        into        the       c r o wd,          due    to       the       excessive              noise          and

atmosphere              the     horse        began          to     spin          around.              My    horse          kicked           out       a

number         of     times         this, c a u s e d         some          of       the    crowd          to    move          away       along

towards          the         temporary           barrier           and       the          river.

1 saw       that        the     mass        of    the       crowd           which          was    pushing             f rom          o u t s i de     in

turnstiles.                   I then        managed           to       move          my    horse       into          the       crowd        and       along

with       other        Mounted         officers              I    placed             him       alongside             the       large         blue

iron       gates,            this    action           helped           to    close          them       and       stop          the      advancing

crowd.

Having       split           the       crowd       we       were       still left            with       the       situation            of     a

still       very       large           crowd       to       our    rear.           this, c r o w d          was       still         pushing       up

towards          the     turnstiles;'                      This    group          of    people          could          not      move       either

to    their       left           or    right       due       to    the       construction                   of    a    steel         barrier       to

the    left       and        a    steel       rail          to    their          right.           I saw          that      a    number       of

people       were        being             pulled          out    from       the       front       of       the       turnstiles,            they

were     being          crushed.

Due    to    the       fact           that    the          steel       tube       railing          which          ran       from      the

turnstiles             out        towards          the       main       blue iron            gates,          it       was      impossible              to

move     people          away          to    the       right       of       the gates,            it    was       also         impossible              to

move     horses          into          this       crowd.

I suddenly              became             aware       that       gate       " C"      on    attached             map,         was    open     and

people       were        being             moved       d                                                                               crowd       and

moved       into        the       exit       g a te.         Although             a    great       number             of    people         entered

into     the      ground              by    this       gate       it    was       only       as    far       as       i could         see    people

from     the      turnstile                 crowd.           The       big       blue       iron       gates          were      kept       closed

despite          the     fact          that       the       outside          crowd          were    still             pushing         to    get

past     them.

After       the    turnstile                 crowd          had    been          cleared,          I saw          that         the    outside

crowd       were        allowed             slowly          into       the       turnstiles,                by    this         time    gate       ''C"

was    closed.               The       remainder             of    this          crowd       entered             the       ground      via     the

t u r n s t :L1 e s .

I    remained           in       the       Leppings          Lane       area,          engaged          in       moving         a    number       of

Liverpool          fans           away       from          the    ground          because          the       turnstile               had    been

closed.           I had           occasion             to    speak          to    a    number          of    youths            all    were     from

Liverpool          and           none       had    tickets             to    enter          the    ground.

I had       on    one        occasion             to       speak       to    a    male       of    about          30       years,      he    was

being       moved        away          from       the       Leppings             Lane       gates       by       South         Yorkshire          foot

officers.               As       he    walked          backwards             towards          my       horse          he    threw      his     arms

                                                                                                                                                            R4 65

             into       the       air,       this       caused          my       horse       to    spin       around.             After          getting

             control          of       rny h o r s e        I attempted             to       speak       to    this         youth,          however,          as

             approached                him        he   again           threw       his       arms       up.     This caused                 my    h o r s e to

             rear       up    and       as        he    landed          he       caught       this       m a l e on    his       left       leg,        he f e l l

             to    the       ground          and       was       pulled          away    by       another          person.

             I then          saw       this       male       walking             towards          the    bridge         .in L e p p i n g s           Lane

             where       he       punched          a    stone          wall       and    continued             to     shout           and    swear.

             I went          to    him,           I asked          if       he   was     injured          a n d d i d he         need       any

             assistance,                he        said,          "WHY    DON'T          YOU       FUCK    OFF YOU BAST A R D " .                  I

             considered                that       he    had       been       drinking,             however,            due       to    the       present

             crowd       situation                on    this          occasion          an    arrest          would         be    ill       advised.              1

             was    unable             to    obtain          any       information                from       this      person.

             I    was    then          instructed                by     Inspector            Hand-Daviss               to    follow          him       into

             Penistone             Road.           We       stood       too       expecting             to    be      used       should          there       be       a

             pitch       invasion.                 Later          we    were       to    hear       of       the      disaster          over          personal

             radios.

             Having          been       witness             to    the       crowds       sometimes             hostile            actions,             in

             respects             to    their          efforts          to       gain    entry          to    the      turnstiles,                I firmly

             believe          that          the    opening             of    the    exit          gate       definitely               saved       life       at

             the    turnstiles.

             At    no    time          during          my    tour       of       duty    did       any       person         complain             to    me    about

             any    injury             sustained             by       Police       horses.

                               LIVERPOOL v NOTTINGHAM FOREST - 15.4.89.



                     I have to report that on Saturday, 15th April,                                 1989,
            I was a member of the Merseyside Mounted Police Department
            sent as mutual aid to assist the South Yorkshire Police,
            in the football match, Liverpool v Nottingham Forest.


                     I paraded for duty at the stables at Greenhlll Road
            at 06.00 hrs, after completing my stable duties and
            grooming police horse No 23 Normandy, I boxed up and
            travelled to Sheffield.


                    We arrived at the South Yorkshire stables "Niagara"
            at 10.00 hrs, we were given refreshments and invited to a j
            briefing, given by Inspector Hand-Davies.                                  Instructions         !
            were given regarding seating arrangements, colour of
            tickets and our positions of which we were to work that
            day.


                     I was to work alongside Constables 3920 Evans and
            4365 Edge of our force, Constable 2613 Lindsay of the
            South Yorkshire force was in charge.                             He were Instructed
            to patrol the area of the Directors Car Park rear of thi
            south stand and also to cover the arrival of both tea*
            coaches.


                    At approximately 11.30 am all nounted officers
            paraded for duty and walked from Niagara stables to the':M
            football ground at Hillsborough.                            All officers were aga|n
            paraded in the Directors car park and from this position
            all were dispersed to their various positions around ttMr
            ground.
                                2


C o n s t a b l e Lindsay and my section Constable Evans and Edge
walked around the ground, Constable Lindsay showing us the
Hillsborough Park area which we were to patrol after the
game.


     -He later returned to the directors car park and we
awaited the arrival of both teams coaches. During the
afternoon a large number of both Liverpool and Nottingham
Forest fans gathered in this area.       It appeared that all
fans of both teams were in good spirit and well behaved.
On arrival of the team coaches both teams were seen into
the players entrance without incident.


        At approximately 14.25 hrs and as a result of a radio
message, myself-and my colleagues were directed to the
entrance gates in Leppings Lane.       On arrival at Leppings
Lane I approached the area from the directors car park,
along past the south stand to a temporary barrier.
                                                 *#   . *   •



        I saw that on the other side of this barrier was a
vast crowd of people.      The crowd were fighting and pushing
 from the main road, "Leppings Lane", towards the blue Iron
gates and on in-to the turnstiles.        I estimated this crowd
 to be in the two to three thousands.


        I then pushed my horse into the crowd, due to the
 excessive noise and atmosphere the horse began to spin
 around.    Hy horse kicked out a number✓times this caused
 some of the crowd to move away along towards the tenpoifir)
 barrier and the river.
                                                                    ■
                                                                :
        I saw that the mass of the crowd which was p u s h i n g ^
 from outside in the main road was in fact crushing,
 children, men and women at the turnstiles.           I then manage*
 to move my horse into the crowd and along with other
 mounted officers I placed him alongside the large blue                 |
 iron gates, this action helped to close them and stop the
 advancing crowd.                                                       4

         Having split the crowd we were still left with the
situation of a still very large crowd to*our rear.          This
crowd was still pushing up towards the turnstiles.          This
group of people could not move either to their left or
right due to the construction of a steel barrier to the
left and a steel rail to their right.      I saw that a number
of people were being pulled out from the front of the
turnstiles, they were being crushed.


         Due to the fact that the steel tube railing which ran
from the turnstiles out towards the main blue iron gates,
it was impossible to move people away to the right          of the
gates,     it was also impossible to move horses into this
crowd.


         I suddenly became aware that gate "C" on attached
map, was open and people were being moved down from the
rear of the turnstile crowd and moved into the exit gate.
Although a great number of people entered iiito the‘ground
by this gate it was only as far as I could see people from
the turnstile crowd.      The big blue iron gates were kept,
closed despite the fact that the outside crowd were still
pushing to get past them.


         After the turnstile crowd had been cleared, I saw
that the outside crowd were allowed slowly Into the
turnstiles, by this time gate ”C" was closed.      The
remainder of this crowd entered the ground via the



         I remained in the Leppings Lane area, engaged in
moving a number of Liverpool fans away from the ground
because the turnstile had been closed.      I had occasion tp
speak to a number of youths all were from Liverpool anc*
none had tickets to enter the ground

        I had on one occasion to speak to a male of about 3C
years, he was being moved away from the ‘Lepping .Lane gate:
by South Yorkshire foot officers.     As he walked backwards
towards my horse he threw his arms into the air, this
caused my horse to spin around-     After getting control of
my horse I attempted to speak to this youth, however, as :
approached him he again threw his arms up.     This caused nr
horse to rear up and as he landed he caught this male on
his left leg, he fell to the ground and was pulled away b
another person.

        I then saw this male walking towards the bridge in
Lepping Lane where he punched a stone wall and continued
to shout and swear.

        I went to him, I asked if he was injured and did he
need any assistance, he said, "WHY DON'T YOU FUCK OFF YOU
BASTARD".     I considered that he had been drinking,
however, due to the present crowd situationr,1 on tHis
occasion an arrest would be ill advised.     I was unable to
obtain any information from this person.


        I was then instructed by Inspector Hand-Davies to
 follow him into Penistone Road.    We stood too expecting t
be used should there be a pitch invasion.      Later we were
 to hear of the disaster over personal radios.


        Having been witness to the crowds sometimes hostile
 actions, in respects to there efforts to gain entry 't^||fcfc
 turnstiles, I firmly believe that the opening of the eit|t
 gate definitely saved life at the turnstile*.


        At no time during my tour of duty did any person
 complain to me about any injury sustained by police
 horses

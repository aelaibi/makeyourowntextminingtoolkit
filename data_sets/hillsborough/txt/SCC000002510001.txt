        Dear Sirs,

       '■■Hillsborough resumed Inquests 19th November 1990.

        Thank you for your letter of the 2nd of November.   I have already got
        statements' made both by Mr. Butler and Mr. Bownes but if' you are in
        possession of any further statements which you feel may be of assistance to
        me in considering and assessing the evidence, I would be grateful if you
        could please let me have it.

        I do not think it is a practical proposition, certainly not at this stage, to
        try and de-limit the extent or scope of the evidence which they may be asked
        to give.

        Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

                      Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

Arising out of the meeting on 30th October 1990 at the Medico Legal
Centre I have been thinking about the point w hi c h was made by some of
the represe n t at i v e s ;that it w o u l d be a lot easier for you to suggest
possible witnesses as to facts if you were aware of the names of the
witnesses w h o m I was thinking about.

As you know I w a s inclined not to disclose these but to let you come
up with names which I would then consider. However in the light of
your representations on this point I do see that my decision makes
life very difficult for you and may unneccesarily increase w o r k for
you without any real advantage.

The selection of suitable witnesses is not an easy task and I am still
working on it but I have decided subject to terms and conditions of
this letter to modify my view and to release to you at this stage
a reasonably comprehensive list of possible witnesses as to facts.

This list is released on the following terms and conditions.

1. The list must be treated as provisional. Inclusion of a name
does not mean that I have definitively decided to call a particular
person.

3. Conversely I retain the right to select others not on the list.

4. It must be clearly understood that we are dealing with a coronal
enquiry and that this is of an inquistorial and not adversarial
nature. It follows that the decision of who to call is matter entirely
for me and that the circulation of names does not in any way alter
my powers in this regard nor is it intended to give you rights or
powers which you would otherwise not have.

5. If upon examination of the list there are persons w h o you are
particular keen that I should call please specify these so that
I can consider your wishes (without prejudice to my rights) in any
reassessment of the list.
      6. If upon perusal of the list you feel that there is some one or m o r e
■i    persons who should be included as a possible witness as to facts
      please let me know as soon as possible.

      7. I reserve the right to make amendments or modifications to the
      terms and conditions set out.

     I hope that my decision will be of help to you. Please note that the
     list i s m alphabetical order and not in the order in which witnesses
     will be considered or called.                                '

     Whilst writing to you there are a few additional matters I might as
     well deal with.

     A. If you have not already done so please let me have the n a m e of
     Counsel or solicitor who is likely to be representing your firm.

     B. As proposed and agreed I enclose a list of the names of the
     various firms who were present at the meeting on 30th Oct. 1990
     showing their references, telephone and fax numbers wh i c h I hope are
     correct and hopefully will be of assistance to you.

     C. Please let me,know your wi s h e s regarding transcripts of the
     resumed inquests comencing on 19th N o v . 1990. The current charge is 80p
     per page. Cheques should be made payable to Sheffield City Council.

     P. For your assistance I enclose a copy of the transcript of the
     meeting on 30th October.




     Yours /faithfully,

at Portwood roundabout, to the east of Stockport at the junction with the
A560. The final part of the M63 providing the last link to the M67 at D e n t o n
was not opened until 28 April 1989.

The recommended route published in the Liverpool Programme advised supporters
to follow the M62 east out of Liverpool) north of Manchester, across the
Pennines to Junction 42 of the Ml. It was then suggested that they travel
south on the Ml, leaving at Junction 35 for Sheffield. Supporters who follo w ed
that route did not report any great delays.

It is clear that many Liverpool supporters chose to follow the M62 or M 5 6 east
of Liverpool, then Joining the M63 to the west or south of Manchester. This
motorway terminated to the east of Stockport and supporters were then required
to follow the A56G to Mot t r a m in Longdendale, where they could join the A57
over Snake Pass to Sheffield, Supporters w h o chose this route were the ones
subjected to long delays. However, some of the accuracy of this evidence has
to be viewed in the context that many people are confused as to their correct
location when they were delayed and also, they were frustrated by the hold-ups
and may have understandably, felt the period of the delay to be longer than it
actually w a s ,

H62, WEST OF JUNCTION 15 EASTBQUND CARRIAGEWAY

At 1106 hours a damage only, road traffic accident occurred between a m o t o r
cycle and a saloon car. The m o t o r w a y , wh i c h at this point has four lanes, was
reduced by two lanes for only about 15 minutes. No reports of serious delays.

M62 JUNCTION 15 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

Between 0830 and 1345 hours, the      three lane motorway at this point was reduced
by one lane, due to a third lane      closure for essential central barrier
renovation, During the closure,       traffic was flowing slowly through  the road
works and was only delayed for a      maximum of 10 minutes.

M62 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 21 & 22 B O T E CARRIAGEWAYS

Contraflow, two lanes in each direction.        Long term w o r k relating to widening
scheme, No serious delays reported.

M63 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 2 & 3 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

The three lane motorway at this point was reduced by one lane          to direct   traffic
into a suitable configuration for approaching contraflow.

M63 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 3 & 6 BOTH CARRIAGEWAYS

Contraflow, two lanes In each direction. Long term work relating to widening
scheme. Long delays reported by supporters and coach drivers.

M63 END OF M O T O RW A Y PORTWOOD ROUNDABOUT

At that time the motorway terminated at a roundabout, at the junction w i t h the
A560. H e a vy congestion reported due to volume of traffic. This delay varies
between a 1/2 hour and 1 hour 10 minutes bet we e n 1215 and 1325 hours.
M67 END O F MOTO R WA Y M O T T R A M IN LONGENDALE

This is a traffic bottleneck caused purely by the combination of a heavy volume
of traffic and the road layout. At this location the motorway terminated into
a single lane carriageway, Close to a crossroads controlled by traffic lights
in a small village centre. The A560, which carried traffic from the M63, joins
the M67 at a rounabout at the terminus of the motorway, just prior to this
point and this further contributes to the bottleneck,

As far as can be ascertained some 102 coaches containing Liverpool supporters
travelled to Sheffield on 15 April 1989.

To evaluate the number of supporter who travelled to the ground in mini buses
and using their private vehicles is difficult, but all available parking wi t h in
a radius of approximately 1 1/2 miles from the ground was utilised,

Clearly the greater number of supporters travelled to the ground in this manner
and although traffic volume was heavy on all approach routes, traffic delays
■were trot a significant factor in the late arrival of fans.

A Ma p showing various routes from Liverpool to Sheffield and identifying
trouble spots is produced,

RAIL TRANSPORT                       • '

Two British Rail stations were used for the transport of supporters, the     ;
Midland and.Wadsley Bridge. The former was used for both Liverpool and
N ottingham Forest supporters and the latter for Liverpool, supporters only. One
special train and three service trains from Liverpool conveyed a total of 825
supporters, 430 to Wadsl e y Bridge, with service trains from other areas
bringing this to a total of 1,337.

LICENSED PREMISES

Premises selling alcohol in and around the Sheffield area were identified and
sub-divided into full On Licences, that is public houses, and Off licences,
w h i c h includes shops and supermarkets. The general opening hours for licensed
premises on this date were for public houses 11 am to 11 pm and off licences 8
am to 11 pm,

193 Public houses were visited in an attempt to identify those frequented by
Liverpool supporters on Saturday, 15 april 1989. These can be graded as
f o l l o w s ;-
10 Public Houses remained closed on this date.
72 Public Houses were frequented by local persons only.
37 Public Houses reported having less than 20 Liverpool supporters,
51 Public Houses reported having in excess of 20 Liverpool supporters.
23 Public Houses reported having in excess of 100 Liverpool supporters.

Seventy-four off licenses were identified as open. These were also visited and
enquiries show that some of thoses closer to the ground were particularly busy
prior to the kick off. It is not possible to quantify this further.

           A comparison of the South Yorkshire Police orders for the Cup Semi Finals 1988
           and 1989 has been made.

           This reveals that the 1989 order was basically a repetition of the 1988 order,

                        DRAFT OF PROPOSED SUMMARY OF A G R E E D FACTS


 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was formed in 1867 and elected to the
 Football League in 1892. Sheffield Wednesday m o v e d to their present g r o u n d at
 Hillsborough in 1899. Rubbish was tipped at either end of the pitch to f o r m
 banking and a stand moved from their previous ground was erected on the site of
 the present South Stand. This was replaced in 1913 by the exisiting South
 Stand, the Spion K o p being added in 1914, the North Stand in 1961 and the West
 Stand in 1965 following the decision to stage a number of World Cup games at
 the venue in 1966.

 Since 1912 30 F A C u p S e m i - F i n a l s , 19 International and 3 World Cup matches have
 been played at this venue. In addition the stadium has been used to stage
 religious meetings, a basketball display, world class tennis and schools
 display for the Queen in 1954, The record crowd for the ground is 72,841 in


              St8dium was designated in 1979 under the safety of Sports Grounds
 Act 1975, An inter-agency group known as the ’Officer Working P a r t y ’ was set
 up to monitor safety aspects of the stadium. They met twice annually or such
 shoiter periods as were necessary. It was comprised of the following
 representativesi                                              5

 1.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
 Z.   South Yorkshire Police
 3.   South Yorkshire County Fire Service
 4.   South Yorkshire County Council and later City of Sheffield
      Metropolitan District Council
 5.   Consultant Engineers (Eastwood and Partners),

They would sometimes meet ’on site* and discuss'and approve alterations for
e x a m p l e , the removal of barrier 144 from enclosure 3 (this has been referred to
by many witnesses as Pen 3) in 1986,

 The Leppings Lane End of the Ground has been the focus of a t t e n t i o n throughout
         r              Apiil 1989 this End was allocated to the Liverpool Football
 C l u b supporters and in order to gain entry into the ground, whether it be to a
 sea ting^ or standing area, supporters first had to negotiate the iron perimeter
 gates situated at the funnel entrance to the ground immediately before the
.turnstiles. These gates are set out in a bank of six double gates and are
 situated across the mouth of the entrance into the ground from Leppines Lane
 They are made of wrought iron and painted blue.

Ha v i n g negotiated these gates the supporters w o u l d enter a courtyard. This
a r e a is shaped like a funnel between the outer perimeter gates and turnstiles 1
to 16 and A ~ G. In normal league matches access can also be given to
turnstiles 19-22 and 23-28. This was not so on 15 April 1989.

The courtyard is divided by a wall of metal construction running from the
perimeter gates to the brick wall of turnstile 16. There is also a metal
barrier lunning almost parallel to this from half way across the courtyard to
the wall adjoining turnstile G. The effect of this is to divide the courtyard
betw e e n the two banks o£ turnstile 1 to 16 and A to G and create a funnel for
people towards the appropriate turnstiles depending on w h i c h part of the ground
they wish to enter.                                    f       . 1           K    u

The wall of metal construction was built in 1985 to segregate home and away
supporters. At about the same time proposals by Eastwood and Partners, w hi c h
w o u l d have achieved enclosures having their own turnstile entrances and
Individual crowd capacities, were rejected by the Club.
There are a total of 95 turnstiles at Hillsborough, 12 o£ w h i c h (Nos 77 - 88}
were not in use for reasons of segregation on 15 April 1989. N o t t i ng h a m Forest
fans w e r e allocated 60 and Liverpool the remaining 23 all from Leppings Lane,

The 23 turnstiles in Leppings Lane contained in two sections 1 to 16 and A to
G, are divided by the metal wall previously mentioned. They were d e s i gn e d in
such a way that turnstiles 1 to 10 served the West side of the North Stand
seated area, 11 to 16 the West Stand seated area and A to G the West Stand
terraces. In actual fact turnstiles u to 16 and A to G give access to the
same concourse area at the rear of the West Stand. Confusion was caused by the
turnstiles being signed from left to right A,C,B, The tickets given to
supporters added to the confusion and the general layout once inside the iron
perimeter gates caused congestion if a supporter needed to get from turnstiles
A to G to l to 16 or vice versa.

As a result if a supporter went through the outer perimeter iron gates towards
turnstiles A-G and found he needed turnstiles 1-16 he would have to return
through the outer perimeter iron gates into Leppings Lane and then to the
correct turnstile.

Also in this area are three, Exit Gates A, B and C, These Gates are large
concertina type metal gates measuring 4.064 metres across and 2.184 me tr e s
high, except ’B ’ gate w h i c h is 3.2 metres high. They were built in 1985 during
modifications to the turnstiles and concourse area. Both sides of the gates
closed towards the centre and are operated from the inside only they w e r e
painted blue and were capable of being locked and bolted, in each pair of
gates one was fitted with.a non-opening glass observation panel at about eye
level.

Looking from Leppings Lane Gate ’A ’ is situated to the left of turnstile 1 and
adjoins the outer perimeter wall of the ground running parallel to Vere Road,
Gate ’B ’ is at the end of the metal wall across the courtyard and between
turnstiles 16 and A. Gate ’C ’ is located to the right in the wall running
parallel with the River Don beyond turnstiles A to G.

Emergency Gate * E ’ is a 8mall concertina type gate opening from inside only and
located in the wall running parallel with the River Don, immediately before it
joins the side of the South Stand and behind the Police Control Box.

Beyond the turnstiles and behind the West Stand is a concourse area w h i c h is
divided into three sections, Each of these sections serves a different part of
the W e s t and North Stands and the West Terraces. The three sections are
created by a metal fence and a brick wall. There was no access from the
central concourse through the metal fence to the North Stand section but a
gate in the brick wall did give access throughout the standing terrace
concourse area,

Entrance through turnstiles 1-10 would only give access to the North concourse
area and thus the seated North Stand,

There were a total of six portacabins on the   concourse at the rear of the West
Stand. Of these, two serviced the turnstiles in the northern part of the
concourse at the rear of turnstiles 11-16. The portacabins were variously used
for selling programmes or souvenirs and in one case by the Police to store
property seized from supporters, One of these portacabins was positioned
behind gate *B' near to the brick wall giving access throughout the stand
terrace concourse area,

Having entered through one of the turnstiles A to G and on the southern part of
the concourse, supporters could either go to their left through the gate in the
wall and into the central concourse area giving access into enclosures 6 and 7
or up to the West Stand seating area; straight ahead into the tunnel and
enclosure 3 and 4; or round to the right and either up another access into the
seated area or alongside the West Stand into enclosure 1 and 2.
That explained, the main sign for the standing areas, measuring 2,591 m e t r e s x
.305 metres was immediately above the entrance to the tunnel and comprised of
the word ’STANDING* in .18 metres letter painted in blue on a white
background, Positioned on both sides of this sign were the letters B + A
respectively. In the normal course of events, following letter *B’ w o u l d take
supporters .along the left hand side of the tunnel and into enclosure 4.
Likewise following the letter ’A* would take supporters up the right h a n d side
of the tunnel and into enclosure 3.

The only other sign on this concourse section indicating a standing area was a
small one at a height of 3.658 metres in letters *09 metres high on a concrete
pillar to the right supporting the West Stand. This directs supporters along
the side of the Stand a n d into enclosures 1 and 2. No signs existed on this
part of the concourse to indicate that access to standing areas in enclosures 6
and 7 could be reached by going to the left through the gate in the wall.

The tunnel is 22.17 Hietres long and unlit. It is located under the seating
area of the West Stand and is used primarily by supporters entering through
turnstiles A to G. Rising at first it then levels off briefly before
descending towards the terraces on a gradient of around 1 in 6.
The recommended gradient from the Green Guide is 1 in 1 0 . The tunnel w a s of
course built prior to the introduction of this Guide,

As the tunnel opens out on to the terrace a radial fence divides enclosure 3
and 4. Enclosure 3 is on the right and enclosure 4 on the left as you enter.
Short walls on either side extend out into the enclosures. There are gates at
the tunnel concourse entrance capable of being closed. In addition it is
possible to close off each enclosure {3 and 4) by a gate to each at the
enclosure end of the tunnel.                   ■

At the rear of the terraces and where the radial fences finish are gates which
provide access to those persons wishing to w a l k along the terraces. Thus there
is unrestricted access to each enclosure if these gates are left open. Anyone
entering enclosures 3 and 4 and wishing to then enter enclosures Z or 5 would
in effect have to take a couple of paces backwards to the rear of the pen and
w a l k alongside the real wall.

Running parallel to the goal line across the front of the West Stand seated
area, are the terraces w i t h a total of 7 enclosures, numbered by their gates
from left to right as you look at them from the pitch, i.e. enclosure 1 is in
the South West Corner, immediately under the Police Control box and enclosure 7
is in the North West Corner. Both corners are banked higher than the rest of
the terracing, w i t h enclosure 5 being a sterile area or void, unused by
spectators. The terracing gradient has been identified as between 1 in 4 and 1
in 4,3, on the West Terraces.

There are 3 rows of barriers on the terraces in enclosures 3 and 4 running
parellel w i t h the goal line. The barriers are of two designs; those fitted by
Husband and Co., the previous engineers, and those fitted by Eastwood and
Partners the current engineers. In 1986 barrier 144 was removed from enclosure
3 to facilitate easier crowd movements. This has been the only significant
change in barrier configuration on the Leppings Lane terraces.

Perimeter fencing was installed in 1977. A t the front of the terrace this
fence is 2.896 metres high, comprising of heavy gage metal wire supported at
intervals by metal posts set in concrete w h i c h in turn are supported on the
pitch side by metal frames. At the top of each of these fences .381 metres of
wire folds inwards. This is designed to make it harder for fans to climb over
the fence onto the perimeter track or the pitch. The wire is welded to the
metal supports for strength and rigidity.

           In each of the enclosures there is a numbered gate to the perimeter track w hi c h
(^ )       is primarily designed for access to the enclosure in an emergency. East w o o d
           STKl Partners have measured the w i d t h of Gate 3 as 0.85 metres and Gate 4 as
           0.83 metres between the gate pbsts, These gates are smaller than the G r e e n
           Guide recommendation (1.1m) but they were constructed before this minimal w i dt h
           was suggested.

           Originally the West Terrace was completely open. Radial fencing between the
           perimeter fence and wall of the West stand, and w h i c h created three large
           enclosures, was installed in 1981. Further radial fencing was added in 1985
           dividing the large centre enclosures into what are n o w enclosures 3, 4 a n d the
           void enclosure 3. This radial fencing is 1.68 metres high and comprises of
           blue painted metal bars and was erected at the request of the Police to
           facilitate crowd control. This was agreed by the Officer W o r ki n g Party.
           Enclosure 1 and 2 and 6 and 7, are not further subdivided by radial fences. In
           fact they are still the large enclosures as orginally created in 1981.

           Schedule 2, Paragraph 3, of the Safety certificate specifies the number of
           spectators admitted to the stadium. Part 1 of Schedule 3 details the n u m b e r of
           spectators permitted in various section of the ground, a figure which should
       ,   not be exceeded. The relevant capacities ares-
                               West terrace         7,200
                               North West terrace   2,900
           In late 1989 some 6 months after the disaster it was discovered that the
           capacity for the North West Terrace was wrong having been calculated w i t h the
           wrong scale. The result was that 2,900 was excessive. The revised figure is
           no w 1,500, The figure is based on an amended Certificate issued by Sheffield
           City Council on the 24 November 1989.

           In 1981 w h e n the first radial fences were installed on the terraces, creating
           the 3 large enclosures a crowd capacity of 2,200 was declared for the centre
           enclosure by Dr EASTWOOD based on calculations in the 1976 Green Guide. W h e n
           this large enclosures was divided in 1985 into enclosures 3 and 4 and the void
           5, Eastwood and Partners split the capacities as follows;- 1,200 into enclosure
           3 and 1,000 for enclosure 4. These figures were included on a plan of
           Eastwoods but the author of the figures has not been identifed. These n e w
           capacities were never referred, it seems, to the Council or the Club in order
           that the Safety Certificate could be amended. In any event the ability to
           restrict those enclosures to those capacities was not possible with the
^ )        turnstile system in operation.

           It also appears that despite the introduction of these additional radial fences
           w h i c h created the void enclosure 5, no amendment was considered to the overall
           capacity of the West Terrace even though the barrier configuration remained the
            same (until 1986).

           Access to the West Stand which is all seating is by w a y of turnstiles 11 to 16
           and A to G, using the staircases off the concourse. The front of the West
           Stand overlooks the terraces, giving seated spectators a v i e w of the terraces,
           The West Stand is divided by gangways for safety purposes. At the rear of the
           West Stand is a refreshment kiosk.

           The Police Control Box is situated in an elevated position in the South West
           Corner of the ground overlooking the Leppings Lane Terraces, a distance of 35
           meters from gate 3 and 47.5 meters from Gate 4. The control Box houses the
           Police Communications System and Video Monitors for the five fully remote
           controlled cameras wh i ch are operated from this location. There i3 also a
           facility for the Police to over-ride the ground tannoy system usually operated
 /         by the disc jockey.

           A Club Control Room is situated on the ground floor at the rear of the South
           Stand, close to the players changing rooms,

 C )       rhere is no view of the pitch from this room. The occupants monitor the entry
           through the turnstiles around the ground, w i t h a computer supplying 'print
           o u t s ’ for the ground management purposes. The room also contains the TV
           monitors from the various cameras located at turnstiles around the ground,
           Recordings are made on a bank of 16 video recorders, There is an ability to
           monitor any one of the five C.C.T.V.s being operated by the Police from their
           control box on request to them. A telephone connects the Police Control to the
           Club Control Room.

           In addition this Club Control room, acts as the main base station for the Club
           personal radio scheme. This radio system is used by Senior Stewards, Security
           Officers and Management on a talk-through basis.

           The Director's Box is centrally situated overlooking the pitch in the upper
           tier of the South Stand. There is access to the board room, the office complex
           below, the Nostalgia Bar and Steps Restaurant to the rear of the South Stand.

           The current tannoy public address system was upgraded in 1988 and broadcasts to
           locations in and around the ground, including the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
 ( )       Capable of being directed selectively to areas of the ground the system is
           operated from the South Stand near to the Police Control Box,: by a Disc Jockey
           employed by the Club. Normally used for Club announcements and musical
           entertainment, the system can be over-ridden by the Police from their Gr o u n d
           Control Box.

           Situated to the right of the Police Control Box, w he n looking from the pitch
           above the Finlux TV and video sign is an electronic clock. A board is also
           Located there being capable of displaying messages.

           The Police R o om is located under the North Stand adjacent to the First Aid
           Room, It iB used as the detention and documentation room for persons arrested
           or being ejected from the ground.

           A first A i d R o o m is required under Schedule 2 , Paragraph 8(1) of the Safety
           Certificate. This room, which was upgraded in 1979, is ma n ne d by the St John
           Ambulance Brigade personnel during matches, St. John Ambulance Staff advise
           the Club on the purchase of equipment for the room wh ic h is located on the
           ground floor at the rear of the North Stand alongside the Police room, A
 ( )       gymnasium is situated at the rear of the Nor t h stand.

           A purpose built commentary box is located above the South.Stand.

           As previously mentioned, the Club have staged many large scale functions at
           Hillsborough, These can give some indication of the level of their experience
           and that of the other agencies involved. That said, during the course of
           enquiries in connection w i t h the disaster evidence has emerged of crushing
           involving supporters in the West Stand terracing at previous F.A. Cup Semi
           Finals.

           The Semi-Finals concerned are 1956, 1981, 1987 and 1988.

           In 1956 a m a t c h was played between Birmingham City and Sunderland and took
           place on 17 Ma r c h 1956, where a surge of people caused crushing on the Vest
           Stand terracing.

           O n 11 April 1981 a Semi-Final was held between T o t te n h a m Hotspur and
           W o l v e r h a m p t o n Wanderers. This is the best document and the most serious of the
 ( j       previous incidents. Tottenham fans arrived late due to a combination of
           difficulties on the Ml Motorway and local diversions. There was crushing on
           the Leppings Lane terraces and during this match.
The Police and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club held discussions following
this incident and the evidence points to the later implementation of the radial
fences forming initially five large enclosures (the centre enclosure being
later divided into enclosures 3,4 and 5), being the action taken to pre v e nt a
similar incident.

On 12 April 1987, a Semi Final between Leeds United and Coventry City was
played. Evidence from one supporter suggests there was overcrowding on the
Leppings Lane terraces.

In 1988 the Semi Final took place between Nottin g h a m Forest and Liverpool.
Evidence, obtained suggested crushing occurred on the Leppings Lane terraces.
There is no evidence, however,'to show the 1987 or 1988 incidents were brought
to the notice of the Police or Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

The Hillsborough Football Stadium was designated under the provisions of the
Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975, on 1 January 1979, the safety Certificate for
Hillsborough was issued by South Yorkshire County Councul on 21 December 1979,
on Sheffield Wednesday Football C l u b ’s promotion to the Second Division.
Atta c h e d to the Certificate are a number of schedules. Schedule 1 deals w i t h
Interpretation} Schedule 2, the General Terms and Conditions; and Schedule 3,
Crowd Capacity and Safety Stewards.

South Yorkshire County Council, as the issuing authority, was responsible for
the administration and supervision of the certificate until their demise in
1986 w h e n reponsibility was transferred to Sheffield City Council. The Officer
W o r k i n g Party, n o w called the Sheffield City Council Safety at Sports Grounds
Advisory Group, at the time of this disaster comprised of representatives from
Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Eastwood and
Partners, South Yorkshire Police, South Yorkshire Fire Brigade and South
Y orkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

At the time the County Council transferred responsibilty for licensing to the
City Council, there was a prepared schedule of responsibilities under the
Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 in existence. This document showed the
responsibilities of the County, Police, Fire Brigade and Building Control
Authority. According to correspondence this acheduule was adopted by the City
Council w h i c h meant they then assumed the former County and Building Control
functions.

In July 1987, these responsibilities were re-drawn by the City Council in draft
form in a document entitled ’Division of Responsibilities between Authorities',
w h i c h proposed responsibilities being divided between the Building Surveyors
 (Department of Land and Planning) and the Director of Environmental Health and
Consumer Services.

            Dear Sirs,


C)                                Resumed Hillsborough inquests on l§th Nov. 1990

            v *th reference to m:y earll<*r correspondence I am circulating to nil,
            the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
            summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
            Hillsborough disaster,

            I would be moat grateful if you could please study                        the documents as
            soon as possible and let me knowi

            1, Whether you agree that they correctly summarise the position in
            respect of those natters which are dealt with.

            2, If you think that, there are any errors in the summaries. Please
            specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.
            If ve cannot agree a particular point than it may be necessary to
            delete it entirely front the summaries. I will decide what
            action is needed in the light of any comments and in relation to
            the importance or otherwise of the point that is disputed,
            Please note that, it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
            be merged and presented a* one, They have simply been prepared in the
            present format, and, in the interests of time I am circulating them

           There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
           that you have kept your client<s) informed of the recomencement of the
           resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
           them of this fact, I have also taken it that neither you nor your
           Client(s) object to this. If these assumptions are incorrect please
           let me have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
           current address o T y o u r client(s) so that JTcan formally write to
           them.                                                                        .

Solicitor/Commission for Oaths.
                              MICHAEL KELLY



(1)   I opened the Inquest on Michael Kelly on 18th April 1989 and

      evidence of identification was taken.   The autopsy was

      carried out by Dr. Clark.



(2)   On 1st May 1990 the Inquest concerning Michael Kelly was

      reconvened.   Mr. Fraser appeared for the deceased's family.

      I explained the procedure that I was proposing to adopt.     No

      objection was made by Mr. Fraser.



(3)   Dr. John Clark gave evidence and in answer to me stated



      "Cause of death was crush asphyxia.  This was based on
      findings of signs of asphyxia in his face.  His face was
      rather congested and had a bluish discoloration.  These
      changes, I have to say, were fairly mild in comparison to a
      lot of the other people and one of the other features of
      asphyxia is to find little haemorrhages on the skin.   These
      were not in fact present".

      ” ... In any event there was nothing to indicate he suffered
      for any great length of time.  He probably lost
      consciousness within a short period of time, 10 or 15
      seconds or so, and then knew nothing about it after that.
      As I said, there were not any major injuries internally".

      Mr. Fraser had no questions for Dr. Clark.



(4)   Dr. Clark was a Forensic Pathologist from the University of

      Glasgow who had been in Sheffield on the weekend of the

      tragedy.   Towards the end of my questioning he said in an

      entirely unsolicited comment after I had thanked him for his

      invaluable assistance




                                12
      "Can I say in turn as someone dealing with this sort of work
      and investigation of death very regularly how impressed I
      have been with the professionalism and sensitivity with
      which the proceedings have been carried^jaiife’-here, in
      particular your handling and explanations to the relatives
      of-the bereaved people.  I think it has given comfort to
      everyone who has worked here and I felt it a very
      appropriate atmosphere".
(5)   Inspector Sawers presented the summary of evidence collected

      which related to Michael Kelly. He summarised the evidence

      Bf 9 witnesses.   Mr. Fraser did not object to this

      procedure.   He had one question to ask Inspector Sawers

      relating to the likelihood of whether Michael Kelly had a

      ticket for the match.



(6)   Detective Inspector Layton summarised the visual evidence

      available.   His answers relating to the observable condition

      of Michael Kelly on the photographic evidence were the

      result of questions from me.   The relevant exchanges were as

      follows



      "Sir, on a photograph reference PR2/21 which is timed at
      15.08 that shows Michael in Enclosure No.3 and whilst the
      detail again is not great it appears to show him certainly
      alive at that time but I cannot say at what stage of the
      process medically he is at".

      "Question:    He looked a bit distressed you think in that?
      - Answer: That is my impression".

      "Question:     You can't say whether he is conscious or
       unconscious, alive or dead at that particular point?" -
       Answer:   It is difficult.  I would say he is probably still
       alive, Sir, but certainly in distress".

      There was no objection from Mr. Fraser to these questions.

      Mr. Fraser had no questions of this officer.



(7)   At the conclusion of this part of the Inquest on 1st May

      1990 Mr. Fraser said:-


                               13
      "Again, Sir, before you conclude the evidence in this case,
      Michael's mother, who as it were is the head of the family,
      is unable to be with us today.     She is in Liverpool but
      through her son and daughter they specifically want me to
      thank through you everybody who helped fiffchael on the day
      obviously.  Everybody's efforts are very much appreciated
      and they want to offer their thanks to the officers of the
      West Midland Police as w e l l " .

(8)   The evidence relating to the main part of the Inquest

      commenced on 19th November 1990.    Much of the evidence was

      common to all 95 Inquests.    With particular reference to

      Michael Kelly, on 14th March 1991 (day 70 of the main part

      of the Inquests) I called Police Constable John Maughan.



(9)   There was no further responsible or relevant medical or

      other evidence available to put before the jury to suggest

      that in Michael Kelly's case (in terms of medical or rescue

      efforts) anything difference could have been done which

      would have had an impact on the cause of death.



(10) Bearing in mind the extent of the coronal jurisdiction, the

      circumstances of this disaster, the findings of the Lord

      Justice Taylor Inquiry and the evidence heard relating to M.

      Kelly,   it did not appear that there was any other

      responsible or any other relevant evidence relating to

      medical or rescue efforts which would have had a bearing on

      the cause of death.

                      PETER TOOTLE



I opened the Inquest on Peter Tootle^on 19th April 1989 when

evidence of identification was taken.     The autopsy was

carried out by Dr. Slater.



On 18th May 1990 the Inquest concerning Peter Tootle was

reconvened.   Mr. Fraser appeared for the deceased's family.

I explained the procedure I was proposing to adopt.        No

objection was made by Mr. Fraser.



Dr. Slater in anwers to question from me stated



"My examination of Peter showed that the general findings
were those of asphyxia.  These were indicated by extensive
blueness on the face extending to the upper part of the
chest."

" ... I submitted my cause of death, Sir, as traumatic
asphyxia."

" ... Sir, unconsciousness occurs very rapidly, normally
within 3 to 5 seconds,and after that there is no awareness
of any pain or discomfort and death supervenes after another
3 to 5 m i n ute s."

Mr. Fraser had no questions for Dr. Slater.


Police Sergeant Killock presented the summary of the

evidence collected which related to Peter Tootle.     He

summarised the evidence of 8 witnesses.    Mr. Fraser neither

objected to this procedure nor did he have any questions to

ask Police Sergeant Killock.
(5)   Detective Inspector Layton summarised the visual evidence

      available.   In answer to a question 'fTonTme Detective

      Inspector Layton stated:


      "That photograph is timed at 15.03 and my perception of the
      photograph, Sir, is that Peter is at that time still alive
      although it is not possible to say at what stage of the
      medical process he has reached."

      Mr. Fraser did not object to the above procedure, nor the

      specific question and had no questions for this o f f ice r.



(6)   At the completion of this part of the Inquest on Peter

      Tootle on 18th May 1990 Mr. Fraser said:-



      "Sir, Mr and Mrs. Tootle simply want to express their
      gratitude to everybody who helped Peter on the d a y . They
      recognise that everybody did everything they could and they
      are only sorry their efforts were unfortunately
      unsuccessful.  They recognise that everybody tried their
      very best."

(7)   The evidence relating to the final part of the Inquest

      commenced on 19th November 1990.        Much of the evidence was

      common to all 95 Inquests.      There   was sufficient evidence

      from this source to   deal with the "how" question in the case

      of Peter Tootle.   The jury had been present throughout the

      hearings in April and May of 1990 (including the 18th May

      1990) and from 19th   November 1990 onwards.



(8)   Bearing in mind the   extent of the coronal jurisdiction, the

      circumstances of this disaster, the findings of the Lord

      Justice Taylor Inquiry and the evidence heard relating to P.

      Tootle, it did not appear that there was any other


                                 16
     responsible or any other relevant evidence relating to

     medical or rescue efforts which would have had a bearing on

     the cause of death.              -

    (1)   I opened the Inquest on Kevin Williams on 18th April 1989

          when evidence of identification was taken.     The autopsy was

          carried out by Dr. Slater.



    (2)   The Inquest concerning Kevin Williams     reconvened on 2nd May

          1990.     The family of the deceased were represented by Mr.

          Fraser.     I explained the procedure I was proposing to adopt.

          No objection was made by Mr. Fraser.



    (3)   Dr. Slater in answer to me stated the following



          "My examination of Kevin showed that the main finding was
          that of asphyxia.  This opinion was formed through the
          extensive blueness on the face and other part of the chest.
          In addition there were small haemorrhages in both the face
          and internal organs including the brain, heart and lungs.
          This asphyxia had clearly resulted from compression of the
          neck and chest and this opinion was supported by the
          presence of 3 small scratches on the left side of the neck
          and also over the front of the voice box.  This had also
          resulted in 4 fractures to the small bones in the actual
          voice box.  In addition there was evidence of bruising to
          the lungs, again supporting compression of the chest."

          "... In terms of the mode of death the compression of the
          neck or chest has occurred here and unconsciousness occurs
          very rapidly, certainly within a few seconds ... Following
          unconsciousness there is no discomfort and no pain.   Death
          then occurs after approximately 3 to 5 minutes, Sir."



    (4)   I was very well aware of the evidence of Debra Martin and I

          put her evidence specifically to Dr. Slater for him to deal

          with.     His answer was as follows:-




                                 18
      "Well Sir, I was aware of this statement and therefore I
      have clearly given this matter considerable thought, Sir.    I
      think there are several comments to make but on the
      moderately large number of autopsies^, X^dijL-from this
      incident, Sir, this was certainly the most severe case of
      traumatic asphyxia that I actually dealt with.     This was
      both in terms of blueness of the face and also the area of
      pallor whiteness around the mouth.   Sir, it was a very very
      severe form of asphyxia.  I do not think that
      unconsciousness would have been quicker than 3 or 5 seconds.
      I have no reasons to alter what I have already said on that
      aspect."


(5)   The evidence of Dr. Slater in commenting upon Debra Martin's

      evidence was not challenged by Mr. Fraser.     I explained to

      the family that I had specifically taken the course of

      referring to this evidence so that nothing of relevance was

      hidden or concealed.   After the summary of evidence set out

      in (6) below, which covered the evidence of P. C. Bruder

      about convulsions, Mr. Fraser put the following questions to

      Dr. Slater (relating to convulsions)


      "It is difficult to find the phrase to sum the situation up.
      Kevin at that stage was beyond help.  He was as good as dead
      Answer:   Yes, that is right, absolutely.  He would know
      nothing".
      Question: "And would feel nothing and know nothing? -
      Answer: "Absolutely.  He would know nothing?"



(6)   Police Sergeant Killock presented the summary of the

      evidence collected relating to Kevin Williams.     He

      summarised the evidence of 15 witnesses.     No objection was

      taken to this procedure by Mr. Fraser and he did not ask any

      questions of Police Sergeant Killock.



(7)   Detective Inspector Layton summarised the visual evidence.

      No objection to this procedure was raised by Mr. Fraser' and

      he asked no questions of this officer.

                             19
(8)   I explained to the family present why I felt it important

      that the evidence of P. C. Bruder ancl Debra Martin be

      commented upon by Dr. Slater.    However, I continued to be

      concerned about the evidence of a convulsion and later of a

      word spoken and so I invited the Police to further

      investigate these aspects of the evidence and for Dr.

      Gumpert to attend the Inquest.    I understand that Dr. Slater

      contact P.C. Bruder direct to ask him in detail about what

      he saw.



(9)   I must emphasise that at no stage did I speak directly to

      either P.C. Bruder of Debra Martin.    Dr. Gumpert, a

      Consultant Neurologist and Clinical Neurophysiologist, made

      himself available for 4th May 1990.



(10) On 4th May 1990 Inspector Sawers reported the results of his

      further enquiries.   Mr. Fraser raised no questions on behalf

      of the family.



(11) Dr. Slater in an effort to explain his evidence on 2nd May

      1990 and incorporate his evaluation of the further evidence

      of P. C. Bruder and Debra Martin said:-



      "Death is a sequence of events.  It is not one set of events
      and the sequence I will put to you is an individual becoming
      unconscious;  whilst they are unconscious they quickly lose
      all sensation of pain and discomfort;  then there is a
      period of various tissues in the body which are susceptible
      to a lack of oxygen, dying.. The most important one of these
      is, of course, the brain and after about 3 to 6 minutes the
      brain undergoes irreversible brain damage.  There is then a
      point which we call brain death.  This is a difficult
      concept, but by this I am implying that the brain is

      ©                    20
    irreversibly damaged.  The brain is no longer able to
    control respiration and in fact that person, for effective
    purposes, is dead, irreversibly.  Tha-k_is^a>.medico-legal
    definition, at least one medico-legal definition, of death."

    "... Having said that, Kevin had extremely severe asphyxia.
    I have no doubt in my own mind that he had suffered
    irrecoverable brain damage and death within the 3 to 6
    minutes that I said."



(12) Dr. Gumpert having listened to the evidence said:-

    "It seems clear to me, Sir, in this case that poor Kevin was
    probably dead before he was got out of the area in which he
    was standing."

    "I cannot explain the Liverpool Police Constable's term
    convulsion' because to me a convulsion is a major epileptic
    attack and he has quite clearly said he does not mean that,
    so I don't know what he does mean".


(13) I did what I felt was necessary to put before the jury at

    the conclusion of this part of the Inquest into the death of

    Kevin Williams all that was relevant on the issues of who,

    when and where.   I must emphasise that I was then and remain

    today (apart from the present allegations) wholly unaware of

    any allegations of improper pressure applied to witnesses.

    I must say that in the light of all that I knew of those

    officers who investigated the tragedy, xl find such

    allegations highly improbable.



(14) The evidence relating to the final part of the Inquest

    commenced on the 19th November 1990.   Much of the evidence

    was common to all 95 Inquests. On 12th February 1991   (day 48

    of the main part of the Inquests)   I specifically called

    Andrew Duncan in relation to the Inquest concerning Kevin

    Williams.



                          21
(15) Bearing in mind the extent of the coronal jurisdiction, the

     circumstances of this disaster/ thei findings of the Lord

     Justice Taylo.: Inquiry and the evidence heard relating to K.

     Williams, it did not appear that there was any other

     responsible or any other relevant evidence relating to

     medical or rescue efforts which would have had a bearing on

     the cause of death.

                           22
                            PAUL CARLILE



(1)   I opened the Inquest on Paul Ca'rlile^on 19th April 1989 when

      evidence of identification was taken.     The autopsy was

      carried out by Professor Alan Usher.



(2)   On 3rd May 1990 the Inquest on Paul Carlile was reconvened.

      Mr. Fraser appeared for the deceased's family.     I explained

      the procedure I was proposing to adopt.     No objection was

      made by Mr. Fraser.



(3)   Professor Alan Usher gave evidence and in answer to me

stated



      "The typical signs of traumatic asphyxia were present both
      externally and internally".
      "... I gave his cause of death as traumatic asphyxia".
(4)   Mr. Fraser put one question to Professor Usher who answered

      as follows

      " ... The reason for Paul's death was that his chest was
      held so tightly that he could not breath in or out and, once
      that had happened, then he would have been unconscious in a
      matter of seconds, between 10 to 20 seconds.  He would have
      died within a few minutes but at the time, of course,
      subsequent to his unconsciousness, he would not have been
      aware of any pain".

      There was no other challenge to the pathological evidence.
(5)   WPC Geraldine Evans provided the summary of the evidence

      collected relating to Paul Carlile.     She summarised the

      evidence of 15 witnesses. Mr. Fraser neither objected to

      this procedure, not did he wish to ask any question of WPC

      Eva n s .



                            2
(6)   Detective Inspector Layton summarised the visual evidence

      available.   Again, Mr. Fraser neither objected to this

      procedure nor did he have any questions of the officer.



(7)   At the conclusion of this part of the Inquest on 3rd May

      1990 relating to Paul Carlile, Mr. Fraser read a note from

      the family


      "The note is from the family in general, Sir, and I read it
      out as it stands. They want to thank Michael Layton and
      Peter Hogan who, I understand, is an officer who assisted
      Inspection Layton, Sir, for their help throughout the
      Inquiry.   They want to thank the two officers, Goulding and
      Pont, for the assistance which they gave to Paul on the day,
      together with the ambulance man whose name has not been
      traced.   Sir, they want to thank Maureen Rowe and Peter Hyde
      from Moseley Social Services and they have been, in the
      family's words, Sir, a 'lifeline for us throughout the last
      year'.   Sir, they want to thank Michael Eollinghurst for
      trying to save Paul. They say, 'words will never express
      how we feel, but knowing that he was with Paul, we are all
      grateful'.   Finally, Sir they want to thank you for being,
      again, their words 'so thorough and a gentleman' as you have
      been throughout these Inquests and, in particular, the
      Inquest into their loved one".

(8)   The evidence relating to the final part of the Inquest
      commenced on the 19th November 1990.    Much of that evidence

      was common to all of the 95 Inquests.   With particular

      respect to Paul Carlile, on 9th January 1991 (26th day of

      main part of the Inquests)   I called Michael Hollinghurst and




                           3
      on 13th February 1991 (49th day of the main part of the

      Inquests)   Ian Fearns.   Mr. Timothy King who appeared for the

      family during this part of the Inquest had the opportunity

      to question-both of them and did so.



(9)   At no stage during this last part of the Inquest was it

      suggested on behalf of the family that Professor Usher's

      evidence was inaccurate or wrong.



(10) Bearing in mind the extent of the coronal jurisdiction,     the

      circumstances of this disaster, the findings of the Lord

      Justice Taylor Inquiry and the evidence heard relating to P.

      Carlile, it did not appear that there was any other

      responsible or any other relevant evidence relating to

      medical or rescue efforts which would have had a bearing on

      the cause of death.



(11) There was plentiful evidence before the jury for this

      Inquest and the 94 others concerning the acts of those

      responsible for crowd control and safety.



(12) The only formal request I received in relation to the

      evidence of Dr. Phillips and Dr. Ashton was as follows.        Mr.

      King in his submissions on the morning

      of the 19th November 1990 mentioned these witnesses as

      indeed did he mention Mr. Eccleston.     However, after that

      submission he did not make any further application to

      persuade me to call any of the evidence from these


                                4
     witnesses.   The parents of Richard Jones wrote a letter to

     me dated 12th February 1991 in which they asked me to call

     the evidence from Dr. Phillips and Dr. Ashton.   For the

     reasons set out in the main body of the Affidavit I did not

     do so.




1.9apgt
                               RICHARD JONES



(1)   I opened the Inquest on Richard Jones'on 18th April 19 89 and

      evidence of identification was taken.        The autopsy was

      carried out by Professor Alan Usher..



(2)   On 3rd May 1990 the Inquest concerning Richard Jones was

      reconvened.   Mr. Fraser appeared for the family. I did not

      in this case specifically explain the procedure I was to

      adopt,   since Mr. Jones (the father) had been present on the

      first day when I had gone through the explanation.        I

      reminded him of this.        Mr. Fraser made no objection to the

      procedure.



(3)   In answer to me Professor Usher stated:-



      "There were obvious signs of traumatic asphyxia both
      externally and internally". "This young man died essentially
      because he could not move his chest in or out and that
      meant, of course, he could not breathe and that meant oxygen
      was cut off to his vital organs and/ once that chest was
      fixed, he would have been unconscious in a matter of
      seconds, probably_between 10 and 20 seconds, and he would be
      completely unknowing of anything that happened subsequent to
      that, though he would take a matter of minutes, perhaps
      between 4 and 6 minutes, to die".

      Whilst Mr. Fraser did ask some questions of Professor Usher

      directed towards a blood alcohol measurement, the

      pathological evidence relating to the cause of death was not

      in any way challenged.



(4)   Police Sergeant Killock provided the summary of the evidence

      collected and relating to Richard Jones.       He summarised the


                               Q
      evidence of 9 witnesses.    Mr. Fraser neither objected to

      this procedure, nor did he wish to ask any questions of

      Police Sergeant Killock.



(5)   Detective Inspector Layton summarised the visual evidence

      available.   Mr. Fraser neither objected to this procedure

      and nor did he have any questions of this officer.



(6)   The evidence relating to the final part of the Inquest

      commenced on the 19th November 1990.   Much of the evidence

      was common to all 95 Inquests.   With particular reference to

      Richard Jones on 28th November 1990 (day 8 of the main part

      of the Inquests)   I called Stephanie Jones (his sister).    Mr.

      Timothy King who appeared who appeared for the family during

      this part of the Inquest took the opportunity to question

      her.



(7)   At no stage during this last part of the Inquest was it

      suggested on behalf of the family that Professor Usher's

      evidence was inaccurate or wrong.



(8)   Bearing in mind the extent of the coronal jurisdiction, the

      circumstances of this disaster, the findings of the Lord

      Justice Taylor Inquiry and the evidence heard relating to

      R.Jones, it did not appear that there was any other

      responsible or any other relevant evidence relating to

      medical or rescue efforts which would have had a bearing on

      the cause of death.



                                  10
(9)   It is correct that Mr. and Mrs. Jones wrote to me asking me

      to call Dr. Phillips and Dr. Ashton ^buiT~not Mr, Eccleston -
         A                     /
      see their letter dated 12th February 1991).   I did not do so

      for the reasons set out in the body, of the Affidavit.   In

      short, they could not add anything of relevance to the

      Inquiry before me.   No further application was made to me by

      Mr. King in the sense I have indicated above.   In his

      submission on the morning of Monday 19th November 1990 Mr.

      King had made specific reference to the evidence of these

      witnesses.    As far as I am aware it is incorrect that Mr.

      and Mrs. Jones submitted a report to me from Dr. James

      Burns.   Until my attention had been directed towards the

      material exhibited to the Affidavit of Mr. James Hawthorn I
      had not seen the report dated 11th March 1991 from Dr. James

      Burns.   Accordingly, as far as I am concerned I received no

      written request from Mr. and Mrs. Jones to call Dr. Burns.

                             IAN GLOVER



(1)   I opened the Inquest on Ian Glover"on~l8th April 1989, when

      evidence of identification was taken.     The autopsy was

      carried out by Professor Alan Usher.



(2)   On 4th May 1990 the Inquest on Ian Glover was reconvened.

      Mr. Fraser appeared for the deceased's family.     I explained

      the procedure I was proposing to adopt.    No objection was

      made by Mr. Fraser.



(3)   Professor Usher gave evidence and in answer to me said:-



      "His body presented both externally and internally the '
      typical appearances of traumatic asphyxia ...  I give the
      cause of death as traumatic asphyxia ... He would take
      between four and six minutes to die.  It would only be the
      first ten to twenty seconds he would be aware of".

(4)   Mr. Fraser had no questions for Professor Usher as to the

      cause of death.   His one question related to a neck device

      utilised by the undertakers.



(5)   WPC Geraldine,Evans provided the summary of the evidence

      collected relating to Ian Glover.    She summarised the

      evidence of five witnesses.    Mr. Fraser neither objected to

      this procedure, nor did he have any questions for WPC Evans.



(6)   Detective Inspector Layton summarised the visual evidence

      available.   Again Mr. Fraser neither objected to this

      procedure nor did he have any questions of the officer.'



                              6
On 4th May 1990 Joseph Glover indicated to WPC Evans that

whilst he was with the deceased in tlie temporary mortuary an

unnamed doctor said that he detected a pulse.        Joseph Glover

had not previously revealed this information nor was any

evidence revealed to me of the nature of the matters at the

end of the note of Sheila Coleman.      I recalled Professor

Usher.      In answer to me he indicated in effect that there

could have been a mistake about the pulse, but that even if

the finding were accurate the deceased would have been

unconscious and severely brain damaged.      I took the step of

recalling the pathologist to deal with this new point

because I wished the family to hear any explanation in Court

rather than to go away without the point having been

considered.



At the conclusion of this part of the Inquest on 4th May

1990 Mr. Fraser stated


 kir, just before you conclude taking evidence, I rise again
at the specific instruction of Ian's family.    They are very
conscious of the efforts that were made to save Ian on the
day and they are   very appreciative of everybody at the
ground who did everything they possibly could and
thereafter.

Sir they are particularly impressed by the way people of
Sheffield, with whom they had dealings on that day and
since, responded to this tragedy to their family and they
very much appreciate that".

The evidence relating     to the final part of the Inquest

commenced on the     19th November 1990.   Much   of that evidence

was common to all 95 Inquests.     I had received a letter

dated 15th October 1990 from John Glover (the deceased's

father) .    On 29th January 1991 (day 40 of the
                   main part of the Inquests) I called Joseph Glover (the
                    deceased's brother) so that he could add anything that he
                   wished to the statement he first gave\ ~ T~cailed him because
                   he wanted to give evidence.


(10) Bearing in mind the extent of the coronal jurisdiction,                  the

                   circumstances of this disaster, the findings of the Lord

                    Justice Taylor Inquiry and the evidence heard relating to I .

                   Glover, it did not appear that there was any other

                    responsible or any other relevant evidence relating to

                   medical or rescue efforts which would have had a bearing on

                    the cause of death.

                             AFFIDAVIT



I STEFAN LEOPOLD POPPER, of

           f NG4        MAKE OATH and say as follows:



1.   I hold the following qualifications: LLB. B.Med.Sci. BM.

     B S . MRGC P. For 6 years I was Her Majesty's Coroner for

     South Yorkshire (West District).      On the

     1st November 1991 I retired.      At various dated between

     the 18th April 1989 and the 28th March 1991 I conducted

     Inquests into the deaths of 95 individuals as a result of

     an incident at Hillsborough Stadium on Saturday the

     15th April 1989.    In total I sat for 96 days.
                                - 2 -




2.   I make this Affidavit in response to those sworn by

     Jeremy Hawthorn on the 5th May 1992 and the

     11th September 1992 filed on behalf of the 6 Applicants.

     I make this Affidavit so that the Court may have the

     benefit of my reasoning in acting in the way that I did.

     Accordingly, what follows is put forward by way of

     explanation.    I am content to leave all matters of

     argument to Counsel instructed upon my behalf.



3.   My attention has been drawn to the 7 grounds raised by

     the Applicants in their Form 86A dated the 5th May 1992

     and I will attempt to deal with each of those matters.       I

     will commence by providing a summary of the form and

     nature of the Inquests.    There is now produced and shown

     to me and marked "SLP.l" a paginated exhibit bundle to

     which reference is made in the body of this Affidavit.

     That exhibit is divided into marked sub-sections which

     indicate the contents.    I have attempted not to duplicate

     material exhibited by Mr Hawthorn.    Further, I have made

     every effort to keep the volume of the exhibit within a

     manageable amount.    During the course of the Inquest

     there was generated an enormous volume of material which

     I considered.    It would be intolerable for me to burden

     this Court with all of that information in order to place

     all of the Applicants' points in context.
Immediately, following the Hillsborough tragedy it fell

to me to conduct the Inquests into the deaths of the 95

individuals who suffered injury on that Saturday

15th April 1989 which led to their deaths.    In compliance

with my usual and well-established practice I considered

that the questions to be answered for each of the 95

Inquests within my inquisitorial jurisdiction and within

the parameters of the Coroners' Act 1988 were: Who? When?

Where? and How? - in other words who the person was,

where he/she was when they died; when he/she died and

finally how he/she died.



I opened the Inquests on the 95 deaths staring on the

18th April 1989.   At the initial hearings the bodies were

identified and the Inquests then adjourned.    Even at that

very early stage there were certain features of this

tragedy which were bound to impact upon the nature of the

Inquests; including



1.   The appointment on the 17th April 1989 of the Right

     Honourable Lord Justice Taylor by the Secretary of

     State for the Home Department to carry out an

     Inquiry:



     "To inquire into the events of Sheffield Wednesday

     football ground on the 15th April 1989 and to make

     recommendations about the needs of crowd control and

     safety at sports events"
                          - 4 -




2.   The very large number of deaths and the nature of

     the circumstances in which they occurred coupled

     with what would be the extreme distress involved for

     the relatives and friends of the deceased.



I was acutely award of attempting to balance the

practical imperatives for my inquisitorial purposes and

the eminently understandable desire on the part of all of

the relatives and friends of the deceased to know every

single piece of information concerning the lives of the

deceased on that fateful Saturday afternoon.



Following the identification carried out in April 1989

there followed the Interim Report by Lord Justice Taylor

in August 1989 and the Final Report in January 1990.     The

Inquiry and the Coronal process was assisted by an

independent Police Force - the West Midlands Constabulary

- who investigated the incident and gathered evidence for

the Inquiry.



Having opened each of the 95 Inquests in April 1989 and

then adjourned each, it had been my original intention

once the public inquiry had been completed to resume the

Inquests reasonably promptly and indeed initially I had

fixed the date for resumption as the 15th January 1990.
                           - 5 -



However, sometime after the Interim Report by Lord
Justice Taylor in August 1989 I was informed by the
Director of Public Prosecutions that an investigation
into the possible commission of serious criminal offences

was being conducted.


Upon receipt of that information I had determined that
any part of the resumed Inquest would have to await the
Director's decision.   However, between August 1989 and
early 1990 I received a request from the families and
other for information about individual together with a
 suggestion that a limited form of Inquest could take
 place - not dealing with the how question, but if the
 evidence were carefully adduced such that there could be
 no possible prejudice to any person the subject of a
 criminal investigation then the questions of who were and

 when could be dealt with•


 Accordingly, I arranged for a series of meetings to take
 place to explore this option.     The first took place on
 the 26th February 1990 with Mr Fraser representing the
 interests of the families.    It was agreed that the
 inquests could proceed and all relevant interests could
 be both promoted and protected by a two stage process
  firstly, answering the questions who, where and when (the
  interim part of the Inquest) followed by a how element of
  the Inquest depending upon any decision by the Director

  of Public Prosecution.
                           - 6 -




I arranged a further meeting on the 6th March 1990 where

a broader range of representation was able to attend.

The proposed method of proceedings was agreed.    I

explained fully the way in which I wanted the evidence to

be presented so as to meet the legitimate requirements of

everyone involved.   There was no dissent from the

proposals.



Therefore, as can be appreciated from the above, in order

to complete my statutory function I have determined that

the factual evidence concerning the questions of who,

when and where, could and should be met by Officers of

the West Midlands Constabulary summarising each of the 95

cases the effect of the evidence they had gathered and

collected.   I have carefully explained to all concerned

in particular Mr Fraser, why I had chosen this path (not

least to avoid the possible pitfalls of prejudicing the

criminal investigations) and he was in agreement with my

proposals.   On the same questions, the forensic pathology

evidence would be dealt with by the pathologist who

undertook the post mortem examinations (each of them

being wholly independent) but the evidence would be led

by Professor Alan Usher - the Professor of Forensic

Medicine at Sheffield.   He is a pathologist of

international repute.    He and his team had completed all

the autopsies within 48 hours of the tragedy.
                                 - 7 -



8.   Although the Final Report for the Inquiry was completed

     in January 1990, at that stage the possibility of serious

     criminal proceedings and disciplinary proceedings still

     remain open against certain Police Officers of the South

     Yorkshire Constabulary.



9.   As described above and with agreement, I decided that the

     questions of who, when and where should be decided at a

     preliminary part of the Inquest for each of the 95

     individuals with the issue of how being held over until

     the criminal proceedings (if any) were determined.



     Each of the 95 Inquests were reconvened to deal with the

     preliminary aspects.   This process commenced on the,

     18th April 1990 and on that day the same jury were

     empanelled to deal with each of the 95 Inquests and the

     preliminary Inquests were held either at the Memorial

     Hall, City hall, Sheffield or at the Medico-Legal Centre

     in Sheffield.



     A full list of representation for this part of the

     Inquests was as follows



     Mr Fraser, Solicitor for the Hillsborough Solicitor's

     Group Steering Committee.



     Mr Sean Smith, Counsel for the Medical and Dental Defence

     Union of Scotland on behalf of Alexander Robert

     Walker-Forest.
                             - 8 -




   Mr Callaghan, Solicitor for Trent Regional Health
   Authority and South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance
   Service.


   Mr McGregor, Solicitor for Sheffield City Council.



   Miss Forbes,. Solicitor for Messrs Eastwood and Partners.


   Miss Alderman, Counsel for the Police Federation of
   England and Wales.


   Mr Isaacs, Counsel for Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.


   Miss Norcliffe, Solicitor for the Chief Constable of
   South Yorkshire.


   Mr Stewart Catchpole, Counsel for Sheffield Wednesday

   Football Club.



10. The Preliminary Inquests (otherwise known as the interim

   or mini inquests)



   This part of the Inquests was held starting on the

    18th April 1990 and continued until 4th May 1990.    At

   that time 90 out of the 95 families were represented by

   Hillsborough Steering Committee.   The solicitor agent

   instructed for the families was .Mr Fraser and he was

   present when I led the relevant evidence.
                              - 9 -




11. I would emphasise the following points as to the

   procedure I adopted:



    1.   As relevant to the six Inquests the subject matter

         of this application the pathological evidence was

         taken from Professor Alan Usher, Dr Slater (a

         Consultant Histopathologist) and Dr John Clark, a

         Pathologist from Glasgow.    In total 9 pathologists

         were involved in carrying out the post mortems

         within 48 hours of the tragedy.   The others involved

         were Dr Lloyd Denmark, Professor Laurence Henry,

         Professor J S P Jones, Dr J R Shortland,

         Dr S Savialoganatham and Professor J Underwood.     My

         understanding of the overwhelming pathological

         evidence was that the victims died as a result of

         injuries received which in the overwhelming number

         of cases led to traumatic asphyxia and that the

         pathological evidence available to me was that the

         injury that caused the death was crushing.



         The representatives of all the families of the

         deceased had been provided with copies of the post

         mortem reports prior to the 18th April 1990.



   2.    I adopted the approach of asking West Midlands

         Officers to summarise the evidence.    It included the

         results of extensive and exhaustive study of TV
                          - 10 -


tapes, video and photographic evidence and was

intended inasmuch as was possible to give accurate

and factual evidence in respect of the questions of

who, when and where.         I have set out above the

reasons why I used this approach.         Further, as a

matter of common humanity it avoided the need for

relatives and friends of the deceased to have to

re-live acutely painful and distressing events.           I

must stress that this procedure had been explained

to the representatives of the families and there had

been agreement about this method of proceeding

before 18th April 1990.



The evidence that was given was given on oath by

Officers (albeit hearsay evidence) - the written

su m m a rie s   themselves were not evidence.   These

written summaries were, however, provided to

Mr Fraser before I called the evidence.          On the

18th April 1990 I explained to the jury how the

presentation of the summaries was to take place,

together with how they had been prepared.          I also

explained the working of Rule 37 and how I intended

to apply that Rule in the presentation of evidence.



No representation was made by Mr Fraser about these

matters.
                               - 11 -


   3.   At the reconvened hearing of nearly every Inquest, I

        started by explaining the method I proposed to adopt

        to the members of the families present.     As far as I

        recall Mr Fraser was always present.     There was no

        objection from him as to the proposed procedure.

        Further, insofar as I can recall, there was no

        substantial challenge by way of cross-examination to

        the summaries provided by the Officers of West

        Midlands Force.      A number of families through

        Mr Fraser expressed their thanks for the work

        carried out by those Officers.



12. In the vast majority of the cases the uncontested

   evidence of the pathologists was that the pathologists

   cause of death was traumatic asphyxia and that within a

   matter of seconds the individuals would have been

   unconscious and unaware of anything further and would

    have died or suffered irreversible injury within a matter

    of minutes thereafter.



13. The "How" element of the Inquests



    Following the conclusion of the Preliminary Inquests on

    4th May 1990, I was informed in September 1990 that the

    Director of Public Prosecutions had decided not to

    prosecute anyone in respect of the disaster.     The

    Inquests had been adjourned to a date fixed and

    accordingly, I made arrangements for the "How" part of

    the Inquests to be held.
                             - 12 -




14. On the 30th October 1990 at the Medico-Legal Centre in

   Sheffield I convened a Business Meeting of the Legal

   Representatives of the interested parties.     This was

    specifically required by me in order to discuss procedure

    and the smooth running of the main part of the Inquests

   which were due to start on Monday 19th November 1990 and

    to be heard throughout at the Town Hall in Sheffield

    (where the Taylor Inquiry had sat).



    In the meeting I indicated that in general terms I

    proposed in this part of the Inquest to take the evidence

    together in respect of all 95.    I then proceeded to

    outline to the representatives the parameters of my

    inquiry on the how question.     In particular, I identified

    the cut-off point for evidence that I had selected,

    namely the arrival of the first ambulance upon the pitch.

    Because of resource constraints I had concluded that

    circulating the statements of witnesses before I called

    them was impractical.   In a similar vein I stated my

    initial views about the admissibility of the Taylor

    Inquiry Report.



    This was a Business Meeting and not part of the hearing

    itself.   It was not the appropriate forum for me to hear

    legal argument, but quite properly the legal

    representatives present used the occasion to inform me of

    the matters they would be raising.
                             - 13 -




   Mr King for the bereaved indicated in general terms his

   position on the "cut-off" point.



    I decided that all matters of a legal argument should be

    heard on the morning of Monday 19th November 1990.



15. Whilst on the 30th October 1990 I had not made a

   preliminary ruling that in consideration the question of

    "How" I would be concerned with events up to and

    including the time of 3.15pm on Saturday 15th April 1989

    but not thereafter, I had reached a provisional decision

    that I would proceed in that fashion.   It was clear to me

    that an important issue for the "How" question was the

    manner in which the crushing on the terraces had come

    about.   As a marker I picked the arrival of the first

    ambulance on the pitch which was timed at 3.15pm because

    on the overwhelming pathological evidence available to

    me, by that time permanent irrecoverable damage would

    have already occurred.   I felt it right to draw a line in

    that regard and I had in mind the approach adopted by the

    Coroner in the Zeebruggee Inquest.   However, my decision

    was based mainly upon the expert pathological medical

    evidence.
16. Representation for this main part of the Inquest was as

    follows:



    Mr Timothy King (Counsel): for 43 of the families

    Mrs McBrien: lay representative for the McBrien family

    Miss Hampton (Counsel) and Mr Maxwell Q.C.: Sheffield

    City Council

   Mr Hale (Solicitor): Superintendent Marshall

   Mr Manning (Solicitor): Superintendent Murray

   Mr Payne (Counsel) and Mr Limb (Counsel): Chief Constable

    South Yorkshire

   Mr Isaacs (Counsel): Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

   Miss Sinclair (Counsel): Eastwood and Partners

   Mr Catchpole (Counsel): Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

   Mr Callaghan (Solicitor): Ambulance Service

   Miss Addelmann (Counsel): Police Federation

   Mr Russell (Counsel): Superintendent Greenwood



17. On Monday 19th November 1990 I heard argument from

   Counsel instructed for the families of the deceased about

   the way in which the answering of the "How" question was

   to be approached.   On that day 43 of the families were

   apparently represented by Mr Timothy King of Counsel who

   had been Junior Counsel instructed to represent the

   families before the Taylor Inquiry.
                             - 15 -


   In summary, Mr King made the following points to me in

   order to persuade me to a different view to the

   provisional view I had reached:



   1.   Up to this point there had been no investigation or

        systematic analysis of what was the organisation of

        the rescue, which it might have been and where it

        would have made a difference.   In that regard he was

        concentrating on that period of time after the

        individuals had been brought off the terraces and

        before death was certified.



   2.   By reference to the case of Richard Jones he

        contended that there was material to support the

        general proposition that not all the victims were

        necessarily dead by 3.15pm on that Saturday

        afternoon.



   3.   There was material (in particular from

        Dr John Ashton) that the medical and rescue attempt

        were disorganised.



18. I think it right to record that Mr Hale (and possibly

   Mr Isaacs) were not entirely supportive of Mr King's

    submissions and Mr Callaghan was against his approach.

    The remainder of the legal representatives present

    adopted essentially a neutral position.
                             - 16 -


19. Having listened very carefully to these submission I was

    not persuaded from my preliminary view.     I reminded

    Mr King that the Inquest was not a Judicial Inquiry.        In

    answer to the seven matters raised in the    Form 86A and

    the six cases the subject of the   application I deal more

    particularly with my reasoning within the exhibit of this

   Affidavit and further as set out    below.



20. On that first day of the resumed   Inquests into the 95

    deaths there was also a good deal of legal argument (in

    the absence of the jury) about the rules against

    self-incrimination as they applied to Police witnesses.

    Those representatives also strongly urged me to consider

    whether the representations of the families at the

    adjourned Inquests was to elicit evidence in order to

    persuade the Director of Public Prosecutions to

    reconsider his decision not to prosecute any of the

    Officers and for the jury to bring in a verdict of

    unlawful killing.



21. I was well aware of the emotions of the families, of the

   concerns of the Police Officers and of the particular

    interests of all other represented parties.     I could not

   but fail to be aware of the views of the interested

   parties.
                                 - 17 -


22. Following the legal argument on the Monday morning the

      19th November 1990 the jury returned in the afternoon and

      the Inquests proceeded on the "How" question for a total

      of 80 days.   In broad terms, I called the evidence in the

      following order, starting with the evidence about the

      arrival of the people to the outskirts of the town

      followed by evidence as to how they approached closer to

      the ground.   I then called evidence of the entrance of

      the crowd to the ground (from all perspectives).     I then

      called evidence dealing with the opening of the gates,

      the concourse and the tunnel and the way in which people

      went on to the terraces.     I ensured that evidence was

      called which came from people within pens 3 and 4 and

      further I called evidence from people who were outside

      those pens but had a different perspective from all parts

      of the stadium.   I then looked at the position by calling

      evidence from those who had been on the perimeter fence.

      I next called evidence about the broken barrier.     There

      then was a passage of expert evidence followed by the

      Senior Police Officers who were involved in particular

      those in the Control Room.    I attempted to call evidence

      such that all points of view were put before the jury,

      namely from the spectators, the Police and others.



23.   The summing-up and submissions on the verdicts available

      I dealt with in the following way.
                            - 18 -




By Friday the 15th March 1991 (the 71st day of the main

part of the Inquests) the evidence was beginning to draw

to a close.   On that afternoon some of the

representatives began to hand in their written

submissions on the verdicts open to the jury in law.       In

particular, Mr Maxwell Q.C. and Mr Payne.     On Monday the

18th March 1991 the evidence was concluded.    On Thursday

19th March 1991 (the 73rd day of the main part of the

Inquests) the legal representatives commenced making

their submissions.   They made their submissions in the

following order: Mr Maxwell Q.C., Mr Payne, Mr Issacs,

Mr Manning, Mr King, Mr Catchpole, Mrs McBrian,

Mr Russell, Miss Adleman and Mr Hale.



The submissions and further submissions were completed by

the afternoon of Wednesday 20th March 1991.    In summary,

all of the representatives made submissions as to whether

or not the verdict of unlawful killing should properly be

left open to the jury.   Not surprisingly they differed in

their conclusions.   Only one representative ( Mr Payne)

indicated what other verdicts should be considered and

left open to the jury, namely misadventure/accidental

death or an open verdict.    Both he and Mr Maxwell Q.C.

agreed that the order in which the jury should consider

their verdicts should be: unlawful killing; then

misadventure/accidental death; and finally an open

verdict.
                           - 19 -




No one made any submissions relating to any verdict of

lack of care or any verdict whereby the cause of death

was aggravated by lack of care - either on the part of

any Police Force or Police Officer or of any other body.

Mr King made submissions exclusively referable to the

verdict of unlawful killing.       It is also correct to say

that on most days of the main part of the Inquests the

legal representatives raised submissions concerning

points of law.    At no stage was I addressed upon verdicts

of the nature of lack of care.



On Thursday the 21st March 1991 (the 75th day) I started

my summing up and continued through Friday the

22nd March 1991, Monday the 25th March 1991 and completed

the summing up with the jury retiring     at12.33pm     on

Tuesday the   26th March 1991.



As far as my summing up was concerned, I emphasised that

each Inquest had to be considered separately.         With

respect to the verdicts open to the jury, I directed them

but they were as follows: unlawful killing, accidental

death and open verdict.    In explaining the verdict of

accidental death, I emphasised that it included events

where no one was to blame through to events where there

was negligence.    I made it clear    that such averdict did

not absolve   everyone of blame.
                                - 20 -




    I did indicate to the jury that under Rule 36B no rider

    should be attached to any verdict.     I also drew their

    attentipn to Rule 42.



    On Thursday the 28th March 1991 at 12.08pm (the 80 day of

    the main part of the Inquest) the jury returned majority

   verdicts of accidental death in all of the 95 Inquests.



24. The Seven Grounds of Criticism in Form 86A



   With respect to the separate arguments made in respect of

   each of the 6 applicants I have set out my decisions (and

   where necessary reasoning) by way of separate commentary

   in the exhibit to this Affidavit.



   I direct my evidence on this aspect specifically to the 6

   Inquests the subject matter of the application.



   Criticism (1)



   I have set out above the reasons why I adopted the

   procedure I did for the preliminary Inquests held in

   April and May 1990.      I do not believe that there was any

   practical alternative to the procedure I adopted.      In the

   meetings beforehand this procedure was explained,

   understood and agreed.     In each of the 6 Inquests the
                            - 21 -


subject of this application, the families were each

represented by Mr Fraser.    He had been provided with each

of the written summaries beforehand.    At the outset of

nearly every Inquest I explained the procedure that I

proposed to adopt to the families.     No objection was

taken by Mr Fraser and there was very little questioning

of the Officers giving the evidence.     I believe that in

each instance the evidence as given in Court by the

Officers was a fair and accurate statement of the

evidence then available.



Criticism (2)



This is in effect the same criticism as in (1) above.



Criticism (3)



The responsible and relevant expert medical evidence

available to me from pathologists of high renown which

had not at any stage been challenged during that part of

the Inquests held in April and May 1990 was

overwhelmingly to the effect that each of the 95 victims

were dead or had suffered irreversible injury by 3.15pm.

Where appropriate, the pathologists were invited to

consider lay evidence relevant to each particular case.

At no time did the pathologists alter their opinions.
                            - 22 -


My task was to call relevant evidence to put before the

jury.     In the light of the unchallenged expert testimony

of the pathologists, there was nothing that could have

been done by way of medical or rescue intervention that

would have had any impact upon the cause of death.



I set out in the exhibit my comments upon the evidence of

Dr Burns.



Criticism (4)



I did not call either Dr Ashton or Dr Phillips.      I

considered the statements from both of these doctors.         In

the light of the uncontested pathological evidence I did

not consider their evidence to be relevant to the issue

of "How" in any of the 95 Inquests.      I had noted that

Dr Ashton and Dr Phillips had both given oral evidence to

the Taylor Inquiry.     I had read the Interim report in

particular paragraphs 296 to 298.      They provided as

follows:



        "No Fault by the Emergency Services

     298.     I say at the outset of this chapter that no

     valid criticism can be made of the response by the

     St Johns Ambulance Brigade by SYMAS or by the Fire

     Brigade on the 15th April.      Indeed, no represented

    party ventured any criticism of them.      The only

    attack on SYMAS came from 2 Liverpool doctors. One
                      - 23 -


claimed that ambulances did not arrive swiftly or

with sufficient equipment and that there was a lack

of triage.    He was proved to be wrong in all 3

respects.    Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on

television on 15th April when he said more lives

could have been saved if staff and equipment had

arrived earlier.   Apart from being proved wrong in

fact as to the time of arrival of ambulances, he

conceded in evidence that it was not possible to say

whether lives could have been saved.     His comments

on television were irresponsible.   The other doctor

complained of the absence of defibrillators.     I am

satisfied on the overwhelming evidence that to

attempt to use a defibrillator on the pitch with

people milling about would have been highly

dangerous owing to the risk of injury from the

electric charge.



297.   I find that all 3 of the emergency services

named above responded promptly when alerted, that

they brought appropriate equipment and that their

personnel operated efficiently.



298.   It would be unreasonable to expect, at any

sports stadium, medical facilities capable of

dealing with a major disaster such as occurred.      To

have in advance at the ground, oxygen,

resuscitators, stretchers, other equipment and

medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100

casualties is not practicable."
At paragraph 301 the Report said:

       "There was insufficiently close co-operation between

       the Police and the emergency services.   It is clear

       that SYMAS and the Fire Brigade should have been

       called earlier than they were.   However, in view of

       the nature and extent of the crushing, the time when

       Police rescue began and the pathetically short

       period for which those unable to breathe could

       survive, it is improbable that quicker recourse to

       the emergency services would have saved more lives."



I was aware that Dr Phillips and Dr Ashton were the

doctors concerned in the observations made in paragraph
296.



I emphasise, however, that it was my opinion on relevance

based upon the unchallenged and overwhelming pathological

evidence which influenced my decision.



After the morning of the 19th November 1990 Mr King made

no further application with respect to Dr Phillips or

Dr Ashton.   I received letters from Mrs McBrien and

Mr Jones asking me to call these doctors.



For the reasons above I decided against this course.
                                - 25 -


    Criticism (5)



    Again, this criticism is really a repeat of the point

    made in (3) above.



    Criticism (6)



    On the relevant evidence that I had led I directed the

    jury upon the verdicts that were in my opinion open to

    them.     I had invited and obtained legal submissions from

    all interested parties.     I have indicated in paragraph 23

    above what submissions were made to me and how I directed

    the jury.



    Criticism (7)



    I am confident that the evidence given in Court was an

    accurate and a fair summary on the evidence then

    available.



25. With respect to the matters exhibited to Jeremy

    Hawthorn's second Affidavit sworn on the

    11th September 1992, then I comment as follows:



    1.      At the time I gave an interview to the makers of the

            television programme, I had retired from the office

            of Her Majesty's Coroner.    However, the transcript

            accurately sets out certain of my answers (plainly

            with editing not all of the information I have was

            broadcast).
                                 - 26 -




    2.      However, I confirm that the views I expressed in

            those interviews represented my opinion.



    3.      I have read and considered the 6 page report of the

            well known pathologist, Dr Iain West, dated

            20th August 1992.   He is an eminent man in his field

            - but then so is Professor Usher and so are Doctors

            Clark and Slater and other pathologists.   Professor

            Usher had held the post of Home Office Pathologist

            for South Yorkshire and East Midlands for 25 years,

            he had conducted approximately 27,000 post mortems,

            700 murder investigations and has had professionally

            examined 40 to 50 cases of traumatic asphyxia*     In

            certain instances Dr West expresses a different view

            or opinion to the pathologists who gave evidence at

            the Inquest.   He was not present at Hillsborough,

            has seen none of the bodies, he carried out none of

            the post mortems and has not seen the post mortem

            photographs.   For my part, I can see no reason to

            prefer Dr West's opinion to the evidence given by

            the pathologists who carried out the autopsies.

                            AFFIDAVIT




I SARAH PIMLOTT, a Solicitor of the Supreme Court, MAKE OATH

AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:



       I am employed by Sheffield City Council in the Legal

       Department.    For the purpose of this application for

       Judicial Review,     I am acting as the Solicitor for Dr

       Stefan Popper.     Save as otherwise indicated I make

       this Affidavit from matters within my own knowledge or

       from documents within my control.
                             - 2 -




     I make this Affidavit in order to bring to the notice

     of the Court certain factual matters that have

     occurred since the Inquest jury returned its verdicts

     on the 28 March 1991.



3.   The relevant chronology so far as the Coroner's Office

     is concerned is as follows:



            28.3.91:   95 verdicts.

            15.4.92:   Memorial on behalf of 6 Applicants

           sent to the Attorney General.

           May 1992:   Coroner's Office notified of

           approach to Attorney General.

           5.5.92:     Form 86A issued and first Affidavit

           of Jeremy Hawthorn with exhibits containing the

           Memorial itself and 2 bundles of evidence —

           Appendices 1 and 2 to the Memorial.

           15.5.92:    Ex parte application for leave to

           move for Judicial Review heard by May J.

           Adjourned pending application to Attorney

           General and for service on relevant parties.

           2.6.92:     Coroner's office served with Form

           8 6 A and Affidavit and exhibit.

           3.6.92:     Applicants served further material

           upon Attorney General.

           18.8.92:    Attorney General refused fiat.

           11.9.92:    Second Affidavit of Jeremy Hawthorn
                              - 3 -



            with exhibits relating to an extract from a

            television programme broadcast on 4 March 1992,

            a report from Dr Ian West dated 20.8.92 and a

            chronology prepared from the Applicants'

            viewpoint.

            March 1993: Notification of restored date for

            application for leave.

            6.4.93:      Applicants obtain leave before

            McPherson J.

            28.4.93:     The City Solicitor receives (in

            addition to material already received by the

            Coroner's office) the Notice of Motion and the

            Order of the 6 April 1993 and the Affidavit

            sworn on the 11 September 1992.



4.   I am advised by Counsel that all matters of argument

     are properly to be addressed at the hearing.      However,

     as to fact, it is plain that it is now well over 4

     years since the tragedy itself and over 2 years since

     the verdicts were returned.      The initial application

     was nearly 14 months after the verdicts.     Whatever the

     reasons for the delay, it cannot now be in the public

     interest for decisions made in 1990 and 1991 to be re­

     examined.   All the Applicants were legally represented

     at the Inquests.    Indeed, before the verdicts were

     returned Dr Popper was informed (by Mr and Mrs Jones

     in a letter dated the 12 February 1991) that if he

     failed to call Doctors Phillips and Ashton this would
       form part of a case for Judicial Review irrespective

       of the verdict.



5.    On the 18 August 1992 the Attorney General refused to

       give his fiat for an application under Section 13 of

       the Coroner's Act 1988.     In part, the letter provided

              "The Law Officers have considered the matter
              very carefully but they have come to the
              conclusion that there is nothing which would
              justify authorising an application to the High
              Court for a new Inquest in any of the above
              cases.

              They have reached this decision on the grounds
              that the application would have no reasonable
              prospect of establishing that it is necessary
              or desirable in the interests of justice for a
              fresh Inquest to be held."

6.    Those observations apply with equal force to the

       present application.



7.     From enquiries I have been able to make, I am aware

       that the civil proceedings have all now been

       compromised and that all Police disciplinary

       proceedings have been concluded.    Insofar as I am

       aware now, over 4 years after the tragedy, there are

       no extant judicial proceedings other than this

       application for review.

Home Secretary


HILLSBOROUGH: MEETING WITH LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH


I attach for the meeting at 5pm:

           (i)         Terms of reference. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has a copy from my
                       meeting with him on Friday.

           (ii)        A note of the key issues which his examination would have to address.
                       I have explained to him the main areas for consideration (essentially
                       the headings in that note). You may want to mention some.of the key
                       issues to reassure him that there are real issues of substance to be
                       answered.




                                                p

                                            PAUL PUGH




                                                                             23
                                                                                  iE   CREMY

To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:


       (a)    To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


       (b)    To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General
       for   the   purpose     of     discharging   their   respective   statutory
       responsibilities; or


       (c)    To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to
       police disciplinary matters;


And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available
is of such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State
for the Home Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and
(c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously considered by them
which which may be relevant to their respective duties; and to advise
whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public interest.
MAIN ISSUES RAISED IN RECENT REPRESENTATIONS



1.         Video evidence

                       Was all the video evidence which is now available considered by the
                        Taylor inquiry and the inquest?


                       Was police video evidence deliberately withheld, or was a misleading
                        account given by the police witnesses of the significance of that
                       evidence?


                       Was evidence from the club’s technician about the operation of the
                       video cameras covered up?


                       Were the inquest jury deliberately shown poor quality video evidence?


                       Some videotapes went missing on the night of the disaster:        is the
                        material now produced by Granada and the families this missing
                       evidence?


                        If any of those allegations are true, would the evidence have made any
                       material difference?


2.         Medical Evidence


                        Is there new medical evidence that some of the victims were alive after
                       3.15pm?


                       Was medical evidence concealed from the inquest?


                        Does this evidence provide any grounds for questioning the coroner’s
                       findings?



f:\oppu\hou\shortsub\pp0248pd.doc
3.          Police cover-up


                        Is there anything to suggest that the West Midlands Police (who
                        investigated on behalf of the coroner and the Police Complaints
                        Authority) were biased or selective in presenting their findings?


4.          Ten allegedly unresolved questions


                        Granada suggested there were 10 unresolved questions (attached)
                        about police handling of the disaster: can we be satisfied that all those
                        questions were fully addressed by the Taylor inquiry?

    M y was Chief Superintendent tevid Ouckenfleld put In charge of a major
    aani-flml cnly ZL days before the game, when he m b s relatively
    inexperienced at policing matches?

1   Mole 1-2, Duckenfield 3-4, Jackson 5-6



    Why were there no barriers or ccrdons to filter the crowd and prevent a
     build up outside the Leppings Lane end of the grand if, as the flans


2   insist, there were the previous year?

    Duckenfield 7-H, Jackson 12-13, Marshall 14-15


    V*y was the game not delayed, as a number of police officers thought it
    fihnild have been, when it became obvious that it would not be possible to

3   get all the Liverpool fens safely into the grand befcre the 3 pm kick-
    off?
    Duckenfield 16-31, Murray 32-39, Bichard 40-41_________ ____________


    v *y didn't police recognise overcrowding cn the Leppings Lane terrace
    v*en eye witnesses, including football cuunentatcr Jcfan ttrtscn, were

4   aware of the problems fifteen minutes before kick-off?
    Duckenfield 42-52



    Vfty wasn't the tunnel leading to the central pens closed *taen they became
      full, the procedure adopted at the previous year's Semi-Final?

5   Duckenfield 53-66, Crawford 67-77, Marshall 78-79



    Why did Chief Superintendent Duckenfield mislead the Secretary of the PA
    fcy telling him that fans had forced open Gate C, vten the officer knew he

6   had given the order for it to be opened?

    Duckenfield 80-92, Murray 93-95, Crawford 96, Bichard 97-101,
    Jackscn 102-103

    Why did it take $ an hour after the first crushing began to pull d o m the
    10 foot spiked fence %&ich trapped the fans, and why were the gates tfcich

7   led an to the pitch too small to be effective in an emergency evacuation?
    Duckenfield 104-108, Seaman 109-115, Hopkins 116-118, Eastwood 119-125,
    Murray 126-129, Taylor 127, Bichard 130/1, Jackson 132/4, Calvert 135-137


    M y was no public address announcement made - either informing the fans
    as to wbat was happening, asking far their help ar for any medical
    persomel at the ground to help - until 3-30 pm?
    Duckenfield 138-143, Jackson 144-148



    Why, tten 42 ambulances reached the grand, did mere not get an to the
    pitch itoere the dying and severely injured were in urgent need of trained

9   medical help?
    SYMAS 149, Hopkins 150-152, Higgins 153-154, Eason 155-156

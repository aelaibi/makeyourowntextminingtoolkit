Hear Mr Whalley

HELtSBCROOGH INVESTIGATION

When we met at the Home Office on Wednesday 18 October, I told you that I had
been approached by the Association of Chief Police Officers who have asked me
to attend a Working Group meeting in Manchester on 11 December 1989. A copy of
the letter I received is attached.

Apparently this Working Group is researching the implications of Recommendation
21 from Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report which is concerned with the use of
CCTV to observe crowd densities at football matches. I have explained to ACC
George what HSE's role was in the Inquiry and the topics which we were askedto
address and that, although we used CCTV film for our analysis, I am not an
expert in such matters.

He understood my misgivings but thought that our experience in the
investigation could be useful to his group. I therefore      have agreed to attend
a meeting. Should youor ACC Mervyn Jones, to whom this letter is copied,
consider that my attendance could in any way influence the inquiry or any
possible criminal proceedings, please let roe know and I will inform ACC George.

Yours sincerely




DR C E NICHOLSON
Deputy Director - Safety Engineering Laboratory 1

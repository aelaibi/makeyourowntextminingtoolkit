                              “When Lord Hesketh argued that Wales should be

                              for making some fine points. I wish to elaborate on

                              in the Bill. Conservative Members must realise that
                              it is nonsense to include Wales if Scotland is
                              excluded. That must have been done for some
                              administrative purpose or because it would have
                              meant extra legislation.”

               I am       presently unemp l o y e d      having    been    prev i o u s l y employed    by



                 or the      past 5 years         I have also worked         part   time as a turnstile

               On S a t u r d ay    the    15th April     1989,    <l60489>,     I was working at            the ground

               in the       capacity of turnstile           operator      having    received my posting           from

               staff at the g r o u n d .          I went   to my a l l o c a t e d t u r nstile at the S piyn

               Kop end       it was one of the           turnstiles       in the block       numbered

               can't       remember       exactly which one        it was.I     was set      up and work / n g    by

               about       12 noon.       On this day the S pion Kop end was occupied

                                                                                                              S 1610

              N o t t i n g h a m Forest S u p p o r te rs .T h e match was      the FA cup semi       final

              between N o t t i n g h am Forest and Liverpool                 Football    Clubs.   To start with

              there was       just a very        steady flow of suppo r t e r s          through my turnstile

              however       at about 2.3 0       pm there was an           increase      in numbers.

              S t a nding    on my turnstile were two                police officers,       these officers        were

              engaged       in stopping    u na u t h o r i s e d access      to the ground and        in searching

              persons       on entry.

              However       when the two       po 1 i c^'tSTfTc'ers were        dealing with people           trying
                                                   /?

          a nd       into the ground.

              I had    previously been           told not       toHeal wit h     persons jumping        the

              turnstil e      but just    to     leave   them.

              I was a p p ro ac he d by man y       people who         offered me money to let           them    into

                    ilable    to those with tickets,                there was    no facility for monies           to

                   get    into    the ground without a ticket              if they were successful                 they

             ^     officers.       However        some fans    that    o b viously had been drinking                because

                   I could smell alcohol             on their      breath were a l l o w e d       into the       ground.

             - All        these fans were         sober    despite     the drink.

                  At about 2.55           pm or 3 pm at the         latest    I was       told to close my

                    u rnstile      this was unusual         and    I gathered that         something was           not    right,

                     t 0 o k my tickets       down to the         collecting a rea and           I became aware           of

                   the    problems at the Leppi n g s Lane End.                I then took          it upon myself             to

                  go across       the     pitch to help       people    in the L e p p i n g s Lane End.

                   It was    now about 3.1 0         pm on arrival       at the L e p pings Lane end the                  scene

                  was     chaotic.        People were      climbing     the fence     Wng        on the     pitch and

                  around     the goal area.           To gether w i t h others/I          took     hold of one       of the

                   dead.

                   The    next    person    I dealt with was a white male,                 aged about        11— 14 years

          the gym.

          On    returning      to the L e p pings Lane          I assisted      /everal       other       injured

          people      but    I cannot    remember m uch about           the)

          One was a large heavily built white w oman a p p r o x i m a t e l y 30 years                              of

          age,   wearing       jeans and a Liverpool             shirt,      scarf and       flat     cap.    She         was

          a c c o m p a n i e d by a male who     I think was         her    b o yfriend     or husband she               was

          conscious and         complaining       of stomach and            chest   pains.       We took       her

          to the tunnel         by the    gym and       left her there.

          M l about 3.20 pm while walking back to the L e p pings                            Lane End from the

          gym    I spoke      to a gateman                             who    on the day was acting

          steward,      and was a cc or d i n g l y wearing a stewards               bib.      He told me that

          he had been threa t e n e d by Liverpool                fans while        he was ass i s t i n g       the

          injured.          He said they were          blaming    the stewards         for the disaster.

          I also      saw a P o l ic em an a s s isting        an injured      person at the           time

          N o t t i n g h a m Forest S up p o r t e r s were    tafunting the Liverpool              supporters

          Forest      fans.     The   policeman broker -down and stated that he couldn't

          take much more of this             behaviour.

          It was      f inally about 6 pm that               I left the ground and            returned home.

          For e s t   on that    occasion       I w a s ponded several          tickets       by supporters who
          had no one to give            them to,       amd    I was   told to give         them free       to any

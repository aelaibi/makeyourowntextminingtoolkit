              TAYLOR REPORT S        HOME SECRETARY’S STATEMENT



    The Home Secretary was very grateful for the comments o£
the Prime Minister as set out in your letter this morning and
those of the Chief Secretary, recorded in Carys Evans' letter.

   I attach a redraft which the Home Secretary has now
prepared in consultation with the Minister for Sport and
which, as you will see, picks up nearly all of your comments.
The peroration, is somewhat longer than before since the H<?m$
Secretary took the view, on reconsideration,                                 that the original
draft ended too abruptly.

    Copies of this go to those who received cnpiss of my
letter of 25 January.

                                       29 JANUARY 1990

 LIKE       TO             MAKE             A        STATEMENT              ABOUT     THE

 PINAL REPORT OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S

I   AM    MOST      GRATEFUL                          TO           LORD    JUSTICE

Taylor for the Report,                                     which sets out

CLEARLY      WHY WE HAVE HAD                                  SO MANY           MAJOR

TRAGEDIES AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS OVER THE

YEARS     AND      WHY         WE           HAVE                   HAD     DISORDER

AND      HOOLIGANISM.                                  AS            THE        HOUSE
FAMILIARISES            ITSELF                   WITH               THE     REPORT,

IT WILL          BECOME                  CLEAR                     THAT     IT         IS
ADDRESSED         AS         MUCH                TO            THE         FOOTBALL

INDUSTRY AS             IT      IS TO THE GOVERNMENT.

Lo r d   Ju s t i c e     Ta y l o r                  explains              HOW        IN

HIS INTERIM REPORT HE CONCENTRATED ON

OVERCROWDING               BECAUSE                         THAT           WAS       THE

CAUSE      OF    THE          HILLSBOROUGH                                DISASTER,

BUT NOW HE GOES ON TO TALK OF A GAME,
THE      IMAGE OF WHICH                 HAS BEEN MUCH

TARNISHED,          AND         OF    A    BLIGHT         OVER       THE

GAME       DUE           TO       OLD          GROUNDS,            POOR

FACILITIES,               HOOLIGANISM,                   EXCESSIVE
DRINKING AND POOR LEADERSHIP.



Lo r d    Ju s t i c e        Ta y l o r       does    not       spare

THOSE WHO RUN THE                     INDUSTRY.                H e SAYS

INDEED       THAT        THE         PROVISION          THEY       MAKE

FOR      THEIR           CUSTOMERS              IS     OFTEN         NOT

MERELY       BASIC            BUT      SQUALID,                AND     HE

SAYS THAT SQUALID CONDITIONS CAN HAVE

AN IMPACT ON SAFETY AND THAT IN HIS
VIEW THEY ALSO LEAD TO LOWER STANDARDS

OF BEHAVIOUR.



                                    /L o r d    Ju s t i c e    Ta y l o r
    Lo r d       Ju s t i c e     Ta y l o r      says       that      the


    Fo o t b a l l       As s o c i a t i o n      and        Fo o t b a l l

    Le a g u e     have         not    seen       it    as   any     part


    OF    THEIR         DUTY          TO   OFFER        GUIDANCE        TO

CLUBS             ON      SAFETY            MATTERS,          AND       HE

QUESTIONS                WHETHER            THE        DIRECTORS        OF

MANY CLUBS               ARE      GENUINELY            INTERESTED IN

THE WELFARE OF THEIR OWN SUPPORTERS OR

THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOUR.                           PLAYERS TOO ARE

CRITICISED)                WITH        LORD       JUSTICE       TAYLOR

POINTING OUT THAT INCITEMENT FROM THE

PITCH            OR    BAD        BEHAVIOUR            BY    PLAYERS,

WHICH        IS NOT             CONFINED TO SOCCER,                  HAS

A     MAJOR           INFLUENCE            ON   THE      CROWD.          I

ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME CLUBS HAVE MADE

AN    EFFORT      TO     IMPROVE       STANDARDS,     BUT

Lo r d J u s t i c e T a y l o r 's   clear   conclusion

was     that     the       majority had        not   and


THAT THE GAME              ONLYHAS A FUTURE IF
THE     DIRECTORS          AND THE       PLAYERS
                                          t
                                                      CAN

CHANGE THEIR OWN PRIORITIES                    AND   GIVE

A LEADERSHIP WHICH IS PLAINLY LACKING

AT PRESENT.


HE    AGREES       WITH      THE      GOVERNMENT     THAT

THERE MUST BE               A   MOVE TOWARDS         ALL-

SEATER       STADIA        AND POINTS         OUT    THAT

SECTION 11 OF THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS
Act        specifically                provides       the

MACHINERY        FOR THIS.             THE CHANGE WILL

about.        Lo r d        Ju s t i c e     Ta y l o r        makes

CLEAR THAT THE BULK OF
THE    FINANCES        FOR      GROUND          IMPROVEMENTS

WILL   HAVE     TO     BE     RAISED         BY    THE         CLUBS

THEMSELVES.            He     SAYS         THERE     ARE WAYS

OF    RAISING    THE         MONEY         IF     THE     CLUBS *

MANAGEMENT             IS        ENTERPRISING                   AND

RESOURCEFUL          AND HE           POINTS            TO      THE
OPPORTUNITIES                     PRESENTED                      BY
SPONSORSHIP.           He      ALSO        POINTS         TO    THE

REVENUE   THAT         FLOWS        TO      THE      FOOTBALL

AUTHORITIES     FOR TELEVISION RIGHTS AND

SAYS THAT THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES

POSSIBILITY OF A LEVY ON TRANSFER FEES

WHICH       HE       SAYS    HAVE     REACHED     A     LEVEL

WHICH MANY REGARD AS GROTESQUE.

OF PROPOSALS RELATING TO CROWD CONTROL

REMINDS       US THAT,        WITHOUT THE WORK OF

  OFFENCES SUGGESTED DO TO SOME EXTENT
  SEEM       TO    DUPLICATE            OFFENCES      WHICH       ARE

 ALREADY AVAILABLE IN THE PUBLIC ORDER

 Act.        But I shall                look carefully and

 QUICKLY AT ALL THESE SUGGESTIONS.


I NOW        COME        TO    THE      PROPOSED        FOOTBALL

Membership               Sc h e m e .        Lo r d     Ju s t i c e

BY    THE       CONSULTANTS                EMPLOYED         BY   THE

FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES.                        He CAME TO THE

CONCLUSION            THAT     HE COULD NOT SUPPORT
A    SCHEME OF          THAT KIND BECAUSE HE DID

NOT BELIEVE THE TECHNOLOGY MOULD WORK

WELL      ENOUGH         TO     AVOID        THE      DANGER          OF
CONGESTION AND DISORDER.                           HE WAS ALSO
CONCERNED            ABOUT       THE        CALL      ON     POLICE

resources.               In s t e a d h e p r o p o s e s         the

MEASURES TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED.



IN     THE       LIGHT        OF     THIS         ADVICE,         THE

Go v e r n m e n t    have    decided        not      to    proceed

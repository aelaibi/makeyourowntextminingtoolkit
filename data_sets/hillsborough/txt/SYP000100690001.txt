              On Saturday                 15 A p r i l ,      1989      (150489)        I paraded          for      duty     at     Doncaster

              DHQ        at    0830       hours.           I was       a member        of    serial       no.     28,    which       was

              supervised                by P S 2 4 0 8       Wilson       f r o m A'1.

              Our        d u t y as       a    serial       was    to w o r k     in L e p p i n g s      L a ne,    Sheffield            manning

              the        barriers             which were          placed       across        side    roads        along      Leppings           Lane

              to     prevent            persons        attending          th e    Notts.          Forest     v.     Liverpool            football

              match           from      entering           the    side    streets           around     the       s t a d i u m at

              Hillsborough                    and   so a n n o y i n g    the     residents          or    causing          damage.

               I had          been      detailed           to w o r k    with     PC 2 6 4 4 R o b e r t s ,        f r o m A1,      at    the

               location Leppings                      Lane       junction Farndale                 Road.

               Inspector             Selwood          of    *E*    Division        had       overall       command          of    ou r    sector.

              After           the    briefing          at H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m w e        made       our    way     to    our

               point          and    at       about    1145       hours    placed           the    barriers         across        the     mouth       of

               the       road.

              At     this        time         there    were       persons        who    were       obviously          attending           the

               match          in L e p p i n g s      Lane       but    they     were       well    behaved and             not     large        in

               numbe rs .

              Neither            myself         nor PC        Roberts      had a        radio       and    to     the    best       of    my

               knowledge             only PS Wilson                had a       radio        within     our       serial.

              By     about          1230 hours             large       numbers     of       persons were            walking         down

                     4                                                                                       «
    Leppings           Lane     towards         th e      stadium.           At    t his         time       it w a s         apparent          that

    large       amounts         of    alcohol          were      being       consumed.                 I saw        many       persons

    carrying           bags,       packs       and     bottles         of    alcohol.                 It w a s      a    sight        t hat

    caused        me    to     feel      uneasy.           I would          not    like          to    estimate              the    number          of

    people        who     were       drinking          from £         Itr    bottles             as    well        as    carrying             other

    full     ones       with       them.        I would          say       that    from where                 I was          standing          to

    the    stadium           g ate    would         have     been a walk               of    only 3           to A m i n u t e s ,            which

    in m y      view meant            that      unless          they       were    going          to     surrender             the       drink

    at    the     stadium          gates,       people          were       going       to    consume           vast          amounts          of

    alcohol        in a v e r y          short       space       of    time       and       at    t his       time       I feared             for

    what     may       ens u e ,     although          the      scale       of    what       was       to     follow          did     not

    cross       m y mind.

    Some     of    the       crowd       began       to    drift       back       from       the       stadium and                 I recall

    being       asked        for     directions            to    pubs       and    clubs          nearby,           many       of     those

    who    asked        for     directions             already         smelled          strongly              of    alcohol           and      s ome

    were     warned          t hat    should         they       drink       any    more          they       would        most       likely          be

    refused        admission             to    the     game.

    One    group        in     particular            stands       ou t      in m y m i n d            having        asked          for


$   directions            to    the      "Club       that       put    on    scran and                beer     for       us    last       tim e " .

    Leppings           Lane     by t h i s      time       was    a mass          of    persons,              no    doubt          most       had

    tickets        but       many     had      not     and      kept       asking       me       if    I knew           where       they

    could       get     one     and      sales       of    tickets          were       obviously              taking          place       with

    large       crowds         guickly         gathering          around          anyone          who       had     tickets           for      sale.




                          and      the     lady      from       the    house       came          out     to    us       to    t ell      us    that

    in    the     pa st      she     had      had    problems          with       persons             u r i n a t i n g _______________

    kept     making          repeated          complaints             to    us    about          this       occurring.                Both

    myself        a n d PC R o b e r t s        turned          from       our    point          to w a t c h       for       any     such

    occurrences              but     did      not    see     this      happening.

By     2.00       pm    (1400)          Leppings          Lane          was    full        and      the       wall       of    the

house        I    have       just       referred          to       was       full     of      people          drinking             from

cans/bottles                 like       alcohol          w as      going       ou t      of       fashion,          as    was        the

                                                 opposite.

Some        time       just       after       after       2.00          pm    (1400)          I wa s       detailed            by     a

Chief        Inspector,              who      I did       not       know,       to       go       and     stand

                             behind        the      lady's          garden          to     stop         persons          urinating

                         that        I have         already             mentioned.

I did        feel       that       this       was    unnecessary                because             with        t he     sheer

volume           of    persons,          many,       many          of    whom       were          well     intoxicated,                   a

PC     on    his       own    wa s      vulnerable              and      again        even         more       so    without           a

radio        and       the    crowds          were       so     m a s s e d that           had      an     officer            g ot

into        trouble          no    one     would         have       been       able        to      se e    the      fact       and

react        accordingly.                  What      further             made       this          exercise          seem

pointless              was    that       the      lady        who       wasdoing           all      the       complaining

must        have       h a d to      have      been        wat ching from                  her      roof        top,      because

had     anyone          been       urinating                                        they          would       have       had       their

back        to    her    house          and    were       shielded             from        her      house          windows           by




During           the    time       to    now     the      only          contact          we       had     was      supervisory

officers              paying       what       visits          they       could        and         having        a quick            chat

At     what       I    would       estimate          to       be    perhaps           2.30         (1430)          to    2.35

(1435)           there       was     a lull         in    the       crowds          and       I    left       the

and     reformed             PC    Roberts          in    Farndale             Road.

At     about          2.45    pm     (1445)         Leppings             Lane       became          sheer          hell       as

hoards           of    drunken          mindless           'fans*            arrived          from        nowhere         heading

fo r    the       Leppings           Lane      end       of     the      ground.              There        is      no    doubt        in

my     mind       that       of    the     perhaps            2-3       thousand           people          who      appeared

from        nowhere,          90     per      cent       were       drunk       and        well         so.        I did       no t

have        a radio          and     could       not      advise             Ground        Control            of    the

approach         of      these           fans.

The    crowds         who       were       now       filling          t he      area        were       truly         unruly             and

behaving         in      a disgraceful                    manner,          when        I tried           to     warn       several

persons        as     to    their          state,          the       st a n d a r d       reply        was      "Fuck          off"

and    had     an     arrest             tried       to    be    mad e I have                  no     doubt      a    serious

public        order        situation             would          have       arisen.

During        this       period           I do       honestly             feel       that       the      officers              in

Leppings         Lane       were          at    great       risk          from       the       mob     who      were       filling

the    road.

Some    of     the       elderly           people          from       Farndale              Road       were      standing

behind       the      barriers             watching             the       mob    and        their        comments              were          of

disgust        that        so       called       football             f ans      could          b e h ave       in    such          a

manner.          The       general             behaviour             of    these          people        made         me    feel

ashamed        to     think          that       should          they       follow           their        team        abroad             we

may    all     in     England             be    judged          by    their          actions           and      behaviour,

At    kick     off       time        the       road       was        still       a mass           of p e o p l e      but       we       had

been    instructed                  to    take       meals           in   ones         at      this time         so       PC

Roberts        set       off        for    Claywheels                Lane       to     have         hi s m e a l .

He    had    been        g one       some       5 minutes             when       seve ral             transit         loads             of

officers         went       al o n g       Leppings             Lane       t o w a r ds        the     ground         and       PC

Roberts        r e a p p e a r ed.             I asked          him       why    he       had       come      back        and       he

was    under        the     im p r e s s i o n        that       there          wa s      a fight          at    the       ground,

We    stayed        at     out       point       as       some       In s pe c to r had               told      PC    Roberts                to

do    so.

Shortly        after            this       an    elderly resident                         of    the a r e a c a m e            t o us

and    told      us      that        she       had    just           heard       on       the       r a d i o that som          e one

had    been      killed             at    the    ground.

The    next      thing          I    saw       was    emergency              service            vehicles             of    al l

types       he a d i n g    into          Leppings          Lane          towards           the       ground,             With          the

lack    of     communications,                       it    was       a case          of     follow         the       last       order

so    PC    Roberts            and      myself          stayed           on    our     point.            The       old     lady

then        reappeared                 and said       that         she    had         just       put    her        TV    on a n d

that        several            people were            dead         in        w h a t she     thought           had       been         a

pitch       invasion.

It    was       then       that        people        began         to     walk        up    Leppings           Lane        away

from       the       ground        in m a s s         numbers            and     some       of    them        at    first

stopped          to     t e ll     us       what     had      happened.                But       within        a    few       minutes

of    this       the       mood        of    th e    crowd         had        become        very       aggressive.                    Both

of    us    were        spit       upon       and      verbally               abused,        some        wanted          to    fight

with        us       but     commonsense              dictated               t h a t we     stood        our       ground         and

prevented             them        from ent ering                 the         side roads.               Of     those        who        spit

and    abused           us      we      did    n ot       answer         but       t r i e d to    assist           th e      genuine

fans       who       were       shocked           and      wanting            to    r ing home           to    inform          the            •

relatives             t ha t      they       were      s a f e.

It    must       have        cost       the       residents             of     Farndale           Road        a considerable

amount          of    money        in       allowing          genuinely               worried          fans        the     use        of

their       phone s .

At    one       stage        we    had       to     l et     a man        and      his      wife       who     wa s      pregnant

into       Farndale            Road         and     i nt o    one       of     the     houses          because           the

mindless             drunks        had       recognised             that        they        were       locals           with      the

shopping             they      were         carrying          and       were       badly         abusing           them.

Although             I ha d       reservations                at    the        earlier           stage        of    th e      day         I

felt       as    th e      crowd        left        the      ground           that     we    were        at    any       t i me

likely          to    be     assaulted.

The    worst          part        of    the       departing             crowd         for    me       wa s    when       a man

came       to    ae     and       said       he     had      not    been        able        to    find        his       young         son.

I had       to       tell       him      that       I had          no    radio        and could              not    directly

assist          him     in      c o n t a c t i n g the       ground,            he    was       at     first       and

understandably                    abusive           but      then       apologised               and     was       at    crying

point.           Fortunately                 there         was     a dog        van        over       the     road       and      I

took    him       to    th is    fo r    help        via     the       radio.

I    cannot       pass       comment        on      th e    following             points       because        I did       no t

see    or     t a ke   part      in     t h em.

1.     The       actions        of    the      stewards,              or    the a c t u a l    incident            and

       rescue          operation          in      the g r o u n d .

       fo r      us    no    communications                 at    all.

Eventually,             along        with      PC    Roberts,              when    all    w as     quiet      we    walked

with    PS       Pearson        from     A2      and       other       odd      officers,          whom      I do      not

know,       to    Claywheels            Lane        where        we    eventually             regrouped        and       were

transported             back     to     DHQ      dismissing                at   7.45     pm    ( 1 9 4 5).

                    I arrived             at       the    ground          at    about         3 . 0 5 pm W nd a l l              officers          immediately

                    went       into       the       ground,          at    this        stage        we    were         told       to    go    to    th e    L e p p i ng s

                    Lane       End.           We    had    no    i de a w h y.             On    entering              the       ground       I could           see

                    people          on    the       playing          area       a nd    the      players            were         just    stood       near          to

                    th e     players           tunnel.
On a r r i v i n g        at    the     fence         I immediately                 saw that            f an s     were        being

crushed          up a g a i n s t       the      fencing          at    the       f roj^i^iff the L e p p i n g s                 Lane

terraces.               I saw        that     the      gates       \o J^ile t e r r a c e s             were       open        and     there

was    a mass           of a r m s      and      legs,       bobbies           were        pulling           people        out       of    the

gate     o ne      at     a time,          there       were       about        four       bobbies            at    t he    gate.

I climbed            onto       the     fence         immediately              to    the      right          hand     side        of      the

s mall      g a te      which was           j us t     to    the       r i gh t     of    the      goal       as    you        look       from

the S p i o n        Kop       end    of    the       ground.
                                                                                  N IS S g
At    the     side        of me       on    the       fence       was     DC      l-^jbbaj^T            We    tried        to     help

people        over         the       t o p of     the f e n c e        but     at    this         stage        it w a s        near

impossible,                so we       tried          to get     th e    people          at     the      rear      of     the      terracing

to m o v e       back.          I could          clearly          see     t h at     there         was       r oo m at         the     back      of

the    terracing               for    people          to m o v e       back       but     one      or    two       just        put     two

fingered           signs        up a n d      shouted            abuse       towards          us.        Together              w i t h JDC

H u b b ^ r ^ y ^ ^ i e I p e d in the                region       of     eight          pe o p l e     over       the     f e n c e.        I

caught        them        and       helped       them       to    the     playing           area        of    the     field.              I laid

them     on      t he     ground and             returned          to     the       fence         to    help       others         over       the

fence.           I d i d not g i v e a n y o n e                 first       aid     as     other        people           were

administering                  first       aid    on    the       pitch.            I kept         returning              to    the       fence

to h e l p       people         over       the    fe n c e .       I noticed              that         everyone           who     c a me     over

the    fence         was       absolutely             sodden with              perspiration                  a n d t h e y all

appeared           to      collapse          in m y a r m s        with        relief         of       h a v i n g got      o u t f          the

crowd.

After       a while            I have       no    idea what             time        the     Fire        Bi^gaXe           attended           a nd     I

think       one      of    them       cut     the      fence       to m y         ri gh t.         I along with other

bobbies          forced         the     fence         open and many                 people         came       out     of       the     fence.

As    the     terracing              began       to    clear       a    little           I could          se e one        or     two       dead

people        on     the       terracing          in     front         of me,            t hi s    w a s the p o i n t          I had        been

stood       at     just        to    the    right       of       the    goal.

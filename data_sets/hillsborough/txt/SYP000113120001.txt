on,    ie heads and shoulders,                    in order      that     they    could     climb over          the

As    the a rea a ro u n d         this gate got          jammed, up with eager             supporters

w an ti ng     to help,          I went     to the gate        further     up the       track where        I

h el pe d PS Swift              and other     officers      pull    people out of the              crowd as

w it h the      previous          gate with some difficulty.

I then climbed              onto       the fence an d helped supporters                  climb over        this

fence.         I took       hold of a young          boy who was          passed to me by his

father.         I do not know what                happe ne d    to this     child's       father as       he was

lost a gain          in the       crushing       that was      still     going    on.     People were

shouting,           begg in g     for me     to help them but            I could not get          to them.

I looked a gain at                the    front    of the    terracing and noti ce d more                 people

had l a p s e d      into u n c o n s c i o u s n e s s and were        turning    blue     in colour.

After        a few minutes             of helping    people       climb* the fence          I deci de d to go

inti? the ter ra ci ng as a space                   had    cleared and try to help some                   of the

injured.            The    sight       that a w a it ed me as      I dropped down from the fence

was   horrifying,               there were       bodies    lying    everywhere          some   quite

o bv i ou s ly dead,            some    dying.

I i mm e di at el y went           to two males at          the    bottom of the          terracing,         one

in his       teens and one              in his e arly 30s.          The    older    of the       two Wets
barely alive              with a very faint,pulse and was making                   gurgling sounds.

I o pened his             a ir w a y and showed      A'   Liverpool       supporter how to keep            it

then noticed a senior                   officer and a sk ed him to get some medical

a t t e n t i o n onto      the   terraces        to w h ic h he replied. ,fWe        can't    get him out

here".        At this          time    this was     impossible as the gate was                still ;

b locked off by people                  going     through and the          fence was     about 9"        high.

1    left    these       two    fans    in the hands        of the young L iverpool            supporter

and    I went       to another         young      person    in his       teens who was      laid

a p p r o x i m a t e l y half way up the           terracing.           He had no pulse and wasn't

b reathing         but    had some       colour still        in his face,        so   I a t t e m p t e d m outh

to m outh         r es u s c i t a t i o n and heart mass ag e          but to no avail.

By now       people were          thinning        out and more          police o ff ic er s were     on the

scene and the m a i n             priority seemed to foe just                 get the    bodies     dead or

alive       out    of the terracing.               All    the time we were        being     helped by the

L i ve rpool       supporters.

One    thing       that     I noti ce d and        reflect       back onrwas     that at no time

w hilst      I was        on the terracing were            there any sign of expert                medical

attention          on     the terracing.            I imagine      they had too muc h to do w i t h

the fans          on the       pitch but    people        died    because    of this.

A fter a while we               cleared the        terraces       of the    bodies and then were

told to form a line along                   the first        line of barriers           from the wall.

We were       told this was            because: the        crowd were getting angry,               but    I did

nqt see a ny t h i n g         u nt ow ar d consid er in g        the    circumstances.

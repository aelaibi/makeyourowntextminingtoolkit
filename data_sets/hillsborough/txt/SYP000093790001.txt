              I am at present Detective     Inspector at Wood^eats P o l i ce Station where

              I have been posted since 20 November            1989 (201189),        On Saturday 15

             April   1989 (150489)   I was the Inspector         in Charge of the D Divisional

             Crime and Vandal Patrol



             Our duties were primarily one of public order patrols in the city

              centre of Sheffield in connection with the F.A. Cup semi-final                    between

              Liverpool and Nottingham Forest which was to take place at

             Hillsborough Football Ground that afternoon.



              The operation in my division had,        in fact commenced the previous day,

              Friday 14 April    1989 (140489) and my unit had undertaken public order

              duties from 6pm (1800)     concluding at 3am (0300) on Saturday 15 April
                                        C                               PAGE      2
                          ''             3-                             S3805

(130489),      The unit then returned to duty at West Bar Police Station

at 12 noon (1200) the same day.



During the course of the early afternoon we were engaged in our public

order duties and were deployed at the Sheffield Midland Railway

Station supervising the arrival of fans from both Liverpool and

Nottingham.      There were a significant number of fans arriving who

were   in possession of cans and bottles of alcohol and I instructed

officers under my command to take possession of such articles and

dispose of them.      This was done by the pouring of such liquids down

drains and in gutters.     Similarly there were a significant number of

fans who had obviously been drinking alcohol which could be smelled on

their breath but although we were aware of our powers in respect of

persons attending football fixtures under the influence of drink our

manpower would have been unacceptably depleted had we taken action

accordingly.



Fans were   "bussed’ to the ground from the railway station in

accordance with the previously arranged operation though many refused

to make use of this facility and opted to make their own way to the

g round.



We commenced patrol of the main routes to the ground as part of our

brief and as a result attended at the Wellington Public House       in

Shalesmoor, Sheffield, w here it was found that a large group of fans

were drinking alcohol,    numbering approximately 30 males.      This    public

house is some 30 minutes from the ground on foot and they were

therefore encouraged to make their way to the ground.         These persons

left the pub between 2pm (1400) and 2.15pm    (1413) and some were

persuaded to get on passing buses on route to the ground.         Some
                                                                      P AGL    3
                                                                      S3805

refused to pay a fare and the driver was persuaded to take them to the

ground at our request.      This was done,   firstly to prevent the further

consumption of alcohol and to ensure their early arrival at the

ground.     The majority of this group were the worse for drink but

could not be described as drunk.       Officers were posted on the bus to

prevent any incidents and monitor their arrival at the ground.



The remainder of my unit resumed general       patrol duties and at a time

just before 3pm (1500)     I decided to attend at the ground to collect

the officers who had been stranded at the ground after accompanying

the bus to the ground earlier.       We arrived at approx. 3.05pm     (1505)

and pulled up outside the ground in Penistone Road North.         I

immediately became aware that there was a problem in the ground owing

to the fact that I saw a number of uniformed officers hurriedly

entering the ground via the gate nearest to the Police room.           I

requested information from my own control at West Bar and was

requested to switch to the match channel which I did.         Indications

were that there was a public order problem at the Leppings Lane end of

the ground and the whole of my unit entered the ground and stood by

near to the Police room awaiting deployment.        After a short time we

were    requested to go into the central arena and form a cordon in front

of the North Stand which we immediately did along with other uniformed

officers.      I was unable to see exactly what was happening at the

Leppings Lane end but there was another uniform Inspector near to us

and I attempted to converse with him regarding the situation.           The

noise was deafening    inside the stadia and I was unable to hear any

radio    communications.    I saw several   persons being carried prostrate

from the Leppings Lane end by other fans.   I queried with the other
    Otoio
Inspector whether or not we should assist with these persons but was

informed that we were ordered to stand fast which we did.         The crowd
                                                                       PAGE     4
                                                                       S3805

in the stand appeared to be directing abuse and directions at us but

it was impossible to make out individual      remarks or comments.



I am unable to say exactly how long we were stood there forming the

cordon but after a short while the Inspector      informed me that we were

requested to return to the Police room to stand by as a reserve.           We

therefore withdrew to the Police    room amidst boos and cat calls from

the crowd in the stand.      It was still very confused at this stage and

I was still unaware of the true situation.



On arrival   in the area of the Police    room I saw a number of casualties

in the open on the ground who were being attended by civilian and

Police   personnel.   1 could not get into radio transmissions for
instructions nor was there any officer more senior to me available at

that point to whom I could refer.        We were being approached by

distressed fans and there is no doubt that at that stage we,         the

Police, were being blamed for the mayhem in some way but, we of

course could not understand why.      In the absence of instructions       I

decided that the officers    present should give what assistance they

could to the casualties and this included a number of officers from my

home division who had arrived at that point,        I then went in search

of a senior officer   in the gymnasium where    I saw Superintendent BATES

from my home division.      From this point I acted upon his instructions

in the gymnasium area in an effort to co-ordinate the rescue

operation,   directing volunteer doctors who arrived there.      There was

an acute shortage of medical equipment though small amounts of basic

items did arrive.



Officers were posted at entrances/exits to prevent unauthorised

persons entering and the gymnasium was divided into sections to accept
                                                                                      PAGE         5
                                                                                      S3805

the dead and injured.         The first sections soon became full with

bodies some who appeared dead or at least unconscious and efforts were

made to post an officer with each one for continuity purposes.                          It

occurred to me that a top priority was to establish that those persons

apparently dead were in fact so and 1 therefore                   commandeered Doctor

CURPEN to accompany me round each body to establish life extinct.                             1

mention this as I am aware that there has been an allegation at some

stage that persons were left for dead who might not have been so.                             As

far as I am concerned I can refute this categorically for the period 1

was    in the gymnasium,   and I saw the elimination of this possibility as

a first     priority.    None of the persons in the area reserved for the

dead were found to be alive by Dr CURPEN.



All these arrangements were made          initially in anticipation of eventual

organised procedures       in connection with Casualty Bureau and having

done so at 4.30pm       <1630) Superintendent BATES instructed me to gather

the remainder of my unit together and leave the ground to supervise

the dispersal     of fans from the area following the abandonment of the

Cj^fTlS n



We commenced foot patrol on Penistone Road North towards the city

centre and were called to Hillsborough Park where there was a report

of fighting.       Though no arrests were made ws were subject to verbal

abuse from young male fans and merely dispersed those present.



We then returned to the ground and obtained our transport and returned

to the area of Sheffield City Centre again to disperse fans                     leaving

the city.       3 of my officers had remained at the ground for duty in

connection with the accompanying of bodies.                     The remainder of the
                                          N 12.453
officers,     i nc 1udi ng my sergeant,   PS 1438 CARTER, were in my view

         shocked and visibly jaded.        I felt that the best course of action wa

         to try and obtain some rest and food as I knew that we were required

         for duty at least until 3 am (0300)      the following morning   in

         conjunction with the pre-arranged match operation on my division.                I

         was concerned that if they did not receive some rest and food that a

         combination of fatigue,      shock and hunger would have a devastating

         effect on their performance.        I therefore requested mealing

         arrangements via my own sub-divisional      control   room and we then took

         break at West Bar canteen.



         We later supervised the departure of fans from Sheffield Midland

         Station,   the last train leaving at approximately 8pm      (2000).      From

         thereon we continued public order duties      in the Sheffield city centre

         completing duty at 3am (0300) on Sunday 16 April        1989 (160489).



         I concede that the times      I have stated are approximate and can only

         explain that owing to the events of that day my last thought was to

         refer to my watch and note times though 1 believe that they are

         reasonably accurate.

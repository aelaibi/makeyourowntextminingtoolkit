Me     and               managed              to    stay         together            but       the       v as t    majority              of       the

we     waited       un til         the        surge        subsided             somewhat             and       then made                our       way    to

inside        the       ground          did        l see         anyone         drinking             alcohol,             nor       did       I

s ee    any       disorder.

I actually              got       to m y       seat        at     about         3.04       pm       (1504)         and      the         game       was       m

sat     down       I saw          that        we    were         all    there         except             for      Eric     and          Stan       who       had

foe,hind the L i v e r p o o l                 goal        was     very         crowded and                 soon         people           began         to

flimb o v e r           the       fence        anto        the     pit c h.           I thought                it wa s         a    pitch

i n vasion,         hooliganism                    and     1 think          the       Police             did also          as       they          were

trying        to    put       th e      people           b ac k    into         the       pens       so     the      match          could          carry

quite        normal          and       never        thought            anything            about           it.       At     no      time          during

th e    day was          I        injured           and       required           no m e d i c a l           assistance.                    i-or

sometime           after          t h is      match        had     been         stopped             we    didn't          know          what       was

happening,              but       I heard           on     someones             r a d io       t ha t     there          had       been       people

             because          we    weren't         sure     whether        or     not    the    match      had       been    cancelled

             happening             and    they      treated        the    whole      incident         as    a    crowd       disorder

             w d     happening            and      started        to    help.       If    they    had      reacted          earlier        more

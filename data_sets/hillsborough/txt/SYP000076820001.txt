w i th    I think a police               officer who           told us that                                           had

been      injured and was               in the       intensive         care     u / i.t at     the N o r t h e r n

General         Hospital       in S h e f f i e l d and that            haSs/parents had been told and

that      t h e y ha cl s a i d f or u s not            to g o    an d s e e h im b u t t o c o m e home.We

then      got a lift         in    a    police       van back          to the    boys     club,       and then we

got      back     in our     cars and went             home.

I w o u l d adci that         I was      not        injured at all          and     that      the fact        of the

perimeter          gates     not being          opened quickly              enough      in my opinion

contr i buted to the deaths                    and      i njuries       to some of the              peo p I e „

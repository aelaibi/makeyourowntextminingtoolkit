           I am a single person residing at the above address.



           On the afternoon of Saturday 15 April               1989 C15Q489)   I attended the FA

           Cup semi-final      football match between Liverpool and Nottingham

           Forest at the Hillsborough football ground in Sheffield.


                                                           /
           I attended as a L i v e rpool s u p p o r t e r /   I have supported Liverpool all

           my life now and regularly attend home matches at Anfield.



           I travelled to the game with the following people -

           1)

           2)

           3)
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 S3437

They have all been seen by the Police.



I was picked up by the others at Junction thirteen of the M5 motorway

at about eight thirty (0830)        on the morning.       We then travelled to

Coventry railway station where we picked up                              ,   We then

travelled to Sheffield via the M1.           We did not encounter any traffic

delays on the way.        We travelled directly to Sheffield not making any

stops.



I travelled to Sheffield without a match ticket, as did

               A friend of            had promised us two tickets and

arrangements had been made for us to meet                    friend at the

Grosvenor Hotel        in Sheffield to collect the tickets.



We arrived in Sheffield at about quarter to one             (1245) and parked on s

road near to the Freemasons Arms public house                   and          had used

that pub at the cor responding match last year.             I did not attend that

match last year.                   and myself then walked off towards

Sheffield,    leaving         at the Freemasons Arms.        We were    looking for

taxi to take us to the Grosvenor Hotel.           We eventually caught a taxi

and arrived at the Grosvenor Hotel at about one thirty.                 (1330)     I

remained outside while             went   inside and collected the tickets.

      came back with two tickets,         one of which was for the South Stand

and the other was for the Spion Hop end.           Both were Nottingham Forest

tickets.     I paid fifteen pounds for the Spion Hop ticket.              We then

returned to the c a r in the same taxi, and rejoined                   in the

Freemasons AijrK % .    We had a couple of pints in the pub and left at

about twenty five past two.         (1425)         had changed his ticket for

the South Stand with a person in the pub and he obtained a ticket for

the Leppings Lane standing.         Now             and         had tickets for

                                                                                 S3457

the Leppings Lane standing and I had the Spion Hop standing ticket.

We decided to carry on to the Leppings Lane end and see if I could use

my ticket there.



It took us about five minutes to walk to the ground.               During this time

I did not see any fighting or any other sort of disorder.                 There were

a couple of drunken supporters in the Freemasons Arms but I did not

see any drunkenness on the streets.           We did not receive any directions

from the Police on the way to the ground,           but we didn't really need

any as we knew the way to the ground.
                                                                                  *      ■

We arrived at the Leppings Lane turnstile area at about two t h i r t y ,

<1430)     It was very busy there at that time and the area between the

turnstiles and the outer gates was full with people.               There were no

orderly q u e u e s .   We joined the rear of the crowd intending to get to a

turnstile on the right hand side as you look from Leppings Lane.                      The

crowd wasn't moving at all.          There were a couple of mounted Policemen

who were trying to close the outer gates,           but to no avail.       I did not

see any stewards outside the turnstiles.            After about twenty minutes

or so, we got to within about five yards of a turnstile,              the one on

the entreme     right.     It was while we were there,       that I saw an opening

behind the turnstiles.          It was obvious to me that a gate had been

opened to relieve the pressure outside the ground, as it was getting

very bad.      I did not actually see the gate being opened,          I just saw it

open.    Myself                     then walked over to the open gate and

went    into the ^        i.   It w a s n ’t a mad rush, we just walked through.

We were three of the first people to enter the ground via the open

gate.    We had lost            outside the tu rnsti1e s .    I do not remember

seeing any unauthorised entry into the ground

Once   inside the ground we did not rush to get onto the terraces.            I

used the gents toilet and        was talking to someone he met         inside the

ground.     I did not see any fighting or any other disorder      inside the

ground,    neither did I see any drunkenness or any people drinking.              I

did not hand my ticket in to anybody upon entering the q r a o r t a     because

there was nobody at the gate to hand it to.          I did not/^ee any signs

indi cat ing how to get to the te r races .    All                central

tunnel that runs underneath the West Stand.          Everybody was using the

tunnel and it seemed the obvious way of entering the ground.             We were

standing about by the entrance to the tunnel when I looked through the

tunnel and could see that the match was about to kick off.             The ball

was on the centre spot and Liverpool were all         lined up ready for the          ^

start.     Having seen this, myself,          and     went along the tunnel

towards the terraces.                                             V.



We had a free passage along the tunnel,        not being impeded in anyway.

I do not remember seeing any Police or Stewards either at the entrance

to the tunnel or anywhere    inside    it.



At the end of the tunnel^ we went to the right hand side and into what

I now know as pen number three.        The match had just started as we

emerged from the tunnel.     It was very packed inside the pen.          As soon

as we entered the pen I felt compacted by the amount of people still

entering the pen behind me.     The pressure from behind me moved me down

a couple of steps.     I coul dn ’t move any further than that and I felt

crushed in by the crowd,    unable to move at all.      The dividing fence to

my left,    the one between pen three and pen four, was about five to six

feet away.     I have marked this position on the separate grid plan

using the figure one.     I remember seeing a Policeman on the outside of

the pen indicating to the people at the rear to move back.             This
                                                                              PAGE       5
                                                                              S3457

w a s n ’t possible,   there was nowhere to move backwards.        The pressure

from the rear was slowly moving me forwards.            It was an involuntary

movement, you couldn ’t do anything about it.           At some stage,          fell

over,    I think he fell over somebody else who had fallen on the

terraces.     I think        fell underneath the first crush barrier down

from the tunnel,       the one on the left hand side as you look towards the

pitch.     I saw that        had taken hold of the barrier.        I did not see

     get up, although he obviously did.           At this time        was slightly

to my right somewhere,       I couldn't actually see him.        Moments    later I

could see people escaping from the pen.            They were climbing over the

front fence,    the dividing fences, and eventually through the gate                in

the front perimeter fence which had been opened.              The game was still

in progress at this stage, although more and more people were getting

out from the pen and were standing           close to the Liverpool   goal.     I

remember seeing a Policeman run onto the pitch and approach the

referee.     This resulted in the game being stopped and a short time

later the players       left the field.      At this point I decided to try and

get out myself.        I thought   it was just a crowd spillage onto the pitch

and that as soon as it was cleared the game would resume.               I

decided to try and get across the pen towards pen number two, where I

could see there was room.          By now there was a queue of people who were

waiting to get over the dividing fence into pen two.              It was still

very packed in the pen but within a few minutes           I got to the dividing

fence.     The fact that a lot of people at the rear of the pen had been

helped up into the seating area above the terraces seefrted to ease the

pressure slightly.        I was helped over the dividing/fence        into pen two

at about ten past three.           (1510)   Once insidev^ n   two I walked towards

the centre of the pen where there was space.            From the centre of the

pen I looked towards the pitch and saw a person laid out on the

pitch.     The person was lying about half way between the six yard line
                                                                           PAGE        6
                                                                           S3457

and the eighteen yard line in the Liverpool          penalty area, and just

inside the playing area,     near to the goal      line.     The person was lying

to the right of the Liverpool        goal as you look from the Stand.       The

person was motionless.      There was a St J o h n ’s ambulanceman kneeling

alongside the person,     looking at him.       Within seconds another person

wearing    civilian clothing went to the person laid out and immediately

starting giving the person mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart

massage.      He appeared to be very competent in what he was doing.             The

St John's ambulance     remained,    looking on as the person was being

resuscitated.      There were other people laid out in the goalmouth area,

butall     eyes seemed to be on the person attempting to resuscitate the

person laid out near the goal        line.    He carried on with the

resuscitation for a few minutes during which time there was no

response from the person on the ground.           Eventually I saw that the

person laid out on the ground had been covered with what appeared to

be a dark jacket.      The jacket covered the face and the upper part of

;the body i    TheS body remained near, to the goal line for at least five

minutes.      I did not see the body being      removed from there.     The person

laid out on the ground was*a white male and aged in            his late twenties.

He had dark coloured h a i r r which was curly but had no obvious style.

The hair was receding.      The man was      clean shaven.    The man appeared

quite stocky with a large stomach.           He was about five feet ten inches

in height.      The man wore a plain white      *T* shirt which was round

necked and sleeveless.      He wore light coloured trousers,         possibly

beige.     I don*t think he had any footwear on.           I would estimate that I

first saw the above described man at about ten past three.              (1510)

The last time I saw him,     still    laid out on the pitch, was at about

twenty five past three.      (1525)     I    now believe that the man   attempting

to revive that person was a doctor           and I believe he was the   doctor who

appeared on television the same day making criticisms about the

I remained inside pen two and eventually found                 and          We left

the ground at some time between twenty five to five            (1635) and twenty

to five.     (1640)    We met up with         again back at the car.



I did not sustain any injury at Hillsborough.



While I was in pen three I was not aware that a crush barrier had

broken.     I saw the broken crush barrier while I was in pen two in the

aftermath of the disaster.

At Hillsborough I wore the following clothing •

sweatshirt with a button up neck.           It has two buttons.       It bears the

word                  on the front in          l_ettering.   Underneath that word

is a white             and the words                                 either side of

the            in white.     I wore denim    jeans and white   coloured training

shoes.     I am a white m a l e r about              height and have      light

brown coloured hair which is cut short above the ears and brushed

backwards on top.



I do not wish to make any specific          comments about Hillsborough.

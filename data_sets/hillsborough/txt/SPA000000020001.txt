           Dear M ember

           S P E C I A L M E E T I N G OF THE POLICE AUTHO R I T Y
           Th e A u t h o r i t y â€™s Meeting on Friday has been called to give the Chief Constable
           the o p p o r t u n i t y of talking to, and answering the questions of members, about the
           t ragic events at Hillsborough last Saturday.
           T h e media have been informed of the Meeting in the usual w a y and therefore
           m e m b e r s can, I think, express a very large Press contingent in attendance on
           Friday. I think members can also expect the Press to exert considerable
           p r e ssure for comments and statements and I wish to take this opportunity to warn
           m e m b e r s of the need for circumspection in the responses they make.
           T h e independent Enquiry to be carried out by Lord Justice T aylor does place
           certain constraints on members as well as the C h i e f Constable. There is a very
           fine divid i n g line between legitimate discussion of a m atter of great public
           interest and the risk of prejudicing that independent Enquiry and I would ask
           m e m b e r s to have this very much in mind when responding to the Press about the
           events of last Saturday.
            Y o urs s i n c e r e l y

As     the g a t e s        closed          those      entering               the       turnstiles         became angry                that

they had w a i t e d whilst                       some had              simply barged               through.          Again,           I was

approached             by many          claiming             the m a j o r i t y           of    those admi t t e d            did     not

have      tickets.               Still       they were                 demanding          action       to e a s e     the       situation

on     th e o t h e r       side       of    the       turnstiles,                 again,        not a c c e p t i n g      any

explanation             given          to    them.           There was              a g o o d d eal        of    abuse         and     bad

language -

The     only      supervision                at    t hi s        time was           Police        Sergeant         Crawford.              I

had     no t    seen        the    Inspector                for        some    fifteen m i n u t e s .

There were             so    few Police                Officers'at                 the     turnstiles           it w a s       impossible

to m a i n t a i n      any       f o r m of       ord er .             It b e c a m e        a case     of     ’s a f e t y    in

numbers'          and       to    this       end       I managed              to    find and          remain with              several

officers          in m y         serial.

The     gate       opened          for a s e c o n d              time w i t h m u c h            the s a m e     results          as the

fi rs t.        The second,                 rather          large         crowd         of p e o p l e m a d e     their        way

towards         th e    tunnel          of     the W e s t             Stand       at    a r a p i d pace.

I believe          th e      second          gate may have                    been       opened after            kick       off      as

there       appeared             some       urgency             in t h e i r m a n n e r .          I was       unable         to h ea r

little         else     due       to    th e      large amount                 of n o i s e        these      f a n s m a d e.

A matter           of s e c o n d s         later       I saw several                    officers        run past           the

entrance           to the W e s t           Stand           claiming           th e p i t c h h a d b e e n         invaded.              I

followed          these          officers          around              th e b a c k      of     the W e s t     St an d ,      entering

the pitch          from          the    front          of       th e    South       St an d .

When      on    th e p i t c h         I saw numerous                     fans w a n d e r i n g       around.         They       appeared

to be d a z ed ,            many       rubbing          their middle.

I looked          to    th e      stands,          noticing               that      the m a j o r i t y w e r e        shouting           for

th e    football            to    continue             and       jeering           at    ou r    presence.

It w a s       then m y a t t e n t i o n was                    drawn        towards           the s t a n d b e h i n d       th e

g o al.        There        seemed          to be       far        too m a n y          people      in t h i s     centre         section

although         I cannot          recall         how many were                 in e a c h        of    t he    sections       at

this      point.

Those         towards       the    back     of        t hi s    section were               clapping and             singing.

They     appeared          to b e p u s h i n g          forward.             Although            I could not           see

anything         a mi ss .         I could        feel         t hat    s o m e t h i n g was          not     quite    right       I

neared         the   fencing when my attention was                                  drawn         towards        a youth       stood

approximately               2 yards        from        the      fencing.             He    s h o w e d all       possible       signs

of d e a th .        The      pressure           of    th e c r o w d w a s          holding           h i m up.

I moved         nearer        to    the    fence         unable         to     believe        that       the y o u t h w a s        in

all      probability           d ea d.      However,             as     I approached               I could         see ma n y

faces         pushed       against        t he    fencing.              Those        immediately behind were

trying         to r e a c h    over the           top      to g r a b at            the    fence.

I stood         on    the w a l l      to a s s i s t          the     officers trying                  to r e a c h    over    the

top      of    the    fencing         to p u l l       people          out.         Only     those       helped were           those

t ha t    had     enough       room       to c l i m b         up a     little way             and help          themselves             to

be h o i s t e d      over     th e    top.           Those      at     th e    front        of    the       fencing were

impossible            to re ac h.

Some      time       later     several           bodies         appeared            on    the p it ch ,          I left       the

wall      to a s s i s t      with     first          aid.       Those         alive were              placed      on pieces            of

advertising            boards         and carried across                       by myself           and       Liverpool

supporters            to    the     exit    between             t he    Spion Kop and North                      Stand where             an

ambulance            was waiting.                I cannot            recall         how many           times     I made       t his

journey         or w h o w i t h .        Apart        from      the     one        or    tw o b o d i e s      I helped       take

across         the    remainder           were        dead.

I returned            to    th e    goal    mouth          in f r o n t        of    the W e s t        Stand      to o f f e r m y

assistance            with     first       aid.

Once      the     initial          shock had           subsided          and many            of    those        alive    had    been

helped,         I saw numerous              Liverpool                fans      approach Police                  Officers,

blaming         t h e m for w h a t        had happened,                 shouting            and       facing      up   to    them

aggressively.                 As    I was        approached             by     such       a youth        I walked        awa y.          He
                                                                                                                                        PAGE           5

             did not          follow me         b ut    continued        to s h o u t     a f t e r me.



             Whilst         helping with              first     aid m a n y     supporters           were w i l l i n g           to do w h a t

             they could             to a s s i s t ,    although        it w a s      clear m a n y did              no t    know what            to

             do.

             I looked          in to      the    upper     stands       to    see m a n y     still         shouting             for    the

             football          to b e g i n .

             As     the d e a d a n d          injured had been              taken care         of     I stood          on       the    pitch

             waiting          for     further         instructions.             I noticed           there were              no    senior

              officers         on     th e    pitch and cannot               recall       seeing any above                   t he      rank   of

             Police         Sergeant          throughout         this    time.         I l o o k e d at        the      clock          on   the

             North          Stand     to s e e       it w a s   4.15    p.m.

             Whilst          stood     at     th e    fencing helping            to    reach        ou t    some      supporters,             a

              blue      pole was          clearly        thrown      over     t he    larger        f e n c in g .      It       flew past

             m y h ea d,       m i s s i n g me       by a hair's width.                  I believe          other          officers were

              hit      by    this missile.

              Some      time       l a t er    serial     14 w a s      directed       to     sit     in the         North        Stand

              until         further       instructions.            By    this    time       the g r o u n d       had       been       cleared

              of m a n y      of    the       supporters.

      '       From      the N o r t h         Stand we were          stood      do wn ,     making         our w a y        to C l a y w h e e l s

              Lane      for    transport.

              I returned            to D H Q w i t h      other m e m b e r s        of m y    serial        at      approximately

              8 p.m.

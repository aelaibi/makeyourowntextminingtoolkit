 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION TO INFORM THE FANS EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON.            THE

 TANNOY SYSTEM SHOULD’VE BEEN USED MORE EFFECTIVELY.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WIS . TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 LAST YEAR LEPPINGS LANE WAS CORDONED NQf>F BY POLICE OFFICERS AT LEAST 50 YARDS

 FROM THE GROUND ENSURING NO-ONE WITHOUT TICKETS GOT PAST THEM THIS DIDN’T

 HAPPEN THIS TIME.         THE WHOLE POLICE ORGANISATION APPEARED UNREAL AND TOTALLY

 INFERIOR TO LAST YEAR.

 AT ABOUT 2.30 (1430), 2.40PM (1440)          I LOOKED OUT AT THE BACK OF THE WEST STAND

 & SAW THE CROWD AT THE TURNSTILES WAS WELL OUT OF HAND AND I SAW PEOPLE

 SCALING WALLS TO GET INTO THE GROUND.            I ALSO SAW 3 POLICE OFFICERS STANDING

 BY A BARRIER CORDONING OFF THE ALLEYWAY BETWEEN THE WALL ADJACENT TO THE RIVER

 D©    & THE RIVER DON ITSELF . I SAW THEM REMOVE THAT BARRIER & ALLOW FANS

 THROUGH,       I D O N ’T KNOW WHERE THAT LED.

 AT 2.45 (1445)       I MADE COMMENT THAT THERE WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF SPACE IN THE

 NORTH STAND.        I BELIEVED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN TRAFFIC DELAYS IT WAS ONLY 1/2-

 2/3RDS FULL.       I BELIEVED IT ALL OCCURRED DUE TO NO ORGANISATION OUTSIDE AT THE

 TURNSTILE AREA.

 AT ABOUT 3.40PM (1540) AS I WAS LEAVING THE GROUND I SAW 20-30 POLICE OFFICERS

 APPEARING EXTREMELY RELAXED BY THE RIGHT HAND GATE OF THE TURNSTILE AREA.             I

 COUL D N’T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WEREN’T DOING ANYTHING.

 ALTHOUGH THERE WERE POLICE OFFICERS OLThSIDE THE TURNSTILE AREA, THE FANS

 WERE NOT CHECKED FOR TICKETS.     IT WAS OBVlbuS TO ME THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF

 FANS WERE NOT TICKET HOLDERS,    IT WAS IDEAL FOR\THE^E PEOPLE TO GET IN, IN THE

 CONFUSION.     THEY WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CRUSH.   IF SCREENING HAD TAKEN

 PLACE THE BULK OF THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE AWAY FROM THE TURNSTILES.

 NO.



 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER TH e \ a TCH WAS STOPPED?

 (I) NOBODY IN CHARGE (POLICE OR S T O ^ R I g ) REALISES QUICKLY ENOUGH WHAT WAS

 HAPPENING, DESPITE THE FACT THAT CAMERAS WERE AVAILABLE. THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 ABLE TO SEE THE INCIDENT DEVELOPING AND TRY AND AVOID IT.

 (II) THERE APPEARED TO BE NO OR A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE

 AND STEWARDS INSIDE AND THOSE OUTSIDE.

 (III) PEOPLE INSIDE THE GROUND WERE NOTINFORMED            OFWHAT WAS HAPPENING AND IT

        WELL HAVE HELPED.

 (IV) THE CONGESTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS LANE GATE.

 ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS BARRIERS HAVE PREVENTED THIS SORT OF CROWD PROBLEMS.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE AUtHQRITIES AND THE SPECTATORS, AS TO

        SEVERITY OF THE INCIDENT, AND THE SCALE O F N m E DISASTER.   ALSO THE^ POLICE

 IN THE GROUND WERE NOT AWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING, AND WERE TREATING THE

 INCIDENT AS CROWD DISORDER, POSSIBLY CONDITIONED BY LIVERPOOLS REPUTATION.

 THE FORMING OF A CORDON ACROSS THE(HALF WAY LINE SEEMED A WASTED RESOURCE

 AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER EMPLOYED ADMINISTERING FIRST AID, AND RESCUING

 THE CROWD.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH       OU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 PRj£R TO THE GAME THERE WAS NO CONTROL OF THE CROWEN         THE POLICE OUTSIDE THE

 LEPPINGS LANE ENTRANCE, MORE POLICE WERE NEEDED TO I*        JAIN ORDERLY QUEUES.    IN

 MY OPINION THERE WERE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE GROUND WITHOUT TICKETS, BECAUSE I

 WAS ASKED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION WHETHER I HAD ANY SPARE TICKETS, THE

 OPENING OF GATE C, BY THE POLICE ENABLED PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS TO ENTER

THE GROUND, EN MASS.

WHY WAS LIVERPOOL FC ALLOCATED THE SMALLER END OF THE GROUND, WHEN THEY HAVE

LARGER GATES THAN NOTTS FOREST?       WAS IT PURELY AT THE REQUEST OF THE POLICE,

FOR THEIR OPERATIONAL PURPOSES, TO CONTROL THE INFLUX OF FANS INTO THE CITY

OF SHEFFIELD.

AT 2.15PM (1415)    I NOTICED THAT THE CENTRAL PENS BEHIND THE GOAL WAS ALREADY

FULL WHICH WAS VERY UNUSUAL.      BETWEEN 2.30 & 2.45 (1430)4(1445)   I SAW THE

 TURNSTILES FROM THE WEST STAND TOILET WINDOW.     THEREWAS AN ENORMOUS CROWD
                                                                                PAGE      7

G18


•
DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE APPEARED TO BE NO BASIC PLAN ~ NO ORGANISATION AS TO HOW TO DEAL WITH

 THE SITUATION.      EVERYONE J U S K A C T E D AS INDIVIDUALS, NOT AS A TEAM.

 I C A N ’T UNDERSTAND WHY A FLEET OF\AMBULANCES DI DN ’T COME ONTO THE PITCH TO

 TAKE THE INJURED TO HOSPITAL.      THIS DI D N ’T HAPPEN, FANS HAD TO CARRY THE DEAD
                                                     C ^ r= r A      z     e o M ^ V
 &      JJURED ON BROKEN DOWN HOARDINGS.  I        JRATHER CONCERNED AT THE NUMBERS OF

 POLICE WHO WENT ONTO THE PITCH BUT DID NOTHING TO HELP THE INJURED.             ONLY A

 HANDFUL OF OFFICERS SEEMED TO BE DOING ANYTHING POSITIVE.


Q19

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO

 THE TRAGEDY. MANY PEOPLE WERE ANGRY AT THE REPEAT OF LAST YEA R’S DECISION TO
                                                                         PAGE     9
                                                                         G SL2917

 ALLOCATE LEPPINGS LANE END TO LIVERPOOL FANS WITH LESS TICKETS AVAILABLE FOR

 THEM. THIS IS WHY SO MANY PROBABLY WENT WITHOUT TICKETS TO THE MATCH.

 I HAVE BEEN TO PREVIOUS MATCHES WHERE I HAVE FELT IN DANGER BECAUSE THERE

 HAVE BEEN OVERCROWDING IN A PARTICULAT\SECTION OF THE GROUND. THIS OBVIOUSLY

 ALSO OCCURRED AT HILLSBOROUGH •- THE CENTRAL PENS WERE SO GROSSLY OVERCROWDED

AND THE SIDE PENS WERE RELATIVELY EMPTY. THSflE SHOULD BE BETTER STEWARDING

WITHIN THE GROUND TO ENSURE A MORE EVEN DISTRI!   'ION OF FANS,

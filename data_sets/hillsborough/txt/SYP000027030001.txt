I set o      f     f      w     i     t     h     three friends for Hillsborough
at 11*30 a.m. and having parked ray car, walked to the ground, arrived
at Leppings Lane at 2.00 p.m.              I made no stops.   I approached the
Leppings Lane entrance to the ground to ascertain position at the
West Stand.      I then asked a policeman of whom there were many
gathered in clusters talking, where the ticket office was.               I had to
collect two tickets left for me by the secretary of Rangers Football
Club as I only got ray tickets from Liverpool on 13th April.             My serial
number did not give me a ticket immediately.              The reply from the
constable was that I would not be able to get through the throng of
people outside the turnstiles and it would be quicker walking round
to the Penistone Road end of the ground amid the supporters of
Nottingham Forrest.           I reluctantly had to do this.      At this stage
outside the turnstiles no orderly queueing or marshalling of supporters
was evident - only a melee of people trying to gain access to the ground.
At the east end (Kop) of Hillsborough access to the terraces appeared
to be simple and again large numbers of police were evident.
On return to Leppings Lane at 2.30 entry to the turnstile area was
difficult.       Again plenty of police were evident.          It took some mintues
to ascertain where access to section c was and marshalling of spectators
was effectively non existant other than a police land rover, overloudhailer,
asking spectators to take their time.              Three mounted policemen were trying
to exert control but were having no success owing to the large numbers
proceeding to the gates.            Through the perimetre gates and the turnstile
wall people were in a crush trying to squeeze through to the turnstile
of which I think there were four for entry to »cM.               I was very frightened
at this stage.         I had only one way to go - forward.       ThBre was no way
back.   At this time people were able to scale the wall by climbing on the
shoulders of those people crushed up against it.               I entered through the
turnstile before the concertina gate was opened and accept the police
officer had little alternative at the time other than to take such action
for people would certainly have been severely injured or worse had the
situation not been relieved.              Regretably this course of action would appear
to have led to a greater catastrophe.
I have never been to Hillsborough before and was very surprised
at the lack of direction and marshalling both from the police and
the stewards of Sheffield Wednesday.
I cannot understand the apparent freedom of movement allowed and the
loose approach taken by the authorities outside of the ground.      I
feel that the entrances through the blue wrought iron gates was
narrow and that the spectators should have been filtered between
barriers all the way down Leppings Lane from the traffic lights at
the main road.    I think this is the main A 6l6.    Such measures would
have ensured that people had to queue and that those who had travelled
without tickets would not be admitted into the queues between the
barriers and would have been kept sufficient distance from the
turnstiles.    Such measures are taken at Wembley.


I feel that despite the efforts of the police to maintain control,
efforts which were obviously taken far too late, the proper forethought
had not been given to organising crowd control at such an event.
I am sure that certain police tactics could have been employed to
gain control but such actions would probably have led to serious
disturbance outside of the ground.     Such were the spectators emotions
at the time.     I do not accept that because the 1988 semi-final between
the two clubs had gone off without incident is any justification for
the measures of organisation and crowd control adopted.      I have been told
that access to the ground last year was similarly tinged with the same
pushing, shoving and crushing in front of the turnstiles.


With so many people outside of the grouniat 2.50 p.m. 1 find it difficult
to comprehend why the kick-off could not have been delayed.      An announcement
to that effect would have removed any panic thought of missing the start
of the game which was surely in so many peoples minds.

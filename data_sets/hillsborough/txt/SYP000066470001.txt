When     I got        to outside        the    turnstile          the    police        searched me and found a

J u v entus    flag       in my pocket.              They      told sue to take           it back        to the       coach

as no banners were                being allo w e d           in the ground.             At     this    point        in time

there was          just a trickle             of    people      going     in the turnstiles.                  There

were    a number          of    people walking around                   in circles on the Leppi n g s                  Ln.

1hs    police were             telling    people          if they had tickets                to go     inside,        if

I walked       back       to the     coach and then               returned to the              ground.         It was

now about          1.45 pm          (1345)          There were          now more        people       in the Leppings

only saw one            policeman on a horse but                      there may have            been more           there,

1 d i d n ’t receive any directions                         to the turnstiles             but    I knew where              i.

was    going.          I wa l k e d through the turnstile                       without any difficulty.

I did not see any gates                   other          than the       turnstiles        open and         1 did not

W he n    through the         turnstile        I saw the tunnel           in front      of me and             I saw

the      letters A ana B above             it.     I had a letter B on my ticket                         50    I

assumed      this was where             I had to go.          1 knew there was              side   terracing

and      I knew you       could not get          to this area           via the     tunnel.        My friends

had a l r e a d y gone        into the ground when                I had to     return to the             coach.          :

thought      they may be         irNme  of the side pens.     So I l o o k e o H p r signs to

in the                          friends w e r e n ’t       any of       them. I couSj.dn't          see any

_dir e ct io ns     to t h e t e r ra c i n g h y 1 h e N o r t h Stand, but         because        of        the

time      it had taken me           to find the other             terr^rsing      I decided not to

1 remember          seeing one          policeman at         the entry     to the tunnel           but    he did

not appear         to be doing anything.                 1 had a free and easy walk                      down the

tunnel,      there were         few people        going      down the      tunnel     when     I did.

Inside      the terrace         everyone was        jovial        and    in good spirits,            there was

 so tension at ail.              I was wi-th all my friends                  except                                 ano

At about 2.45            pm   (1445)     it started to get              packed so we m oved to the

       In the      crush       I was    so frigh t e n e d    I was      not    paying any a t t e n t i o n to the

       game,       I did not know           if    it had kicked off.             I could see a girl about

       three    people         in front     of me.       She was         forced against the front

       perimeter       fence,          I heard her streaming              then she         turned blue and

       stopped       screa'Taing.        I could see her\face.                 She was a plump                looking

       w h i t e girl.         In tnx, picture       shown on the          front       page of the Daily

       this    girl,     she was wear i n g a black               coat.
R om        la^d a fair        guess    that     she was     dead because         she had turned               blue and

       * t o PI“ied screaming.

       Eventually        people were           getting     out    of the       pen.      I did not           notice any

                  As the         pressure got              less my       feet went down towards the                   ground and I

                  was aware            I was       standing       on     someone's legs,              but    I could not       describe

                  I had now made my wa y back                          to about       the    centre     of the       pen when a man

              \   eyes    were         slightly          open.     He was wearing              blue    jeans,       that's all         I can

      this was.           I then       left    the gym area           to    return to the       pitch and         1 heard

      the Forest          fans jeering,             and    1 noticed the Liverpool              fans    going

      towards        the Forest         fans.       Police        then started ushering              these    fans

      back,       who    complied with this                respect without           any    problems    but    some      of

      the Forest          fans     continued         jeering       so more Liverpool           fans made       towards



      It was at          this    point    that       the     police    formed a broken          line across          the

      half way          line.     By this       time       I was    back     in the Liverpool          half of       the

      field.         I then      climbed       back       into the      centre      pen before my friends               on

      the terrace             by the South stand s h o u t s d , and                I then joined t h e m .

      We     later      left the ground             of our own accord,              this was at about 4,30               pm.

      cutting        equipment         to the       fence was       directed to the wrong              place.        I saw

      it in the tunnel                on the way out after                 I had    lost my composure          carrying



      W hen     t n e ,crushed people at the                  beginning       started       climbing    over      the

      g eared for a riot the                  police and not a disaster.                     There was a xacK of

      unde rstandi n g hy s om e of t h e police.

      After       the m a t c h l^ad been stopped the                   police      still    treated the fans as

      hooligans,          even a f t W        the    disaster.         There       seemed no    co-operation

      b etween all            the eme r g e n c y services.             There was a total            lack of

      communi cation between                  the    police       themselves.         I did not see any of
whe n    the    police       formed a line across                 the    pitch     it heig h t e n e d the

tension.         These       police        should have       been helping with the                 dead and

injured and            not just       bothering about             the    violent      side of      it.

The     police       could and        should have been far more                    sympathetic and

u.nde rstandi ng and not                  t r eat i ng us as hooligans.

There     should have             been more       communication between the                   police and       fans

as    to what was           happening.

E v e n at     the     beginning          of the game       the    police        seemed        if they had no

knowledge        ckF   how to        control      crowds.         It was     not what y o u \ w o u l d expect

of a big        game?        1 was a m a z e d at the         number        of    po 1 i ce Just         nder inq

a r o u n d doing      nothing.            People were       drinking and doing what                 they    liked,

the     police were          just walk i n g        past.     The       ticket a l l o c a t i o n was wrong,

L i verpool      should have gone                to the Kop end,

At    least     twenty       people asked me            if I had a spare              ticket.       It must     have

It was       busy outside            the    ground at       1.45    pm (1345>          and the     police

At the       cor responding           game      last year     the       policing was        far    superior.

They were        checking           tickets and anyone without                    ti\kets w e r e n ’t a l l o w e d

areas.         There       just     seemed      to be more        police     there      last year.

in    pedestrian             activity          with      large       groups        of y o u t h s w a n d e r i n g              around

aimlessly          w i t h a few           s'hoiiting the            u s ua l    football             cha n t s .        We      both

made      our w a y      along Middlewood                  Road        in the         direction             of    the       hospital™

When      nearing        the       Texaco       petrol         s t a t i o n we       decided          to w a l k        back         in the

opposite          direction             towards         Hillsborough             shopping             centre .

At    about       1 2 midday            as we     approached            the      j u n c t i o n of M i d d l e w o o d               Road

a nd W a d s l e y Lane,             our a t t e n t i o n       was    caught         by P o l i c e        Sergeant                1948

Miller       who       was    on m o b i l e      Transit         patrol.             He    stated          that       one       of       the

pubs      situated           further        up W a d s l e y L a n e         was      full       to    capacity and                   that

there       was    a    large        number       of     people        outside         on the          frontage             and       road

drinking          beer.           He a p p e a r e d     concerned           that      they may             get     out         of    hand.

Also      s i t u a t e d at       this     j u n ction are            a number            of    shops       where          a    large

number       of L i v e r p o o l        supporters            had     gathered            for w h a t        can      only          be

described          as    a drinking             session.             There       were          numerous          cans       of       beer

and    lager        being         and    had    been      consumed.              I continued                to w a l k          along

Middlewood             Road and          into     the     shopping           cen t r e .         Whilst          walking             along

this      road      I again          saw    l a rge      groups        of    youths         drinking             from       cans          of

beer      and     lager.           Those       t ha t    I did       not     see      drinking           I could            hear          pass

comments          as    to    "Where        is the        nearest           public         house?"

Once      TD C    O ’B r i e n     and myself            had     patrolled            the       precinct,           we      decided             to

visit, P a r k s i d e        Section          House      via     the       park      grounds.              At    about

•1,00 p.m.         -    1.15       p.m.     whilst        walking           along      Parkside             R o ad ,     I was

approached             every       five     yards        by a L i v e r p o o l        supporter             asking             for a

ticket.           On    eventually             reaching          Parkside          S ection House,                  I saw a

la r ge     number       of y o u t h s        standing          behind         the    Section           House         and       around

vehicles          in the          parking       bay      situated           adjacent            to    the    Section             House,

the m a j o r i t y      of w h o m        were    drunk         and were          subsequently                  removed.                 Again

by the a c c e n t           I believe          these       to    fie L i v e r p o o l         supporters.

I recall, t h a t            whilst        inside        the     b o x/ Se ct io n House               I heard           footsteps

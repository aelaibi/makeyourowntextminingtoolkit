                SUBJECT:                       ATTACHED REPORT


                I enclose herewith a report from Inspector W a rdle, E2 Sub-Division,
                following his attendance at the E2 Sub-Divisional Forum on the evening of
                Wednesday 14 June 1989.    As you will see, the meeting was chaired by
                                      |jP.

                I felt it appropriate you had sight of this report which gives an
                indication of the feeling of this section of our public towards the South
                Yorkshire Police following the Hillsborough disaster.

   T°:     Chief Superintendent Stark, E Division.                        Date:      22nd June, 1989,



           SUBJECT:
                          POLICE a COMMUNITY LIAISON FORtM RESOLUTION RE HILLSBOROUGH


                 At 7.30 p.m. Wednesday, 14th June, 1989, in company with Superintendent
            Greenwood and Chief Inspector Saunders I attended the above Forum.


                 During the course of the meeting a person attending rose to address
            those present and put forward the following comments:-

                "There has been a lot of media exposure surrounding the Hillsborough
            disaster and whilst it is appreciated that mistakes may have been made I
            would like to put forward a resolution from this meeting that the
            overwhelming feeling is one of total support for the South Yorkshire
            Police."


                 The meeting, attended by over 100 persons supported the resolution
            enthusiastically and spontaneously applauded the proposer.


                 The Chairperson,                 commented to the meeting that
            Police Officers are human beings in uniform and this fact must never be
            forgotten.


                 The resolution was a touching gesture and you may feel that officers
            should be made aware of it.

                     Submitted for information and attention please,




            Inspector.

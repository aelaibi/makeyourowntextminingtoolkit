      The public enquiry into the Hillsboro' disaster will no doubt establish the fact's
 and reasons why people died and put to an end, once and for all, the appalling
 assumptions of so much media speculation.
      uut, even in this technological acre, will the Lord Justice Taylor be able to
 determine the exact minute, of the most crucial factor, the first death?
      For if it occurred prior to the opening of the exit gate No 2, and as a witness
 in the West Stand I am of the opinion it did, then it will establish that the disaster
 occurred for other principle factors other than the sudden surge of people through
 the tunnel and that this particular event only served to increase the number of
 fatalities.

     A factor that cannot be ignored, is that as early as ?.45om on that day, the
number of people actually within the penned centre terrace (with only one combined exit
and entrance located directly behind the goal), appeared to be far in excess of the
safety level and I would suggest a figure of twice as many would not be unrealistic.
     To witness the complete front row of spectators at ’.45pm all standing with their
hands up holding the metal fencing, presumably to withstand the appalling crush behind
them, together with attempts to climb the fencing, does sugj?est to me, that m a n y people
were being crushed to an unconscious state well before the sudden sur^e of spectators
through the tunnel just before the Kick off.
     The classic statements of most Journalists, and in particular George "ale writing
in the Daily Mail, state, much to my annoyance as a neutral spectator, that the
Liverpool supporters were drunk, were rioting, and were crushed to death by those
who lived.
     The fact he and so nany have ignored or are unaware is that approximately twice the
number of spectators over and above the safety limits imposed by law, who were not
drunk, who did^ not riot., who did not turn up late, held hono. - fide tickets for the
centre and/orA$art of the Leppings Lane standing area, were permitted to and did in
fact in an orderly manner take their places in the centre penned section of the terracing
by 2.45pm.
     That section was then bursting at the seams and spectators were packed so tightly
as if cemented together, they were unable to wave, clap or cheer,Why on earth theKfirfene
weren't the tickets and the subsequent entrances to the terracing speci-fWIUdesicmated
A, B and G?
     With that arrangement together with satisfactory and adequate officialdom at
these subsequent entrances it would have GTJAHANTS7® that the 3 penned sections of
terracing would have been below the maximum safety limit prescribed.

     The number of fatalities there would have been in thisAsection if the exit erate
had not been opened, will never be known but for the sake of Justice and all connected
with this most popular sport, please y o u Journalists, do not assume that all the deaths
occurred as a result of hooliganism and that sudden surge of people entering the tunnel
at ?.57pm,!

      The public enquiry into the Hillsboro' disaster will no doubt establish the facts
 and reasons why people died and put to an end, once and for all, the aT>t>alling
 assumptions of so much media speculation.
      isut, even in this technological age, will the Lord Justice Taylor be able to
 determine the exact minute, of the most crucial factor, the first death?
      For if it occurred prior to the opening of the exit gate No 2, and as a witness
 xn the West Stand I am of the opinion it did, then it will establish that the disaster
 occurred for other principle factors other than the sudden surge of people through
 the tunnel and that this particular event only served to increase the number of
 fatalities.

      A factor that cannot be ignored, is that as early as ?.45pm on that day, the
 number of people actually within the penned centre terrace (with only one combined exit
 and entrance located directly behind the goal), appeared to be far in excess of the
 safety level and I would suggest a figure of twice Ss many would not be unrealistic.
      To witness the complete front row of spectators at '?.4‘>pm all standing with their
 hands up holding the metal fencing, presumably to withstand the apnalling crush behind
 them, together with attempts to climb the fencing, does suggest to me, that many t>eot>le
 were being crushed to an unconscious state well before the sudden sur^e of spectators
 through the tunnel just before the Kick off.
     The classic statements of most Journalists, and in particular George Gale writing
in the Daily Mail, state, much to my annoyance as a neutral spectator, that the
Liverpool supporters were drunk, were rioting, and were crushed to death by those
who lived.
     The fact he and so nany have ignored or are unaware is that anDroximately twice the
number of spectators over and above the safety limits inroosed by law, who were not
drunk, who did^ not riot, who did not turn up late, held bon©.-fide tickets for the
centre and/orA$art of the Leppings Lane standing area, were permitted to and did in
fact in an orderly manner take their places in the centre penned section of the terracing
by 2.45pm.
     That section was then bursting at the seams and spectators were r>acked so tightly
as if cemented together, they were unable to wave, clap or cheer,Why on earth "Hzerefene
weren't the tickets and the subsequent entrances to the terracing siDeci-ftolUdesignated
A, B and C?
     With that arrangement together with satisfactory and adequate officialdom at
these subsequent entrances it would have GUARANTS7® that the 3 penned sections of
terracing would have been below the maximum safety limit prescribed.

      The number of fatalities there would have been in thisAsection if the exit crate
 had not been opened, will never be known but for the sake of Justice and all connected
 with this most popular sport, please you Journalists, do not assume that all the deaths
 occurred as a result of hooliganism and that sudden surge of people entering the tunnel
 at ?.57pm*

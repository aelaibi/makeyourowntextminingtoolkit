            a pp r o x   1 mile       from the ground.                  We d i d n ’t see any police officers

            giving       d irections         to    the    ground and we had to hurry towards                      the    ground

            as    it was         near kick-off.

            O n the way to the               ground,          along M i d d l e w o o d Rd and      into L ep pi ngs     Ln,       I

            a b o u t 2.4 5       pm (1445).

            There,       at the        turnstiles,            was a heavin'j/mass of s u pporters                trying       to

            get    into       the ground.           There w e r r no / r g a n i s e d        queues.     The fans       trying

            to get       in were        h i n d er e d by      railings,        a lack of grounted p o l i c e m e n to

            queues.              They were    pulling          them from the mass            onto    the turnstile        roofs.

            I hadn't             been to the       gro un d before            but my son had.          We were    stood

            l oc a t i o n on seeing          several          fans     turned a wa y from the t urnstiles with

            the w ro n g         ticket.

            At    this       point we a s k ed a p oliceman and he d ir ec t ed us back onto                             the

            W h e n we       reached the B turnsti l^sr^we d i sc o v e r e d                  the exit gate       between

            this     gate and          it was a pp r o x 2.55            pm    (1455).

            I d i d n ’t w i tn es s any u n a u t h o r i s e d entry to the ground,                     nor did       I see

                were     no stewards           or signs         sugg es ti ng a l te r n a t i v e      routes and we

                t h e re f o r e    took    to the       tunnel.          There was       no    rush or panic.

                Once     inside       the enclosure,               however,       the    pressure       began to mount.               I

                still       had my ticket            and    it was        intact.        I had    it ready to show but

                nobody        ins p e ct ed    it.

                Almost        immediately,           my son and           I were    separated.              He had a t t e nd e d     last

                year's        s e mi-final        and    p r o ce e de d to make         his wa y    left along           the   pen to

                w hat    he    consi d e r e d was a safer                vantage       point.      I was       unable     to do this

                due     to the       pressure w i t h i n the             crowd and found myself                 being     pushed

                f u rt h e r and      further        f o rw ar d    towards       the    perimeter          fence.

                I saw the kick-off                 to the m at ch take             place       but by this         time    conditions

                w o u l d d e s cribe       this     boy as        thin faced,          smalljreh built wit h ginger

                hair.         It was       dif fi cu lt     due     to the       pressu yk of the            crowd.       We were         too

            ,   packed        together.           I was     having        d i ff i cu l ty keeping my feet              but     I was

                a ware      of the      c o nv e rs a ti o n b e t w e e n / t h y ’ father and son as they became

                more     and more          separated.           By now,      the fans were           calling         for a ss is t an c e

                at    the     front     of the       pen and        behind me s pe ct a to r s were              being     lifted

   ^            into     the West Stand.

                It    is dif f i c u l t      to m e as u r e      time    but    it m ight      have       been 2 0 - 2 5 minutes

                before        the    police       on the     pitch        realised the se ri ou sn es s              of the

                si tuat i o n .

                I could still              feel    the     pressure        i n cr e as i ng l y getting worse             behind me

                but     eventually          the    perimeter         fence was          torn open and the             pressure

                relaxed a little.                  It was at         this    point       that    this young          boy's

                s i t u a t i o n was      seen as       being     very grave.            His    face had turned blue,                  his

the    crowd and he was                passed orj,T^o the          pitch.         I don't        know what

happened           to his    father.

By    now the game           had     ceased and         certain        r e cr im in at io ns were            taking

place,       some     b et we en fans and           police,        others        betw ee n fans and fans.

During       this     time,       m i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g s arose.       I saw a L iv erpool              fan

remove       the     net from        the goal       in order          to a l lo w the a mb u la n ce access.

O th e r    fans     thought       he was a vandal              and     reacted       noisily a g ai ns t          him.       A

p ol i c e m a n    near me had e nt er ed the               pen to help            remove       the       injured and a

m in o r a r g u m en t     took     place     betw ee n him and one of the fans.                             To his

credit,       he was a t te m p t i n g        to j u st if y the          conduct         of his      c olleagues and

it was at           that    point      I was m oved        to    praise        his own        courage        but to

criticise           some    of his       c olleagues who           had been         less quick             to assess      the

situation.

In front           of us there were approxirnately SO s pectators who were                                         quite

e v i d e n t l y dead a nd        it was      not until         about 3 . 5 0        pm    (15SQ)         that   I saw my

own    son on the           pitch safe.

Throughout           this    there       had been no w or d from the                    public addre ss            system.

This       I am sure        had    caused a good deal                 of m i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g    between     the

rival       fans and kept all               the s pectators             in the dark about                  the gravity

of the situation.                  It w as n 't     until       K e nn y D a l g l i s h spoke         to the      crowd

on a dif f e re nt m i c r o p h o n e         that we were            given any           inform at io n at all.

From       this     point onwards           the moo d of the             crowd      changed and everyone was

c o n c e r n e d only w it h a ss i st i ng          the a u th o r i t i e s      in bringing             the   crisis

to an end.

The    c o n fu s i o n that       can arise        through        lack of        c o mm u ni ca ti on       could be

witnessed           everywhere.

A    p o l ic e m an emerging          from the       crowd w it h an            injured head m ig ht              of been

attacked           but might       have     s u st ai ne d the        injury      in an atte mp t            to   rescue a

person       from the        crowded        terrace.

I st a y e d      in pen 4 until             4.2 5   pm    (1625)       when     I heard an a nn ou nc e me n t

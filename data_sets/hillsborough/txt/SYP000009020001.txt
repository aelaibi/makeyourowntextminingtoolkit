         During my          patrol       of Halifax RD             I noticed many supporters           sj^&lflng on

         a nd the         public jynxse in Halifax RD near                    to t h e ^ a i Iway stat i on was

         full at          1£3p/ nours.       The weather was’ f in e^^nd warm and the re a p p e a r e d

         to be as/carnival atmo sp he re



         At a bout         1400 hours       the     contingent         d#"Tai led to meet       those a rr iving      by

         t ra *n (including rriyself)                coll^^fed some 50 0 Liverpool                 supporters and

         w a l k e d them the half miL*""to the ground.



         On a r r ival          (approx im ately       1415 h oursK^the          turnstiles were        busy but

         the 500 had no d i ff ic ul ty                in gair^fng access.             There were      supporters

         in the near vicinity b l o c k i n g/ pa ve me nt s                  on each side of the bridge.

         These m o u nt ed officers               o p /(h e       escort were    initially employed

         e nc ou ra g in g       those    people     to make         their way      into the ground,      if they

         had tickets             or leave    the area.             There was     no h ostility and most

         m o v ed w hen         requested.



               a bo u t   14^0 hours        it became apparent               that    the   c ^ v ^ K o utside was

         i nc r e a ^ y n g .     Large numbers         of        people were    coming     down Lepi^yffg LN from

         Catpflbaryf L-N (the opposite                  dir ec ti on from w h ic h we had '''been told to

         expect      the Liverpool           supporters)            and started to         push towards     the

         turnstiles.              I shouted to officers                in Lepping LN to slow the flow as

         the    compound and immediate area behind was full.                                 Constable^fSOO

                                    iat compound.          There a pp e a r e d to be no         reaction

to   requests     not to move f o r w a r d ’ and          in fact        horses were      being     pushed

in an effort        to
                    reach the turnstiles.     At one point, a tt em pt s were
                      Mcx_r\       ;a U z & L
made to     close the w r o u g o n gates to relieve the pressure but on

each o c c asion     it was       pushed back.           At one    point      I saw what a pp ea re d

                   being thrown through the air.                    It narrowly missed

C o n s t a b l e STANBR          but    its   contents     s c a t te re d over him and those

a ro u n d him.     I remember          thinking    “Thank      goodness       he was wear in g         his

r einforced hat."



E v e n t u a l l y we were able        to form a complete            1                ;es from

building      line to building            line,    but    evertf^then, people were attem pt in g

to push between and under                 the horses w i t h a complete dis re ga rd for

their    safety.         T hose   that    had got    past the       line      continued to       push

a nd all    requests       to be     patient were         ignored.



T here was a brief          time when one hoj^e-G'T from fear,                   moved out of        line

a nd there was a surge             tow^rtls the turnstiles.                 This was      quickly-

fi ll ed but as      I looked over aA^"this point and                      I saw the gate on the

left    of the t u r ns t i lj>»<fpe n .       I a s s um ed that         it had been breached.               A

short time        l a p y f the gates were         closed and the            crush a p p e a r e d to

At    1130 hours         <1130)     all    Moo^ t ^ d O ff ic er s were    briefed by the Chief

turnstile areas and others                   to patrol      the   routes    to the ground.



During      the      period fSrom 1130 hours           (1130)     to   1413 hours      (1415)     I

                 ^ 1 II<4 .
Inspector H A N D - D A V I E S of the S ou th Yo rk sh ir e Police.                  It was    during

this    period that           I saw many supporters            sitting     on grass     verges

drinking alcohol             from    cans.      I saw a long queue outside              the off

licence and a public house a dj acent                    to    it, was full at         1230 hours

(1230).           The weather was          fine and w arm an d there a pp ea r e d         to be a

carnival          atmosphere.



At about          140u\ftours      (1400)    with other       officers,     I met a p p r o x i ma te ly

5 0 0 L iverpool         su^rjers          from the    railway     station and escor te d them

a l ong Halifax Roa d to the turnstiles                     in L ep pi ng s Lane.      At this         time

the    road and         pavements were        busy but      the 500 had no diff ic ul ty              in

gaining access            to the ground.



I then      remained near           to the L ep pings Lane         turnstiles wit h other

officers,          encouraging       supporters       to make     their way towards         the ground.

Man y were         standing       on the    pavements    on both sides        df the bridge

blocking          the   pavements - some drinking alcohol                  from   cans and bottles.

As traffic was            still moving        in the    road,     other    pedestrians      had

d i f fi c ul ty    in crossing       the bridge.



At about          1430 hours       (1430)    it became appar en t         that the    crowd in the
                                                                                                            PAGE

was      now full.         Large     numbers        were    coming    down Lepping Lane             from

C at ch ba r Lane - joining               the i^a^r of those           in the       c o m p o u n d and    s tarted

to    p u s h to^a^rds      the t u r n s t i l e s .

At    this     point Const ab ^e ^ GRUIMIMIL.L and S n ^ p R I D G E                place d their horse*

inside       the      compound     in an effort            to ease the       pressure       on the

turnstiles.



W it h    other       officers     I a t t e mp te d to stem the flow of s upporters                        from

L e ppings Lane whilst at the same                         time    encourage       those    heading        for the

c ompound to take a few steps                       backwards.        This was       impossible - all

a t te mp ts     to    reason wit h those queuing were                     ignored and some a t t e mp te d

either       to push the horses              out of their way or squeeze                    past them.            I

could see          that    the   compound          inside    the    railings was         now tightly            packed

and C o ns ta bl es G R U N N I L L and S T A M B R I D G E were            having      d i ff ic ul ty taking

the      pressure       off the turnstiles as more                   supporters         joined    in at the

rear of the            compound and        pushed forward.



At o n e ’"po^i'Tr^                        officers wit h foot              officers       closed the metal

gates at the            rear of\t^hJ c o m p o u n d but w it h i n seconds                these were           forced

and more         supporters        pushed towards            the turnstiles.



The      horse     that    I was     riding        is twelve       years    old,    e xtremely      calm and          is

well      ex pe ri en ce d wit h        large      crowds.        During    this    period as the           crowd

packed tightly ar ou nd him,                    for some      reason he       panicked and          reined back

for about          five    paces    into the         crowd.        He was    reluctant       to go forward

and      I can only surmise             that he had been struck                on the       head.         I pushed

him forward out of the                   crowd      into L ep pings Lane,          my    concern at this

time was         that     he may strike            out or stand on some             person,      causing
                                                                                                                   PAGE            4

               As other M o u nt ed Officers arri ve d we were able                         to form a complete          line

               a cross     the L ep pi ng s Lane         entrance      from the bridge         to the shop.          Even

               then supporters were                pushing between and under                the horses with

               complete          di sregard for       the i r s a f e t y .



               T here was a br i e-f'Hdme when one young                       horse,   from fear,       m ov ed out of

               the    line and once a ga ir Nt he re was a surge                    towards    the turnstiles.              The

               gap was          quickly filled but \t was at this                   point   that     I saw the

               c o nc er tina gate on the             left o f \ h e \turnstiles          open.      I a s s u m e d that     it

               had been forced open,                  I saw s upporters          running    through this gate and

               a short time             later   the   crush outside           subsided.



               The    remainder         of the supporters           ente re d    in an orderly manner and after

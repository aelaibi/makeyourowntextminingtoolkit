                These guidelines represent the BBC's best
                editorial experience. They are in effect the
                w o rk of generations of factual program m e
                makers in television and radio, and are
                approved at the highest levels in the BBC —
                the Board of Governors and the Board of
                M anagem ent.

                They replace the N ew s a n d C urrent A ffa irs
                Index, the change of name indicating their
                w id e r applicatbn. They provide a ready
                check list of considerations for the range of
                difficult issues program m e makers
                encounter. They advise and guide and rarely
                prescribe, because the proper course is often
                to be determined by detail w h ic h differs from
                case to case.

                They encourage program m es to satisfy the
                better expectations of their audiences. To
                th at end the guidelines insist, directly and by
                implication, on four fundam entals: fairness,
                independence, reliability and sensitivity.

                   ^   ACCIDENTS A N D DISASTERS_________

                       In covering accidents, disasters and disturbances
                       BBC journalists need to balance full, accurate
                       reporting against the obligation to avoid
                       unnecessary distress or anxiety We should be
                       thorough and enterprising and also sensitive. Try to
                       keep the nervous excitement that is natural in
                       handling a big story from infecting the coverage: it
                       might seem to be excitement at an event being
                       enjoyed.

                       1. Concentrate on the Facts
                       ® Times, locations, flight numbers help to provide
                         a context and to minimise the area of concern
                         to viewers and listeners.
                       # Radio Current Affairs programmes wanting to
                         flash reports must liaise with the newsroom.
                         TV news flashes will come only from the
                         newsroom.
                       •   The newsroom must be informed as soon as
                           possible of accidents occurring during an
                           outside broadcast.

                       2. Beware of Hoaxes
                       © Unless the source is impeccable and
                         unmistakably recognised make checks.
                       © Reports of accidents or incidents involving
                         military aircraft must be checked with the
                         Ministry of Defence.
                       *': If a false report is broadcast it must be corrected
                           explicitly at the earliest opportunity.

                       3. Concern for Victims and Relations
                           The BBC should try not to add to the distress of
                           those w ho have been injured or bereaved.
                           Reporters and news gatherers at the scene are
                           often under great pressure, so the process of
                           selection in newsrooms and programmes must
                           take matters of taste and sensitivity very
                           seriously
B B B                      News gatherers, so far as they can, should
'U ID E L IN E S
\R FACTUAL
                           record scenes in such a way that leaves scope
G RAM M ES                 for editing and should try to warn programmes
  where such editing will be essential.
© Hurried, thoughtless questions in interviews hurt
  individuals and damage the BBC's reputation.
  When possible edit out such questions.
© Bodies should not normally or needlessly be
  shown. Great care should be taken even when
  they are covered by blankets.
& There are very few circumstances in which it is
  justified to show executions or other scenes in
  w hich people are killed or are dying.
© Other difficult scenes may need to be shown
  only briefly: an acceptable picture can become
  intolerable because it is shown for too long —
  even by a few seconds.
@ Generally, long shots are less intrusive than
  close-ups.
® Show as little as possible of the news gathering
  process unless it is part of the story. It is often a
  tough, unattractive scramble. When the focus of
  it is a survivor or a bereaved person the sight
  and sounds of jostling reporters and cameramen
  is usually too much.

    Live Coverage
This brings special problems particularly for
television. It is impossible to have full control over
w hat is shown because it is not known w hat will
happen next.
€' People may be shown dying.
    Relatives of victims may see them being injured
    or killed.
Wide and long shot pictures are generally to be
preferred to close-ups. When the pictures are being
supplied by other organisations which may not
have the same scruples as the BBC, our live
programme must be prepared to return to the
studio if there is no other way to avoid showing
w hat could turn out to be unacceptable scenes.

5. Further Considerations
There are times when the considered showing of
  tail of a horror is justified, perhaps to avoid

« nitising reports of a terrorist outrage.
                            It is a fine judgement to be made by
                     1      experienced and sensitive editors. •
                            At other times the impact of the coverage
                            should readily give way to respect for people's
                            feelings.
                          .; We lose support among viewers and listeners
                             when they think we are being sensational. They
                             do not like it when our coverage seems to
                             hound.

                         The public is sometimes upset and angered over
                         scenes in which victims co-operated willingly or
                         even asked for coverage.
                            The public reacts because it does not know the
                            circumstances.
                         ?s A few considerate words of explanation when
                            introducing the scene would prevent much of
                            the anger.

                         6. Programmes need to explore the causes of
                         accidents, even in the immediate aftermath, as
                         there is a proper and natural public interest in what
                         w ent wrong. But there are dangers.
                         # Quick judgements, including those by experts,
                            can be badly wrong. We should not make too
                            much of them.
                         # They can also seem like an insensitive rush to
                            blame which should be avoided.

                         7. It is journalistically proper to withhold names
                         of casualties w hen next of kin have not been
                         informed.
                         9 Allow a reasonable period for the next of kin to
                           be notified personally.
                         © Even if the information has been published
                           elsewhere in the media it might still be proper to
                           hold off for a while.
                         £ W hen names are being withheld avoid other
                           detail which would identify.
                         ® In a few cases, the identity of victims may be an
                           integral part of the story and withholding
  n n n                    information may not be sensible.
 G U ID E L IN E S       ® Normal rules may not apply in the case of
FOR FACTUAL
PROGRAMMES                 publicly important people.

                                                                                 7.
8 . Requests by the Authorities
Requests are sometimes received from the British
or foreign governments for the broadcast of special
announcements. The BBC gives careful
consideration to such requests in the light of the
emergency in question. This applies to the World
Service as well as to the domestic services,
including local radio. It is especially important for
local radio to be ready to assist the authorities
tackling accidents and emergencies, which are
usually localised.

Information from and about special announcements
is normally available for inclusion on merit in news
bulletins. Attempts to confine it to special placings
should be resisted.

Programme
 Guidelines    Foreword by the Director General

                              HESE Guidelines bring together the outcome
                        T     of discussion on certain programme matters
                        b etw een the IBA and the programme com panies
                        over the years in a form that I hope will b e helpful
                        to those who work in Independent Television.
                        The Guidelines w ere first issued in 1977 and
                        revised in 1979 and 1984. They take account of
                        new legislation and experience of programme
                        developm ent in recent years. It is, of course, the
                        responsibility of companies, and not just the IBA,
                        to s e e that the requirements of the Broadcasting
                        Act and of the programme contracts are
                        o b served and that fair practices are established.
                        Most com panies have papers of their own
                        covering matters referred to in these Guidelines.
                        The present intention is to reinforce, and not to
                        supplant, the guidance that com panies have
                        already them selves provided. The existence of
                        written Guidelines should help to maintain good
                        practice, not only betw een the IBA and the
                        com panies, but also betw een the com panies and
                        outside b od ies and individuals.
Introduction

  For reference purposes, TTV m eans the first
 service, as in the Broadcasting Act; 'Independent
  Television1m eans the IBA's television services
 i.e. ITV and Channel 4. The Guidelines do not
 attempt to cover the full range of matters with
 which the IBA is concerned. Not all asp ects of the
 Broadcasting Act, or of the contracts, which deal
 with programme matters are referred to. This is
 not b ecau se they are unimportant, but b ecause
 they have not given rise to the n eed for discussion
 or interpretation. The G uidelines are therefore
 not a com plete guide to good practice in
 Independent Television.
 The Need for Revision
 The Guidelines are not necessarily the last word
 on the matters to which they refer. V iew s and
 attitudes change, and any description of what is
 required of those who m ake and provide the
programm es is bound to b ecom e im com plete
and possibly out-dated. The Guidelines are
subject to interpretation in the light of changing
circumstances, and on som e matters it may be
necessary to provide fresh or revised guidelines
from time to time.
Editorial Discretion
 These Guidelines are therefore not d esign ed to
 fetter normal editorial discretion. They point to
 areas w here careful judgem ent is required on
each occasion, and indicate the general
considerations on which such judgem ents should
b e based. Several sections em phasise the n eed
for consultation with IBA staff on matters of
particular sensitivity.
   The Guidelines do not constitute a C ode
drawn up under Section 5( 1) of the Broadcasting
Act 1981 nor do they represent formal
requirements im posed under Section 5(3) of that
Act. The Authority has drawn up, pursuant to
Section 5, a C ode on the portrayal of violence on
Independent Television and, for e a se of
reference, this is attached at A ppendix 1.

sy m p t o m s ,    which have no physical                                cause.           Various       labels,         including "nervous
shock"            have       been        applied              in    the     past,          and    there        is    a    body        of     medical-

1987        and      had       a      refined            definition              of       PTSD.       It      would        be     reasonable         to
describe            the D S M - I I I - R              definition           of       the    illness        as r e p r e s e n t i n g      a widely

5.         Data    from the Lockerbie ground cases which has undergone preliminary
analysis,           shows       that        PTSD was                the most          common disorder.                      Out        of     the 70
medico-legal cases analysed,                                   PTSD was diagnosed as being present or having
 been       present In the year after the disaster In 51 cases.                                                    At examination In

The second question concerns the remoteness of those likely to. suffer from

the conditions described above.


9.     As     regards              PTSD,         certainly           the    sufferer            must     have           had     exposure         to a
n o x i o u s event.              Without            this,    the d i a g n o s i s c a n n o t be made.                       T h e e v e n t m us t

judged        to       be    likely         to       be " m a r k e d l y      distressing"             to a l m o s t          a n y one.       This
includes           a    wide        range         of    possible           events         and     experiences.                   The     range       of
potential stressors                        to be c o n s i d e r e d        in m a k i n g the d i a g n o s i s                increased from

10.      Examples                given       in      the     DSM-III-R          criteria           include          "serious           threat        tu

18.       There           is      some        evidence             from         the          Lockerbie              cases          that        exposure           to
horrific        sights            is e s p e c i a l l y           related              to     this         key         feature         of     PTSD:        those
with exposure                  to h u m a n d e b r i s            having more                  intrusive                 images and eff orts                     at

also     be s e e n        that        t h e d e g r e e of             exposure,               while         possibly being related                              to
the      extent           of          intrusive              recollection                      and       clearly                  being        related            to
avoidance,               is not        in        fact    related              to o v e r a l 1 p s y c h o l o g i c a l                 disturbance              as

19.       As    regards               the        questions           about             remoteness,                 these          are     impossible              to
answer        with        certainty.                    It    is     probable                 t ha t    most            clinicians             would        agree
that      the       emotional               closeness              of     the           relationship                    matters,          probably            more
than     degree           of      relationship.                     However,                 any       relationship                  between        symptoms
and      closeness              of         relationship                  is        a     very          general             rather            than      precise
relationship.                    In    the        Lockerbie             cas es,              those      who had                also     h ad    a relative
killed         or        injured           did      indeed          score              higher          on     all          t he      measures          studied
(Figure          2).              Although               t he se         differences                    did             no t      reach         statistical
significance                  individually,                  it     must           be        remembered                 that       the       numbers          were
small,         which       makes            it m o r e        difficult                 to    achieve              statistical               significance.
H o w ever,         the c o n s i s t e n c y           of    the       difference                 across           all        measures         suggests              a

It w o u l d       I think            be w i d e l y      accepted           that     the      involvement            of     relatives            or

21.       I was          asked        to c o m m e n t        on    my     personal         experience.               Cases       with         PTSD

this     was        a    mother           whose        t wo     sons       were       trapped         fo r    several         hours          in       a

I have also been asked to comment on Dr Morgan O'Connell's generic report.


Dr   O'Connell            is     well     respected             in    this      area,        and    as        I expected,              I have
found     little          or     nothing        in       his    report        to w h i c h   one should               take exception.
It   is g e n e r a l l y a c c e p t e d      that       the        impact        of    events          is    even        greater        when
disaster       strikes           on     what    would          normally         be      a carefree             occasion,           although
whether       thi s       applies        to     a     large          football crowd            is    debatable               and       whether
football       as     a        'wa y    of     life'          really       compounds          the    problem               is,     I    think,
speculative.              Section            9 of    his       report       however          describes              very     clearly           and
graphically               the          powerful stimuli                   which      give      rise            to     t he        intrusive

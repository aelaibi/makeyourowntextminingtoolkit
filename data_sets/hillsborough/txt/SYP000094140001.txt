On    our a r r i v a l       we       were       met       by f a n s       who       screamed and                pleaded with               us to

open     the      c o n c e r t ina         gates.           One       in    parti c u a l r          came      up to me             and

                                                                            hose       gaes,         there's         kids       being

gates        opened         the    f a ns        more       or    less       fell         through        the       ga t e s .        Several

held     up t h e i r        match          tickets          to be          checked          but      it wa s        impossible             to

then     closed

  and    the vast m a j o r i t y who were a r r i v i n g at around S . 3 0 p m                   (1430) and

  after    had     c o n sumed     large     quant i t i e s   of alcohol.I           was    being a s k e d by

  fans    if they       could t^a'lk down F i e l d i n g           R oad    to an a l l e y    to urinate,

  this was of         course       declined.!       could see             fans climbing        over the •

  fencing       at the e n t r a n c e     to L e p p i n g s Lane and           in my o p i n i o n these

  were    the    ’m o b ’ element.

  I did not get          involved         in the, incij^nt           in the ground a n d           I did not

  see any stewards.

  I did    not     receive a n y ■r a d i o / t r a n s m i s s i o n s     because    none     of the Police

  Constables        in my ey e s i g>ft hfid personal                radios ,howeve r whilst              at the

  junction, two special                 constables w a l k e d       past us and both had                radio's.,

  Myself aifd 'Pc Bt u b b i n g s         only    received         i nformation about            the    disaster

  by r e sydents who were w a t c h i n g a TV and coming                        out to tell          us.As        fans

  were /eav i n g       we were         being met wit h the               full verbal       abuse.I      was     in

  fear/ that       if a fan or Police O f f i c e r a t t e m p t e d to arrest                    or go over

  the top it w o u l d have e r r upted               into a full            scale    battle      outside      the

  Ground.I       have    never      been     in a s i t u a t i o n w here        I was     v e r b a l l y abused

l^with    every swear         wor d ever         invented,I         was     threa t e n e d with assault and

  spat at and         in all       this    1 could not          do a thing,          I had no      radio      to

  call a s s i s t a n c e   or    inform       control    of the events             outside     the ground

  after    the     d i s a s t e r .1nfact myself         an d Pc Stu b b i n g s were          called     to a

  house were a fan had used the                      phone     to    phone       home and      then     collapsed

  into an epileptic, f i t , t h i s             fan was       eventually         conveyed to hospital                by

  ambulance        that we sent           for.

  I can have        no o b s e r va t i o n s    regarding       the      incident     inside      the    ground

  because       I did not         get    involved     but my obs e r v a t i o n s        outside are         get

  the    professional         police       to    carry out       public       order    duties      in an event

  such as this          and any         large    football      m a t c h and get       the     specials       to man

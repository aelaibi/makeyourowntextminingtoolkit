                    I am a married man and I live at the above address,

                    0 n the morning of Saturday             15th October       1969    (151089)   I left

                    Liverpool      in a Hired mini         bus with 13 other youths.

                    At this time I was with my friend Alan Johns vbna,                      of

                           y a 11 o n ■, L iv e r pool »

                    Alan lives at that address with his stepfather and was due to ge

                    mar r ied this year to his g i r 11 riersfi

                    He is a trainee j/n i o r accountant with the Merseyside Region Area
                            -------- B*>*--------------------------------------------------------- -
                    Health Authority at the Fazat^erly Hospital.

                    Upon arrival      in the South Yorkshire area we had called for a few

                    drinks and gradually made our way to the ground.

                    Upon ar r iva I      a tt he   g r ound we s plit up and e nt e red tne        s tad ium at

                    various entrances.

                                                                                                                            S212

         I have known Alan for appr oximately 10 years and over that time he

         has enjoyed full health and as far as                                    I am aware has never suffered

         from any major                 illness.

         Due to an i nc ident within the football                                  stadium I and several other

         colleagues attended the two hospitals                                    in Sheffield the Northern

         General and the Royal Hal lamshi re to try and find Alan Johnstone but

         unfortunately we could not locate h i m .                                  As a last resort we returned

         to the football                 stadium at Hillsborough where                          I made certain

         enquiries.             As a result of these enquiries                             I was shown a number of
    V.
     I t * * ph ot ographs.

          I can say that No. 30 photograph is that of Alan J o h n s t o n e .

         At 9 . 5 0 pm (2150)                on Saturd ay 15th April                1989       (150489)        I was shown a

         body identified to photograph number 30 by Police Constable 1986
          5STEA.
         Sower.  i identified that body as being that of Alan Johnstone the


         man who had travelled with us to Sheffield.
                                                                            /

 HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER - TONY EDWARDS

I wrote to you on 25 November about Tony Edwards, an ambulance attendant whose vehicle
entered the Hillsborough stadium at about 1535 on the day of the disaster. He had sent us a
letter about Inspector Layton and Inspector Sawers, which I copied to you.

 2.      This letter formalises the questions about what Mr Edwards says which Lord Justice
 Stuart-Smith would like to put to Mr Layton and Mr Sawers. These are:

         a)        was Inspector Sawers present when Inspector Layton interviewed Mr Edwards
                   on 21 or 25 October 1989 (which date is correct)?

         b)       was Mr Edwards shown video tapes and photographs of his ambulance on the
                  pitch during this interview?

         c)       when Inspector Sawers interviewed PC Bruder on 3 May 1990 did he know that
                  there was photographic evidence of Edwardsâ€™ ambulance on the pitch consistent
                  with what PC Bruder was saying? If so, how does it come about that he put the
                  contrary to him?

         d)       was Inspector Layton present at the Inquest on 4 May 1990? If so, did he not
                  recognise that what Inspector Sawers was saying at pages 6 & 7 of the transcript
                  of 4 May, about the ambulances was wrong?

 3.      It would help if we could have answers to our questions as soon as possible as the
 scrutiny is now at an advanced stage. I attach two copies of the transcript of the mini-inquest
 on Kevin Williams on 2 and 4 May 1990.

I refer to your letter of 23 October 1997 regarding video C539 being shown in its entirety to the
Coroner's Inquest Jury and requesting a copy of the video tape of the Inquest on the day that it
was played. A copy of the tape is enclosed.

Video C539 was shown in its entirety to the Inquest Jury on the morning of 15 March 1991. At
the request of the Coroner the video is introduced by Police Sergeant John Killick of the West
Yorkshire Police. After the video has been shown the Coroner requested a reference number
and Superintendent Beechey of West Midlands Police gave it the number C539. Sergeant Killick
is then asked to identify the content of the video and does so incorrectly attributing it to TB1
when in fact it shows scenes from TB2 as stated in your letter.

You will note that only the bottom of the large screen on which the video C539 was shown at the
inquest at Sheffield Town Hall is visible from the camera position used to video the inquest
proceedings. It is not therefore possible to see the actual content of C539.

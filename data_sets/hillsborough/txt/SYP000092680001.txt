the awai ting PSV and together with two Police                            officers      per PBV they

were     to be escorted to the ground.

On    completion of the briefing we were                       provided with a packed m e a l , and

after     consuming        this we walked to M i d l a n d S t a t i o n as a serial.                    On

arrival       there at a p pr ox im a t el y      lOVflO am      <1000>    we    remained there and

carried out our duties as                 previousIy\^ated.

Stadium.        On arrival           we went    direc t r v to the gym where we were to be

held on standby.               I am unsure       of the time at this stage,                however,           I

can recall        that     on our arrival         at the       ground there was         considerable

R adio    traffrs^,      ail    relating       to probIems       being    suffered at        the L.sppings

Lane     entrance      tQ~N^he^g^jund.           1 cannot       recall    any    particular      officers

however      the s i t uation sou nded very hectic.                    We were      immediately told

to    leave the gym and go onto the track                       s urrounding      the   pitch and go to

the Lepping Lane            terraces where         problems were          being     encountered.              As

far as       I am aware we were           not told what          the   problems were at that

particular        end of the grountTT^As we wa l k e d                 round the track          to the

Leppings Lane          terraces        I can r e ca Irsthat       t h e niat c h ha d n o t s t a r t e d ■

At that       stage    there were only           " A r e a ’ Police    officers      from F D i v i s i o n

on the       perimeter      track.       Those    I r ecognised were PC *s MARSDEN,                 WALPOLE!

and BROOKES.          As    I got to the L e p p i n g s Lane          end of the ground the

Liverpool       supp o r t e r s were     throwing       coins and verbal           abuse at     the

Poli ce officers.              They were also          spitting at them and shouting

* Fucking murderers,                 do something.''       The Srfeole feeling          of this     crowd

squashed against            the mesh,      their       faces    bulging    through the h 0 i.es, they

were     vomitting       on the       person next to them and those                 that    could still

and     the     s o u n d was    one     of    peo pie      ts^y i ng a n d a wax ling          sound       that    I have

abuse      at    the    Police        and     spittinq       at    them.        As   I passed      behind      the    goal

at    the Leppings Lane                end of the ground the                    crush    inside       the    pens

seemed        to be getting worse,                  1 could see           children and teenagers                   being

physically          crushed against               the mesh,         their       faces were       turning       purple,

their      eyes bulging and vomit and saliva trickling                                       from their mouths.

I then saw a man of about                                         years.                hair,    and               jacket

he was at the front                   of the      crush and his face was                     totally distorted

w ith     being     crushed against               the mesh.          He had turned             purple and          it was

obvious         that he was           dead.       I realised that               if something was             not done

there were          going       to be more          deaths        in that       pen.

At    briefing         ti^at morning           1 had been          issued w i t h N a        personal       radio    the

noise      from the       crowd was such that                     I could       not h e a r \ a n y t h i n g at all.

1 called         control        severa^times               on the    radio       but    I h e a r V n o res p o n s e .

I do not know whether                   they heard me or whether                       the    noise was       such that

I could not hear                them a ck no wl e d g i n g my           call.       A gain    I can remember

s houting down the               radio that there were                     dead      people     in the      crowd.        The

scene and the sound                    at the front           of those          terraces was unbelievable..

I was      now near to one               o f 'the small access              gates       that    lead into the

terraces,         and    I real is^Td^that this must                      be opened          i mmediately       in an

a 11 e ifip^NtiO get      into         the peoplfes^i ns i d e .           I looked          round for a

s u p e r v i s o r y officer          but 1 could not see                 one.        Together then with

several         other    officers           using     our own       in          t i v e we opened        the gate at

the     left     of the goal           leading        into the ter race's^ i n yo the                 centre       pen.

On opening          the door          1 intended to enter                 the     centre      pen are a and try

to    render what assis t a n c e                I could,         however       once    the door was opened

outward         it became apparent                that the         crush was         such that        no one       could
                                                                                                             PAui-       4
                                                                                                             £>3694

     such an extent        that    the    two or three a c t u a l l y              in front      of the door

     could not get out,           they were wedg><|^ t o g e t h e r .

     Together with several            other Police                of Fixers       I began to attempt         to

     force the s u pporters         back,    to relieve                 the    crush,    however    1 immediately

     realised that        this was futile and                    t>njrs was      no way that       this    crush of

     bodice     could be forced back.                     I then beg^p dragging             out    supporters

     from the     pen,    these however were                    the ones       that had been stood several

     rows    back they were        climbing              over the heads          of the ones at the front

     who were     still    crushed together                 so that       they could not move.              As we


r    were

     kicking
             helping     thfe-E^e fans out       onto

                 out at the P'olice and hurling abuse at them.
                                                                the   pitch they were striking and

                                                                                                 It was    obvious

     that    the m a j o r i t y of thk<f(\ we re drunk and on several                      occasions       I was

     struck and kicked           by these supporters.

     As    I helped the first         initial            wave of s u pporters            out they mainly

     a p p e ar ed alright     and they made their way                        round the track to the North

     Stand.      After    this    first wave              had    come    out    the supporters       that we were
                                                 ''-s,
     helping     out were      in a worse        co'mjition,             although       1 would say that most

     of them a p p e ar ed to be still                   breatnkqa.           It was    during    this    that    1

     lost my uniform helmet,              my tie and my PcHsj^ce spectacles,                        recovering my

     helmet     later    on that    day.      I pulled one                suppehcjper out who was wearing

     all    d e n i m s , and he a p p e ar e d to be still               breathing,       as    I pulled him

     onto the pitch he vcmitted, and at that point I was joined by
I?         W-5 5 8 G   "
     Inspector HA R V E Y and^i^ogether we wa l k e d him around on the pitch until

     he had     calmed down and w a s Xb re a t h i n g more                   normally.        I then    left this

     man with     Inspector H A R V EY and                rejfrdned other          officers at the         gate.

     D uring all     this time we were still                      Being       abu s e d by the    rest of the

     crowd    inside     the   pen- and numerous                 supporters who we had alre a d y                got

     out    onto the     pitch were       fighting with myself and other                          officers       in an

     attempt     to get Pack       into    the           pen.

     On several      occasions      1 had great                 difficulty        convincing      these    people

                                                                                                           S 3694

    that     they    could not go back            in and that       they were only getting                 in the

    way of rescue attempts.                   The m a j o r i t y of them after              being    initially

    very agg re s s i v e     towards me would simply break                  down and start              crying,

    and slump down onto              the    pitch.

    It was at some           point    during      this    I cannot     recall        exactly w h e n that            I

    realised        un at   the tgame      hacn a c.ti.ia.tIy s uar 1.-0 u., a s x    .1 e     a f an o u o o n uo

    the    pitch and handed him over                   to other Police       officers who were                 stood

    behind     I saw the game           in progress.

    As    1 looked along at           the fence awa y from the gate to either                           side    I

    could still        see    people trapped who were               either      dead or very near to

    d eath that we still csouldn’t get to.
                   A/(e(^    XJ
    I then saw PS K NI GH TS and a P ol i c e w o m a n stood on the hoardings                             several

    y ards    from the gate,
                           lifting supporters over the fence.  I joined them

    aftti^assisted in lifting several fans over this fence and handing them

    down to lifts£i cers who were              stood on the track.              These were all            still

    alive     through       lVa    various      state     of health.

    As we     l ifted one supporter             over     I realised      that there were               no Police

    officers        to hand him down ta so               I climbed down still                holding     this

    youth.      1 carried him onto               the    pitch where a f t e r    1 a s c e r t a i n e d that he

    was    in fact s t i 1 l N & r e a t h i n g . 1 left him and returned to the fence.                                  1

^   perimeter        track.       PS M O R T b w thten ran off towards               the gym area.             The

    pitch     in front       of the Leppings Lane end was                 littered with               people,       the

    m a t c h had b e e r N <t op pe d at some stage.

    I then heard a siren and on 1                           g towards     the gym a rea              I saw a St

As    1 got        to the gate      leading      into    the   centre      pen numerous         other

the    pitch.          I ^>«^lised that several            Police Officers were              now    inside

the    centre        pen,    rendeNijig first aid to fans on the terraces.                           These

officers           inside    began to     p!**»s out b o d i e s      to us and we were          then

passing        them down the funnel              o^ito inf pitch where other Police were

tending        them.        it was obvious        toV>e    tnat       the vast m a j o r i t y of these

fans were           dead.      Their   bodies were \^njpF their              faces were         purple.,    they

were     covered        in vomit,      and they all        had several         items of      clothing

missing       or hanging         off them      in tatters,

Chief S u pe ri nt en de nt NESS1T joined officers                       inside   the     pen and was

a s s is t i n g    in handing      bodies     out to myself and other              officers who were

on the track.

O c c a s i o n a l l y someone w ould        shout,     “This one's still          alive" and that

particular           body w ould       be rushed out through             the gate and        laid onto          the

s u p p or te rs .i n    rendering       first aid.        The     sight    of these     bodies was

terrible           as non&vtjad any a p p arent          injuries other         than    purple      faces.

They were           obv i o u s l y suffe ring    from    crush       injuries.

I remained outside at                  theNgate    helping       to    lift bodies      out and onto            the

we formed a cordon a p pr ox im at el y                        way up the terraces,              to preserve

the    scene.            The    terraces were         littered w ith shoes,            items of      people's

clothing,           money,     s p ectacles    etc.

As    I stood        in this     cordon    1 looked onto the              pitch and saw that other

officers           had formed a c o r d o n across         the     pitc h at about        the    c e nt r e o f

the    field,        thereby     containing       the Liverpool          supporters and the             injured

    that Police an d supporters were                    pulling        the a d v e r t i s i n g    hoardings          down

    that were        round the ground and were                 using      them as s tretchers               to    carry

    bodies     to the gym area.

    All    during      this time we were          being    s u bjected to continual                      abuse    from

    Liverpool        s u pporters who were above               us    in the seating            in the West

    Stand,     they were also still              spitting       on us and shouting,                     "Fucking

    m u r d e r e r s ” and    ‘"This    is all your     fucking         fault, "

    After a period of time the word was                        passed along           the     cordon to          return

    onto    the    pitch,        I did this and along with several                          other       officers

    broke     up numerous         fights     that were     taking         place     between Liverpool

\   supporters,           It became apparent            that    these       fights were            the    result of

    onKian        blaming the Police            for what       had happened and the second one

    a p p a r e n t i y ^ de f endi ng them.     Once    this       s i t u a t i o n had    calmed down,          I

    remained ,on t n ^ p i t c h          together with other             officers a s s i s t e d         in

    carrying fche woundes^ to the gym area and also a t t e m p t e d to get the

    fans    that     could walk         ujNrided off the        pitch,         Several        supporters asked

    me    if the m atch had been             postponed and after asking                      other Police

    officers       1 was       informed that      it in fact had .-'been.                   During a lull          in

    this a c t i o n    I met PS M O R G AN and after               conversing with him for a period

    of time we obtai n e d a drink               of water       from a bucket               brought       round the

    field by a man             in a t racksuit who was an e m p 1oyee of Sheff ieId

           I assisted        in loading       the    injured      into ambulances,        and at  one point I

that     had opened            1t .     My son,               two friends            and m y s e l f were       the

•first    half         dozen    people        to get      ou\throuqh            this     gate     onto   the     space

Jaehind the            goal.      This w o u l d be a b o u t \ w o            or '’three minutes          past

three.        We       c e r tainly w e r e n ’t in the            pen from          the worst       of the      crush

for more        than about             two minutes.            There      were a        lot of people           f o 11 owed

us t h r o u g h the        gate and          the     police      in the       vi c i n i t y did not appear at

first     to know e x a c t l y what                do do.

I myself,          never       having        been     inside      the    pen was       not aware         initially

just     how serious            the     crush was and             I ’m sure      that a l t h o u g h the Police

at the        front      knew s o m e t h i n g was wrong               they    didn't       realise      that      people

were     going         to die.         1 then       im m e d i a t e l y star t e d     to w a 1k along         the    back

of the        pitch      in the        direction        of the S o u t h S t a n d and the               base    of my

ribs     were a bit            sore     t h r o u g h the     crush and myself and my son and his

f>4ends        sat, down on a beneh                   near    to the      corner       of the      ground where

there     were         some St.        Johns     Amb u l a n c e men.          A P o 1 icewoman        came     over    to

us        told me that we                   c o u l d n ’t stay    there       but    she    jret us     into    the

pens     down      t   /2 on the        plan of the           ground      t hrough       the    pitch g a t e .

There     was      plenty       of     room     inside       there and         I was     still     unaware       of how

serious        the      s i t u a t i o n was    as    I am sure were            the Police,,

At     this    time      the    game was         still       being      played and as           I looked        back

toW9t<ds the            rear    of     the    goal     I could sXe         people        being      carried out         of

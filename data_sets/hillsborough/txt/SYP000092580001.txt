             Further to the questionnaire that I completed for the West Midlands

             Police today'"H?1289> .                                    ftzS)   S   I 51 O     .
              I climbed out of perVyfour and into pen five at about ten past three

              (1510).       I left pen fiveXyia\the gate in the front perimeter fence and

             pent onto the playing area,

              I had been on the? pitch for between five and ten minutes, when I saw

             some     lads car ryini_ja person on an advertising ho arding.                        I was in the

              penalty area of the LeppiTtg^ Lane goal, somewhere between the six yard
   & A aW ( -
         \    box and the eighteen yard box, TXa the left of the goal as you look

              from the. Kop end.         There were six or\seven lads carrying this hoarding

             with a person lying on it.               I went to trn^e i^ads and took up a

              position at the rear of the hoarding.                   I helped to carry the hoarding

             as far as the half way line, and then left the lads when I realised
                                                                            PAGE           S
                                                                            S3&84

that they d i d n ’t need my assistance.        I ca n ’t remember anything about

the person on that hoarding except that           it was a male person and that

he was dead.

Having    left that hoarding,    I went across to the No/-^t|i^^n.d and

together with another      lad that I did not know,       I picked up another

hoarding in front of the North Stand.            The hoarding had already beers

ripped down.     We carried the hoarding back towards the Leppings Lane

end.     We went to the grass area behind the goal         line near to the goal

itself.    This was to the left of the goal as you look from the kop

end,   virtually in frcNjt of pen t h r e e .    In this area there was a lad

lying on the grass who w^s obviously d e a d .        There were people

standing around him,      I car)' t remember if they were Police or

supporters.     We put the hoarding down and the people who had been

standing by the lad,      placed him on the ho arding.      Together with five

other lads, I carried that hoarding to the far end of the ground.                I

was at the rear of the hoarding on the left hand side.             The person on

the hoarding was lying with his fset towards me.            When we got to the

far corner o^M^he ground, in between the North Stand and the Kop, we
                     o q x
were directed to the gymnasium.  I. believe it was a Policeman who

directed us towards the gymnsium.         When we got to the entrance to the

gymnasium, a person there,       X believe      it was a St Johns ambulanceman

asked each of us if we knew the person on the hoarding.             We each said

that we diidjn’t know the person.       The St Johns ambulanceman then asked

me if I wou ld N^e 1p to carry the person into the gymnasium.             We placed

the hoarding down/^&Qd then together with somebody else,            I c a n ’t

remember who    I carried the person into the gy mnasium.         I was    carrying

the person by his legs.       When we entered the gymnasium I could see

that there were already a number of bodies            laid out on the floor.         The

bodies were lying in rows and I would estimate that there were already

about twenty bodies already in the gymnasium.             We placed the body down
                                                                                            PAGE       3
                                                                                            S3684

         on the gymnasium floor next to another body,                  A uniformed Policeman,

         he was wearing a helmet, approached us and he said to me something

         like,     "Will you stay with him."           I said,    "Not really, n o , I d o n ’t know

         him."The Policeman said something              like,    "okay fair enough."      I then

         left the Policeman and the body and then left the gymnas ium .                    I

         cannot remember anything about the Policeman who remained with the

         body.     I am very vague about time,
                                            but I would estimate that I helped
                                                 S o* €          ® .
         carry that person to the gymnasium at some time between three thirty

         (3.30 pm)     (1330) and three forty five          (3.45 pm)     (1543).

         The person that I carried to the gymnasium was a white male and aged

         between twenty five and thirty.               He had short hair,     cut above the

         ears,     I can't remember the colour.           He was clean shaven.        He was about

         five feet ten inches in height and was quite stockily built with

         broad shoulders.      As best I remember he wore a ^enim shirt and denim

^   [J   jeans

                                           I think he wore white training shoes.

         On Sunday 16 April        198      (160489)    I saw a photograph on the front page

         of the News of the World n e w ^ a ^ e r .        The photograph depicts a dead

         body lying on the pitch at Hillsborough.                I am certain that the body

                                   X
         in the picture was thg\same body that I carried to the gymnasium.                         -
                                                                                                   i

         am fairly certain that I could identify the body from the picture if

         necessary.

         At Hillsborough I wore the following              clothing       A whitBO long sleeved

         shirt, with                          stripes.     Therexare two s H s      of stripes,

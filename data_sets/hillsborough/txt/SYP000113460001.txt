w ith Liverpool                              supporters            who were       drinking and who were               in very high

spirits,                  singing and                     shouting.         As    I left       the 'premises,       I spoke        to

the          licensee who                         said      that    the fans were             not     presenting    him with a

problem.                    I told him that                        if they       continued to           consume    dr i n k , it was

unlik e l y that they would be a d m i t t e d                                         to the       football     match.

been and there were                                     very few football               fans    still making        their way

several                 occasions                  over a five minute                  period       1 heard the     phrase        ’Open

originated.                              At this          stage     however,          there was nothing           to suggest           that

there was a n y thing                                  other     than a busy sporting                  event    taking    place.

Since               our     pre-match duties were                            c o m p l e t e ? I ordered the        driver        to

make              his way towards                         the football           ground and from there we would go

to C l aywheels Lane                                   if we were        not     required further.               Radio

transm i s s i o n s                       continued to be a g i t a t e d and were                      becoming     confusing and

u n i n telligible                           and       it became        inc r e a s i n g l y apparent         to me that

something                   serious                a p p e a r e d to be building              up..

I appro a c h e d                        the      ground by way            of C a t chbar Lane and turned                 left     into
Leppings Lane.               There was a group of about                           six Police        officers at the

Catchbar Lane,            Leppings Lane                j u n ction and they gave                the a p p e a r a n c e      of

just having           completed           their       p r e-match d u t i e s .

On a p p r o a c h    to the        turnstile area at                 the Lepping Lane              end of the

ground there were                still      a few fans milling around                       but     there was         no

crush and no disorder and as a result                                   of what       1 saw,      1 ordered my

serial       to    remain     in their           vehicle whilst              I went      to find out            if we

were    required for             further         duties.           There     seemed to be sufficient

the    fans were         being a d d r e s s e d by an              Inspector who was               sitting        on the

roof of a Police L and Rover and using                                  the vehicle's           public address

system.           1 a sked Chief           Inspector Waring                if my serial           was    required and

at    first       he said that            he had nothing              for us but         it was       clear that            he

himself       did not        know what           the       si t u a t i o n was    inside     the     ground.           Fans

were    still        a r r iving     in L e p pings Lane at 2 . 5 5 p m .                  Many were waving

ti ckets      i n the ai r and we re b 9 hav ing                      i n a manne r whi ch indi cated that

they    had       been    drinking.             For    the     number      of     fans   that     were     in     Che a r e a

at    that    time,       I would         say    that       there     were       sufficient       Police        officers;

d e p l o y e d at    that    location.               At    some    stage        I was   told     that     the     ground

was    closed and          t h at    we    were       required        to    prevent      furtner        fans     from

entering.            Together        with       officers         from      Inspector       M i l l e t t ’s s e r i a l ,    we

formed a          cordon across            the    entrance          and     prevented        further       fan,     some

of w h o m w e r e       waving      tickets,          from      entering.

Supe r i ntendent Marshall                  then ordered              that       tne area      immedi a t e l y to the

rear    of the West S tand                 be cleared of fans as the area was                              becoming

c ongested and we             thought           t,hat the        game      had faeen stoppad for                sorne

reason which was as yet                     unknown to us.                  As    I went     to the       rear     of the

West     stand,       I oa s s e          n a rnb iLUa n c:e w hich was            parked m ^ t h e         r

roadway which             runs      round towards               the S o u t h stand.          Several           injured

people were           being a t t e n d e d       to at the           rear       of the a m b u l a n c e and as            I

                                                                                                                    R 273

      strode      over   one    person       I noticed that he was                 receiving        oxygen and

      that    he was     blue    in the      face.         1 n s p e c t o r 1'1LLL 6 t1 said      "It    looks as

      though he *s a gonner".                This      person was           receiving a t t e n t i o n at the

      time and our a s s i s t a n c e was           not    required         there.     With hindsight                  I now

      realised that that              person was alre a d y dead.

      As we arri v e d at the           rear of the West                stand m ? a ^ to the ^ ^ t ^ a ^ c e

      the tunnel,         it became      clear       to me       that     it was    impossible           to   clear          the

      area    because        there were       too many           injured     p e o p 1 a on the g r o u n d.            We

      would have         been driving         un i n j u r e d    people     over the      top of        people who

      were    a p p a r e n t l y s e r iously    injured.          The     situation at this             stage was

      one    of   chaos wit h        individual        officers         not aware what was               required or.

      in fact what the            s i tuation was          inside       the ground.          For    some       reason as

      yet    unknown to me the fans were a p p r o a c h i n g Police                        officers and

      saying      that    it was all         the fault           of the Police.            In between various

      0 u t b urs t s o f v i o 1e n t a b u s e f r o m t h e f a n s , ma ny o f w h o m were               d ru n k , I

      a t t e m p t e d to assess      the    situation.            Police      officers and fans were
i t
      carrying      injured       persons        up the tunnel            from the     terraces.              lne

      injured were           strewn on the ground at the                     rear of the West             stand and            I

      only began to           realise     the     real     enormity of the            s i t uation when             I

      turned      round an d saw that             the head of one             of the       injured had been

      covered over and he had been                     left       u n a t t e n d e d and quite a pp a r e n t l y

      dead.       This was      the first         time     that      X knew that       someone       had been

      killed and from that              point       on it became apparent                  that man y         people had

      b e e n k i 11 e d »    I n j u r e d a n d ci& a d fans were          bei n g carried out              of    the

the situation           faced     by. many       officers at that            location.         The a rea was

eventually         littered with         probably about             15 bodies       none    of w h i c h had a

Police-officer            in attendance.             I tried to allocate a Police                    officer

to each body but              I believe       that    I failed       in this       task as the        officers

were    event u a l l y each faced with               life     or death situations where                   they

m ay have      been of help, to someone who                    could be saved.

This was a very            confused      period during w hich               I had    little      or no

perception of time a l t h o u g h I can               remember       several       times

At various         times      during    this     period      I saw and spoke          to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Marshal 1, Chief           Inspector W a r i n g , Inspector Millett,                     Inspector Bullas

and    Inspector Sykes.

We were       later     required       to go onto        the    pitch and face the              crowd?      most

of whom were          still      in the stadium.             During      the time that          1 was on the

I remained         in the      stadium    until       it had been          cleared of fans and              later

                 THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


                                          Inspector C*E. Walker


At 9.00 am on Saturday, 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at Force
Headquarters for deployment in connection with, the FA Cup Semi-
Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

Together with several hundred other officers, I attended a
briefing given by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and other
senior police officers in the North Stand at Sheffield Wednesday
Football Ground, Hillsborough*   Following the briefing at 10.^5 am
I was deployed on mobile patrol in the Middlewood, Oughtibridge,
Deepcar and Stocksbridge areas with instructions to watch for
Liverpool supporters approaching along the A, 6l6 route.  Of the
three mobile serials under my command, I commenced patrol with
Police Sergeant Hunt and his serial.

For two hours we maintained a patrol along the A.616, paying
particular attention to licensed premises along the route*
Throughout this time there was a steady stream of vehicular traffic
apparently bring fans to the football match*   Some public houses
appeared to be well frequented by football supporters but during this
period I did not encounter any trouble*

At 1**12 pm together with Sergeant Hunt, I visited licensed premises
known as The Silver Fox at Stocksbridge*    These premises were
crowded with Liverpool supporters who were drinking and who were in
very high spirits, singing and shouting.    As I left the premises, I
spoke to the licensee who said that the fans were not presenting him
with a problem*    I told him that if they continued to consume drink,
it was unlikely that they would be admitted to the football match*
                                                      ©   *
As the time for the match approached, I deployed progrssively
nearer to Hillsborough and at about 2*30 pm we positioned our vehicle
in a side road, just off the main road at Oughtibridge*   By this
time traffic travelling towards Sheffield was much lighter than it
had been and there were very few football fans still making their
way towards the match*

It was our intention to go to Claywheels Lane Traffic Garage to take
a meal at 3*15 P“> as we had been ordered but as we listened to the
UHF radio transmissions, it became increasingly clear that all was
not as it should be in the vicinity of the football ground.    Radio
transmissions began to be shouted in an agitated manner and on.
several occasions over a five minute period I heard the phrase ’Open
the gate.'   This phrase was repeated at least six times and on each
accasion there seemed to be more urgency in the voice of the person
transmitting the message*    I have no idea from whom the message
originated*   At this stage however, there was nothing to suggest
that there was anything other than a busy sporting event taking place.

Since our pre-match duties were complete, I ordered the driver to
make his way towards the football ground and from there we would go
to Claywheels Lane if we were not required further*   Radio transmissions
continued to be agitated and were becoming confusing and unintelligible
and it became increasingly apparent to me that something serious appeared
to be building up*
                           - 2 -


I approached the ground by way of Catchbar Lane and turned left into
Leppings Lane,   There was a group of about six Police Officers at
the Catchbar Lane, Leppings lane junction and they gave the appearance
of just having completed their pre-match duties.

On approach to the turnstile area at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground there were still a few fans milling around but there was no
crush and no disorder and as a result of what I saw, I ordered my
serial to remain in their vehicle whilst I went to find out if we
were required for further duties*   Ehere seemed to be sufficient
Police officers at the turnstile area to cope with late arrivals
and the fans were being addressed by an Inspect©* who was sitting on
the roof of a Police Landrover and using the vehicle’s public address
system,   I asked Chief Inspector Waring if my serial was required
and at first he said that he had nothing for us but it was clear that
he himself did not know what the situation was inside the ground.
Fans were still arriving in Leppings Lane at 2,55 P®»   Many were
waving tickets in the air and were behaving in a manner which indicated
that they had been drinking.   For the number of fans that were in the
area at that time, I would say that there were sufficient Police officers
deployed at that location.   At some stage I was told that the ground was
closed and that we were required to prevent further fans from entering.
Together with officers from Inspector Millett's serial, we formed a
cordon acroos the entrance and prevented further fans, some of whom
were waving tickets, from entering.

Superintendent Marshall then ordered that the area immediately to the
rear of the West Stand be cleared of fans as the area was becoming
congested and we thought that the game had been stopped for some reason
which was as yet unknown to us.   As I went to the rear of the West
Stand, I passed an ambulance which was parked on the riverside roadway
which runs round towards the South Stand.   Several injured people were
being attended to at the rear of the ambulance and as I strode over one
person I noticed that he was receiving oxygen and that he was blue in
the face.   Inspector Millett said, "It look's as though he's a gonner."
This person was receiving attention at the time and our assistance was
not required there.   With hindsight I now realise that that person was
already dead.

As we arrived at the rear of the West Stand near to the entrance to the
tunnel, it became clear to me that it was impossible to clear the area
because there were too many injured people on the ground.    We would have
been driving uninjured pepople over the top of people who were
apparently seriously injured.    The situation at this stage was one of
chaos with individual officers not aware what was required or in fact
what the situation was inside the ground.    For some reason as yet unknown
to me the fans were approaching Police officers and saying that it was
all the fault of the Police.    In between various outbursts of violent
abuse from the fans, many of whom were drunk, I attempted to assess the
situation.   Police officers and fans were carrying injured persons up
the tunnel from the terraces.    The injured were strewn on the ground
at the rear of the West stand and I only began to realise the real
enormity of the situation when I turned round and saw that the head of
one of the injured had been covered over and he had been left unattended
and quite apparently dead.    This was the first time that I knew that
someone had been killed and from that point on it became apparent that
many people had been killed.    Injured and dead fans were being
carried out of the tunnel continually and taken to the rear of the
Leppings Lane entrance.    I gave artificaial respiration to one full
grown male person whose face was covered in thick vomit.    My impression

           was that I was pumping beer out of the body which showed no signs of life
           at any time.   Eventually I was joined by an ambulance attendant who
           administered oxygen for a short time but to no avail.    I left the body
           and went to find someone who could still be helped and this was the
           situation faced by many officers at that location.    The area was
           eventually littered with probably about 15 bodies none of which had a
           Police officer in attendance.   I tried to allocate a Police officer
           to each body but I believe that I failed in this task as the officers
           were eventually each faced with life or death situations where they may
           have been of help to someone who could be saved.

           This was a very confused period during which I had little or no perception
           of time although I can remember several times automatically looking at
           my wristwatch, the time did not register.   At various times during this
           period I saw and spoke to Superintendent Marshall, Chief Inspector Waring,
           Inspector Millett, Inspector Bullas and Inspector Sykes.

           We were later required to go onto the pitch and face the crowd, most of
           whom were still in the stadium.   During the time that I was on the pitch,
           I remember speaking to Superintendent Greenwood, Inspector Harper,
           Inspector Purdey and Chief Superintendent Nesbit.

           I remained in the stadium until it had been cleared of fans and later
           regrouped together with about 200 officers in the briefing area of the
           North Stand.

           By this time all the officers were suffering from deep shock and at the
           suggestion of Superintendent Brookfield I assisted in trying to identify
           Police officers who required immediate help.

           During the main part of this incident I never made use of the UHF radio
           system as I judged that any attempt to have done so would have been
           futile.   The radio messages were inaudible, incessant and confused.

           After being released from the ground I assisted in general policing duties
           including organising the transportation of equipment for the Major Incident
           Room.

           At 8.30 pm I went off duty at Force Headquarters.

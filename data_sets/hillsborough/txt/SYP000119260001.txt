                  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - 16 APRIL 1989



                  I commenced duty at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground at

C   ^             9,45     a.m.   on S a t u r d a y , 15th Apri 1, 1989, and a 10 a.m. briefing took

                  place in the North Stand by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.                I was

                  under the supervision of Police Sergeant C h a p m a n , serial       1 covering

                  track duties throughout the operation.            Briefing was completed at

                  approximately 10.20 a.m. and I subsequently took up a position on the

                  track under the North Stand between the half way 1 ine and the Spion

                  Kop e n d ,     I usu ally work the same duty for all Sheffield Wednesday

                  home games and I have worked many semi-finals at the ground during my

                  14 years Police s e r v i c e .    I usually take up the same position as

                  stated for all m a t c h e s .

                  I noticed that a few fans had entered the Spion Kop by 11.40 a.m. and

                  there was a constant trickle of fans arriving after this time again on

                  the Spion Kop       (Notts Forest f a n s ).

                  Meal was taken at approximately 1.15 p.m.           on the direct ion of Pol ice

                  Sergeant Chapman and this was a hot meal           eaten in the gymnasium at

                  the rear of the North S t a n d .
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             R287

I returned to my previous position on the track at approximately

1.40 p.m.    I remember that by this time the Spion Kop had filled up

considerably and by 2.15 p.m.         the Spion Kop and South Stand appeared

to be nearing full capacity,       these parts of the ground being taken up

by Notts Forest f a n s .   At this same time I noticed that the North

Stand was perhaps only half full and this also being the case with

the West Stand seats.

The Leppings Lane terrace has three pens for standing only and at

approximately 2.15 p.m.      I can recall the centre pen being quite f u l l ,

the pen nearest the police control was about one third f u l 1 and the

pen towards the North Stand was almost empty.           This was certainly

unusual for a semi-final match being only 45 minutes from kick off

time.   It was obvious that the Liverpool fans had not arrived at the

ground early as the Spion Kop and South Stands containing the Notts

Forest fans were almost f u l 1.

By approximately 2.45 p.m.      the North Stand appeared to be quite f u l 1

but the Liverpool fans in the seats directly facing me were very

intoxicated.    At normal Sheffield Wednesday matches such youths would

have been arrested at the turnstiles for being drunk at a

sportsground.     The pro blem was that all     the young white males aged

about 20-30 years were all the same and it would have been impossible

to arrest them a l 1.     It was quickly evident that these Liverpool fans

were very hostile and abusive towards myself as a Police Officer and

Press photographers who were taking up positions on the track n e a r b y .

At about this time      (2.45 p.m.)   I can r e c a l 1 hearing on my personal

r a d i o , Superintendent M a r s h a l 1 at the Leppings Lane turnstiles

stating there was a serious problem with the crowd outside and that

he wanted to have the main gate o p e n e d .    I recal1 Superintendent

M a r s h a l 1 asking for the gates to be opened about 3 or 4 times during

the following few minutes and from his v o i c e , he was obviously in
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    R287

some distress.          I remember Police Sergeant 626 Goddard in the Police

Control saying over the radio,          "IF IT LOOKS AS THOUGH SOMEONE MIGHT

BE KILLED THEN W E ’LL HAVE TO OPEN THE G A T E . ”

By 2.55 p.m.         the central pen for standing at the Leppings Lane end

appeared to be absolutely packed solid whilst the pen towards the

Police Control was about half f u l 1 and the pen towards the North

Stand was perhaps only one sixth f u l l .         For normal big games the

standing fans at the Leppings Lane terrace have filled each pen

slowly well before kick o f f .       I did not hear any radio message for

the entrance to the central pen to be closed o f f , despite this being

packed sol i d .

At this time (2.55 p . m . ) the Liverpool        team came onto the pitch to

’warm u p ’ and this brought the usual         ’big c h e e r ’ from the Liverpool

fans.    I then heard Police Constable 1863 Buxton on the Pol ice radio

asking for the kick off to be delayed.             I heard Police Sergeant 616

Goddard in Police Control say,          " W E ’VE NO C H A N C E , ONE OF THE TEAMS IS

ALREADY O U T . "     The Notts Forest team and the officials had NOT at

this point come out onto the pitch.            About two minutes later the

Notts Forest team and officials did come out onto the pitch to more

cheers.     I felt that fans outside the ground trying to get in would

become    ’e x c i t e d ’ by hearing a l 1 the cheering and that it could make

things w o r s e .

The game kicked off at 3 p.m. and after only a few minutes Liverpool

hit the c r o s s b a r , again making the crowd shout with e x c i t e m e n t .

Normally I would by this time take up my seat on the track (when

Police Sergeant Chapman retreated into the players t u n n e l ), but as I

looked towards the Leppings Lane terrace (now approximately 3.05 p.m

I could see fans being allowed onto the track from the p e n s .               At

this time the drunken Liverpool fans in the North Stand directly in

front of me were shouting abuse and threatening an official Press
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               R287

photographer who was directing his camera towards the Leppings Lane

terraces.       1 realised that these fans were so hostile that I told the/

photographer to go away as I believed he was in danger of being

attacked,

There were now Liverpool fans running down the track in front of the

North Stand obviously having come onto the track from the Leppings

Lane t e r r a ce .   I stopped the first three youths and asked them where

they were going.           They all produced North Stand seat tickets so I

directed them to go towards the Spion Kop then turn left to get into

the seating a r e a .      By now a l 1 I could see at the Leppings Lane end

was people spilling out onto the track and P o ljnt* o f f icers trying to

prevent them going onto the pitch.             I then saw Chief Superintendent

nurirflnfiolrd run onto the pitch towards the r e f e r e e , obviously

requesting him to stop the g a m e .      The players all then went off the

field and by this time there were          1   iterally hundreds of fans s p i 1 1 ing

out onto the track through the gates at the Leppings Lane t e r r a c e .

I recal1 Inspector Sewell saying on Pol ice             radio he had f ive   serials

in the gym which were then sent out to the              track in front of    the

North Stand and Leppings lane t e r r a c e .       I then saw the St. John's

Ambulance drive across the pitch to the track in front of the

Leppings Lane terrace.

I was at this time in the same position on the track to prevent the

drunken Liverpool fans invading the pitch,              but assisted by another

Serial who were spread out in front of the              North S t a n d .
                                                                                         i
By 3.15 p.m. a number of casualties were being carried cross the                         I

carried on advertising hoardings by other f a n s .             It was now apparent      i

that a large number of fans had been crushed in the central pen.

It was not u n t i 1 about 3.15 p.m.      that the scale of the disaster

became a p p a r e n t .   I was by now very frightened for my own safety as

to place a male casualty onto an advertising hoarding on the pitch so               }

I went to a s s i s t .   I then helped carry this casualty up the track to

the gymnasium at the rear of the North Stand.               There was a serial of

Police forming a cordon to the entry at the rear of the North S t a n d .

There was only just sufficient room to get the casualty into the gym

where other officers pulled the man in on the advertising h o a r d i n g .

The man was semi- c o n s ci o u s , white,   aged about 25 y e a r s .

The gymnasium was full of bodies and casualties still alive were

being taken to the far e n d .       I am unaware who the officers were who

took over my casualty or who assisted me as they were from other

divisions.

There seemed to be no organisation or radio messages from about

3.15 p.m.     It was a case of every officer doing what he could

wherever he happened to b e .

I did not notice any significant difference in the policing of this

semi-final compared with others.

My own feelings were of fear and horror and a severe sickly feeling

approximately                 2.15          p.m.       I can        recall       the    centre          pen       being          quite       full,           i

the    pen     nearest             the       police           control          was    about     one         third          full    and       t he

pen    towards           the       North          Stand        was       almost       empty.         This         was       certainly                        ,

time.        It    was        obvious             that       the     Liverpool          fans       had          not    arrived          at    the

ground       early           as    the       Spion          Kop     and    South       Stands        containing                  the    Notts                j

Forest       fans        were          almost          full.

By    approximately                    2.45       p.m.        the    North       Stand       appeared             to       be    quite       full

but    the     Liverpool                fans          in    the     seats       directly        facing            me       were    very

intoxicated.                  At       normal          Sheffield           Wednesday           matches            such          youths       would

have       been    arrested                 at    the       turnstiles           for    being        drunk            at    a

s po r t s g r o u n d .          The       problem          was     that       all    the     young            white       males       aged                 <

about       20--30 y e a r s            were          all    the     same       and    it w o u l d         have       been       impossible

to    arrest       them           all.           It    was     quickly          evident        that         these          Liverpool          fans

were       very    hostile              and       abusive           towards          myself     as      a       Police          Officer       and

Press       photographers                    who       were        taking       up    positions             on    the       track       nearby.              ;

At    about       this        time          <2.45          p.m.)     I    can    recall        hearing            on       my    personal

radio,       Superintendent                       Marshall           at    the       Leppings        Lane         turnstiles

stating        there          was       a    serious           problem          with    the     crowd            outside          and    that

he    wanted       to        have       the      main        gate        opened.        I recall                Superintendent

Marshall          asking           for       the       gates        to    be    opened       about          3    or    4    times       during

the    following              few       minutes             and     from       his    voice,       he       was       obviously          in

some       distress.               I    remember             Police        Sergeant          626     Goddard               in    the    Police

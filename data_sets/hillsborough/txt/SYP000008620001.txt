where     first aid           instruction                is given and                practised.

On S a t u r d a y    13th April              (130489)          together            wit h my husb a n d we                 left      home

at about         1 pm    <1300).              We    travelled             by car along              He s l e y LN         into

L o n d o n WAY then C o w l e y Hill                    into Ne t h e r          LN    into Mill            RD and        then

S alt Box LN and then                    right       into M ain ST,                 w here we met             the        cadets who

I named        earlier.            We    then t r a v e l l e d along                  Fox Hill         RD    parking          the    car

in Baxter         DR.

As we     travelled           by    car along             C h u r c h St there was a pub open a l t h o u g h

I d o n ’t know         the    name       of       it.     O u t s i d e was a g roup of s u p p o r t e r s who

w ere    wearing        red/white.                 I would        estimate             the    number         betw e e n £0 and

50    people.         As we        c o n t i n u e d our         jour n e y we          t r a v e l l e d along Fox Hill

R D where        there were             I think a couple                    of     pubs      open w ith S u p p o r t e r s

s tood    outside        them.           I am not          sure        of the          names      of any       s r 'f    the   pubs.

We    parked      the    car       in Ba n t e r DR and w a l k e d                    to the       Q /ound a long Fox

               Stand         standing              area       at       the     outsides          was    fairly           empty       (Pens        i and 2

               6 and         7)..        There          were       a    number        of    people          in the          areas        behind        the

               also,          I noticed                 before          th e    kick       off    that        there         were     a number           of

               people         being           pulled          up       into     the    West       Stand         seating         area       from        the

               standing             area,          I didn't             not i ce      the    time       and        I am       not    sure       if     the    area

               behind         the        goal       was       full       or     not,       it wa s      sti l l       fairly         empty        in    the

               outer         areas           of    the       standing           area       and    in    the        seats       at    the       time.

               I don't         remember                 kick       off       taking        place,       there         were      people          trying        to

               climb         the        fence       in t h e           area     behind       th e      goal        and      policemen           were

               telling         them           to    get       down.            When    I saw        this        I looked            at    the     crowds

               in    that      area           and       there          was     nothing       untowards               happening.                I don't

               think           kick          off    had t ak en              place          at      this        time.

appeared           quite     distressed.                     I turned           to    examine       a man       in f r o n t     of    her;

he a l s o     appeared           distressed.                              a    cadet      went     to    the     woman.         She

told    him        she    was     hy pe r-ve rtt i lat i ng .                          took     o ve r    with       the     man and     I

went    back        to     the    woman.               She    asked        for a        plastic       bag,      w h i c h I gave        to

her.        She     was     able       to       hold      the    bag       over       h er    nose       and mouth.           I stayed

with    h er       long     enough          to    se e     her       begin       to    improve.           I left       her     to

attend       a man         lying       on       th e    g ra s s .        He    was    conscious          and     laid       in the

recovery           position.               He    appeared            to    need a       stretcher.              As    I looked

around       I saw         one    close          by,     but as           I tried       to     organise         the    spectators

to    help     lift        him    other          spectators               ran up w i t h        another         man    in t h e i r

arms    and        laid     him       on    the        stretcher.               I quickly           noticed       severe       bruising

to    the    left        side     of       his    abdomen.                He    was    conscious          but     in g r e a t      pain.

He    had    been        placed        on       the     stretcher              on his        left    side.        A spectator           was

left    with        th e    other          man. I got         spectators              to     help    push       the          stretcher

and    went         round with              h i m to     the a m b u l a n c e         room.

On    arriving           there        I found           it v e r y        busy with           blankets         laid    on     the     floor

and    people        laid        on    them.                                                    took      over       f r o m me a n d    1

spent       th e    rest     of m y         time        checking           the       meWboys         laid      on the        floor

trying       to     ensure        that          t h e y we re        not N^eter i o rat i n g .             All      we re    resting

in t he      most        appropriate               position,              awaiting           removal      to    hospital         on a

priority           basis.

           I am currently employed Jby the South Yorkshire Police in the capacity

           of Divisional Warrants Officer stationed at West Bar Police Station,

           Sheffield.



           At 8.00 am (0800), Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I paraded for

             uty, in full uniform, at West Bar Police Station where I was briefed

             or duties on serial 7 in connection with the semi-final football

           match taking place at the Hillsborough Football Ground between

           Nottingham Forest and Liverpool football clubs later that date.             My

           duties were in relation to the arrival of Nottingham Forest supporter

           arriving Jby train at the Sheffield Midland Station and their further

           transport to Hillsborough Football Ground on specially provided buses
                                                                       PAGE     2
                                                                       S3756
At IQ.QQ^ro (1Q00) , this date, 1 went to the Midland Station where

thp^e duties were performed, along with other officers assigned to
serial 7,



At approximately 2.45 pm (1445), I boarded a bus containing Nottingham

ForestsuppoFters and other officerss and was transported to             ^   ■

Hillsborough Footbal1 Ground.   The supporters left the bus and were            j

directed to the area in which they were to be allowed into the ground,

through the turnstiles at the rear of the Spion Kop»         ^



I then proceeded to the tgyfhnasiym at the rear of the Penistone Road

Stand where I was to take! a trfeal and regroup with other serial 7

officers.



The time would be about 3 pm (1500),     I had just entered the gymnasium

when, along with other officers,     I was directed by the Inspector on

djaty to attend the playing area in front of the Leppings Lane stand

    terrace where assistance was required-



I went to the playing area, entering from the side of the Penistone

Road stand ne*ir to the Spion Hop.    The game was still taking place

and, as I turned in front of the stand and looked in the direction

of the Leppings Lane stand and terracing,     I could see people climbing

onto the fencing and jumping onto the area at the rear of the goal.

There were quite a number of people and policemen tKere.


                                              hJft-tidC   ‘n -p
When I passed the halfway line I saw Police Se-s^eant HALL.       He

directed me, and other officers with me, to keep people off the

pitch in front of the Penistone Road stand near to the Leppings Lane

terracing,   I was aware of the game coming to a halt and the players
                                                                      PAGE    3
                                                                      S3736

beginning to leave- the pitch as I made my way alongside.



People were now coming out of the Penistone Road stand and spilling

onto the playing area.   My first duties were to calm the supporters,

who all appeared to be from the Liverpool contingent of fans, and try

to return them back to the stands.                                 iK



It was then that I saw injured and hysterical fans coming from the

goal mouth area in front of the Leppings Lane stand.      St John’s

ambulance persons were in attendance and dealing with casualties, as           t




  gave assistance where possible with the injured but concerned myself

with the more agitated supporters attempting to cross the playing area

towards the Nottingham Forest supporters.     I stayed working in that

area until I was directed to line up across the centre of the pitch

with other officers already there.



I was* then sent: out of :the ground: into Penistone Road where I vworked '?

crowd control duties, directing Nottingham Forest supporters onto         ,

waiting ;buses to return them to Midland Station.     Once the buses were. --

full, I boarded, and escorted the fans back to the station.



At the station I performed crowd control duties until they dispersed

onto waiting trains.



I later returned to West Bar Police Station where, after taking

refreshments,   I went off duty around 8 pm (2000).

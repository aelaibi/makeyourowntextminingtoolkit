STATEMENT OF:    ALAN KEITH SEAMAN



OCCUPATION:      ASSISTANT CHIEF FIRE OFFICER .




My name is Alan Keith Seaman.       I am employed by the South Yorkshire          County

Fire   Service   in   the   rank   of   Assistant   Chief   Fire Officer.       My major

reference is that of Fire Prevention/Safety, which amongst a great deal               of

other matters, encompasses Safety at Sports Grounds.



I   have   been employed within the Fire Service for 23 years and I have been

involved with fire safety matters since April, 1973.



I have held my present post since February, 1987.           Prior   to   that    I   held

several    specialist   Fire   Safety posts at both Divisional and Headquarters

levels within the Fire Service.



I am a member of the Institution of Fire Engineers.
                           SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975



      The involvement of the FLire Service in the implementation of the Safety

      of Sports Ground Act, 1975



1.1 The Safety of Sports Ground Act (SSGA) was passed in 1975 following the

      publication    in     1972 of the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at

      Sports Grounds which          was   prepared    by   Lord   Wheatley        following          the

      serious    accident     at     Ibrox   Park    Football     Ground    in        1971, when 66

      spectators were killed on a stairway.



      The Home Office issued Guidance to Local Authorities under cover of

      Home Officer Circular 150/1975.                                                                      Ex 1




1.2   The Safety of Sports Ground Act gave the Secretary of                     State        power   to

      require    through     designation orders that safety certificates be issued

      to sports stadia with accommodation for more                than     10,000       spectators.

      The     intention    was     for the Act to come into force gradually through a

      phased programme of designation orders so as not to place an                           immediate

      financial burden on the smaller and less well off clubs.



1.3 The     first   order was made in August 1976 and applied to first division

      football clubs and         certain     international      grounds.        The    Home     Office

      issued     guidance    to     local    authorities     under      cover     of    Horne Office

      Circular 130/76. Sheffield Wednesday's ground was designated in                           August     Ex 2

      1970,     although    the club was not in the first division, becausio of its

      quasi international use.            Second    division    clubs    were         designated      in

      August     1979.      Third    and fourth division clubs and rugby leagua clubs

      were designated in August 1985, following the                  Bradford         City    Football

       Club fire.
1.4   In 1976, the Home Office produced a voluntary code called the "Guide to

      Safety at Sports Grounds                  (Football)",             commonly      known      as    the    Green       Ex 5

      Guide.       This      gave        guidance          on     measures for improving the safety of

      spectators at sports grounds and extended the                               recommendations             of   the

      Wheatley      Report.           The      County Council later contacted the Home Office

      regarding the application of the Green Guide and had been informed that

      basically        any    new        work       or construction           had to be of a           standard not

      lower than that set out in the Green Guide                              but that maximum flexibility

      had to be maintained in the case of existing structures.



1.5   The     former South Yorkshire County Council, as the enforcing authority,

      delegated its powers and duties under the Safety of Sports                                       Ground      Act

      to     the   Fire       Service       Committee.             On 8th January, 1976, the Committee

      decided that           their       functions          should       be   exercised        through        Officer

      Working      Parties       for        the      four        borough      council areas, consisting of

      representatives of the                 police,            the    Fire    Service      and    the       building

      inspectors of the borough councils, with co-ordination being undertaken

      by David Vaughan who was the responsible officer of the                                     Department of

      Administration.            He       also       took the chair           and produced the minutes for

      all working party meetings.



1.6   In order to avoid duplication and                           division      of    resources,         a    primary

      authority         was      chosen         for        the     carrying     out    of    inspections,          re-

       inspections, and           making            final        technical     recommendations           using     the

       headings     given        in      the        contents summary of the Green Gu3.de with sorae

       additions.       'JKiao primary authority responsible was required                              to     consult

       tha     other authorities concerned before finalising any recommendations.

       It: will be Been from the schedule that the Fire Service were designated                                          Ex 4

       the     primary       authority          for        means of escape and fire precautions.                    By

       virtue of their general experience as a                             fire      and    emergency        service,

       they     were      able      to    give        advice          on this subject.       However, the Fire

                                                -    2 -
          Service did not attend and have not                         attended       football       matches         as     a

          matter of course.



    1.7   It was the practice for all disciplines to report to the Administration

          Department and thereafter for a joint meeting of                              the     Officer        Working

          Party     to    be     held    after       which       the       agreed     recommendations           of all

          disciplines were            amalgamated            into     a    report     by    the     Administration

          Department       and     sent to the club(s).                   Copies of all correspondence and

          the minutes of meetings were sent to each member and                                 all     arrangements

          for meetings were made by the Administration Department.



•
    1.8 It   was     the       practice for the Officer Working Parties to carry out two

          inspections of the ground each year, commonly                              known     as     "summer"           and

          "winter”       inspections.           It was Fire Service practice to be represented

          by officers          from     both    Divisional            and    Headquarters           levels     at        all

          meetings       and     inspections             whenever         possible.        This enabled a common

          standard to be applied.



    1.9   With the abolition of the South Yorkshire County Council                                   on 1st April,

          1986 enforcement in South Yorkshire was to pass                              to the four

          Metropolitan          District       Councils,            Rotherham,       Barnsley,        Doncaster and

          Sheffield.       The Local Government Act, 1985 amended Section 3 (3) of the

           Safety    of Sports Ground Act so that in future in Metropolitan comities

           the local authority,            in       this      case        Sheffield    Metropolitan           District.

           Council       was    required       to     send a copy of any application for a eafcrLy

           certificate for a stadium to the chief officer of police and                                      th?:    fir«

           authority       and    to     consult         them        about the terma and conditions to be

           included in the certificate.                      The Officer Working Party was replaced by

           the      Safety       of      Sports          Ground           Advisory     Group         comprising           of

           representatives from            police,            Fire     Service,       the    building        surveyors

                                                _    3   -
    division         and    the    Health    & Consumer Services Department of the local

    authority.         The Home Office issued guidance               on     the     new   arrangements

    under cover of Home Office Circular 7/1986.



1.10 On   18th       February,      1986, a memorandum from the Chief Fire Officer was                       Ex

     circulated to all five Fire Service                   divisions      detailing       the    changes

     that were to take place under the Local Government Act 1985 and the way

     the administrative arrangements of the Safety                        of   Sports     Grounds     Act

     1975, would be affected.



     It stressed the importance of establishing and maintaining good liaison

     between divisions and District Councils who would                         be    responsible      for

     administering the Act.



1.11 A letter dated 24th February, 1986, was received from Sheffield City                                    Ex

     Council indicating that as the Council were to take over responsibility

     as the Licensing Authority under the                   Safety     of      Sports     Grounds    Act,

     1975   ,   it    would       be of assistance to the Council and other Authorities

     for an informal meeting to be held to discuss both existing and                                future

     arrangements for administering the Act.



1.12 On the 5th March, 1986 Mr D Vaughan                   arranged a joint meeting, for the

     2 4th      March,       1986 with the officers of the District Councils who would                        Ex

     be taking over responsibility for Safety of Sport.E5 Grounds Act.                           matters

      which     was        attended by officers from the police and Fire Service.                      The

      purpose of the meeting was to hand over the County Council's filas                               and

      have    a      general      discussion       on Safety of Sports Grounds matters.                The

      Fire Service said that they hoped the South                    Yorkshire          County   Council

      General        Safety       Certificate      would   be   adopted        by   all the districts

      because this would help               them    standardise      on     one     rather   than     four

      different sets of conditions.
1.13 In Sheffield the Administration and Legal Department became the

        responsible        department and Mr David Bownes was the responsible officer

        within the department.              In a letter dated 5th June, 1986, they attached                         Ex 9

        a     copy   of    a report which had been placed before the General Purposes

        panel on 6th May, 1986 together with a copy of the                           panel's     resolution

        in relation to that report.



        With     reference      to the Safety Certificate Conditions, the report noted

        that these were standardised throughout south Yorkshire and both police

        and     Fire      Service     had indicated that they wished this to continue for

        reasons of administrative simplicity.                         It then went on     to     state    that

        the     conditions      gave     some        cause      for    concern as they appeared to be

        inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.



        It was proposed to re-draft the Certificate Conditions after which                                  the

        Sheffield         Wednesday     certificate            would     be   replaced.        The Sheffield

        United certificate could then be issued with the new conditions                                  before

        the     start      of   the    1986/87           season. In the covering letter, Mr Bownes                Ex 9

        indicated that the re-drafting                    of    the     certificate     conditions        would

        shortly be completed and the comments of the Fire Service would then be

        sought.



        The Panel was asked for authority for the present administrative system

        to be continued for the time being.



 1.14   & meeting took place on 10t.h March, 1987 to deal with the future

         administration         of    the    Council's certification function.                   The general      Ex 10

            feeling of the meeting war, that the roles of                     each    authority     involved

            should be defined perhaps along the lines of the South Yorkshire County

            Council system.      This was described in a letter dated,                    14th May, 1987,

                                             -   5   -
  from     Mr D Bownes, which enclosed a draft division of responsibilities.

  The letter asked for comments on the proposals                       that,      inter      alia     the

  following      should   be    Fire     Service responsibilities fire precautions,

  fire alarms, means of escape, emergency lighting, stadium capacity.                                  It

  was    also    proposed      there     should    in     future       be      only one inspection

  annually.



15 In a letter dated 7th July, 1987 the Fire Service



   (a)   expressed the      view       that    division     of     responsibilities            between

         authorities        should      remain    along     the        lines     of    the     schedule

         previously adopted and referred to in Para 1.6



   (b)   accepted the proposal of one inspection annually.



16 At a meeting of the Advisory Group on 16th July, 1987,                             the    definition

   of    roles   was    discussed.        DO     Grimshaw      said      that     when determining

   capacity figures each discipline would have                    to     put     forward       figures.

   Those    of   the    Fire    Service       would     only be based on means of escape.

   Following those remarks, it was agreed that:



   (1)     Roles should be broadly defined and responsibilities taken                            on    by

           the   appropriate of the three "lead authorities" i.e. Police, Fire

           and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs.



           All contact with the         grounds       should     be     through        the    licensing

           authority.



           Environmental Health would take a "general safety role” and not be

           a "lead" authority.
(2)   The annual inspection was to be a                   joint   full    inspection        to    be

      carried out near the end of each season.



      D.P.   ("during     performance")             inspections    were        to be done on an

      individual basis.       Prior arrangements were to                 be    made      with    the

      Police,   but     not   the       Club.       The Licensing Authority were to be

      informed when an inspection had taken place.



(3)   The meeting was informed that legally the group                         was   an    advisory

      authority.      Only the council would be the ultimate decision making

      authority.



(4)   Individual authorities were to correspond with the sports                            grounds

      through   the     licensing authority who would subsequently circulate

      copies of all letters to each "lead” authority.



      Meetings of      the    group         would    be    held   at     irregular       intervals

      depending     on need and would be called by any member of the group.

      Individual authorities did not need to attend specific meetings if

      they had no "interest”.



      Agendas were to be issued px'ior to each meeting.




                                -   7   -
    1.17 On   3rd   August,      1987,   a       draft   report    which    had been prepared for

         submission to the general purposes panel of the City Council                      was      sent   Ex 14

         to   the   Fire   Service.          In    that report, under the heading of "future

         administration of council certification function', it                   was      recommended

         that   the     "Safety    of    Sports Grounds Advisory Group" would serve as a

         forum for discussion between officers               and    would    form   the     basis     of

         written      detailed    advice to the council.           It was also recommended that

         the roles of the various officers should be                 defined    along      the   lines

         discussed      at the meeting of the 16th July, 1987 and the point was made

         that there were extensive areas of potential overlap.

        2.     History: 1978-1986

        2.1    The South Yorkshire            County             Council           received         an     application        for       a

               General    Safety       Certificate                in     September,             1978.          The    club engaged

               Eastwood and Partners, a Sheffield based firm of                                          consulting        engineers

               as their consultants.



        2.2    In     November    1978, the draft General Safety Certificate which had been

               prepared by the County Council following consultation with the                                                Officer

               Working     Parties      was       submitted              to        the    Fire        Service        Committee for



•
               approval to be used throughout the county.



        2.3    On 2nd January, 1979, the Chief Fire Officer sent a memorandum                                                to      the

               Chief     Executive      of        South          Yorkshire              County      Council suggesting that                  Ex 15

               officers of the working                 party           undertake           a     comprehensive             survey     of

               Sheffield       Wednesday          Football             Club        in unison rather than separately.

               The chief Fire Officer suggested that a copy                                      of      the    report       of     each

               department        be    provided             to        each    other department involved to enable

               problems to be discussed                     so        that    an        acceptable         approach         might     be

               determined        and    consolidated                   into    a        single        report     which should be

a   .          forwarded to the club.               The memorandum made several other                                 observations

               regarding the standards necessary.



         2.4    (i)    On 17th January, 1979                     the South Yorkshire County Council received
                                                                                                                                             Ex 16
                       a report prepared by Eastwood and Partners on ground                                           capacity         of

                       Sheffield       Wednesday             Football           Club,          in     connection       with        t.hei.c

                       application          for    a        General           Safety       Certificate.               The         repor'e

                       indicated       that       tha        Green           Guide       had been used as the basis for

                       their     calculations,               although              as    with       probably         all     existing

                       grounds,        it     would               not         be        possible         to    satisfy       all     the



                                                        -    9    -
    recommendations in the guide and reasonable                    compromise        would    be

    needed.



(ii) Paragraph (b) of the report dealt with the west terrace (including

    the lower level at the north west corner but excluding                       the       north

    west     corner       reinforced concrete terrace).            The report considered

    that despite the fact that the full area of the west terrace could

    accommodate about 8,000 spectators, due to the lack of gangways an

    allowance should be made for circulation space in order that                             good

    packing could be achieved.              It further suggested that an allowance

    of 10% be made for this purpose, resulting in a suggested capacity

     for the west terrace of 7,200.



     Crush       barriers were to be designed to match the capacity of 7,200

     spectators and additional barriers and                   appropriate     strengthening

     of existing barriers would be provided for where necessary.



     Reference       is    also   made      to   the    evacuation     time     for the west

     terrace, this being about six minutes based on the                       exits    already

     available       and    also to the fact that some spectators would be 25m

        from an exit although movement along the terrace would be easy and

        quick.     The     existing   exits      were    through      the tunnel and round

        either side of the west stand.




(iii)        A meeting of the Officer            Working      Party    was    held    on     12th
                                                                                                    Ex 17
             February,       1979,    the    purpose     of    which    was to discuss the

             report prepared by Eastwood and Partners and to consider                         the

             views which should be put to the club.



                                  - 10 -
         With     regard      to the west terrace, it was considered that due

         to the lack of depth of the terrace, the offer to reduce                                the

         spectator       limit       to     7,200     and with a discharge time of 6.6

         minutes it would have been                  unreasonable     to     insist        on     the

         provision       of    gangways or additional exits.                 There was total

         movement laterally               throughout     the    terrace      and     the       three

         entrance/exits            from     the terrace were well situated.                At the

         time, the worst disaster/emergency contemplated                           was     one     of

         fire.      As     the      west     stand     provided a minimum of fire risk

         (because it was constructed in concrete) it was accepted that

         these routes would be available and adequate in an emergency.

         The existing gates in the perimeter fence were discounted for

         means     of    escape          purposes.      At     that time the gates in the

         perimeter       fence       were     considered       to    be    there         for     the

         convenience          of    the     police     for     crowd control purposes and

         suitable as a means of egress for a relatively                        small           number

         of spectators in the event of a localised incident.



         It was noted that, subject to existing crush barriers passing

         the tests, they would require special attention                           in    view      of

         the apparent sharp edges and corrosion.




(iv) On 2nd April, 1979, a meeting was held between the Officer Working

    Party and the club to discuss the views                     of   the    Officer        Working

    Party in respect of the report submitted by Eastwood and Partners.



    As   far     as the west terrace was concerned, it was agreed that the

    club's proposal for additional barriers and reductions in capacity

    to   7,200    without          the    need   for    additional         gangways should be
      implemented.         The    question     of    the     condition     of   some    of     the

      existing       barriers         and the stepping arrangement on the north west

      corner exit would be the subject of detailed                      discussions     between

      Dr Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.



(v)   A meeting of the Officer Working Party and the Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club was held on 18th April, 1979 during which                          the    club

      accepted       that       the    stepping arrangement on the north west corner

      exit should be rebuilt.               The matters concerning the crush barriers

      were    to     be     reconsidered       after    it      was seen which of the crush

      barriers failed on testing.



(vi) On 1st May, 1979, the City of Sheffield Building                       Surveyors        wrote

      to     South      Yorkshire       County Council and summarised in the letter,

      their own requirements in relation to matters discussed at                             recent

      meetings.           The    Building     Surveyor indicated that, subject to the

      downward slope of exit steps at the north west corner                          exit     being

      corrected and the capacity being restricted to that agreed between

      the police and the              club,   that     department       considered     the     west

      terrace to be acceptable.



(vii)On 16th May, 1979, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service wrote

       to South Yorkshire City Council, enclosing plans numbered 1610/12,

       1610/11, 1610/9A, 1610/8A, 1610/7A,                   1610/6A,     1610/4A,     1610/2XA,

       1610/1XA and a recommendation of work schedule to be undertaken.



       With    regard to exit routes from the west and north west terraces,

       these were considered to be satisfactory.



       The provision of exit signs was required in the work schedule, the

       siting      of     which       was   indicated      on   the   plans.    There        was no
            requirement for such signs on the west terrace                          exits.        This   was

            because     they were the ones used for normal entrance and exit from

            what was an open terrace.                   Further, none       were    required       for   the

            perimeter      fence      gates.            These were not       normal exit routes.          To

            have   exit       signs    for     these        gates    could     cause        problems     and

            confusion.



            The    schedule also detailed that adequate roads should be provided

            to ensure that speedy and                   direct    access     could     be    obtained     by

            emergency      vehicles      to all exterior parts of the stadium and that

            it had to be ensured             that        parked     vehicles       would    not    obstruct

            emergency vehicles on these access roads.



      (viii)On the 8th June, 1979, South Yorkshire County Council sent a
                                                                                                                Ex 23
             memorandum to the Chief Fire officer, enclosing the work schedule

            forwarded to Sheffield Wednesday                      Football     Club    which      had    been

            collated      from     the   detailed           comments of the various disciplines

            represented on the Working Party.



      (ix) A meeting of the Officer Working Party and the Sheffield Wednesday

             Football     Club     was       held       on 12th November 1979 when it was noted                 Ex 24

             that work detailed in the schedule dated 8th June                             1979   had    been

             carried out as far as the west terrace was concerned.



2.5   The    General      Safety      Certificate          in     respect    of     Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club with plans attached was issued with                            conditions      on    21st
                                                                                                                 Ex 25
      December,       1979.     The club's attention was drawn, in particular, to the

      following conditions:



      8(1) acceptance of existing first aid facilities on an interim

             basis only

                                         -    13    -
      12(1) arrangements for emergency lighting in the south stand being

              only acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life.



      14      acceptance of police facilities on an interim basis only.



      30      no spectators being allowed to use the stadium                         in     conditions     of

               extreme wind and/or snow loadings.



               The    Fire     Services'       plans     were     sent    to South Yorkshire County

               Council for duplication and for                  attachment      to    the     certificate.
                                                                                                                  Ex 26
               Copies were returned to the Fire Service on the 4th February 1980.                                 Ex 27



2.6    (i)     On     the    14th     March,    1980, South Yorkshire County Council sent a                       Ex 28

               memorandum to the Chief Fire Officer                      stating     that     despite      the

               fact     that    the     certificate       had     been issued as recently as 21st

               December, it was felt that                the      Sheffield          District Officer        Working

               Party would have to review                the      situation          due to thepending FA Cup

               semi-final between Arsenal and                  Liverpool     on      12th    April,     1980.

               Comments        were    requested on any outstanding matters for which the

               Fire Service had primary responsibility.



           (ii) On the 20th March, 1980, Stn.O. Davies sent a                        memorandum       to   the
                                                                                                                   Ex 29
               Chief        Fire Officer       detailing areas of concern that were revealed

               during an inspection of the ground on                     12th     March,     1980.      These

               included:-



                (a)    training of stewards

                (b)    exit     signs not beingof the required standard                     as detailed in

                       schedule II of the certificate.



                                           -    14   -
    (c)     non provision of fire alarm systems as required                        by     Schedule

            II of the certificate



(iii)On the 26th March, 1980, the Chief Fire officer sent a memorandum

    to    South   Yorkshire          County Council detailing what was set out in                     Ex 30

    the memorandum referred to at 2.6(ii) above.



(iv) On the 31st March, 1980, South Yorkshire County Council wrote                               to
                                                                                                      Ex 31
    Sheffield     Wednesday          Football         Club detailing what was set out in

    the memorandum to South Yorkshire County Council                         referred      to    at

     2.6(iii)     above.       Additional            observations   made     by the Building

    Surveyor were also included in this letter.



(v) On    the   3rd     April,       1980      Sheffield    Wednesday        Football          Club   Ex 32
     acknowledged       receipt       of       the    letter from South Yorkshire County

     Council referred to at 2.6(iv) above.                  An explanation          as    to    the

     lack    of training of stewards was given stating that this would be

     undertaken on completion of the fire alarm                     system    which       was    in

     hand.      All    other     matters         in    the letter of the 31st March were

     passed to Dr Eastwood for his professional advice.



(vi) On the 4th and 8th April, 1980, Eastwood & Partners wrote to South
                                                                                                      Ex 33
     Yorkshire        County Council explaining the reasons for non provision

     of exit signs and fire warning system and dealing with all matters

     referred to by the Building Surveyor.



(vii)A meeting of the Officer Working Party and Sheffield Wednesday

     Football Club was held on 10th April, 1980 to discuss the areas of                               Ex 3 1*

     concern recently communicated to the club and in view                          of    the    FA

     Cup Semi-final to be held on 12th April, 1980.                     The points covered

     by the letters from Eastwood and Partners on 4th                        and    8th    April,

                                 -   15    -
           were    discussed       and as far as training of the safety stewards was

           concerned it was agreed that there was little point until the fire

           warning       system    had       been      completely      installed.       It   was noted

           however that the         Fire       Service      had     given     instruction     to        some

            stewards.



2.7   On   the 3rd September, 1980 South Yorkshire County Council wrote to the

      Chief Constable outlining the concern of the                       Chief   Executive        of    the
                                                                                                               Ex 35
      police policy of locking away supporters inside grounds until such time

      as home supporters had cleared the area and suggesting that instead                                 of

      being   allowed to approach locked gates at the end of a match, the away

      supporters should be held back in a relatively safe place, such                              as     on

      the terrace.



      Concern     was    also     expressed           at modifications being made at Sheffield

      Wednesday Football Club at the                  request     of   the    police,    without         the

      knowledge of the Officer Working Party.



2.8   On   the    16th    January,       1981,        Eastwood     and    Partners      wrote to South

      Yorkshire     County      Fire     Service         confirming      that    the       fire        alarm   Ex 36

      installation       and    modifications            to the public address system had been

      completed during July 1980.

                                                                                                               Ex 37
      Club was held on 7th April, 1981 the purpose of which was to review the

      ground due to the pending FA cup semi-final to be held on                            11th    April,

      1981. Consultations between South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the

      police had resulted in           the     production         of     an   "Emergency     Evacuation

      Procedure".        The club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to
                                                                                                               Ex 38
      all stewards who would be on duty for the FA Cup Semi-Final.



                                         -   16   -
       A copy    of       the    procedure         is       produced     dated      12th   May, 1981.        The

       procedure          detailed     the        signal      to     be adopted to inform stewards and

       police that an emergency had arisen and the actions to be                                 followed     on

       hearing further announcements over the public address system.



2.10   A meeting of the Officer Working Party and Sheffield Wednesday Football

       Club     was       held   on    8th        June,      1981.       It   was     noted    that following
                                                                                                                    Ex 39
       experiences          at   the    FA        Cup        Semi-Final       in April,       the club      were

       considering          revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the west

       stand and that the Officer Working Party would be consulted when                                    these

       had substance.



2.11   (i)            On    2nd September, 1981, Eastwood and Partners wrote to South
                                                                                                                   Ex 40
                      Yorkshire County Council detailing                       the    club's     proposal     to

                      instal two radial fences on the west terrace in such a manner

                      that the terrace would be divided                       into     approximately       three

                      equal areas, each served by its own entrance.                            The aim was to

                      achieve more control over supporters, a                         visiting     team     with

                      only       a    few supporters being allocated one section, with the

                      other two sections retained by the home supporters.



                      Larger         contingents              of     visiting       supporters could          be

                      accommodated           in     two      or    all   three       areas as their numbers

                      dictated.        A 1.15 metre gate was proposed at the rear of each

                      fence.



       (ii)           A    meeting      of        the   Officer        Working      Party was held on 11th

                      September, 1981, toconsider the proposed erection of                               radial    Ex 41

                      barriers on the west terrace for crowd control purposes.




                                              -    17   -
             Whilst      there were reservations due to problems with opposing

             fans mixing at the rear of the west stand,              the     police     felt

             that     they could cope with any problems of this nature and as

             they felt that increased control on the terrace should result

             from      the    proposals,     the   Officer   Working    Party        saw    no

             objections to their implementation.



             The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed                      at

             the rear of the radial barriers was discussed, as was the use

             of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter fence.                  It       was

             agreed      that   Messrs Eastwood and Partners be notified of the

             Officer Working Party's decision which was subject to:-



             a)     further calculations requiredby the Building              Authority

                    being satisfactory



             b)     the adequacy of headroom in the vicinity of the proposed

                    gates at the rear of the terrace           and



             c)     the new gates at the rear         of     the   terrace    also     being


*•                  under police control.



                    It    was clearly understood by the representatives of the

                    Fire Service that these gates would be constantly manned

                    and      they   would    not   have approved the proposal if the

                    situation was to be otherwise. Again, at this time,                    the

                    perimeter       fence    gates were never contemplated           for use

                    for mass evacuation on to the pitch.




     (H i)   On 14th September, 1981, South Yorkshire County Council wrote

             to Eastwood & Partners welcoming the increased control on the

                                    - 18 -
        terrace that should result from the proposal                               to    instal     two

        radial      barriers       but           pointing        out     the reservations of the

        Officer Working Party                    and     the     conditions       referred     to    in

        2.11(ii)      above        that          the approval of the scheme was subject

        to.



(iv)    On 14th December, 1981, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                                    South

        Yorkshire        County      Council             declaring that work on the radial

        fences was substantially complete.                         Whilst this had not            been    Ex 43

        previously        brought           to     the attention of the Officer Working

        Party,      there had been three first team home games since                                the

        fences had been erected and the police had inspected the work

        and were satisfied with the new arrangements.



(v)     On the 23rd        December,              1981,    the         Chief    Executive      (South

        Yorkshire County Council) sent a memorandum to the Chief Fire
                                                                                                          Ex 44
        Officer      requesting our confirmation that the                            radial    fences

        were satisfactory.



(vi)    On    the    8th     January,             1982     the    Chief        Fire Officer sent a

        memorandum to the Chief                    Executive           (South   Yorkshire      County     Ex 45

        Council)         dated     8th January, 1982 confirming that the radial

        fences were considered to be satisfactory.



(vii)   On the 20th January, 1982, South Yorkshire County Council

        wrote to Eastwood and Partners                         commenting on the fact that
                                                                                                          Ex 46
        the matches played at the stadium since the                               installation      of

        the    barriers confirmed that they appeared to be working well

        and    satisfactorily               effected       the         segregation      of   opposing

        groups      of     fans.        It       was      noted    however,       that the entire



                              -    19   -
         section of the terrace had yet to be given to                              one    group     of

         fans.



         There      was     also      comment from the police that existing crush

         barriers         extended         up    to   and       completely    through           radial

         barriers         at    a    height       of 4'6" or so, thus enabling fans to

         easily climb over the radial barrier into adjacent pens.



(viii)   On 26th January, 1982 Eastwood                     &    Partners     wrote        to   South
                                                                                                          Ex 47
         Yorkshire         County Council replying to the police observations

         with regard to crush barriers being up                        to     and     through       the

         radial barriers.



         Mr       Eastwood      observed         that if the crush barriers were to be

         removed up to a distance of 1.2m from                        the     radial       barriers,

         there       would      be     a    consequent          loss of calculated spectator

         capacity which is undesirable from the club's point of                                 view.

         However,         from       the    point of view of safety, a strip of that

         width without a single crush barrier would be a major hazard.



(ix)     A    meeting      of       the     Officer     Working      Party     and          Sheffield
                                                                                                          Ex 48
         Wednesday         Football         Club      was   held on 4th February, 1982 in

         order to         discuss          the   apparent        difference     of        opinion    on

             certain    aspects           of the radial barriers on the west terrace,

             these being the observations of the                    police     in     relation       to

             crush barriers passing adjacent to the new radial barriers.



             It   was   agreed        that,      on    balance, it was preferable from a

             safety point of view to prevent crowd surge by                          the    existing

             barriers     being       extended up to and/or through the new radial



                                    - 20 -
              barriers than to completely prevent                     persons     being        able    to

              climb from one pen to another.



2.12   (i)    A     meeting       of    the        Officer      Working   Party       and    Sheffield

              Wednesday Football Club was held on 23rd                      January,          1985,    in    Ex 49

              order to carry out the winter inspection of the stadium.



              The     club recalled the practice followed in consultation with

              the police of separating home and visiting supporters at                                the

              rear     of    the       west    stand       at    certain matches (such as with

              Liverpool) by            erecting       of     temporary    barriers.          This     had

              worked    well        but       in    all other normal occasions it was the

              policy of the police to aim                    for    exclusive     use by      visiting

              supporters          of the west stand and terrace. On those occasions

              when the number of visiting                    supporters    was    small        and    the

              weather       was     inclement, it was considered desirable to allow

              home supporters access to a sheltered area.



              It was agreed that the club would                     consider     at     some     future

              date,     a    scheme       for       permanent      barriers at the rear of the

              stand.



       (ii)   On the 9th April, 1985, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                                 South

              Yorkshire       County          Council,       enclosing     sketch      plan     6705/2,
                                                                                                             Ex 50
              stating that the club was anxious to segregate                           the     visiting

              team's        supporters         as    they       entered   the ground and also to

              enable the police to control their exit at the end of a game.

              The     scheme        involved the construction               of two      new banks of

              turnstiles and various runs of fencing                       and    new       gates.      It

              provided        for      separate       turnstiles for the three sections of

              the west terrace that then existed.

                                       - 21 -
A meeting of the Officer                Working       Party      was   held    on         18th

April,    1985      to discuss the proposals for segregation at the

Leppings Lane end.



The police were            already         familiar    with      the   proposals           and

indicated      that    they          had     instigated       them because of their

desire to allow greater flexibility in the use of the terrace

and    stand by both home and away supporters, allowing them to

vary the neutral area between opposing fans as                          circumstances

dictated      and     to     achieve such arrangements for ingress that

would allow turnstiles to be dedicated to specific areas.



At the meeting, the police suggested                       the    provision         of    two

further radial fences, one dividing the existing central area

in half and running from the tunnel                     entrance       to   the      pitch

side     security      fence         with    gates     to permit entry to either

section as appropriate, the other dividing the existing north

end    of the terrace in half and running from the front to the

back of the terrace.



In addition, the two new pens created by the provision of the

radial       fences were to be provided with additional exit gates

through the pitch perimeter fence, the new                         radial      fence        at

the    north     end       of    the       terrace    to    have two gates and the

existing radial fence to the north side of the tunnel to have

a second gate.



The    provision       of       the second gate in each of the two radial

fences to the north of the tunnel was to allow police                                access

to     all     parts            of     the    terrace      to    control      any        crowd
disturbances.          It was felt by the Fire Service however,                             that

only     one        gate in each fence would be necessary for means of

escape.



If the above features were implemented, the                              proposed       radial

barrier        running      parallel        and    2     metres          from the existing

barrier at the north end of the terrace                         could          be    dispensed

with     as    the     police        felt   that        they    would have more than

adequate control for segregation purposes with                                 the    creation

of     the     smaller pens.          The creation of smaller pens was also

seen by the police to be a bonus in that                            by    having       smaller

sections       of     crowd,        their job in maintaining order would be

made easier.



At the meeting, the revised                 proposals          outlined         above       were

sketched        on    to    the      drawing      by     Mr    Grimshaw, of the Fire

Service and the main concern he expressed was                                                      Ex 50



(a) whether the external gates and exit routes created at the

rear     of    the     stand        would   be     adequate          for the numbers of

spectators in each section of the west stand and terrace,



(b) whether the numbers of spectators being allowed into each

section        of    the    terrace     could       be    controlled            to     prevent

overcrowding, and



(c) what arrangements were to be                   made        to    ensure          that   the

gates in the radial fences would be readily available for use

should lateral movement               along       the    terrace          to    alternative

exits become necessary.



                       -   23   -
Items     (b)      and (c) above were specifically put to the police

as they, along with the club, were responsible                                   for    ensuring

that     emergency             evacuation             procedures      were       adequate         and

controlled and had                  experience         with     the      club     of    ensuring

correct       crowd       density           packing.         The assurance was given by

the police that all the gates included in the                                   proposals         for

the terrace part of the scheme would be manned by them at all

times during games in order that evacuation procedures                                          could

be initiated should this become necessary.                                 As far as correct

density       packing          was       concerned,          the    police       stated          that

arrangements           that         they     had with the club were satisfactory

and they felt that the provision of smaller sections                                        on    the

terraces would make overall control of the terrace easier.




In     the    light           of    these assurances, the Fire Service saw no

objections in principle to the proposals subject                                   to       a    more

detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects.



It      was       agreed           that     R    Grimshaw          (Fire    Service)            should

investigate as a                   matter       of    urgency      the     means       of       escape

aspects           of    the          proposals         and    subject       to     satisfactory

clearance of these matters, the outline                               proposals         submitted

would        be    agreed           as now amended by the suggestions of South

Yorkshire Police and, to                        the    submission          of    the    necessary

 detailed         plans        and       calculations         under        both the Safety of

 Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.




                          -    24    -
(iv)   (a)   On examination of the plan                   by    the    Fire     Service,      the
                                                                                                    Ex 50
             width    of        the        exit   gates    to    allow for the number of

             spectators that it was anticipated would                          use     them   was

             calculated          and it was decided that the gates would have

             to be supervised by either the police or club officials.

             With    regard           to the terracing arrangements, it was felt

             that the proposal for the new radial fence at the tunnel

             position       had        little      effect on the existing situation.

             The capacities, travel distances and                       exit     arrangements

             from the two new central pens did not change.                             In fact a

             new gate through the pitch perimeter                       fence     was    to    be

             provided.           The new radial fence at the north end of the

             terrace       did        actually      slightly      increase       the     travel

             distance to the normal route of exit i.e. the way across

             the terrace otherwise there was no change.



       (b)   It was not thought necessary to                    sign    any     exit     routes

             because:



             (i)     the    principle             ingress/egress       route would be that

                     already familiar to users, and

             (ii) radial fence gates would be manned by police or

                     stewards on the spot.



       (c)   The gates through the perimeter fence were considered to

             be     necessary,             this   being reflected by the request for

             two additional gates in the newly created pens.                            The use

             of     the gates was under the direct control of the police

             and was to allow their access into                       the     terrace     should

             any     disturbance arise and to relieve any local build up

             of pressure at the front of the pens or allow any person

                            -    25    -
            becoming       ill        or   overcome to be removed by that route.

            The police, had always been happy that                            the     gates          were

            adequate for these purposes.



      (d)   It    was never considered that the gates in the perimeter

            fence would be used for the                     evacuation of each                  section

            because        (i)    the      risk     of      fire     in the west stand and

            terrace was low and (ii)                   it   was    considered                 that       the

            height     and       strength         of     walls     and    gates outside the

            Leppings Lane end. were such that the                         risk           of     a    door

            being     forced          or   the     walls      scaled          and    fans thereby

            entering in large numbers was remote.                         At        no        time       was

            there any suggestion to the contrary.



            If      any         situation         arose       that       necessitated                total

            evacuation of the central pens this would in                                  the        first

            instance be by way of the normal route on to the terrace

            i.e. the tunnel.               Should the tunnel             be     obstructed               for

            any     reason,        the      gates      in the radial fences                    would be

            used as directed by the police with                          the        assistance            of

            the public address system.




(v)   On    the 30th April, 1985, South Yorkshire County Fire Service

      v7rote to South Yorkshire County Council                          indicating that                  the   Ex 52
      new     crowd        control         arrangements          were     considered                to    be

      satisfactory providing                that       certain     gates        had       widths          as

      indicated       on    the       plan    attached to the letter and that the

      gates would be supervised by either police or club officials.




                            -    26    -
(vi)     On the 2nd May, 1985, South Yorkshire County Council wrote to

         Eastwood and Partners                indicating that the proposals outlined
                                                                                                      Ex 53
         for crowd        control        arrangements          were    generally        acceptable

         subject to        points a - d set out in the Officer Working Party

         minutes dated 18th April, 1985, and (v) above.



(vii)    On the    8 th   may, 1985,          Eastwood and Partners wrote to South

         Yorkshire County Council                 acknowledging the comments of the

         Officer          Working        Party     but         requesting        that      further
                                                                                                      Ex 54
         consideration be given to the requirement for the second gate

         in the two radial fences since if they were meant for use                               in

         an    emergency it would mean having a steward in attendance on

         each     occasion,         the       expense    of     which    would       hardly     be

         justified.



(viii)    On    10th      May, 1985,          South Yorkshire County Council wrote to

         Eastwood and Partners                 indicating       that    the    two      additional    Ex 55

         gates     were      included          primarily at the request of the police

         who had indicated that they                    were    prepared       to    concede    the

         request       for    the     two       additional gates subject to all other

         points raised by the Officer Working Party being incorporated

         into the proposals.



 (ix)    On 18th July, 1985 South Yorkshire County Council wrote to
                                                                                                      Ex 56
         Eastwood and Partners                 noting that the Chief Executive (South

         Yorkshire         County     Council)          had    been     made    aware     of    the

          application        for     Building       Regulation/planning              approval    in

          respect of the re-organisation of fences at the Leppings Lane

          end and other matters.




                               -    27    -
(x)     On        the     19th July, 1985, Stn.O Ryder noted                  that plans which

        had been submitted to Sheffield                     City      Council     for       Building         Ex 57

        Regulation approval were different to those discussed between

        the club and the Fire Service.



(xi)    On the 25th July, 1985, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                                    South      Ex 58

        Yorkshire             County      Council    enclosing        copies     of drawings in

        respect of segregation of                   visiting       spectators         at    Leppings

        Lane        end,       these being further to the preliminary submission

        in April, 1985.                 Amongst these drawings          is     Plan       NO.6705/8A         Ex 5$

        which           showed     a revised layout and which abandoned the means

        whereby separate turnstiles would be used for each sector                                      of

        the        terrace.        The proposed new wall between turnstile 17 and

        the rear of the west stand was shown as                         having        a    door        for

        personnel             access      described       on Plan No. 6705/14A as being a                    Ex 6C

        timber door being 838 x 841 x 44mm.                        Plan No. 6705/17              showed      Ex 62

        the proposed new pen arrangements for the west terrace. Under

        this arrangement, spectators would gain access to pens 1 -                                       4

(xii)   A     meeting of the Officer Working Party was held on 29th July,                                    Ex 6i
            1985    to        discuss     the     detailed plans submitted to the South

            Yorkshire County Council on                  25th   July,    1985.            Subject      to

            certain       points        detailed     in    the minutes the proposals were

            considered to be acceptable.                  Item (i) made reference to                   the

            need        for    a   new    perimeter       fence gate now marked No.3                   for

            security access and emergency egress purposes.                        Item           (j)    of

            the     points         required       that    all   the     new    gates        be     fully

            supervised by stewards who must be                   fit,     able    and        properly

            trained.

                                    -    28   -
         Also       at    this       meeting,            at item (h), reference is made to a

         proposal to have either                     a    pitch    perimeter      fence        gate    or

         radial       barrier(s)               at   the front corner of the Spion Kop "to

         overcome possible lateral crushing hazard when                                large    crowds

         are present" "in view of experiences last year”



(xiii)   On    1st       August,       1985,        Eastwood and Partners wrote to South                    Ex 63

         Yorkshire County Council acknowledging the                             comments       of     the

         Officer         Working Party meeting of 29th July, 1985 Dr Eastwood                               Ex 62

         asked for further clarification of the location of a proposed

         extra security gate, claiming that an existing gate in the                                    2m


         wide gap could be used by police and would still be available

         for     use for spectators in emergency as there were gates into

         the   2m    gap from the terrace which would be under the                             control

         of    the       police.       With respect to the provision of stewarding

         for all the new gates, (item                       (j),   of    the     minutes       of     the

         29th July,         1985).             Dr Eastwood commented that this would no

         doubt be taken care of by the club.



(xiv)    A    meeting       of       the       Officer     Working      Party    and       Sheffield        Ex 64

         Wednesday         Football Club was held on 7th August 1985 to carry

         out the "slimmer" inspection and in                       particular         to     view     the

         Leppings Lane end improvements.                        The matter for clarification

         dealt with in the letter at (xiii) above was investigated and

         it    was       noted       that there was an existing gate in the new                        2m


         wide gap for use by the police.                        Again    it     was    stated        that

         these       gates       would          still      be   available       for    the     use     of

         spectators in an emergency as the gates at                             the    top     of     the

         terrace         under       the control of police would enable spectators



                                 -    29   -
             to be directed down the       2m   wide gap, although it      was    agreed

             that steps or a longer gate would be required.



             Also    at this meeting, the club agreed to provide a new pitch

             perimeter fence gate at the Spion Kop end             (as    discussed     at

             the meeting of the 29th        July, 1985 - see 2.12(xii) above).

             There    were already four existing pitch perimeter fence gates

             at the Spion Kop end.         Unlike the gates in the fence          at   the

             Leppings    Lane end, it was contemplated that these gates (and

             other exits) would be used in the event of the whole                terrace

             having     to be evacuated, and these gates were included in the

             calculation of evacuation time from the Spion Kop.



2.13   (i)   A meeting of the Officer           Working   Party   was    held    on    22nd

             January,     1986,    to   discuss     further   development       proposals

             involving the Kop and to carry out the "winter” inspection of                    Ex 65

             the stadium.



             The      police      representatives     confirmed    that    the    revised

             segregation arrangements to the rear of the west stand worked

             well on the majority of occasions.

3.    History: After local government re-organisation



3.1   At   a   meeting          at     the    Hillsborough ground in the summer of 1986 (not

      minuted) attended by the police, the local authority (Mr                                Bownes),      the

      Building       Surveyor, the Fire Service (Mr Grimshaw) and Dr Eastwood, the

      police asked that consideration be given to the removal of the southern

      half     of    the        crush      barrier immediately in front of the tunnel by the

      Officer Working Party.                 The matter was discussed and approval given                     to

      the removal of all but the northern third of that barrier.



3.2   A    Home     Office Circular (75/1986) was sent to the Fire Service on 29th                                 Ex 66

      October, 1986 enclosing a copy of the re-issued Green Guide.




3.3   A letter dated 3rd November, 1986, was received from Sheffield City
                                                                                                                   Ex 67
      Council asking for Fire Service Comments in writing as to the condition

      of     the    stadium          under    the       1975    Act.        It asked for any outstanding

      matters requiring attention to be detailed.



3.4   An inspection of the                 Hillsborough         ground      was   carried     out     on    17th

      November, 1986.



3.5   On     18th    February,             1987,    a    letter       was    sent by the Fire Service to
                                                                                                                   Ex 68
      Sheffield City Council in response to their                             letter    of   3rd    November,

       1986.        This    was        a    comprehensive         letter      covering matters that were

      considered           as    requiring         attention      throughout           the   stadium.         In

      particular           it    was       recommended         that    a    satisfactory security device

       easily openable from                 the    pitch       side    be    found     and   fitted    to    all

       perimeter fence gates.



                                                  - 31 -
3.6   A    meeting     of    the Advisory Group was held on the 10th March, 1987, in

      order to discuss the contents of the Fire                  Service    letter    dated       18th   Ex 10
                                                                                                         Ex 68
      February, 1987 (and Sheffield City Council's proposals for divisions of

      responsibility between the various bodies on the Officer Working                          Group

      (see 1.14 above).



      With regard to the letter of 18th February 1987, it was agreed that the

      contents should be taken up with the club. Stewarding and the                       securing

      of all gates was discussed and the Fire Service indicated that existing

      arrangements were only acceptable subject to exits being stewarded                           and

      unlocked       for    the whole of any period that the ground was in use for a

      designated purpose.



      The Fire Service also pointed out that the new                  guide    now     included      a

      section       which     defines    in     detail, management responsibility.              It was

      recommended by the Fire Service that the club certificate specify as                           a

      condition that this section be complied with.



3.7   On     28th    March,     1987,    a     copy    of a draft letter from Sheffield City
                                                                                                         Ex 69
      Council to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club dated 19th March, 1987 was
                                                                                                         Ex 70
      received by the Fire Service for their comments.



      The     letter       referred     to    the     fact   that the police, Fire Service and

      Building Surveyor had been asked to comment on                  the     condition     of     the

      stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.                       At that time,

      no comments had been received from the Building Surveyor and the police

      had      indicated      that    they     were     quite   satisfied with the stadium and

          indicated that the degree of co-operation that they received                    was     very

          satisfactory.




                                             - 32 -
      The    letter       then     pointed       out    that   the Fire Service had a number of

      comments to make and these were to be                    attached          in    the     form       of     the

      letter    of    18th       February.         It did not however include further points

      that had been discussed at the Officer Working Party                              meeting          held     on

      10th March.



      Following       a    telephone       conversation with Mr David Bownes to point out

      this omission, a copy of the                 letter,     annotated          with       the     additional

      points was returned to him .



3.8   Prior    to the Leeds/Coventry FA cup semi-final on the 12th April, 1987,
                                                                                                                        Ex 71
      a representative of the Fire Service attended a site meeting                                    with       the

      police at the Hillsborough ground.



3.9   On    22nd     April, 1987, an amended copy of the letter previously seen in

      draft was       sent       by    Sheffield       City    Council       to       Sheffield       Wednesday

      Football       Club.        On    this occasion the further points discussed at the                               Ex 72

      Officer Working Party meeting were included.



3.10 On 7th July, 1987, a letter was sent to                      Sheffield            City    Council           (see

      1.13     above).        The       letter    concluded       by    requesting            that       Sheffield

      Council on 18th February, 1987.



3.11 On 7th July, 1987, a letter was received from                           Sheffield          City       Council

      enclosing       the new draft certificate conditions.                       The conditions were a
                                                                                                                        Ex l b

       individual          stadia.         Also        enclosed        was   a    first        draft       of    the

       interpretation section of the certificate.

     attended on behalf of the club.                        All matters contained in the letter of

     18th     February,          1987,       were      discussed       with Dr Eastwood who tended to

     agree with most of the points.



3.13 On 13th August, 1987, a reply to Sheffield                           City    Council's      letter     of

             preventing          overcrowding by ensuring crowd limits in various parts

             of the ground were complied with, It was "difficult to imagine how

             this     task       could       be controlled by stewards” and that "the matter

              should be considered further".

     was    received        by       the Fire Service on 26th October, 1987.                    This letter          Ex 77
     confirmed that the club did hold a copy                     of       the   Guide     to        Safety      at

     Sports    Grounds           -    1986   edition    and   the Club Secretary, Mr Mackrell

     Sheffield Wednesday Football                Club     from    Sheffield         City       Council         was
                                                                                                                     Ex 78
     received       by     the Fire Service.           The letter enclosed a list of comments

     made by Officers of the Working Party at the annual inspection                                      of    the

     ground on      6 th   August, 1987.



     The    club     were reminded that as yet, no reply had been received to the

     letter from Sheffield City Council of 22nd April, 1987, which                                      enclosed

     the Fire Service letter of 18th February, 1987.



                                             - 35 -
3.17 A     letter     from    Sheffield            City     Council dated     8 th   February, 1988, was

    received.        The letter enclosed copies of a letter dated                           3rd   February,
                                                                                                                  Ex 79
    1988,      received       from Eastwood and Partners that had been sent in reply
                                                                                                                  Ex 80
    to the Fire Service             letter         of      18th   February,     1987.       David       Bownes

    expressed        concern       at    the       apparent       criticism     of    the     Fire Service

    contained in the letter from Eastwood and Partners and                              suggested         that

     the Fire Service respond directly to them.



     The     letter    from     Eastwood           and      Partners    dealt with the Fire Service

     letter item by item and in general most of the matters had already been

     dealt     with    or were agreed upon although there were still some matters

     that required attention, some of them to be dealt with when                                  the    south

     stand     was refurbished in 1991.                    The concluding paragraph of the letter

     indicated that the club was concerned that with each new member of                                    the

     Fire      Service        to        the       Officer     Working    Party,      new     or    different

     recommendations were being put                        forward   which    in     some    cases      openly

     contradicted the recommendations offered by                         predecessors.



3.18 On     29th    March,     1988,          a    letter was sent to Eastwood and Partners in

     reply to their          criticism of the Fire Service.                                                       Ex 81




3.19 By letter dated 29th March, 1988, the police informed the Fire                                     Service

     of     the     parking    and       travelling arrangements made for the FA Cup semi

     final on 9th April, 1988.                                                                                    Ex 82



3.20 At the 1988 semi final, two fire officers carried out an inspection                                     of

     the     ground      and made a note of their findings.                    They toured the ground
                                                                                                                  Ex 83
     and checked all final exits, finding stewards and police                                in    position.

     Emergency           lighting         and          firefighting      equipment          all      appeared

         satisfactory.       The PA system was also audible                  throughout       the       ground.



                                              -   36   -
       However,      it    was       noted       that       a   number    of    stewards    were    without

       identification and no log book was kept.



3.21 On 19th May, 1988, a further inspection was carried out at                               the     ground

       by   the    Fire    Service and the observations of the officer who attended                               Ex 84

       were set out in a letter dated 25th May, 1988 which                            was   sent     to    the

       local authority.



3.22 On     9th August, 1988, ADO Rowlands attended the meeting (referred to at

       Tab.15 of Volume 1 of the South Yorkshire Police documents)                                which    was

       called      by     the    police      to        discuss     the    operational       attendance      at

       Hillsborough Football Ground during the                         coming     season.   ADO     Rowlands

       stressed     that        it   was     essential          that     the    Fire Service received an

       accurate indication of the exact location of an incident                              and    what    it

       was.



3.23 By     letter dated 30th March, 1989, the police informed the Fire Service

       of the parking and travelling arrangements made for                            the    FA    Cup     semi   Ex 85

       final on 15th April, 1989.



3.24 On       3rd April, 1989, a letter dated 30th march, 1989, was received from

        Sheffield City Council enclosing a draft                         copy    of   the   final    revised      Ex 86

        Safety Certificate Conditions which as far as possible incorporated the

        comments made in the Fire Service's letter to                           Sheffield    City    Council

        dated     13th    August,       1987.          The letter listed four points for further

        consideration.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975



NOTE BY THE HOME OFFICE




BACKGROUND

1.     The purpose of the Act is to implement the main recommendations
contained in the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Saf ety at Sports Grounds
(Cmnd 4952: 1972).  This report was prepared by Lord 'Wheatley who undertook
his inquiry, at the then Government's request, following the tragedy at
Ibrox Park football ground in January 1971 when 66 people died and over
140 were injured.

WHEATLEY REPORT
2.   Lord Wheatley had no doubt that present controls over safety at
football grounds were inadequate.    He found that the existing voluntary
system of certification of grounds introduced by the Football Association
some years ago laid down no requirements as to the competence of persons
who carry out the annual inspections of grounds and there were no guidelines
to assist those persons in their assessment of safety standards.    Moreover,
a review of the statutory provisions relevant to the safety of spectators
at football grounds convinced Lord Wheatley that the law also fell short of
providing proper a n d effective control over football grounds as a whole.
The building regulations, for example, provide for the basic structural
safety of new buildings within a football ground but they do not apply to
existing buildings, except where alterations are to be carried out, nor
do they apply to a ground as a whole.    In any case, most football grounds
were built before national building regulations were introduced.

3.   Lord Wheatley concluded that only a specially devised statutory scheme
could ensure comprehensive controls at football grounds in the interests
of safety.  He recommended a statutory licensing control administered by
the "top tier" of local authorities.   He proposed that these controls should
be introduced b y stages, the larger or more important grounds, broadly
speaking, being dealt with first.   Lord Wheatley also recommended that there
should be a right of appeal for the clubs concerned against any decision
of the licensing authority.   What is quite clear throughout the report is
Lord Wheatley's awareness of the need to reconcile the paramount aim of
ensuring the safety of spectators with what would be reasonable ana
practicable for the clubs.

4 . Lord Wheatley also provided, as a technical appendix to his report,
guidelines to Safety standards at football grounds designed to assist the
local authorities in their task of enforcement.

CONSULTATIONS ON THE REPORT


5.   When the Report was published, those bodies mainly concerned, including
the local authority associations and the football authorities, were
consulted about Lord W h e a t l e y ’s proposals. The football authorities made
it clear that they were apprehensive at the financial implications for the
clubs, but there was general agreement with the proposals themselves.
Detailed consultations *rere held on the guidelines contained in the
technical appendix to the Report and these, duly amended, were finally
published by the Home Departments in November 1973 as a special booklet,
"Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds".

GUIDE TO SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

6.   The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force.    Its
primary purpose is to set out principles or guidelines which the local
authorities will no doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.
The Guide therefore deals wi th matters such as the provision of adequate
entrances and exits, means of escape, the slope of terracing, the
strength and siting of crush barriers, the construction of staircases,
and measures to ensure the safe movement of spectators both under normal
and emergency conditions.  The Guide is not a set of requirements to
be rigidly applied, regardless of individual circumstances.   As
Lord Wheatley recognised, it is important to maintain the maximum
flexibility in any system of control so as to take account of the
differing circumstances at individual grounds:   factors such as age,
size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to ground.

7.   While the basic principles set out in the Guide are relevant to
all sports stadia, modifications may well be necessary where sports
other than football are involved.  These will be discussed with the
appropriate authorities at the time. A copy of the Guide is attached.

THE GENERAL APPROACH TO THE ACT

8.   Lord Wheatley recommended that the introduction of any system of
control should be phased so that the more important grounds, regularly
attracting the larger attendances, should be dealt with first.    It is
intended, accordingly, that only those grounds consistent with
Lord Wheatley's category 1 should be dealt with first, that is to say,
the international grounds, the English First and Second Division and
the Scottish Premier Division Clubs, about 60 in all.   3ut the full
system of control under the Act will not apply to Lord Wheatley's
category 4 , namely, grounds with accommodation for fewer than 1 0 ,0 0 0
spectators.   The intention is that safety at these grounds should be
secured largely by voluntary action on the part of the club concerned in
consultation with the local authority.

9.   The main instrument of control unde r the Act is the safety
certificate issued by the local authority.   A safety certificate will
be needed in respect of every stadium which is the subject of a
designation order made by the Secretary of State.   The certificate will
enable the local authority to impose such terms and conditions as are
necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the ground in
question having regard to the circumstances.

10.  The Act has been designed with football stadia chiefly in view.
But other stadia, if necessary, can be brought within the system of
local authority control as well as places such as racecourses where
large numbers cf spectators may be crowded together in stands.  Nothing
will be done, however, without full and prior consultation with those
concerned.
JUBSTANC3 OF THE ACT

11.   The first 5 sections establish the main system of control under
the Act, that is to say, the safety certificate, issued by the local
authority, which will be required for 8very sports stadium designated
for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.

 12. Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate
 any sports stadium having accommodation for more than 1 0 ,0 0 0 spectators
 as requiring a safety certificate.     A safety certificate is issued by
 the local authority for the area in which the stadium is situated, that
 is to say, the county council in England and '.vales a nd the appropriate
 regional authority in Scotland.     Safety certificates are to be of two
kinds, general and special.       A general safety certificate will be the
main continuing form of control and will be issued for an indefinite
 period in respect of a specified activity or activities regularly
 taking place at the stadium.     A special safety certificate m ay be issued
 at the discretion of the local authority for a special event or other
 circumstances not covered by the gensral safety certificate.      Such an
 event might be an evangelistic rally which might call for special
 arrangements if, for example, seating were provided for the congregation
 on the playing area. A special safety certificate can be issued only in
respect of a sports stadium for which a general safety certificate is alrea
"1^. ° r^ & e contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section 2 .
 The local authority is empowered to include in the certificate such
 terms and conditions as are necessary to secure, at the stadium in
 question, a reasonable degree of safety.     Without prejudice to this
 general power, the section requires certificates to contain t e m s and
 conditions relating to major matters such as entrances and exits, means
 of escape in an emergency, the number, strength and situation of crush
 barriers, and the maximum number of spectators who m a y be admitted to
 the stadium or any part of it.     To remove any possibility of doubt,
 sub-section (3 ) makes it clear that a certificate m a y include a
 condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance and
 the maintenance of safety.

14.   In imposing conditions, local authorities will doubtless follow
the principles set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds, although
as already explained, this document has no statutory force.     It is
envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the
local authority and the club, as well as the building authority, the
police ana tne fire service, in the process of drawing up the certificate
conditions.   For example, if a ground is rarely filled to capacity,
the local authority is free in such a case to base its requirements on
actual levels of attendance over a given period rather than maximum
capacity.   On the rare occasions a capacity crowd was expected, the
procedure of the special safety certificate could be invoked so that
more than the normal permitted number of spectators might be admitted
subject to    -.'oial additional safeguards such as more attendants,
admission by -,i^kot only and so on. Again, if a stand we re found to be
structurally •..oak, the local authority might restrict admission to it
until it had been strengthened.     But the club would have the choice
whether to have the necessary remedial works carried out, so that the
restriction could be removed, or to accept the restriction indefinitely.

15.   The earlier Bill, which was introduced in 1973, limited the terms
and conditions imposed under a safety certificate to what was necessary
to secure a reasonable degree of safety for members of the public.
There was some difficulty over this terra because it might have excluded
for example, members of s u p p ort ers ’ clubs. This particular problem
has been met by the definition of "spectator" in section 17, that is
to say, any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.
On the other hand, it seems right that all the people present on the
occasion of a match or other activity for wh ich a ground has a
certificate should be taken into account for the purposes of the
safety certificate, for example, people using a squash court or other
facilities at the ground.    Accordingly, the general power of the
local authority under section 2 ( 1 ) to include in a safety certificate
such terms or conditions as are necessary omits any reference to
people and speaks only of securing "reasonable safety at the stadium",
(although the term "safety", as defined in section 17, does not include
danger arising from participation in a sport).       Certain provisions
must, however, be specifically linked with spectators (who are, after
all, the people the Act is mainly designed to protect and who will be
greatly in the majority),, Thus section 2(2) requires the certificate
to state the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted, an d it
is a serious offence, under section 1 2 (l) (a) or (c) for spectators to
be admitted to a designated stadium where no safety certificate is in
operation.

 16.    Sec tion 3 sets out the broad procedure to befoilowed when a
 local authority receives a n application for a safety certificate.          It
.requires them to d e t e r m i n e 'Whether an applicant is, in their opinion,
 a qualified person, that is to say, a person likely to be in a
 position to prevent contravention cf the terms and conditions imposed
 in the certificate.     If so, they are then under a duty to issue a
 general safety certificate to him. In this respect, the general safety
 certific.E-.te is different from the fire certificate issued under the
 Fire Precautions Act 1971.           The latter is issued only after necessary
 safety works have been completed.           The safety certificate under this
 Act will be issued almost from the outset and will be an instrument
 of continuing control.        The issue of a special safety certificate,
 however, is left to the discretion of the local authority, as already
 explained, because only their can judge whether it is appropriate to
 issue it for the special occasion in question.

17.   The local authority are required to send a copiy of any
application for a certificate to the police and to the building
authority, and must consult them about the terns a n d conditions to be
included in the certificate. The need for such consultation is self-
evident:   there must be close co-ordination of the interests of the
different authorities directly concerned with different aspects of
safety at football grounds.

18.   Section 4 provides for the amendment, replacement, transfer,
surrender and cancellation of safety certificates.   It is of primary
importance that a local authority should have power to amend a safety
certificate where it appears appropriate for them to do so, for example
if they find in the course of a routine inspection that a part of a
ground has become so dangerous as to demand an immediate restriction on
its use or seme other necessary safeguard.   Again, they must have
power to relax a requirement where, for example, certain improvements
have been carried out to make this possible.

 19.   Section 5 provides for appeals by interested parties against
 decisions or requirements of the local authority in connection with
 safety certificates.  Appeals will lie to the Secretary/ of State.,         In
 this respect, there is a departure from Lord W h e a t l e y ’s proposal that
appeals should be heard by a specially constituted tribunal.    But apart
from the need to avoid creating r.iore special tribunals than necessary,
most appeals are likely to be on technical matters and it therefore
seems appropriate for appeals in this case to be made to a Minister.
But the Secretary of State will have power to set up a formal inquiry
along the lines reccamended by Lord Wheatley, should the need arise.

20.   Section 6 (2 ) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations
relating to the cafety of spectators at sports grounds.    This is in
the nature of a reserve power which could be used, for example, to
give backing to requirements of the local authorities which in the
light of experience had been shown always to be essential.    This
section also empowers the Secretary of State to ma ke regulations for
various other purposes connected with the Act.

21.   Section 7 provides for acme supplementary matters on determination
and appeals.  Sub-sections (l) and (2; provide for the deemed with­
drawal cf an application for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate
when a local authority determines that a person is not, or has ceased
to be, qualified to hold it.  The section also provides for the
suspension cf a condition in a certificate pending determination of an
appeal against the inclusion of that ccnditicn, although a court, on
the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition
remain in force pending the determination of the appeal.

22.   The holder of a general safety certificate is required by
section 8 to notify the local authority of any proposed alteration or
extension of a stadium.  The purpose of the clause is to guard against
any alterations being made, without the local authority's knowledge,
which might affect the safety of spectators®               ,

23.   Section 9 provides for the harmonisation of the Act with other
legislation which may affect sports stadia.

24.    Section 1C is an important emergency power.  Should a magistrates'
ccurt, on the application of a local authority, consider that the risk
to spectators at any sports ground is so great that their admission
should be prohibited or restricted until remedial action has been
taken,   the court may make an order accordingly.  This power applies
to any sports ground whether or not it is required to have a safety
certificate.   In practice, it is not expected that the power will
often need to be exercised.   In the case of a small football stadium,
for example, not subject to the designation order procedure,
consultation:: between the local authority and the club concerned are
expected tc 33 cure the prevision of a reasonable standard of safety on
a voluntary basis.

25. Section 11 confers rights of entry and inspection on persons
appointed by the local authority and others involved in the task of
ensuring crowd safety at sports grounds. Section 12 deals with offences
and penalties.

26.   Section 1 3 deals mainly with civil liability. Its purpose is to
make clear that while nothing in the Act itself confers a right of
action in respect of a contravention of regulations or of conditions
in a safety certificate, the existing rights of a spectator injured
at a football stadium to bring an action for negligence against the
occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.
27.   The Secretary of State is empowered by section 15 to extend to
clashes of sports grounds other than sports stadia such provisions of the
Act as are not already expressed to apply to them.  For example, it
enables the Secretary of State by order to extend the safety certificate
procedure to such places as race-courses.  Cnly a class of sports ground
may be the subject of an extension order under this clause:  an individual
sports ground (other than a stadium) cannot be designated until section 1
of the Act has been applied by an order under section 15 to the class of
sports ground to which it belongs.

28*   Section 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications,
to the Crown*  Section 17 deals with interpretation.

29*   Section 18 provides that orders and regulations except commencement
orders, made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution
procedure.  It also imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, before m a k i n g
any orders or regulations, except commencement orders or orders relating
to the Isles of Scilly, to consult with such persons as appear to him
requisite.

 Dear Sir

€^:TE office circular no * 1 3 0 /7 6

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 19755
 FIRST DESIGNATION ORDER AND ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS

 1 . The intention was expressed in Horns Office Circular No* 1-50/1975 of issuing, i n
 due course, further guidance on tho procedure to be followed when a ground is designated
 under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 as requiring a safety c ert if i c a t e • As
 will be seen from the enclosed copy., an order has now been made (SI 1976 Ko. 1264)
 designating under the A c t 4 with effect from 1 J a nu ary 1977» the international association
 and rugby union football grounds and those of the clubs i n the firct di vis ion of the
 football league*

 2a      It is an offence under section 12(1) of the Act to admit spectators to a designated
  stadium after the dare on whic h the designation order relating to it cojnes into
  operation, unless an application for a general safety certificate has been m.de a nd not
  subsequently withdrawn or deemed to have been withdrawn.      In consequence, therefore,
  of this order, the local authorities for the areas in which the grounds are situated
^fcy expect to receive- by the date of operation applications for the grant of general
 7 ^ r > t y certificates under the Act, which will thereupon fall to be dealt with in
\; ^ r d a n c e with tho Act and the regulations, also enclosed made under section 6(1) of
  the Act (SI 1976 No. 1263).

 3 0 Guidance as to the -procedure to be followed, in conformity with the regulation*?,
 in dealing with applications for general safety certificates is set out in the tom ex
 to this circular*

 ko  It is not proposed at this stage to issue guidance as to the procedure to be
 followed in connection witli the grant of special safety certificates, s i n c e v under
 section 3(2) of the Act, such certificates are not required until general safety
 certificates are in operation*        Further guidance for this purpose \/i.U accordingly be
 deferred until nearer the date when a need for special safety certificates may arise#
 There is, however, one 1actor regarding the issue of such certificates which may have
 a bearing on the date of the introduction of a general safety certificate and to which
 regal’d should accordingly be paid • Onco a general safety certificate has been issued,
 a person wishing to conduct an' activity calling for tho issue of a special safety
 certificate rcust comply with all the requirements relating to such certificates laid
 down in the regulations*   W h e r e , therefore, ouch an event has already been arranged,
 local'authorities may wish to consider, where appropriate, the desirability of not
 issuing a general certificate until -after the event has taken place »•

 5c  The regulations provide specific time limits for the determination, of application:!
 for spccdal safety certificates, but this is not the case as regards genera’!. Gaiety
 certificates*  A1 though local authorities and the clubs and other organioal::ens op:ratir:.;<
 ntorl ia will no doubt have done as much pre-planning as posc3.bJ.e, it u.s assumed vha<- i.he
H f s and consultations involved in determining suitable terras and conditions will,
 many cases, still extend over several weeks, so that -it will not be practicable,
>ecird ly should appellate proceedings arise, to bring certificates into eifect
nificantly in advance of the end of the 97^/77 season. In these circumstances,
[ v'hr-re a club or stadium company wishes to take advantage ol the close season to
•ry out structural work which will have the effect of significantly altering the
.mQ r.UKi conditions which would otherwise have applied, local authorities may feel that,
'ending on the condition of the stadium and having regard to the powers already
dlable to deal with cases of severe risk, the maximum advantage is to be gained by
rerring the issue of a certificate until the beginning of the 1977/78 season so as
 enable as much work as p0. 3 sib.le to be done. In tnis way, it is hoped that it will
anally be possible for a sufficient measure of agreement to be readied between the
:erected parties to obviate the need for appeals against the terms and conditions
posedo

   It is suggested in paragraph 5 of the annex that local authorities will wish to keep
 mind tne guidelines set out.'in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds when framing the
editions which they consider should be included in the safety certificate. Some of
     "recommend<i.tions have been revised in tho light of the experience gained in applying
“""'guideline5; during the past year or so. The Guide is being reprinted and should be
l i a b l e we3.1 before the first designation order becomes effective; a copy will bo seat
 you. "as soon as it becomes available.. A list of the proposed amendments to the Guide
 attached for reference in the moantiise*

   Section. 6(1)(b) of the Act enablos the Secretary of State to make regulations
th'orisjW local authorities to doto.rr.dne the fees whicli may be charged in respect of
plications Tor safety certificates.     In the discharge of this power, Regulation 1**
ovides that sue!) charges may ba t;-ada in respect cf applications for the i^sue or
endnient of safety certificates, but that they shall not exceed an amount commensurate
til the work actually and reasonably done. As regards the issue of a general safety
rtificatf! it is hoped that, by affording stadium authorities an opportunity to co-operat
"the full,'by eg preparing plans, checking crush barriers, etc, local authorities should
  the normal course, not find it necessary to charge fees representing more than 17

■“ate it b o If proposed conditions w h i c h w o u l d apply only to xucuie woxks, should b o z v g
I obviate confusion.        At tho aawo tira©, however, care Must be taken not to exclude-
com tbf* certificate any r e striction gorasne to current conditions, since section 5 0 )
f the Act provides for an interested p a r t y to app e al to the Secretary of State against
lie inclusion o f anyth i n g in,, or the o m i ss i o n o f an y t h in g from, a safety certificate,
ad these rights must not be p re judiced in any way in consequence of tae fortn c f the
ortificato.

      As regards the scope o f a general safety certificate, section 2 ( 5 ) o f the Act
roVides that different terms and conditions may bo included for different; activities.
It hour’ll therefore, a etaaitsa Kay be in regular us© only as a football ground, in
asos where it is also ne e d from tii&e to time to stage other events it wou ld be desir-
ble     a n d 3 n m n y cases obviate the n e e d for special safety certificates, if the terms
n d c o n d i t i o n appropriate to those events were to bo included in the general certif-
Cato.       It is suggested that any such events for w h i c h it is considered desirable to
rov i d e might conveniently be divided iato 2 classesJ

     (1 )   thobo sufficiently sirailar in character to tae isain purpose of tho                        .
            stadium for the n o r m al terms an d conditions to be equally applicable,

     (2)    Those o f a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
            concerts, etc which -say involve all or part of the playing area being
            H ^ e n over to spectator a c c o m o d a t i o n a nd for which separate torus and
            conditions will have to be devioad.              It is not, of co-arse, necessary to
            provide for these contingencies in cases whore no clear need is foreseen
            by the ctodiuu authorities*

7     Tho**e nay also be circuraafconceo i n which tho terms and conditions applicable to
.L   m r r - l s c t i v n v of the atadiwa may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a epscial
[vent     w c h . a s a~cun tie or a "local Darby", is e j e c t e d to attract sie;ni£icantly moro
:ba„ tho usual attendance.           In the case especially o f cup replays these special events
:,av ari;. with only a few days* notice, within which it would not be possible to               _ ^
iccommodate tho whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to the grant ot a special
•afe**v certifiost«.          la order to overcome this difficulty, it would seera cos arable foi
•lv> local authorities and stadium authorities to seek to work out in advance the
' d U ^ o n e         to the normal terms and conditions which might be appropriate to such
locations, eg the admission of increased numbers to certain areas on the condition
 •hat'extra stewards and police are employed, that notice is given to fcne local
 authority, and so on, and to provide for their incorporation in the general safety
certificate.

3     Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determination of
 *v annual, 'the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amendment o f _the
certificate    which may be at the initiative either of the holder of the certificate or
Jf the local authority (see section k(P.) of the Act) and will presumably R e f l e c t
~har*es Ha circumstances occurring since the grant o f the original certificate.          It
will°thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities and clubs/stadiuw authorities
for a close liaison to be maintained after the issue of Die certificate and certainly
L,hiio s-ny further works of safety measures are being carried out.         It is likoly to be
in the stadiua o p e r a t o r s ’ finanical interest to get the safety certificate amended as
poon as possible alter wcrlt has been completed, and they shoulo, accordingly ensure that
tho local authority is kept informed of progress,           for its part the local authority
will no doubt wish"to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion
uf the work,    the certificate can be amended without delayo
        Al-or a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for tho transfer
nf tb« certificate to another Person. ' Similarly, while a local authority xa consxdoring
  n                      for a certificate find before tho certificate has boon granted, it may bo
^ c d to substitute eoae person other than the original applicant as the person to vnom
       c e r t i f i e d should be p a n t e d . Those arc, however, likely to bo rare occurrences
fn th- c~r- of rene r a l safety certificates, where an application will normally bo rr.ado
on i e ^ T o f a club or a stadium organisation by an a u t h o r e d official of tho club
or r e w e s e n t a t i v o of tho organisation.    However, if it does happen, tho local authorxty
will b» required in both caaos to determine whether the substituted nominee io a
ana] ’f ied L - s o n .       Thereafter, in the first case, tho procedure xaxd down xn the
rervlatione relating to giving notice of, and the reasons for, t.,e determination uxll
apply" together with any necessary appeals procedure.               In the second case, . h u e is no
 reason why the local authority should not treat the application m all respects as a
 n e w application in the terms of the original one and process xt xrom the point it had

already reached.

  10      Jn addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety certificate
  ^ i n c t th* determination that he is not a qualified person (see paragraph f above)
t f £ c h / o f course, applies also in the case of a proposed transfer of a certificate, ohe
 H e t i-ovides a further right of appeal to any "interested party" (which term i n c l u d e
-the ho 3 der of tha safety certificate) against the inclusion of anything xn or the
  o S s S o n of anything from a safety certificate or against a refusal to « n d or replace
  a Gaiety certificate.      The regulations provide that, xn the c m Oi a general eaxe^y

  of a notice of the local authority's decision, or, xn the case of persons who axe no*

    AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDE

    The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1973 and is ba se d on the •

    technical Appendix to Lord Wheatley's Report of'the Inquiry into Ground Safety

    at Sports Grounds.                      Since its publication,              its use on a voluntary basis has

    brought to notice the need for some amendments to be made to the guidelines


    wh e n applied to football grounds*


    2.     D u r i n g consideration of the Safety of Sports Grounds Bill, Ministers mentioned

0   that if the provisions of the Act were applied to sports grounds other than

®   football grounds,               separate guides would be compiled for the different classes of

     sports grounds.                  The e xi s t i ng Guide will accordingly be revised and re-printed

     as the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football).                                   The amendments which will

     be made for this purpose are,                        in the meantime, attached as an appendix to this


     note.


     3.     These      a m e n d m e n ts   include   a   new chapter covering the recommendations of the

     Minister for S p o r t ’s W o r k i n g P a r t y on Crowd Behaviour which was established m

     1974 to look.into means of combating hooliganism at football grounds.                                   Matters

      of crowd control inevitably have a b ea r i n g on safety at sports grounds and it

      has accordingly b e e n thought right to incorporate the W o rking Party's

      recommendations for the general convenience of clubs and other stadium authorities,



      4.     The'main amendments in the attached list are as follows:

              a.      Exits- from each area of              s p e c t a to r   'accommodation should enable the

                      spectators to leave that area in 8 minutes or less.


              b.      E v e r y spectator on the terrace should be within 12 metres of a


                      gangway or exit.

                 c.   Railings and fences dividing sections of the ground should be of

           ' .        the same strength as handrails.


                 d.   Depending on the condition of the individual stand, the time

                       specified for the evacuation may lie between tho prescribed

                       maxinuro and minimum.
     e.   A recommended distance from terrace to touchline is now given

          o n ly for a terrace gradient of 30° or more.


     f.   The reco m m en d e d flowrate from all sections of the ground has

          b e e n increased to 60 persons p e r minute per unit of exit

          w i d t h except in the case of stands (where it remains at 4 0 ).


     g.   R ec ommended strengths are given for handrails in various

          situations.


     h.   Recommendations of the W o r k i n g P ar t y on Crowd Behaviour.



5.   It is aga i n emphasised that the recommendations made in the Guide to Safety

at Sports Grounds are essentially guidelines and ,irfiould J e J f p p l i e d t o e x i s t i n g ?

                           ^he^iiecessary ^:degree B i ' M e x i l v i l i t y t o :take -account ,of the*

                          "Recent research has indicated that when it takes more
                          than 7 minutes to vacate an area of spectator accommo­
                          dation the crowd flow tends to become turbulent.        In
                          these conditions individuals can lose control over their
                          own movement and the rate of flow may be reduced.        It is
                          therefore s u r e s t e d that the exits from each area of
                          spectator accommodation should be designed so that if
                          desired or recmired the spectators can leave that area
                          in 8 minutes or less."

                          "Care should be taken in the planning of exit systems to

                          native exit routes in the event of their normal exit
                          route being obstructed."

 access should be designed to secure a unifo r m flow down
 each channel.

        The approach to the head of the stairs should be
 level, and should be so arranged that the spectators
 converge on the stairway from the front and/or the sides
 only.  There should be no approach from behind, involving
 movement around the ends of the balustrades or side walls
 of the stairway except where this approach is already
 controlled by physical means, such as by the gangways in
 the seated areas of stands.

18 .        Recommendations of the Work-In,? Party on Crowd Behaviour

18.1    ■    Crowd movement on terraces should "be severely limited in
             order to give the Police the fullest opportunity for crowd
             control.  Less problems occur where the terraces are
             divided as f r r as possible into sections by the use of'
             railings or barriers, both radial and lateral.    Ideally,
             each section should be self-contained arid should be
             serviced by its own entrance/exits, refreshment facilities
            'and toilets, (see para. 7 *7.)

18.2        "Home" and visiting supporters should be segregated.  It
            should not be possible for spectators to transfer from one
            end of the ground to the other.

18»3        Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as
             possible in normal circumstances while, at the same time,
             pr o v id i n g the Police with proper access to the terraces for
             the purposes of crowd control ?nd enabling the pitch to be
            u s e d in the event of serious emergency.       One alternative
             to fenc i n g is the construction around the pitch of a wall
             w i t h a smooth surface which should be not less than 4 feet
             in height on the terrace side.         This boundary wall should
             have gates or access points to the pitch w h i c h could be
             man n e d by the Police or stewards.      A walkway between the
             boundary wall raid the terraces, which would be solely
             occupied by Police, First Aid and official club personnel,
             has been found to be effective as regards safety and
             security.        In order to achieve this, it might be necessary
             to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect the
             walkway from the terrace by a continuous lino of barriers,
             b o d e s igned as to discourage access to the walkway except

             at authorised points.        The access points from terrace to
             w a lkway should be reasonably near the access points from
             w a l kway to the pitch,      (see para 7.10).  Where a walkway
              nystesn is in use, sliding gates may be installed at the
              access points from the walkway to the .pitch, io where there
              can be no crowd pressure against them,        (see para 6.14*2
              r egarding use of sliding gates elsewhere).       A barrier to
              the pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level
             of the playing-area.

 18.4       Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
             sale of alcohol.  In any case all refreshments should be
             served in plastic containers.

 18.5       Home clubs should consider, in conjunction w i th the Police,
             each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
             and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club.    So far
             as the terraces are concerned, any allocation should have
             regard to the manner in wh i ch the terraces are divided so
             that policing errangements can be effective.

 18*6       The home club should, as a general rule, make it their
             policy not to issue tickets for announced all-ticket matches
             to away supporters 011 the day of the game. 'However, the
             local Police will be best able to assess the situation and
            'their advice should be followed, but it is important where-
             ever possible to discourage 'supporters from travelling to
             all-ticket matches without tickets.

1. IN T R O D U C T IO N
1.1 T his boo k let is a guide to measures fo r im proving spectator
safety a t football grounds ie a t R u gby U n io n a n d R u g b y League
grounds as well as a t soccer grounds. I t is a v o lu n ta ry code a n d has
no legal force.

1.2 Guidelines o n m easures fo r im proving the safety o f spectators
a t sports grounds first became available on a m o re o r less com ­
prehensive scale w hen the W heatley R e p o rt o n C row d Safety a t
Sports G ro u nd s w as published in 1972. T he recom m endations in
the appendix to th a t R e p o rt were extended to include fire p re­
cautions and m eans o f escape from an em ergency situation such
as a fire, and th e n form ed the basis o f the G uide to Safety a t Sports
G ro u n d s (which becam e kn o w n as ‘the green code’). T h e application
 o f those guidelines to football grounds during the next few years
 bro u g h t to light a need for the advice to be am ended in certain
 respects. F u rth erm o re, since the safety o f spectators c a n be affected
 w hen crowds are disturbed by hooliganism , it was felt th a t the
 recom m endations' o f the W o rk in g P a rty on C row d B ehaviour,
 which were m ade k no w n to the F o o tb all League clubs in 1975,
 should b e inco rpo rated in an y com prehensive guide to safety at
 football grounds. This bo o klet is the outcom e. Since this new guide
 is aim ed a t football grounds, as distinct from sports grounds in
  general, it has been nam ed accordingly.

 1.3 T h e problem o f crow d safety a t football grounds is complex
 and can n ot be solved simply by ensuring th a t each com p o n e n t o f
 a ground, such as stairways, passages o r sections o f terracing, is
 satisfactory in itself. T h e inter-relation o f com ponents is essential:
 they should be com patible arid com bine to form a balanced unit.

  1.4 D eviations fro m individual guidelines are possible w ith o ut
  necessarily detracting from the overall safety o f the ground. A

                                                                                 1
flexible a p p ro a c h should be m aintained to take account o f the p a r­
ticular circum stances a t individual grounds.

1.5 A ltho u gh new w o rk o r reconstruction a t football g rounds
should n o t be to a sta n d a rd lower th a n th a t set out in the guidelines,
it should be b o rn e in m in d when using the guide to assess w hether
existing situations provide adequately fo r the safety o f spectators
th a t the criterion is th a t o f a reasonable degree o f safety. It would
be u n reaso n ab le, even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute
safety o f everyone atten din g a ground.

1.6 T h e a d v ic e g iv e n in th isg u id e is w ith o u tp re ju d ic e to the operatio:
o f the B uilding R egulations 1972 fo r E n glan d a n d W ales (in In n er
L o n d o n the L o n d o n Building A cts and C on stru ctio nal Bye-Laws),
the Building S tan d ard s (Scotland) R egulations 1971-73 a n d any
o th er relevant legislation.



2. THE PROBLEM
2.1 T here are essentially three types o f safety p rob lem to be con­
sidered w ithin a football g ro u n d a n d in its im m ediate surroundings.

2.2 T h e first concerns h azards affecting individuals which cause
tripping, slipping an d falling. T h e guidelines fo r general construc­
tional features o f a g ro u n d are intended to deal w ith this type o f
problem .

2.3 T h e second type is far m ore im p ortan t. W h e n large crowds are
p resent a n d densities are high, pressures b uild up w ithin the crow d
either th ro u g h m o tio n o r swaying which m ake it difficult, o r ever /
impossible, for individuals to control their ow n movem ents. U n d e r
these conditions crow d pressures can escalate to a dangerous state
a n d if a perso n stum bles or falls the crow d can no t a d a p t to avoid
him o r stop to help. Since this type o f danger arises from crowd
pressures its remedy lies in their removal o r restraint w ithin safe
limits. These dangers arise in p articular on terraces and in exit
routes, and so careful a tten tio n m u st be paid to restraining surges
 and sim ilar pressures on the terraces and to ensuring free m ovem ent
 th ro u g h o u t the exit systems. Such free m ovem ent is dependent
 u p o n the capacity o f all the various sections o f the exit systems
 an d interactions between them.
2.4 T h e third type o f safety pro b lem c a n n o t be divorced from^the
second a n d in som e ways is an extrem e version o f it. T he danger
arises fro m emergency situations w hich can develop follow ing, for
example, a n o u tb re a k o f fire o r hooliganism . T h e orderly evacua­
tion o f large crow ds m ay u n d e r emergency conditions becom e a very
serious p ro b le m , particularly in respect o f stands w here spectators
are in effect o n the ro o f o f a building, the m aterials a n d construction
 o f w hich m ig h t themselves constitute a fire risk.



 3. GENERAL CONSTRUCTIO N
 3 1 T o m eet the requirem ents o f safety in a g round, all com p o nen ts
 a n d installations, e.g. terraces, stands, stairs, barriers a n d pylons,
 should have the strength an d durability, and be m aintained in such
 condition a n d arranged in such a m an n er as to p erform safely their
 required functions. T h e design and construction o f these com ­
 ponents a n d installations should be in accordance w ith good
 engineering a n d building practice, especially as set o u t in all relevant
  British S ta n d a rd specifications an d codes o f practice.

 3.2 All electrical installations should com ply w ith the cu rren t
 edition o f th e Regulations o f the In stitu tio n o f Electrical Engineers.

  3.3 W h en walls a n d fences are to w ithstan d crow d pressures they
  should b e designed to w ithstand such pressures safely and allow ance
  should be m ade .fo r forces sim ultaneously a n d independently
  induced by o th er factors, e.g. w ind forces o r attach ed installations.

  3 4 P recautions should be tak en to prevent people fro m clim bing on
  roofs, pylons, hoardings a n d the like. W h ere possible such struc­
  tures* sh ou ld be provided w ith unclim bable devices, e.g. sto u t
  barriers o r close b o a rd e d enclosures. Spikes an d b arb ed wire
  should be installed only above a m inim um height o f 2-4 m etres from
   the base.

   3.5 All p a rts o f the g round used by the general public, a n d especially
   tlie exit routes, should have a m inim um h e a d ro o m o f 2-4 m etres o r
   such height as required b y the ap p ro p riate Building R egulations.

   3.6 W here the n atu ral lighting in any section o f the g round accessible
   to the public is deficient, adequate artificial lighting should be
provided. I f the g ro u n d is intended for use d u rin g the hours o f
darkness, all p a rts accessible to the p ublic should be provided w ith
m eans o f lighting adeq uate to enable them to see their w ay into,
w ithin and o u t o f the g round. T hese provisions are particularly
im p o rta n t in relation to exit routes a n d stairw ays used by the public.


4.     IN S P E C T IO N S A N D T E S T S
4.1 A detailed inspection o f the ground, including all com ponents
a n d installations, sh ou ld b e carried o u t annually to ensure com pliance
w ith the guidelines in this code.

4.2 Follow ing each event, a general visual inspection o f the g ro u nd / '. !
should be m ade fo r signs o f dam age which m ight create a potential f y j
dan g er to the public. P articu lar atten tio n should be paid to the
condition o f terraces, viewing slopes and stairways. C ru sh barriers
a n d balustrades should be exam ined for deform ation o r any o th er
overt signs o f weakness.

 4.3 T esting o f crush barriers sh ou ld be carried o ut in accordance
 w ith A ppendix C o f this code. W h e n the guidelines are first
 applied to a p a rticu lar g round, a representative sam ple o f barriers
 o f all types from all areas o f the gro u n d sh o u ld be selected fo r
 testing. F u rth e r testing o f barriers should be necessary only at
 intervals o f several years unless circum stances arise w hich raise
 d o u b ts as to their strength.


 5. IN G R E SS TO THE GRO UND
 5.1 W here adm ission to a football g rou n d o r p a rts o f it is controlled ^
 b y turnstiles, these, by their n u m b e r an d location, control n o t only    •,
 the rate o f adm ission b u t, to a large extent, the dispersal o f
 spectators w ithin a g ro u nd to th eir chosen sections. Turnstiles v ,/
 should be o f such num bers as to adm it a t a ra te whereby no unduly
 large crowds are w aiting fo r adm ission and yet at n o faster rate
 th a n the arrangem ents for distributing spectators w ithin the ground
  perm it.

     5.2 D an gerou s overcrow ding can be caused if spectators are able
     to force their w ay in to a g rou n d already full to capacity by scaling
     o r breaking th ro u g h b o u n d a ry fences. T o avoid this danger such
     fences should be o f a p p rop riate height an d strength.

section to flow in on e direction w hen leaving the ground.

6.7 So fa r as possible, exit routes should be free from obstructions.
In p a rticular, no kiosk o r lavatory should be situated in such a way
th a t it o r any associated queue obstructs an exit route.

6.8 A lth o u g h the m inim um w id th fo r any section o f an exit route
should be 1.1 metres the required w idth for any p articu lar section

 6.10 F o r a m ore complex exit system com bining a n um ber o f
 exit routes a n d /o r offering a choice o f alternative routes to exits,
 however, the system should be analysed in the form o f a netw ork
 in o rder to check th a t the capacity o f the exit fro m the terrace o r
 sta n d is such as to ensure a free flow o f spectators to the various
 exits fro m the ground. W here branching o f routes gives departing
 spectators a choice o f paths, the p ro p o rtio n o f the crow d likely to
  use each p a th should be derived from local knowledge.

 6.11 W h ere there is n o t a free flowing system, the w idth o f the
 restricting element should be increased a n d /o r the w idth o f the exit
 fro m the sta n d o r th e terrace reduced.

  6.12 W here there are gross deviations in design o r construction
  from the recom m ended guidelines so as to create a m anifest dange
  th a t section o f the exit system should be closed (and a reduction i
  th e capacity o f the section o f the g round w hich it serves should
  made) until remedial action has been taken.

  6.13 C are should b e taken in the p lan n in g o f exit systems to ensure
  th a t crow ds have access in an emergency to alternative exit routes
  in the event o f their norm al exit route being obstructed.

   6 .14 Exit d o o r s
   6.14.1 All doors on an exit route should be capable o f opening
   o utw ards in ord er th at crowds can escape in an emergency. This
p o in t is o f p a rtic u la r im p o rtan ce in the case o f doors w ithin stands
an d at the fo o t o f stairways. W h ere exit d o ors have to be secured
against outside intruders they should be fitted w ith panic-type
bolts.

6.14.2 W h ere it is im practicable fo r exit gates fro m a ground
to open outw ards fo r n orm al use since to do so w o u ld cause, for
example, an obstruction on a public highway, th e gates should
be resited w ithin the exit route they serve, o r provision m ade
for two-way opening. Sliding o r roller-shutter gates are n o t
recom m ended because they are incapable o f being opened when
pressure is exerted in the direction o f crow d flow a n d have m echa­
 nism o r runw ays w hich are vulnerable to jam m ing.


 6.14.3 All doors o n a n exit rou te should be secured in th e fully open
 position before the end o f play..

 6.14.4 W h en open, no d o o r should obstruct any gangway, passage,
 stairw ay o r landing.

 6.14.5 T h ere should be n o obstruction in a n exit e.g. n o change
  in level at exit doors.

  6.14.6 All exit gates should be m an n ed at all times while the ground
  is used by the p ublic so th a t they can be opened im m ediately in an
  emergency.

  6.14.7 Facilities should be provided to enable people to leave the
  ground at any time. F o r this purpose a nu m b er o f reversible
  turnstiles o r doors so operated as to limit th e openings to th e passage
  o f one person at a tim e m ight be considered.



  7 TERRACES
   7.1 Terraces are recognised as presenting a special safety problem .
   In addition to the incidental dangers o f standing fo r long periods
   o n steep terraced slopes, crowds are subject to excessive pressures
   generated by spectators straining to see the event, by excitement, o r
   by surging deliberately induced by a certain type o f spectator.
7.2 Failure to provide spectators w ith a n u no b structed view invites
th em to stretch a n d strain a n d so generate dangerous pressures
w ithin the crow d. F o r this reason it is desirable to provide a m ini­
m u m distance betw een the fro n t o f the terrace a n d the tou ch line
o r goal line o n the pitch (see p ara g ra p h 14).

7.3 A rran g em en ts should also be made to encourage even distri­
b u tio n o f the crow d o n th e terraces to provide ease o f access an d
egress, to facilitate m ovem ent particularly should a local emergency
arise d uring the event, a n d to contain pressures before they reach
d angerous p ro p o rtio n s. T h e following provisions will assist i n ..
achieving these conditions.                                            ■


7 .4 T e rr a ce s t e p s
 7.4.1 The surface o f terrace steps should be o f a non-slip m aterial
 with adeq uate drainage provided to prevent deterioration fro m the
 action o f rainw ater.

 7.4.2 A terrace step should be n o t less th a n 280 m m o r m ore th an
 380 m m wide, w ith a preferred dim ension between 355 mm and
 380 mm. -

 7.4.3 T he height o f risers should be w ithin the limits o f 75 m m and
 180 m m , the low er limit, o f 75 m m being related to the m inim um
 w idth o f 280 mm. I f the riser height is greater th a n 180 m m it is
 desirable th a t a crush barrier should be provided a t the to p o f the
 riser.

 7.4.4 Excessive variations in the gradient o f a terrace should be
 avoided. G rad ien ts steeper th a n 1 in 2 could be dangerous.  %
                                                                          h    '

  7.5 G a n g w a y s
  7.5.1 T h e aim should be to ensure that every spectator o n the terraces
  is w ithin 12 m etres o f a gangway or o f a n exit. This m ay be achieved
  by a p a tte rn o f gangways (not less th a n 1-1 m etres wide) linked to
  the exit system, the following points being b o rn e in m ind:

  7.5.2 Spectators w ould be discouraged from standing in lateral
  gangways if these were su n k 100 m m to 200 m m a n d if crush barriers
  were provided behind b u t not immediately in fro n t o f them.
7.5.3 R adial gangways w hich are relatively long a n d uncontrolled
dow nw ard p ath s th ro u g h terraces are difficult to keep clear especially
when sited in p o p u la r viewing areas, for example beh ind the goal
areas. I t is helpful to sink them 150 m m to 200 m m and to interrup t
an otherwise continuously descending gangway by turns along,
say, lateral gangways. As w ith other form s o f stairways the going
should be uniform a n d the step dimensions as defined in p a ra g rap h
9.3.4.


7.6 D iv is io n o f s p e c t a t o r a c c o m m o d a t i o n
7.6.1 A gro u n d should be divided into sections to prevent m ajor
m igrations by spectators. F o r example, each end or side o f a ground
should be self-contained with its ow n entrances, exits a n d toilet/
refreshm ent facilities. T here should be no access from one such
m ajo r section to a n o th e r except in an emergency.

7.6.2 Railings, fences, etc. dividing sections o f the ground should
be o f the strength o f the handrails dividing stairways into channels,
described in p a ra g ra p h 13.

7.6.3 Each o f these m a jo r sections should be sub-divided by such
means as gangways a n d crush barriers so disposed as to minimise
sway and surge o f spectators. R ecom m endations on the siting o f
gangways an d the spacing o f crush barriers are given in p aragraphs
7.5 an d 12.


7.7 Crush barriers
7.7.1 M u c h o f the ha za rd on terraces can be eliminated by the
provision o f well constructed, correctly positioned a n d properly
m ounted crush barriers.

7.7.2 T he m axim um spacing o f crush barriers will be dependent
on the gradient o f the terrace or viewing slope. P ara g ra p h s 12 and
13 give recom m endations for the spacing a n d strength o f crush
barriers.

7.7.3 Ideally, crush barriers should be provided along the full
w idth o f a terrace with gaps only a t the radial gangways.

7.7.4 W here barriers are n o t continuous between radial gangways,
the alignment o f gaps in succesive rows of barriers on a terrace

                                                                            9

             n o t be m ore th a n 2 consccutivc gaps in any line o f gaps (see
             A ppendix B : Fig 1).

             7.7.5 W here there arc gaps in the line o f crush barriers these should
             be at least 1-1 metres a n d n o t m ore th a n 1-4 metres in width.

             7.7.6 In order to locate the to p rail against th a t p a rt o f the body
             m ost able to tolerate pressure, the height o f crush barriers should
             be between 1-02 metres a n d 1-12 metres above the nosing o f the
             step imm ediately behind the barrier, w ith a preferred height o f
             1*1 metres.                                                                 *

              7.8.3 Viewing slopes w ith a gradient greater th a n 1 in 6 should have
              continuous crush barriers between gangways.

              7.8.4 The spacing o f crush barriers should be the sam e as for

deem ed a crush barrier a n d fulfil the conditions o f height a n d
strength specified in pa ra g ra p h s 7.7.6 a n d 13, although if the fcncc
is o f solid construction its height m ay be m ore th a n 1-12 metres.
T his is because the pressures acting on a person forced against such
a fence are distributed over a large area o f the body, unlike the
situation w ith a norm al crush barrier, where the pressures are
localised.



8 STANDS
8.1 T h ere is generally a less hu rried d eparture fro m stands at
the end o f a m atch a n d furtherm ore, spectators are induced by the
layout o f the seats to fo rm orderly queues. How ever, the general
safety considerations are similar to those fo r terraces a n d in this
regard a ttention should be paid to the following points:

8.2 Every stand should be provided w ith sufficient exits to allow
fo r the orderly evacuation from the stand o f all spectators likely to
be accom m odated.                                   '
                                                         t

8.3 E vacuation time, which will depend largely on the fire hazard
present in the stand, should be w ithin the following limits:
a. 8 minutes w here a stand is of- non-com bustible fire resisting
    construction, the interior use a n d contents present a low fire
    risk a n d the exit staircases are n o t vulnerable to a fire occurring
    within the s ta n d ; and
b. 2-5 m inutes fo r stands o f a lower standard.
T h e conditions at a particular g ro u n d m ay call for interpolation
between these times.

 8.4 Seats a n d gangways should be so positioned as to provide
 ready access to exits. N o person in any p a rt o f a stand should have
 to travel m ore th a n 30 metres to the nearest exit from the stand.

 8.5 All seats should be securely fixed in position. T h e use o f tip-up
 seats allows m ore circulation space, the autom atic type being
 preferable.

 8.6 T h e m inim um area allotted to each seated person should be
 460 m m wide and 610 mm deep, b u t for com fort these m easurements
should be 550 m m a n d 760 m m respectively. T o enable people t0
m ove freely between rows o f seats there should be a t least 305 m m
between perpendiculars from the forem ost projection o f one scat
a n d the back o f the seat in front. (This m inim um o f 305 mm is
included in the 610 m m or 760 m m d epth m easurem ent o f the
seating area).

8.7 T he n u m b e r o f scats in a row should n o t excecd:
a. 14 seats where there is a gangw ay at one end only, and
b. 28 seats where there is a gangway at b o th ends.

 8.8 G angways should b e o f sufficient w idth for the seats served bu ^
 in no case o f less th a n 1-1 metres w ith out projections.          ^

 8.9 T he seating area should be separated fro m the rem ainder o f the
 stand b en eath it by a co nstruction having a fire resistance o f not
 less th a n h a lf a n ho ur.

 8.10 W alls w ithin stands a n d ceiling linings b en e ath the stand
 seats should have a flame spread classification o f n o t less th a n
 Class 1, w hen tested in accordance with British S tan d ard N o 476
 P a rt 7.

 8.11 A com m o n feature in the construction o f stands w hich is a fire
 risk is the provision o f voids u n d e r th e seating. T hese voids becom e
 the resting place fo r paper, cartons a n d other com bustible m aterials
 w hich can be ignited, unnoticed, by a carelessly discarded cigarette
 end. W herever possible such spaces should be excluded b u t where
 they exist they should be sealed off so th a t paper etc can n o t find its
  w ay into them .                                                          ,

  8.12 B a lu s tr a d in g                                                 I
  T hose sections o f balustrading w hich lie a t the fo o t o f stairways or
  gangways w ithin stands should have an equivalent strength to th a t
  o f crush barriers o f the stronger type (see p a rag ra p h 13).



   9 S TA IR W AYS AND RAM PS
   9 1 T his is a n area which calls for particular attention since the
   construction and disposition o f stairways play a vital p a rt in
   achieving th e desired aims o f sm o o th a n d unim peded egress for
spectators u n d er all conditions set o u t in p a ra g ra p h 6. T h e aim
should be to provide stairw ays which limit hazards to the m inim um
by such features as uniform going, secure footing, n o t to o steep a
gradient, and a w idth sufficient to allow free m ovem ent b u t narrow
enough to provide everyone w ith access to a handrail. T h e head o f
the stairw ay should be so designed th a t flow is uniform across its
w idth and crow d pressures cannot easily be generated. I n addition
flights should n o t provide long, unrestricted paths dow n w hich crowd
pressures a n d surges can be created. A dequate separation between
channels in m ulti-channel stairway arrangem ents should be provided
 so th a t there is no overspill from one channel to another.

9.2 Stairways should be carefully positioned to take advantage o f
n a tu ra l lighting a n d ventilation. W here the n atural lighting is
deficient the stairway should be adequately lit by artificial light.


9 .3 C o n s t r u c t i o n o f s t a i r w a y s
9.3.1 T he width,, rise a n d ‘going’ o f the steps should be uniform on
any stairway.                                     . . .

9.3.2 Stair treads should be provided w ith non-slip surfaces and
d urab le edgings. A d eq u a te drainage should be provided.

 9.3.3 O pen risers should n o t be used.

 9.3.4 O n any stairway the preferred going o f treads should be
 305 m m b u t n o t less th a n 280 m m a n d the preferred height o f risers
 should be 150 m m b u t n o t m ore th an 190 m m . •

 9.3.5 Stairways should be w ith out winders, should be in flights o f
 n o t m ore th a n 16 o r fewer th an 3 steps, should have n o t m ore th a n
 two successive flights w ith o u t a turn, and, if there are m ore th a n
 12 steps in a flight, should have n o t m ore th an one flight w ith o u t
 a turn. T he going o f the landing between flights should be n o t less
 th a n the w idth o f the section o r channel o f the flight.

  9.3.6 Every person on a stairway should have access to a handrail.
  A ccordingly the m inim um w idth o f a stairway should be 1-1 metres,
  stairways w ider th an 1-8 metres being divided as far as possible
  into channels having a w idth o f between 1 *1 metres a n d 1*8 metres.
  T h e strength o f the handrails (including, supports) used to divide
: a stairway into channels should be as described in p a ra g ra p h 13.

                                                                            13

 the step, o r the surface o f the landing.


 9.3.8 P ro tectio n should be provided on b o th sides o f all stairs
 a n d landings. W h ere next to open wells, or spaces, such protection
 should be enclosed a n d should be n o t less th a n 1-1 metres in height
 m easured vertically from the centre o f the step, or the surface o f

should be so arranged th a t the spectators converge on the stairway
fro m the fro n t a n d /o r the sides only. T h ere should be n o ap p ro ach

 10.1 N ew structures will conform to current Building Regulations
 a n d therefore have a reasonable degree o f structural fire protection.
10.2 Existing structures vary considerably in age and the m aterials
used in construction. T h e qualities of combustibility a n d fire
resistance have an im p o rta n t effect on the stan d ard of fire p re ca u ­
tions required to ensure reasonable safety. I t m ay be difficult
in m any cases to im prove th e fire resistance o f a structure to any
significant extent but this should be d one w herever practicable,
W here it is n o t possible to bring a b o u t such im provem ents, it m ay
be possible to achieve an acceptable solution by the provision
 o f o ther safeguards such as sprinklers a n d /o r autom atic detection.

  in p a ra g ra p h 8.11 this can present a p articular prob lem in stands.
  Every effort should be m ade to reduce this hazard. All p a rts of
  buildings should be inspected before and after every event and
  accum ulations o f com bustible waste cleared as quickly as practicable
  o r stored in a safe place pending clearance.


   10.7 E m e r g e n c y p r o c e d u r e and s t a f f trainin g
   10.7.1 It is essential that plans should be m ade fo r dealing with

 1 2 SPACING OF CRUSH BARRIERS
 12.1 T he location and spacing o f crush barriers will be m ajo r
 factors in the safety o f spectators on a terrace. C o lu m n A in the
 following tables provides the m axim um distances between barriers
 conform ing to the greater strength requirem ents o f crush barriers
 in p ara g ra p h 13. C o lu m n B provides the m axim um distances
  between barriers conform ing to the lesser strength requirements
  o f crush barriers in parag rap h 13. In terp olation m a y be m ade
  between these figures.
  12.2 A distinction is m ade between barrier intervals required in
  (i) ‘pe a k viewing areas’; and
  (ii) ‘o ther viewing areas’.
  The term ‘p eak viewing areas’ describes the m ost p o p u lar parts of
  the terraces w here there is a tendency fo r spectators to crowd
  together and becom e so em otionally involved in the occasion that
   their reactions can cause additional pressures to be set up m those
   sections o f the ground. T h e peak viewing areas are typically behind
   the goal areas, although other parts o f the terraces know n locally
   m ay com e within this category.

     T h e m inim um recom m ended distance from terrace to touchline

     W here the gradient is shallower it m ay be advisable to increase
     this distance so as to enable spectators to obtain a clear view.


     15 ESTIMATION OF SAFE GROUND CAPACITY
     15.1 The foregoing sections o f the code recom m end guidelines for
     individual features o f a ground in isolation. This section suggests
     a m e th o d o f calculating the n u m b e r o f people th a t can be safely
     accom odated w hen taking into account interactions between thesr,
     individual features and when there are deviations from the guidi                                              -
     lines. T o facilitate the calculations, a plan of the gro u n d should                                       ■•
     be available w ith such details as exits, stands, terraces, stairways,
      passages, kiosks, seats and barriers. A scale o f 1:200 w ould be
      convenient for this purpose.

      15.2 T h e m ethod assesses:
      a. the holding capacity of a terrace (that o f a stand being determ ined
           by the n u m b er o f seats when the stand conforms to the guide­
          lines) ; and
       b. the capacity o f a given exit route from a terrace o r stand.




\
15.3 T he n u m b er o f people th a t can be safely accom m odatcd on a
terrace, however, is either its holding capacity o r the capacity of
the exit system fro m it (assessed in accordance w ith p a ra g ra p h 15.5)
whichever is the smaller.

1 5 .4 T e r r a c e s a n d v i e w i n g s l o p e s
15.4.1 T h e capacity o f a terrace o r viewing slope should be assessed
from the area available for stan ding (that area o f the terrace or
viewing slope from which the w hole o f the playing area can be seen,
excluding gangways) by allowing a packing density o f between
54 and 27 persons p e r 10 square metres, depending o n the condition
o f the terrace o r slope. F o r this purpose the extreme allowances
are:
a. 54 persons p e r 10 square metres w hen the terrace o r viewing
   slope is in good condition (as defined in p a ra g ra p h 7); and
b. 27 persons p er 10 square metres w hen it materially deviates from
   the recom m ended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible
   haza rd to individuals closely packed.
I t m ay be necessary to interpolate between these figures where
conditions fall betw een the two extremes.
W h e n the positioning a n d width o f gangways do n o t m eet with the
recom m endations o f p arag ra p h 7.5.1, an ap p ro p ria te reduction
should be m ade in the area available fo r standing.

15.4.2 W hen crush barriers conform to the recom m ended guidelines
on spacing (see p a ra g ra p h 12) the capacity o f the terrace is calculated
by multiplying the area available for standing by the appropriate
packing density. T h e following form ula may be used:
                                                         A
              Capacity (nu m ber o f p e r s o n s ) = — X27 or 54

W here A is the area available for standing in square metres.

15.4.3 W hen the spacing o f crush barriers does n o t conform to the
guidelines, the capacity is calculated from the provision o f crush
barriers in the area available for standing (as defined in pa rag rap h
15.4.1) as follows:
a. W here a terrace contains either ‘peak viewing areas’ (*) only or
   ‘other viewing areas’ (*) only — by multiplying the total length
   o f crush barriers by the appropriate distance between barriers
* See p a ra g ra p h 12.
       (as given in p arag ra p h 12) or the existing distance, whichever is
       less, a n d m ultiplying by the ap p ro p ria te packing density,
     b W here a terrace contains b oth ‘peak viewing areas a n d other
      ’ viewing areas’ — by m ultiplying the total length o f barriers by
        the ap p ro p riate distance between barriers in a ‘peak viewing area
        or the existing distance, whichever is less, an d m ultiplying by the
        a p propriate packing density.
     15 4 4 C rush barriers w hich do n o t meet the guidelines on strength
     set out in p ara g ra p h 13, should be ignored for the purpose o f these
     calculations.

      assessing the adequacy o f exit systems are set out in p a ra g ra p h 6.

      15 5 2 T he capacity o f an exit system can be obtained by assessing
      for each element in the system (ie each gangway, doorw ay, stairway
      etc) the n u m b er o f persons th a t can pass in 8 minutes or, m the
      circumstances indicated in p a ra g ra p h 8.3(b), in 2-5 ^ m u t e s Th ls
      calculation is m ade by multiplying the w idth o f the element by the
      a p propriate flow rate in parag rap h 16.

       15.5.3 W here an elem ent in an exit system is less than 1-1 metres
       wide, th a t element should be om itted from the calculation.

       15 5 4 Flow-restricting elements of the kind described m paragraph
       9.4.5 should be ignored for the purposes o f these calculations
       (see A pp endix B Figure 2).

     18.1 C row d m ovem ent on terraces should be severely limited in
     order to give the police the fullest opportu nity for crowd control.

                                                                           23
Less problem s occur where the terraces are divided as far as possible
into sections by the use o f railings or barriers, b o th radial and
lateral. Ideally, each section should be self-contained and should
be serviced by its ow n entrance/exits, refreshm ent facilities and
toilets, (see para g ra p h 7.6).

18.2 ‘H o m e ’ and visiting supporters should be segregated. It
should n o t be possible for spectators to transfer from one end o f the
ground to the other.

18.3 Access to playing pitches m ust be m ade as difficult as possibly ..   ,
in no rm al circumstances while, a t the same tim e, providing th e -,
police w ith p ro p e r access to the terraces for the purposes o f crowd
control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event o f serious
emergency. One alternative to fencing is the construction a round
 the pitch o f a wall w ith a sm ooth surface which should be n o t less
 th a n 4 feet in height on the terrace side. This b ou n d ary wall should
 have gates or access points to the pitch which could be m anned
 by the police or stewards. A walkway between the bo u n d a ry wall
 an d the terraces, w hich w ould be solely occupied by police, first
 aid a n d official club personnel, has been found to be effective as
 regards safety a n d security. In order to achieve this, it m ight be
  necessary to remove one or two rows o f terracing and to p rotect
  the w alkw ay from the terrace by a continuous line o f barriers, so
  designed as to discourage access to the w alkw ay except a t authorised
  points. T he access points from terrace to w alkw ay should be
   reasonably near the access points from w alkw ay to the pitch, (sec
   p a ra g rap h 7.9). W here a walkway system is in use, sliding gates
   m ay be installed at the access points from th e walkway to the pitch,
   ie where there can be no crowd pressure against them , (see paragraph ,
   6.14.2 regarding use o f sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the J g c .
   pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level o f the playing
  area.

  18.4 C lubs should carefully consider their arrangem ents for the
  sale o f alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be served in
  plastic containers.

   18.5 H o m e clubs should consider, in conjunction w ith the police,
   each o f the matches an d determ ine which should be all-ticket,
   and the allocation o f tickets to the visiting club. So far as the
Icrraccs arc concerned, any allocation should have regard to the
m a n n e r in which the tcrraccs are divided so th a t policing arrange­
m ents can be effective.

18.6 T he hom e club should, as a general rule, m ake it tlicir policy
n o t to issue tickets for anno unced all-ticket m atches to away
supporters on the day o f the game. How ever, the local police
will be best able to assess the situation and their advice should be
followed, b u t it is im p o rta n t w herever possible to discourage
supporters from travelling to all-ticket matches w ith o u t tickets.

TEST ING OF CRU SH BARRIERS A N D H ANDRAILS
1. F o r crush barriers the test is to consist o f the application o f an
   evenly distributed force o f either 6-0 K N /m e tre w idth (400 lbs
   f/foot w idth) o r 4-3 K N /m etre w idth (290 lbs f/foot w idth) of
   barrier as m entioned in p a ra g rap h 13.


2. F o r handrails the test is to consist o f the ap plication o f an evenly
   distributed force o f either 4-3 K N /m etre w idth (290 lbs f/foot
   width) or 2-74 K N /m e tre w idth (188 lbs f/foot width) o f handrail
   as m entioned in p arag rap h 13.


3. T he force is to be in the form o f a static load acting on the top
   rail o f the barrier or handrail a t right angles to the longitudinal
   axis an d applied in a b o u t ten equal increments.


4. T he force to be applied for three consecutive periods, the full
   force being m aintained for 5 minutes each period. T he interval
   between applications to be as short as possible, ie to enable
   complete unloading an d reloading only. A record should be
   kept o f any deform ation during the loading periods, during the
   periods o f m aintained loading, or during the recovery period.


5. I f on the rem oval o f the force for the third time the recovery o f
   deform ation is a t least 75 % the barrier or handrail m ay be deemed
   to have satisfied the loading requirements.
  I f this requirem ent is not met b u t the recovery is m ore th a n 50%
  then the test should be repeated and if on retest the recovery is
  a t least 75% the barrier or handrail m ay be deemed to have
  satisfied the loading requirements.
  I f the recovery is less than 50% on the first test or less th a n 75%
  on the retest, the barrier or handrail shall be deemed to have
  failed to meet the loading requirements.


                                                                        29
6. I f during any test, even tho ugh the barrier or handrail satisfies
   the above loading requirem ents, d o u b t should arise for any
   reason (including such m atters as cracking o f the terracing or
   d istortion o f connections) as to the safety o f the barrier or
   h an d rail, a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless
    the results o f this investigation remove the d o u b t as to the safety
    o f the barrier or ha n d rail, the barrier or handrail, as the case
    m ay be, should be deem ed to have failed the test.

7. A record should b e kep t o f all the barriers a n d h andrails tested
   a n d o f their perform ances during the tests.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1 9 7 5

Background

Wheatley Report

1.   The terms of the Inquiry extended to sports grounds generally but because the
immediate concern at the time related to soccer grounds, its Report concentrated
on crowd safety in such grounds, and included Rugby Union and Rugby League grounds.
Lord Wheatley had no doubt, that the then existing controls over safety at
football grounds were inadequate.      He found that the voluntary system of certifi­
cation of grounds introduced by the Football Association some years previously laid
down no requirements as to the competence of persons who carried out the annual
inspections of grounds and there were no guidelines to assist those persons in
their assessment of safety standards.     Moreover, a review of the statutory provisions
relevant to the safety of spectators at football grounds convinced Lord Wheatley
that the law also fell short of providing proper and effective control over
football grounds as a whole.     The building regulations, for example, provide for
the basic structural safety of new buildings within a football ground but they do
                                                                 not apply to existing
buildings, except where alterations are to be carried out, nor do they apply to a
ground as a whole.    In any case, most football grounds were built before national
building regulations were introduced.


2.   Lord Wheatley concluded that only a specially devised statutory scheme could
ensure comprehensive controls at football grounds in the interests of safety and he
recommended a statutory licensing system.      He proposed that these controls should
be introduced by stages, the larger or more important grounds, broadly speaking,
being dealt with first.     Lord Wheatley also recommended that there should be a
right of appeal for the clubs concerned against any decision of the licensing
authority.   The Report showed Lord Wheatley's awareness of the need to reconcile
the paramount aim of ensuring the safety of spectators with what would be reasonable
and practicable for the clubs.


3.    Lord Wheatley also provided, as a technical appendix to his report, guidelines
to safety standards at football grounds designed to assist the local authorities
in their task of enforcement.
C o n s u lta tio n s   on t h e   R eport

4.      When the Report was published, those bodies mainly concerned, including the
local authority associations and the football authorities, were consulted about
Lord Wheatley's proposals.                   The football authorities made it clear that they were
apprehensive at the financial implications for the clubs, but there was general
agreement with the proposals themselves.                   Detailed consultations were held on the
guidelines contained in the technical appendix to the Report and these, duly
amended, were finally published by the Home Departments in November 1973 as a
special booklet, "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds".                   It was revised in 1975
in the light of practical experience of its application and specifically targeted
on football grounds*


Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)

5.      The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds has no statutory force.                Its primary
purpose is to set out principles or guidelines which the local authorities will
no doubt wish to keep in mind in enforcing the Act.                   The Guide therefore deals
with matters such as the provision of adequate entrances and exits, means of
escape, the slope of terracing, the strength and siting of crush barriers, the
construction of staircases, and measures to ensure the safe movement of spectators
both under normal and emergency conditions.                   The Guide is not a set of requirements
to be rigidly applied, regardless of individual circumstances.                   As Lord Wheatley
recognised, it is important to maintain the maximum flexibility in any system of
control so as to take account of the differing circumstances at individual grounds:
factors such as age, size and mode of construction differ widely from ground to
ground.


6.      While the basic principles set out in the Guide are relevant to all sports
stadia, modifications may well be necessary where sports other than football are
involved.


General Approach to the Act

7.      The main instrument of control under the Act is the safety certificate issued by
the local authority.               A safety certificate is needed in respect of every stadium
which is the subject of a designation order, made by the Secretary of State.                     The
certificate enables the local authority to impose such terms and conditions as
are necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the stadium in question.
8.    The approach to designation was based on a phased programme so that the more
important grounds regularly attracting the largest attendances were dealt with
first.     The international stadia at which soccer and Rugby Union were played plus
stadia used by soccer clubs in Division 1 of the Football League were designated
in 1976.     This was followed in 1979 by designation of stadia of clubs in
Division 2 of the League and thereafter on promotion of a club to Division 2.
Following the    fire   at Bradford City FC in May 1985 all the remaining stadia
liable to designation used by clubs in Divisions 3 and 4 of the Football League,
and qualifying stadia of clubs in Division 1 and 2 of the Rugby League were
designated.


Substance of the Act

9.    The first 5 sections establish the main system of control under the Act, that
is to say, the safety certificate, issued by the local authority for the area in
which the stadium is situated, which is required for every sports stadium desig­
nated for that purpose by order of the Secretary of State.


10.   Section 1 empowers the Secretary of State by order to designate any sports
stadium having accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators as requiring a
safety certificate.     Safety certificates are of two kinds, general and special.
A general safety certificate is the main continuing form of control and is issued
for an indefinite period in respect of a specified activity or activities
regularly taking place at the stadium.     A special safety certificate may be issued
at the discretion of the local authority for a special event or other circumstances
not covered by the general safety certificate.     Such an event might be an evangel­
istic rally which might call for special arrangements if, for example, seating were
provided for the congregation on the playing area.     A special safety certificate
can be issued only in respect of a sports stadium for which a general safety
certificate is already in force.


11.   The contents of safety certificates are dealt with in section 2 .   The local
authority is empowered to include in the certificate such terms and conditions as
are necessary to secure, at the stadium in question, a reasonable degree of safety.
Without prejudice to this general power, the section requires certificates to contain
terms and conditions relating to major matters such as entrances and exits, means of
escape in emergency, the number, strength and situation of crush barriers, and the
maximum number of spectators who may be admitted to the stadium or any part of it.
To remove any possibility of doubt, sub-section (3) makes it clear that a certificate
may include a condition relating to the keeping of records relating to attendance and
the maintenance of safety.
12.   An earlier Bill, introduced in 1973, limited the terms and conditions
imposed under a safety certificate to what was necessary to secure a reasonable
degree for'taembers of the public." There was some difficulty over this term
because it might have excluded, for example, members of supporters' clubs.        This
particular problem was by the definition of "spectator" in section 17, that is,
any person occupying accommodation provided for spectators.     On the other hand,
it seemed    right that all the peole present on the occasion of a match or other
activity for which a ground has a certificate should be taken into account for the
purpose of the safety certificate, for example, people using a squash court or
other facilities at the ground.     Accordingly, the general power of the local
authority under section 2(1) to include in a safety certificate such terms or
conditions as are necessary omits any reference to people and speaks only of
securing "reasonable safety at the stadium", (although the terms "safety", as
defined in section 17, does not include danger arising from participation in a
sport).     Certain provisions must, however, be specifically linked with spectators
(who are, after all, the people the Act is mainly designed to protect and who will
be greatly in the majority).     Thus section 2(2) requires the certificate to state
the maximum number of spectators who may be admitted.




13*   Section 3 sets out the broad procedure to be followed when a local authority
receives an application for a safety certificate.     It requires them to determine
whether an applicant is, in their opinion, a qualified person, ie a person likely
to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions imposed
in the certificate.     If so, they are then under a duty to issue a general safety
certificate to him.     In this respect, the general safety certificate is different
from the fire certificate issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971:     the latter
is issued only after necessary safety works have been completed, whilst the
safety certificate under this Act can be issued almost from the outset, and is an
instrument of continuing control.    The issue of a special safety certificate,
however, is left to the discretion of the local authority, as already explained,
because only.they can judge whether it is appropriate to issue it for the special
occasion in question.


14.   In Metropolitan Counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
authority is required to send a copy of any application for a certificate to the
police and the Fire Authority, and must consult them about the terms and conditions
to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere a copy must be sent to, and
consultation take place with, the police and the Building Authority.     The need
for such consultation is self-evident:    there must be close co-ordination of the
interests of the different authorities directly concerned with different aspects
of safety at football grounds.


15.   Section 4 provides for the amendment, replacement, transfer, surrender and
cancellation of safety certificates.     It is of primary importance that a local
authority should have power to amend a safety certificate where it appears
appropriate for them to do so, for example, if they find in the course of a
routine inspection that a part of a ground has become so dangerous as to demand an
immediate restriction on its use or some other necessary safeguard.     Again, they
must have power to relax a requirement where, for example, certain improvements
have been carried out to make this possible.


16.   Section 5 provides for appeals by interested parties against decisions or
requirements of the local authority in connection with safety certificates.        Appeals
lie to the Secretary of State, who has power to set up a formal inquiry.


17.   Section 6(2) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to
the safety of spectators at sports grounds.     This is in the nature of a reserve
power which could be used, for example, to give backing to requirements of the
local authorities which in the light of experience had been shown to be essential.
This section also empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations for various
other purposes connected with the Act.     To date no regulations have been made
under this sub-section.


18.   Section 7 provides for some supplementary matters on determinations and
appeals. Sub-sections (1) and (2) provide for the deemed withdrawal of an applica­
tion for, or the surrender of, a safety certificate when a local authority
determines that a person is not, or has ceased to be, qualified to hold it.        The
section also provides for the suspension of a condition in a certificate pending
determination of an appeal against the inclusion of that condition, although a
court, on the application of the local authority, may order that such a condition
remain in force pending the determination of the appeal.
19-   The holder of a general safety certificate is required by section 8 to
notify the local authority of any proposed alteration or extension of a stadium.
The purpose of the clause is to guard against any alterations being made, without
the local authority’s knowledge, which might affect the safety of spectators.


20.   Section 9 provides for the harmonisation of the Act with other legislation
which may affect sports stadia.


21.   Section 10 is an important power which authorities should not feel inhibited
from using where the danger to spectators are such that use of the ground, or part
of it, should be prohibited or restricted.   Should a magistrates’ court, on the
application of a local authority, consider that the risk to spectators at any
sports ground is so great that their admission should be prohibited or restricted
until remedial action has been taken, the court may make an order accordingly.
This power applies to any sports stadium or ground, whether or not it is designated
as requiring a safety certificate. Where a general or special safety certificate
is in force, local authorities may prefer to remedy an unsatisfactory situation
by amending the certificate, in cases where there is sufficient time to do so.
In respect of sports grounds and the smaller stadia, consultations between the
local authority and the club would usually be expected to secure, on a voluntary
basis, a reasonable standard of safety; however, where management appears to be
unwilling to undertake the necessary measures or is slow to act on advice, this
additional power can be used.


22.   Section 11 confers rights of entry and inspection on persons appointed by the
local authority and others involved in the task of ensuring crowd safety at sports
grounds.   Section 12 deals with offences and penalties.


23-   Section 13 deals mainly with civil liability.   Its purpose is to make clear
that while nothing in the Act itself confers a right of action in respect of a
contravention of regulations or of conditions in a safety certificate, the existing
rights of a spectator injured at a football stadium to bring an action for negli­
gence against the occupiers is entirely unaffected by anything in the Act.


24.   The Secretary of State is empowered by section 15 to extend to classes of
sports grounds other than sports stadia such provisions of the Act as are not
already expressed to apply to them.   For example, it enables the Secretary of
State by order to extend the safety certificate procedure to such places as
race-courses. Only a class of sports ground may be the subject of an extension
order under this clause:   an individual sports ground (other than a stadium)
cannot be designated until section 1 of the Act has been applied by an order
under section 15 to the class of sports ground to whichit belongs. To date,
the powers under this section have not been used.


25.   Section 16 applies the Act, subject to necessary modifications, to the
Crown.   Section 17 deals with interpretation.


26.   Section 18 provides that orders and regulations,except commencement orders,
made under the Act are subject to the negative resolution procedure.    It also
imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, before making any orders or regulations,
except commencement orders or orders relating to the Isles of Scilly, to consult
with such persons as appear to him requisite.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1 9 7 5

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES

1.     The Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 provide that any application
for   a safety certificate shall be made in the form contained in the Schedule to
the Regulations or a form to the like effect.    An application should be accompanied
by detailed information as to the structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, includ­
ing plans of the stadium, certificates relating to the testing of crush barriers
and evidence of the applicant's status.     It is, however, open to a local authority,
under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice in writing, such further
information of this kind as it may consider necessary to enable it to determine
theterms and conditions to be included in the certificate.


2.     On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local
authority must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a
person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and con­
ditions to be imposed in the certificate.     If it considers him to be such a person
the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.
In the case of a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not
paramount, the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.
In any event, it seems prima facie unlikely that an application for a general
safety certificate would be made by an unqualified person.     There is, however, a
right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is
not a qualified person (see paragraph 10).


3.    In Metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) the local
authority is required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of any appli­
 cation for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chief
 Officer of Police and the fire authority, and must consult them about the terms
 and conditions to be included in the certificate.    Elsewhere in England and Wales
 the local authority must send a copy to and consult with the Chief Officer of
 Police and the building authority.    In framing such conditions, local authorities
 will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines set out in the
 Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.    In this connection local authorities are
 reminded that, this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be
 rigidly applied regardless of individual circumstances.    The maximum flexibility
 should be maintained to take account of the different circumstances of individual
 grounds deriving from differences in such matters as age, size and mode of con­
 struction.   In this regard, it should also be noted that the Act provides that the
terms and conditions should be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reason­
able safety" and it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek
the absolute safety of everyone attending the sports stadium.


4.   It is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the
local authority and the stadium representatives in the process of drawing up the
certificate conditions.     In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is
rarely filled to capacity, the local authority may consider it proper to base its
requirements on actual levels of attendance over a given period rather than on
maximum capacity.     On the rare occasions on which a capacity crowd could be
expected, separate provision might be made for this contingency on the lines
indicated in paragraph 7 below.     Again, if a stand were found to be structurally
weak, the local authority might, in consultation with the stadium representatives,
offer the choice of having any necessary remedial works carried out or of restrict­
ing admission to the stand until it had been strengthened.


5.   As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content of a
safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the indivi­
dual case.     Accordingly, a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate.
It must however contain full details of the terms and conditions imposed including,
in particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and have annexed
to it a plan of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be
framed.    The certificate when first issued may contain restrictive conditions which
can then be relaxed or deleted by amendment of the certificate.     The local
authority may find it convenient to list, in a covering letter to the certificate,
such modifications as will be subsequently permitted, eg in the form of a state­
ment of the increased spectator capacities' to be allowed for the separate sections
of the ground when the various stages of any future .works programme
agreed with the stadium authorities are' completed. This arrangement, by
excluding from the certificate itself proposed conditions which vrould
apply only to future works, should serve to obviate confusion.    At the same time,
however, care must be taken not to exclude from the certificate any restriction
germane to current conditions, since section 5(3) of the Act provides for an
interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State against the inclusion of
anything   in, or the omission of anything from, a safety certificate, and these
rights must not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of the form of the
certificate.
6.   As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the
Act provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different
activities.    Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a foot­
ball ground, in cases where it is also used from time to time to stage other
events it would be desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special
safety certificates, if the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were
to be included in the general certificate.     It is suggested that any such events
for which it is considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided into
2 classes


     1.     those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
     stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;


     2.     those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
     concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being given
     over to    spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and conditions
     will have to be devised.    It is not, of course, necessary to provide for
     these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen by the stadium
     authorities.


7.   There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable
to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a
special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected vo attract signi­
ficantly more than the usual attendance.     In the case especially of cup re plays
these special events may arise with only a few days' notice, within which it would
not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to
the grant of a special safety certificate.     In order to overcome this difficulty,
it would seem desirable for the local authorities and stadium authorities to seek
to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions which
might be appropriate to such occasions, eg the admission of increased numbers to
certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed, that
notice is given to the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their
incorporation in the general safety certificate.


8.   Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determina­
tion of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend­
ment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of
the certificate or of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the Act) and will
presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the
original certificate.    It will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities
and clubs/stadium authorities for a close liaison to be maintained after the
issue of the certificate and certainly while any further works of safety measures
are being carried out.   It is likely to be in the stadium operators' financial
interest to get the safety certificate amended as soon as possible after work
has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure that the local authority
is kept informed of progress.   For   its part the local authority will no doubt
wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion of the
work, the certificate can be amended without delay.


9.    After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the
transfer of the certificate to another person.   Similarly, while a local
authority is considering an application for a certificate and before the certifi­
cate has been granted, it may be asked to substitute some person other than the
original applicant as the person to whom the certificate should be granted.      These
are, however, likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certifi­
cates, where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club or a stadium
organisation by an authorised official of the club or representative of the
organisation.   However, if it does happen, the local authority will be required in
both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified person.
Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the regulations to
giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply together with
any necessary appeals procedure.   In the second case, there is no reason why the
local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new applica­
tion in the terms of the original one and process it from the point it had already
reached.


10.   In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety
certificate against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see
paragraph 2 above), which, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed
transfer of a certificate, the Act provides a further right of- appeal to any
"interested party" (which term includes the holder of the safety certificate)
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.      The
regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of
any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following receipt of a notice of
the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified,
the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating
in the locality.
11.    In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or,
amending a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain
specified "interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press.
It is regretted that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of
advertising, but, since Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition
which it provides of "interested party", no other means could be found of ensuring
that all persons who might validly claim to be "interested parties" within the
meaning of the Act should be able to acquaint themselves with the local authority's
decision, and failure to bring the decision to their notice could result in a
denial of their rights of appeal or of a hearing by the Secretary of State.     For
the same reason a similar obligation has been imposed on an appellant (by
Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing to
appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under Section 5(4) of
the Act is required to give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.


12.    Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
appeal.    It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with Regulation
8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether it
wishes to oppose the appeal.    With any such notice, the local authority is
required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state
whether it wishes a hearing under Section 5     of the Act.   (The procedure govern­
ing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in Regulation 10.)


13.    It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to
order a public inquiry under Section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in Regulation 12.

 14.   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
practice of copying to the Home Office newly issued or amended safety certificates.
                                                                           ANNEX D




SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1 9 7 5

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall
be made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the
like effect.     Part II of the form and its frontispiece should be completed in the
case of applications for special safety certificates.     In any case where an
application for a special safety certificate is not made by the holder of the
general safety certificate, it should be accompanied by evidence of the appli­
cant's status.     Details of any planned changes to the normal standing and seating
arrangements for spectators should be provided, together with such further
information in support of the application as is considered necessary to enable
the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act.     However, it is
open to a local authority, under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice
in writing, any further information of this kind which they may think it
necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions to be
included in the special safety certificate.


2.    A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates
is that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant is a quali­
fied person, the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory,
whereas the issue of a special safety certificate remains at its discretion.
But an applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against a
refusal (see following paragraphs for details).


3.    An application for a special safety certificate should normally be made at
least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied
that the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
 Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser period,
 eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person.    On receipt of an
 application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
 determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be
 in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed
 in the certificate.    The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make
 this determination within 14 days of receiving the application.    There is a
 right of appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant
 is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9), and, under regulation 5, the
 applicant must be furnished with the reasons for such a determination.
1).   It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused
on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person.     This
decision must, in accordance with regulation 6, be made within 28 days of the
receipt of the application, not only in cases where the local authority has
determined that the applicant is a qualified person but also in those where
it has determined that he is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to
be considered.    There is also a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds
other than a determination that the applicant is not a qualified person (see
paragraph 9).    In the event of such a refusal, therefore, the local authority is
again required, under regulation 6, to give the applicant the reasons for its
decision.


5.    When the first 2 stages have been completed, should it have been decided
that a special safety certificate should be issued, the local authority in
metropolitan counties and Greater London (from 1 April 1986) is required, by
section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the Chief Officer
of jPolice and to the fire authority and to consult them about the terms and
conditions to be included in the certificate.     Elsewhere in England and Wales
the local authority must send a copy to, and consult with, the Chief Officer of
Police and the building authority.    The special safety certificate must, in
accordance with regulation 6(2), then be issued not less than 28 days before
the   proposed event is due to take place.


6.    The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary
according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
certificate would not be appropriate.    (In suitable cases, however, regard may
be had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(Football) on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 of the paper relating to the
"Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates".)     Any
special safety certificate must, however, contain full details of the terms
and conditions imposed, including in particular the matters referred to in
section 2(2) of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where
appropriate by reference to the plan attached to the general safety cartificate.


7.    Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the deter­
mination of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only    by formal
amendment of the certificate.    This may be on the application of the holder of
the certificate or at the discretion of the local authority (see section 4(2)
of the Act).    This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
certificate, otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has
been issued well in advance of the event to which it relates.     Any such amend­
ment must, however, be publicised as in paragraph 10 below.


8.    Considerations of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate
to another person an equally unlikely contingency.     Any possible difficulties
in this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the
general safety certificate applies for the special certificate.     Nevertheless,
should an application for transfer be made, the local authority must decide
within 14 days if the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it
decides to the contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating
to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will
the appropriate appeals procedure, should the need arise.     In the case of an
application for transfer before a special safety certificate has actually been
issued, there is no reason why the local authority should not treat the applica­
tion in all respects as a new application in the terms of the original and pro­
cess it from the point already reached.


9.    Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a deter­
mination that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3) and against
the refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4).     In addition the
Act provides (in section 5(3))a right of appeal to any "interested party"
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.
The regulations provide that, in the case of a special safety certificate, notice
of any such appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice
of the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not
notified, the publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper
circulating in the locality.


10.   As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so
to amend it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also
to advertise its action in the press.     A similar obligation falls on ain appellant
(under regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wish­
ing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section
5(4) of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement.
(The reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the
paper relating to the 'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety
Certificates'.)
11.   Any appellant is required (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the
appeal.   It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation
8(9), to inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it
wishes to oppose the appeal.   With any such notice, the local authority is
required to submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to
state whether it wishes a hearing under section 5(4) of the Act.   (The pro­
cedure governing the conduct of all such hearings is set out in regulation 10.)


12.   It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary,
to order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any
appeal.   In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in
regulation 12.


13-   It would be helpful if local authorities could continue the existing
practice of copying to the Home Office any special safety certificates issued.

Dear Sir
SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION

1    The purpose of this letter is to inform you of the effects on the Safety of         _
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA) of Local Government reorganisation in the Metropolitan
counties and Greater London brought about by the Local Government Act 1985.

2.   With effect from 1 April 1986 responsibility for administering the SSGA 1975 will,
in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London, transfer to the appropriate
Metropolitan District Council (MDC) or London Borough (the "successor" authorities).
They will be responsible for, among other things, the issue of and amendments to safety
certificates   A consequential effect of Local Government reorganisation is that the
current certificating authorities in the Metropolitan counties and Greater London are
not in the meantime empowered to issue or amend safety certificates for any period
commencing on or after 1 April 1986. Such certificates or amendments will fall to be
issued by the successor authorities. It is therefore in the interests of applicants
in these areas to ensure that applications for special safety certificates, or amendment,
to existing certificates, which are to come into effect on or after 1 April 1986 are
copied to the appropriate successor authority who should be kept informed of development;
and progress so as to be in a position to assume responsibility for the case in question
with the minimum of delay and inconvenience.
                                                                  Yours faithfully

The abolition of          tropolitan Count"/ ;•nd Greater London Councils on
31st March, 1936, has necessitated some changes to the Safety of Sports
O^cundr: Act 1975 (S:3GA); these have been achieved by means of the Local
Government Act 1935 (LGA).

b’ron 1st April, 1         the role and status of the Fire Authority in South
Yor*!:r-htre under i:^o .'?SGA vill be changed, as the Fire Authority will no
longer be      the Local Authority.   It is therefore   necessaryto jive the Fire
Authority      the status of an "interested party", and thus require the Local
Authorities (District Councils) to .consult on matters involving the Act.
The Fire Authority v M l also be able tc authorise entry and inspection of
a sports ground in its own right.

It will be important to establish and maintain good liaison between Divisions
and vhichevnr deoartnent is made responsible for the Act in each of the
Local Authorities (District Councils).

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

As you probably know the City Council will take over responsibility as the
Licensing Authority under the above Act from the South Yorkshire County
Council on 1st April, 1986.

I think it would be of considerable assistance to both the Council and
"chlr Authorities for an informal me«ing to be held to discuss both the
existing and future arrangements for administering the 1975 Act. To this
end I have arranged for a room to be made available in the Town Hall on
Thursday, 13th March, 1986, at 9.30 a.m..

Please contact my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, as soon as possible
with a view to indicating who will be present at the meeting on your
behalf. I have also invited representatives to attend from the South
Yorkshire Police, the Health and Safety Executive and the Council s
Department of Land and Planning (Building Surveyor’s Division).

 Please bear in mind this meeting will be informal in nature and any
 constructive comments which you wish to make will be welcome.

 Yours faithfully,


                                                                                                                        "X>C> 5

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975

I enclose for your information a copy of my Report to the General Purposes Panel
on 6th May, 1986, together with a copy of the Panel's Resolution in relation to
that Report.
I would like to make the following comments in relation to the decision:-

(a)       Although it has been decided to carry on with the old administrative system
          organised by the County Council I wish to make it clear that the system is
          under review and may be adjusted in the future;

(b)       I will shortly write to the other District Councils in South Yorkshire with
          a view to establishing a basis for consultation as described in the
          Resolution;

(c)       the re-drafting of the Certificate conditions will shortly be completed and
          I will then be asking for your comments on them.

 If you have any questions to ask on this matter, please do not hesitate to
 contact Mr. Bownes on the number given below.

 Yours faithfully,

         Owlerton Sports Stadium
         It is understood that the Home Secretary . 1 1 1 shortly be designating the Sta.i

          as requiring a Safety Certificate in accordance „ith the Popple.ell Report

                  ,            v i l l , therefore, be necessary to arrange for a full

                            c           in the next few weeks to find out what works are
          inspection of the Stadium m the next
  2.
  going to be required to raise the standard of the Stadium to appropriate levels.

  The Panel is probably aware that the Stadium is Council owned but is currently

  leased to the Owlerton Sports Stadium Limited.       This Lease will expire on 1st

  November, 1987.

  Safety Certificate Standard Conditions

  At the moment the Safety Conditions attached to Safety Certificates are

  standardised throughout South Yorkshire and both the Police and the Fire Service

  have -indicated that they would wish this situation to continue for reasons of

   administrative simplicity.      The Conditions do, however, give some cause for

■^concern, as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.        The

' drafting o£ these Conditions is of particular importance as it is a serious

   criminal offence to contravene any of them punishable by the Statutory Maximum

   Fine (Currently £2,000) or 2 years imprisonment or both.


   It is proposed to re-draft the Certificate conditions, where appropriate, and to

       submit them to the Panel for approval.   The Sheffield Wednesday Certificate

 ' would then be replaced in accordance with Section 4 (1) (b) of the Act.       The

       Sheffield United Certificate could then be issued with the new conditions before

       the start of the 1986/8?' season.   The re-drafted conditions would, of course, be

^submitted to the Fire Service, the Police and Building Surveyor for comment;

       other authoritiesin South Yorkshire could also be involved in this process.

       Existing Administrative Arrangements

       The County Council system for administering the Act is based on 2 main

       components - (a) bi-annual inspections of the Stadium; and (b) meetings of an

        officer working party.   The bi-annual inspections consist of representatives

        from all the interested authorities and involve thorough inspections of the

        Stadia and the identifying of any defects.   These defects are at the time of the

   ■ visit brought to the attention of the certificate holder and its technical

        representative if one is present.    Depending on the nature of the faults found

       ’ (if any) steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Certificate Holder
3.

to rectify th.m or so arrange -attars that no risk to the public occurs.          The

Working Party consists of representatives from the Police, Fire Service,

Building Surveyors and the County Council r it considers in detail various

 matters (such as the Spion Kop development at Sheffield Wednesday Football

 Ground) and also any outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.        The

 Working Party Is effectively a coordinating body which attempts to ensure that

 a balanced and consistent approach is ^intained to current issues at the Sports

 Grounds.        Any recommendations it makes are subject to approval by this Panel.

 The Health and Safety Executive

 Recommendation 9 of The Popplewell Committee's Interim Report read as follows

 "There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety Executive and

 the Fire Authorities and Local Authorities as to how best to co-ordinate and

 communicate their inspections and reports".        Bearing this in mind the local

  office of the Health and Safety Executive was invited to participate in the

     administrative system for safety at sports grounds.    This invitation was

     declined.    The Executive will apparently take no direct part in the

     Certification system.

     In view of this problem the Home Office was contacted and the position

> explained; it appears that negotiations are under way between the Ho*e Office

     and the HSE about Popplewell's recommendation but as yet there has been no

     useful outcome.
     In these circumstances the Council could keep the Health and Safety Executive

     informed of all developments in Sheffield and to invite their comments on them.

      It would then be the responsibility of the Executive to decide whether or not to

      respond.

      Fees
      The basis on which fees may be charged is set out in Regulation 14 of the Safety

      of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 which states "H.      A local authority may

      determine the fees to be charged in respect of applications for the issue or
amendment of safety certificates but such fees shall not in a particular case

exceed an amount commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done."              The

    South Yorkshire County Council did .not fix any fees under the Regulation

    apparently as a matter of policy and the Panel is therefore asked to decide

    which of the following options to adopt:- (a) state as a matter of .policy that

    no fees will be:charged in respect of Safety of Sports Grounds legislation or

    (b) decide in principle to fix fees and to ask for a report back on the costs

    to th*e Council.

^ Conclusion

    The Panel is asked to:-
    (a)     Note the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

            County Council and authorise its continuation for the time being;

     (b)    Dote the position of the Health and Safety Executive and request the Bead

            of   Administration   and Legal Department to keep the Executive informed of

            all matters relating to sports ground safety;

     (c)    Request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to draft new

            safety certificate conditions in consultation with the appropriate

             authorities approval by the Council;

I     (d)    Either resolve that no fees will be charged under the legislation or

             request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to report on the

             Council's costs in this respect.

 Meeting held at Division Street Conference Room, 10.March 1987.
 Present:-      D Bownes (Lie), Mr Moor (Enviro Health), Messr's Bulter and Swain (Bldg
                Surveyors), Messr's Hildreth, Grimshaw, Binnington, Waterhouse, Woodhouse
                and Miles (SYCFS).
 Contents of letter dated 18.2.87 (SYCFS - D Bownes) were discussed and agreed that
 these matters be taken up with the Club. With regard to the timber buildings
 beneath stands, it was agreed that the Club be requested to remove or resite these
 structures.
  With respect, to locked doors under the South Stand, i t _was agreed that this matt?'.*
'..wouxd'ba dealt with under FP Act 1971. ' Fastenings tersliding gates'werer else ■•
  discussed and a copy of a sketch’showing a single hook arrangement for securing
  such doors was circulated. It was agreed that D Bownes would put this solution to •
  the Club for their comments.
”Stewarding and securing of all gates was discussed and the Fire Sarvics iri.cic2.tEC1
 that existing arrangements were only acceptable subject to exits being stewarded
 and unlocked during 100% of the time that the ground was in use for a designated
 purpose. Any relaxation of this would mean an insistance that panic fastenings
 only be provided.
 Discussion then took place on areas of responsibility and ground inspections.
 On areas of responsibility D Bownes" did not want to be tied down to individual
 references and even indicated that his Department could not act independantly but
 must refer all matters to the Council Committee responsible for SASG Act. Whilst
 all others present would prefer definitive areas of responsibility (allowing th-
 there must be some overlap) , David Bownes preferred to refer back to a future
 meeting following further consideration of the matter.
 On ground inspections, D Bownes referred to the recent Lords decision that grounds
 should be inspected annually, he anticipated that this would mean a much more
 thorough examination than the present system of bi-annual inspections, and that this’
 would be backed up by inspections during games.
 This was agreed by all present, but reservations about the suggestion that during
 game inspections be carried out by the whole working party were expressed by the
 Fire Service. It was agreed however that one such 'during game' inspection would be
 set up and the outcome monitored.

    Dear Sir,

' Sarety cf        Ground?., Act- 1975.-         • " • ' "       ‘
- Future Administration of the-Council ’s Certificating Function

    Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
    the above subject.
    Many points were raised at the meeting but I think that the general feeling was
    that the roles of each Authority involved in the system should be defined
    perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

  I have no objection in principal to roles being defined in this way but I should
           clear that if it is agreed that particular Authorities adopt particular
 • l e s then they will be under a duty to consult with other interested parties
   Here there is an overlap of interest. As I see it the Authority which carries
   mt a particular role will have the responsibility of advising the Council as.
Certificating Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role-.

    I have drawn up a draft Schedule which attempts to define Lead Authority roles.
    I should point out that the draft is intended to be open for discussion and I
    would therefore welcome your comments on it. Would you please also let me know
    if there are any other matters which should be included in the Schedule.

    Moving onto the question of inspections of stadia, this point was also discussed
    at the meeting on 10th March. My view is that the existing system of bi annual
    limited inspections is no longer appropriate; I feel that one major    inspection
    ner year should be carried out on each stadium which should include    allthe
    areas and installations within the scope of the legislation. To back up this
    inspection there should be a number of "during performance inspections by
    Officers   I think that there is general agreement in relation to during
    performance” inspections as they would highlight the performance of    thesafety
    system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.
                                                               Cocit *••

                                                                                                                        734690 - Mr. Bownes
                                   For te le p h o n e e n q u irie s o n th is m a tte r p le a s e r i n g ..............................................(STD C o d e 0Z4-2)
                                                                           T elex 5 4 2 4 3 (A d m inistration & Legal)
  Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
  Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
  co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
  first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it mijjht be
  appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
  all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
  encountered.

   Moving on to the "working party" structure I think it is clear from the meeting
   of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required. It is
   reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the working party as
   such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
   powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
   remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
   Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
^nyself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
^ l s a forum for discussion.

^1 take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
 a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
 to be submitted to the Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
 Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
 my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
 meeting "to take place. “Ah -agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the .
 meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will "prepare a list
 showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
 Authority. This list will be circulated as well.

 Would you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
 on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
 General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

  Yours faithfully,

                          Suggest include those items plus additional ones
                          as allocated.
                          Also Environmental Health responsibilities are
                          in some cases more directed to the Fire Authority,

                          matters not covered by other Authorities.

                          Agree, should be one full inspection per year.

                          Each Authority to sort out its inspection pro­

                          (At Divisional level programme to inspect so
                          as to verify position during large and small
                          crowd capacities, day and night matches etc.).

                          More emphasis on completion of works to be carried
                          and make the club more responsible.

                          The new code is very specific in management respon­
                          sibilities, use it.

                          No objection to a preliminary joint inspection.

                           taken, to automatically include outstanding items
                           so that a self monitoring programme is introduced
                           and we don't have to keep referring back through

 For the attention of ”r. D. Bp-./r.es


 Dear Sirs,

                      ter dated 1'ith May, 1987 regarding the "Future Administration
 In reply to your 2.3-‘
 of the Council’c Certif
 1975, please find belcw

 1.    With respect to the
       between authorities
       the document issued
       County Council, a copy of which is attached. As this document has steed the
       test of tine with few problems, it is recc-amended that a meeting of all author­
       ities concerned be C a l l e d as see:: as possible in order to discuss the division
       of responsibilities it lays down.

 I     Whatever the- outcome one area i/hero there r.ay be a need for emphasis is a
       reference to tha fact that all authorities should be aore aware of other author­
       ities responsibilities and that when considering any proposals all aspects
       of the green guide should to taken into account in order that full consul­
       tation can take place with other interacted authorities.

 2.    The pcoonsrJ. for one annual inspection by the working group in conjunction
       with"individual inspections by authorities as and when considered necessary
       is agreed wit:: although it is envisaged that because of manpower resource
       limitations the decree of central co-ordination referred to may cause problems.

       The Fire Av.'-hcrifr/ would wish to carry out such inspections subject to the
       limitations referred to above and under varying conditions at the ground.
       Obviously any adverse comments on crowd safety would be forwarded- to your
       Department.   Ac to the annual inspection, a good time would be at the end
       or towards the end of a season in order that any necessary work can be followed
       up befort the conmcncamcnfc cf a new season.

  3.   Whilst the situation regarding the status of working group is fully appreciated,
       this authority feels that the recognition of the group as a decision making
       bodv by the City Council is imperative if it is to remain effective. As under
       the*County Council however, the terras of reference of the group would be within
       the conditions of certification laid down by the City Council, anything beyond
       these terms being referred back via your Department for a Committee decision.

       reference Jto outstanding matters from previous meetings in order that these
       are not ’lost* in the minutes.

For the attention of D« 0» Grimshaw


Dear Sir,




Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
the above subject.
                     «-r«pd at the meeting but I think that the general feeling was
Many points were           Auth0rity involved in the system should be defined
p e r h a ^ a S r tfe " C t e / h y the South .orfcshire County Council.

                  v    «-*«n -fn principal to roles being defined in this way but I should
I have no objectio               P         ed that particular Authorities adopt particular
make it d ea r that if                ^    du    tQ consult with other interested parties
roles then they will                    interest    As I see it the Authority which carries
where there is ^ “- r^ l h a v f tje risp^sihility of advising the Council as
C e r t m c a t i n g Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.

 X have drawn up a draft
 I should point out that t                                                                          Would vou please also let me know
 " r l ^ r ^ r r n y " : i r e r . ya r e r r r i r s h o u i U e H i                                    S    Pin the Schedule.


 Moving onto the ^u^ ^ ° ^ hinS^ C^ ° ^ Sisf thl^the existing system of bi annual
 at the meeting on 0th March. My 1         ^     I feel that on£ major inspection
 limited xnl* e[ l X°™ ^ rried out on each stadium which should include all the
 per year s h o u l d be carr:^      ^   g     of thfi legisiation. To back up this
 areas and                    be a number of "during performance" inspections by
 inspec               ^       there is general agreement in relation to during
 plrfomaice- inspections as they would highlight the performance of the safety
 system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.                 ^   ^


                                                                                                                     734690 - Mr. Bownes
                                 For te le p h o n e e n q u irie s o n th is m a tte r p le a se rin g ............................................. (STD C od9 0 7 4 2 )
                                                                         Telex    54243 (A dm inistration            & Legal)
Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
encountered.

Moving on to the "working party" structure I think it is clear from the meeting
of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required. It is
reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the working party as
such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with .
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Authority. This list will be circulated as well.

Would you please consider the points I. have raised and let me have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

Meeting of S.A.S.G.A.G - l6th July, 1987


Mr. Beanes-opened the meeting and stated that the discussions would be divided
into four areas:-

1.   Definition of Rolls
2.   Inspections
3.   Status of Group
4.   Admin. Machinery of the Group


1. It was agreed that rolls should be broadly defined and responsibilities
   taken on by the appropriate of the three "lead authorities" i.e. Police,
   Fire and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs.

     A1 contact with the grounds should be through the licensing authority.

     Environmental Health would take a "general safety roll" and not be a
     "lead" authority.

2. The annual inspection is to be a joint full inspection to be carried
   out ri#*s.r th*3. of each ?*ep.con.  '            r'- r~ .  — :■    .

     T>.P. inspections to be done on an individual basis. Prior arrangements
     to be made with the Police, but not the Club. The Licensing Authority
     to be informed when an inspection has taken place.
                                                                                                                                  ■
3- The meeting was informed that legally the group is essentially an advisory
   authority - only the council can be the ultimate decision making authority.

4. Individual authorities to correspond to the sports grounds through the
    licensing authority who will subsequently circulate copies of all letters
    to each "lead" authority.

     Meetings of the group will be held at irregular intervals depending
     on need and can be called by any member of the group.       Individual
     authorities need not attend specific meetings if they have no "interest".

     Agendas will be issued prior to each meeting.

REPORT OF THE HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO THE GENERAL
PURPOSES PANEL

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - THE CURRENTSITUATION AND PROPOSALS FOR THE
FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNCIL'SCERTIFICATION FUNCTION

Introduction

The Panel will recall that on 1st April 1986 the City Council inherited from the
South Yorkshire County Council the role of certificating Authority under the
1975 Act.    The Act itself is basically aimed at ensuring adeauate standards of
safety at   designated stadia; there are three of these in Sheffield at the moment
- Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield United Football Club, and the
Owlerton Sports Stadium. A detailed report on the Act and its application in
Sheffield was submitted to the Panel on 6th May 1986.

The Current Situation

The Panel at its meeting in May 1986 identified several main areas for further
investigation.

Firstlv it was accepted at the time that the broad outlines of the
administrative svstem organised by the County Council should be continued for
the time being. This system has now been reviewed and the proposed
reorganisation is detailed later in this report.

The Panel also asked that the Health and Safety Executive be kept informed of
all matters relating to sports ground safety and that the Association or
Metropolitan Authorities also be asked about the RSI's involvement. As far a?
keeping the KSE informed of safety developments at the stadia the Executive made
it fairly plain that they would not make any comments. Tha srscc^|^vss       ,,
therefore discontinued. The involvement of the AMA in the H3E ?~4^=r=?-. has beer,
somewhat forestalled by action at central Government level to reviev the KSZ's
relationship with local authorities; this reviev was announced ir. tne
Government's reply to the Popplewell Report but no results of that^review have
yet been received. Fortunately, however, the Council's Director of Health and
Consumer Services has permitted his Officer's to      provide professional Jvseltfcand
safety input into the decision making process in      relation to ssraty or
sports grounds. The problem is, therefore, at least temporarily resolved.

The Panel also made reference to consultation on the sarety or sports ground?
policy with the other District Councils in South       Yorkshire. T'nfortur.ateiv,
attempts at arranging consultation meetings havebeen unsuccessful to date.     I:
is proposer, to try again to organise some consultations ir. the fairlv near
future, perhaps when the Certification system has settled down ir, each area.

The drafting of new safety certificate conditions in consultation vith the
Council's advisers has been progressing steadily and new draft conditions are
currentlv under consideration by those advisers.  It is hoped that tne new
conditions will be submitted to the Panel at its meeting in October for final
approval.

As to the question of charging fees under the1975 legislation, it should he
be made clear that such fees are only payable on the grant of a Certificate.
It is anticipated that if the Panel approves the new Certificate conditions a
Certificate will then be issued to Sheffield United and at that time it is
proposed to deal with the question of fees.

Future Administration of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a thorough review of the legislation it has become clear that a
detailed administrative system needs to be established in connection with the
Council's Certificating function. Discussions on this matter have been underway
for some time with the Police, the Fire Service, the Council's Building
Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services on the establishment
of such a system.

Accepting that the Council as the Certificating Authority will act on the basis
of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service) the question arises as to how
that advice may be best formulated. In the past, the County Council organised
an Officer Working Party which was apparently used as a forum for discussion
between Officers prior to the final formulation of advice to the Council. That
particular working party also appeared to have some decision making powers.

As it is essential that meetings take place due to the potential overlap of
requirements in many areas, all the Authorities and Officers have now agreed
that it would be appropriate to establish a revised form of the working party to
perform a similar function for the City Council. It is recommended that the
"Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group" (which would consist of
representatives from the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's
Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services), would function as
a forum for discussion between Officers; its most regular use would probably be
the discussion or items or advice to the Council before they are fincu.1^
formulated by the appropriate Authority. Meetings of the Group would be held^at
the reauest of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a reauest the Head of
Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a list
of items to be discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting a further list or
items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be taker, by each
Authority would be noted. It is then anticipated that detailed written acii'ice
to the Council would be forthcoming and be acted upon as appropriate.

In addition the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keeo copies of
all relevant correspondence which will be available to all participants m t^e
Group.

Under the cld County Council administrative structure the different Authorities
represented in their working party had fairly clearly defined roles within wrricn
to operate. Although it can be seen that there is some merit ir. this idea the
areas of potential overlap of responsibility are cuite extensive in deslinc with
sports srounas. However it appears that the various Authorities and Offir*
wish for some definition of roles and the following have been agreed:-

Authority                                         Area of Pesponsibility

The Building Surveyor                     All matters relating to the structure of
                                          stadia including crash barriers, walls,
                                          etc.

South Yorkshire County Fire Service       Fire precautions, fire alarms, means of
                                          escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                          capacitv.

South Yorkshire Police                    Stadium policing, evacuation procedures,
                                          access of emergency vehicles and
                                          emergency planning.
                                       - 3 -

It is anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department would have an
input on (a) aspects of general safety; (b) the general safety management of
stadia- (c) various special items *uch as first aid requirements. It will be
appreciated that these areas of responsibility are not exhaustive but it is
anticipated that any areas of doubt will be dealt with by discussions at
advisory group meetings.

Inspections
Movine on to a matter of more general policy it has been suggested that one
large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out by the Group backed up
by a series of inspections which will take place actually during football
matches. This proposal is in line with both the Popplewell Report and with
licensing practice in other areas.

Delegations
There is also a further question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
to the dav to day decision making required for the running of the Certification
System. At the moment decision making powers rest with the Panel but this is a
hierhlv impractical arrangement which needs to be reviewed urgently. It seems
that as an interim measure all routine matters could be delegated to Read or
Administration and Legal Department with other natters remaining at the ^ ^
discretion of the Panel. It is proposed that when the Certificate or Conditions
are in force then the delegation will be much more closely defined.
Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment with the current Certificate or
Conditions.

Recommendations

The panel is recommended to:-

(a)    Note the current situation;

 (b)   Approve the revised administrative system detailed in this report^including
       the establishment of the "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group .

 (c)   Delegate to the Head of Administrator* and Legal Department autnority to
       deal°with all routine matters in connection with the Adeinistrativs System.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975




I thank you for your letter dated 22nd December, 1978, and the cooy
letter of the Building Surveyor of the Sheffield Metropolitan
District Council.

It would seem essential that ths officers of ths County Council and
Metropolitan District Council involved in the production of ths
ceneral safety certificate raauired by the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club under the above Act, undertake a comprehensive survey
of the ground. I feel sure that it would be beneficial to the Club
if, initially, each department acted in uni3on in this respect
rather than separately and I would make the necessary arrangements
with my officers for this toJbe ^achieved.  ___      _         ^   ^

/T copy of the report of each department'should'be provided to each
involved department to enable problems to be discussed so that an
accepted approach might be determined and consolidated into a single
report which should be Torwardsd to the Club.

This report, together with that of Dr. Eastwood, would form ths
basis of a further meeting with officials of the Club as differences
of opinion, if any, would have been identified.

It is my opinion that the necessary comprehensive survey could not
be undertaken satisfactorily without plan drawings. In this raspact
I rsfer to paragraph 1.3 of the 'graen code1:

"The problem of crowd safety at football grounds is complex and
cannot be solved simply by ensuring that each corr.por.snt of a ground,
such as stairs, passages or sections of terracing, id satisfactory
in itself. The inter-relation cf components is essential: they
should be compatible and combins to Torm a baluncad uni*-".

Following the receipt cf drawings I suggast that Officers meat to
aGrae on identification procedures. In ordsr that each deoartmant
is abla to identify parts of the ground in a uniform manner, I
would prefer to hava stands and terraces clsarly identified, exit
rout9 s, passages, gangways, gataways, doors, etc., numbered in a
consecutive mannsr—and stairways lettered.
                     I   i
Officers of the County Council and Metropolitan District Council
have visitad ths ground and I bslievs t h z i furthsr visits should
be part of the ‘comprehensive survey. Findings from visits other


                                                     Cont'd.
than ths survey rsfarrad to will be limited and if us involve
ourselves in consultation with the Club following the submission
of Dr. Eastwood's report with limited information this could
prove unfortunate in the long term.

As previously mentioned I prefer to await the provision of the
plan drawings which have already been requested and if any
action can be taken to expedite this matter it would be
appr8ciauec.

                   and    spacing,          the          guide     recommends               that     the       number

                   of    spectators             should          not     exceed         54 p e r      10m        of       plan       'S

                                The     three         exits          have       a    total w i d t h             of      about

                   11    5m w h i c h      would       permit             about        12oO people                  per        minute

                   to    leave       the    ground.              Thus          the     terrace             could         be
                   emptied       in     about         six    minutes                which      is      very         satisfactory.

                                The     guide         suggests             that        everyone             on      a    terrace

                   should       be    within          12m     of      a    gangway           or       exit.             There           are

                   no    gangways          and       some     spectators                  will        be    2 5m f r o m               an

                   exit.         But       we    feel       this          is    of     no    consequence                      as

                   movement          horizontally                 along         this        terrace            will           be       easy

        Following the Working Party’s meeting with the representatives off the
        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th Decem ber, 1978, the
        Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January , 1979) circulated a
        Beport, together with P lans, drawn up by D r. W. Eastwood of Eastwood
        and P artn ers. The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
        16th February, 1979, to discuss the documents. .

        The purpose of today's meeting was to consider the views which the Working
        Party should put to the Club on the 16th February..

            (a)     Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants" stated that detailed
    V       plans at 1:100 s c a le should be supplied of a ll buildings and other accommodation
            for spectators, som e of the plans supplied w ere to 1:200 sca le . The F ire
            Service felt that the latter size were acceptable provided all of the plans were
            to the sam e s c a le , and it was AGBEED that the "Notes for the Guidance of
            Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

            (b) ■ The site plan at 1:500 scale had not.been supplied a s required by the
            N otes, but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in time for
            F riday's m eeting. The firm had also prom ised that a ll site fixtures would be
            Indicated on that plan.

  r . H. E. McGee welcom ed the rep resen tatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the b e s t in Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely a s a football operation, the Club
had been°losing money since 1967. C om m ercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it w as hoped to expand this side o H h e Club’s activities. The Club’s
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    .That, w h ilst Designating Orders did not specify time limits for the is s u e of
General Safety C ertificates, it was essen tial to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.
     2     That as the Club wanted to attract representative games, the aim should
     be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds. . • , , ..

 evacuation time of s o m e 1 2 h minutes.                      L a r g e r and re-aligned gates in the barrier
 and i m p r o v e m e n t of the existing upper exit could reduce this time to s o m e 10 minutes,
 but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a n e w exit of 3 m e t r e overall width.
 This could be integrated into the proposed future s c h e m e for enlarging and roofing the
 Kop.       T h e Club A G R E E D to give consideration to the proposals.
Para. 4 - T h e exploratory w o r k regarding the i m p r o v e m e n t of the h e a d r o o m had ..
still to be carried out, but w a s not expected to be a m a j o r item.


Para. 5 - B e c a u s e of the difficulty in devising a suitable m e t h o d of testing in places
(such as the top of the Kop), it w a s A G B E E D that proposals should be formulated
after further discussions betwe en Dr. E a s t w o o d and the Building Surveyor.


Para. 6 - T h e Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked at.                It w a s A G B E E D that the question of the h-aight of s o m e
of the cru sh barriers be considered again after it w a s seen which of t h e m failed on
testing.

Para. 7 - T h e Club stressed that their proposals for the i m p r o v e m e n t of the m e a n s of
egress would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer t e r m future.


Para. 8 - T h e Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together with
the installation of the n e w crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates in the existi ’
barrier, could all be carried out in the close season.                     Their a i m w a s to achieve a

Para. 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the i m p r o v e m e n t or replacement of the

Para. 1 - Dr. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
a g r e e m e n t on a s c h e m e which could be r e c o m m e n d e d to the Club.    This would
involve the re m o v a l of 10 seats f r o m each of the 9 g a n g w a y s and 4 seats f r o m in
front of each of the 9 upp er exits.                 T h e result would m e a n a loss of 126 seats
c o m p a r e d to the 225 in the original proposals.             T h e Club A G B E E D to give
consideration to the proposal.


Para. 2 - T h e w o r d at the end of the first line should have been 'Tea’ and not ’T e am '.

Para 1 - The b a ses of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor tim ber.
Whilst rusting was not e x c e s s iv e , it was AGBEED  th.at all bases would be exposed for
inspection and, if necessary, ste e l plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
encasing in concrete for permanent protection. B ecause of the apparent accumulation
of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
Club a lso AGBEED that the space beneath the tim ber floor should be cleaned out.

P ara. 2 - Provided the penning barriers w ere removed entirely, it was AGBEED that
it would not be n e c essa ry to rem ove any se a ts for escape purposes in the upper part
of the stand (the covered area).

Para 3 - It was AGBEED that tim ber handrails should be provided down each of the
outer ed^es of the main staircs&er that the existing iron centre railing should remain,
and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairw ay should be installed.
It was a lso AGBEED that the brick s ta ir c a s e walls should be buttressed where crowd
surge p ressu re could be generated.

             iron under eland ureas.
With r c r a r d to future m e e t i n g I think it ic essential that all matters agreed
b e " r e c o r d e d , as«ws are no w approaching finality in many areas and it is necessary
that v/e h &V2 r e c o r d e d exactly the agreed masters.

I vould rlso s u r e s t that in v i e w of the approach of certification it would,
perhaps, be advisable to hold future meetings a wa y from the ground, and that
Mr Vauchon, as the co-ordinator, should chair such meetings.

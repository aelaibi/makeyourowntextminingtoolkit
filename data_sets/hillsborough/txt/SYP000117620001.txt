                  awaited        arrival       of     the    first       fans.        A     number         of    trains         were      arriving

                  been     drinking          alcohol.         Those       without           good      reason for              going       in the

noted     that        th e    majority           of y o u n g       men who           bordered               t hi s   bus       had

obviously            been     consuming           alcohol.                However,              they were             well       behaved

with    the      exception            of 2 y o u t h s            wh o   were        on    the       top      de ck.         These

youths         had    been       causing         a nuisance              on     the       top       d ec k    and      had      to       be

Upon arrival               the     bus w a s      met        by a S e r g e a n t          and a number                 of      Police

Constables            who     supervised               the    unloading              of    the       supporters.                 All          the

supporters            were       directed          across          the        road    to       the     turnstiles,                   I

recall         some     of    the      fans      wishing           to     go    elsewhere              and       remember            the

Police         Sergeant          telling          them       to    go     into       the       turnstiles              and      then          to    do

what    they         wanted.

Myself         and    Police          Constable             Dixon        kept       back       the     two y o u t h s          who       ha d

been    a nuisance               on    the       bus    and       advised           them       of     their       behaviour.                   !he y

were     also        then     directed            to    the       turnstiles.                  Then,         together           with

Police         Constable           Dixon         1 made       my w a y         to    the G y m         under          the    North Stand

to a w a i t     the       arrival          of    the       rest     of m y         Serial.            Eventually               Police

Sergeant         Wright          and    th e      remainder              of    the    Serial           arrived           and      we      took

refreshment             whilst         on    standby.

At    approximately                2.45      pm we          were     deployed             by    personal              radio       to a s s i s t

on L a p p i n g s      Lane       with      crowd          control.            We    walked           u n de r       the    North Stand

and    towards          the      turnstiles             at     Leppings             Lane,       whilst           on    route         I was

approached            by     two      members          of    the     public          who       had     just       entered            the

ground.          One       man     said      to me,          “ get       those       fucking           gates          ope n *     its

murder         out    th e r e ,      there's          going        to    be    people          killed           if y o u       don't          do

something".                The     other         one    said        "you       better          get     out       there       your         mates

need     help” .

By    t h is    time         1 had     lost       sight        of m y S e r i a l ,            I made          my w a y      to      exit

gate A and            approached             two       stewards.               I immediately                   no t i r:e d that              the

qates      were       under        immense         pressure,              people          were        banging          on    it.          I said
                                                                                                                                         P AGE         3
                                                                                                                                         R123

to    the      stewards             "has a n y o n e         gone       out       of    these      gates".              They      said

" t h e r e ’s no w a y             anyone         can get         out,       its       crushed         out    there".

I then         looked             through        the    perspex           window          in the        gate       and     s aw a m a s s

of    bodies            pressing            against         the    gat e.          I then walked               further            round          to

gate      b where              1 saw Police             Officers             on    the     roof     of      the     turnstiles

pulling            people          into      the      ground       over       the w a l l .         One       of    t he      officers            on

the      roof          was    an    inspector.               1' s a w     that         half     of my       serial         w as     at      this

point         so       I remained            there with            t hem.          1 could         see      that        there       was      a

tremendous                  c r u s h at     the      turnstiles             and       in f ac t    officers             were       having

to    kick         t he      turnstile           back       so    that       it w o u l d       click       and allow             the       next

person         through.               A     number      of       the    spectators              coming        through          the

turnstiles                  were    apparently              injured          and       1 went      o ve r     to a s s i s t        a number

of    people.                However,           none    were       seriously              injured.            A number            of     the

spectators                  coming        through       were       asking          for     directions              to    their         part       of

the      ground.               It w a s      whilst         directing             some     of    the     f an s     that       I noticed

t h at    gate          C was       wide        open.        People          were       just     walking           through          this

g at e    at       a steady           pace.           I did       not     see      any     stewards           near       to    this         open

gate .

1 then         returned             to      gate 8 and            saw     t ha t       t h e r e wa s    just       the       Inspector-

on    the      roof          of    the      turnstiles.                I could          stil l     see      through           the      perspex

in G a t e         B    that- t h e r e         was    st ill      a    crush          outside      the       gate.

I then         heard          some        one    shout       "get       the       gate     op en " .        I thought             it s o u n d e d

like      a    voice           of a u t h o r i t y .        1' t h e n      saw Po li ce          Constable             1 63 2 S m i t h

with      other             officers         walk      over       toward          Gate     B.      they       then       spoke         to    the

stewards               on    the    g ate.         Gate      B was        then         opened      for      approximately                   30

seconds            an       initial         burst      of 5 0 -         100       people        came     through           t hi s      gate.

After         the       initial           burst       these       people          sorted        themselves              out    and walked

in a n        orderly             fashion,         s om e    went       to    the       programme           hut     and       some       asked

for      directions.                  The       majority          headed          towards        the N o r t h          Stand.

A short            t im e      l a te r ,    I made         my way        to G a t e       C and went              outside          where         I

met    up w i t h          Sergeant           Wright.              All    appeared            to    be     reasonably              c a lm

outside          around          this        area.        A message             wa s     then       received approximately

£ minutes             later       that        all    officers             were       required             on    the    perimeter

track.           Together          with        most       of m y S e r i a l           I went        back        into       the       ground

through Gate                C and        made       my way          onto       the     track        whilst           on th e w a y            round

I heard          fans       shouting           " t h e y r ’e not          fighting".

Upon arrival                at    the        track       at    the       Leppings          Lane      e nd       I saw       t ha t       there

was    a    number          of    spectators              on       the    playing          area and             police          officers

stood       at    the       fencing           were       pulling          people         over.            I also       saw       that

people       were          being        pulled       up       into       the    stand.             I immediately                 went         to

the    fence          to    the     left       of    the       goal       and     assisted            other          officers            in

getting          people          out     of    the       terracing.               1 together               with       other        officers

were       shouting          directions              to       the    crowd        to     get       o ut    of    the       way     as     I

could       see       bodies        in a       pile       under          the    w al l     bottom.              Fans       seemed         to

ignore       these          directions              and       shouted abuse                towards             us.     I lifted a

number       of       fans       over        the    fencing?             some     of     these        fans       were       slightly

injured and                some     more       seriously.

The    o n es     that, w e r e          slightly             injured          1 carried            as     far a w a y          from      the

fencing          as    possible.               I ensured             t ha t     these         fans        were       not    in a n y

distress.              Before           returning             to    the    fence.

I then       carried             on e    man       out    wh o      was    close         to    collapse?              X carried               him

on    to a       clear       area        in the          pitch and             stayed with                him    for       some       five

minutes.              He    was     very       distress             however,           didnot        appear           to    be     in a n y

danger.           A member              of    the St          Johns       Ambulance            crew        came       and       t oo k    over.

I returned             to    the        fe nc e .        I then          formed        part        of a        chain       of    police

officers          and       pulled a           number          of    dead       bodies         out.            1 was       in the m i d d l e

of    this       chain       and        did    not       actually          se t      any      bodies           down    on       the      pitch.

They       were       all    passed           to    other          officers.

The    only       one       I can        give any             description              of wa s       a man           in his        late

twenties          who       was     grossly          over          weight.           1 have         no     idea w h i c h          officers

                                                                                                                                 R 1 S3

             the    bodies        were       handed      to   as    everything         was      so    hectic    I did      not    h av e

             time    to    pay a t t e n t i o n .        Throughout            the   t i me    that    I was      pulling       the

             bodies       ou t    I noticed         a number         were       covered        in    vomit   and    a strong

             smell    of a l c o h o l        was   on    the      clothing.

             Throughout           the    ordeal       officers           were    cont i n u a l l y    having      abuse    shouted

             at    tehm,     which was          most      upsetting.             H o w e v e r , having      said    t h a t , t h e re

             were    a number           of    supporters           who    were    absolutely           magnificent         and

             assisted        us    greatly.

            At about          10 am (1000)      on Saturday 15th April       1989 (150489)   I left my

            home        in                    Liverpool,    to travel to Sheffield ground to watch

            the Semi Final match agaipnst Liverpool and Notts Forest.

            I am a Liverpool              supporter and I went with a group of about           10

            friends.              I purchased my ticket from Anfield Ground for the terraces

            in Le ppi ngs Ln at Hillsborough Stadium which I paid £6 and I got it

            from my season ticket

                                         All the others were friends of friends and I

            don't know them too well.

            We travelled along the motorway.     We didn't stop at all on the way and

            the traffic was not heavy and the roads were pretty clear.         We got

            into Sheffield at about    1 pm (1300) after getting    lost a few times       in

            Sheff ie 1d .

            We parked on a car park near to a Comet warehouse and walked to the

            ground which took about    15 minutes.     I passed a few Police near to the

            ground but they were on traffic duty.        We didn't have any Police

            escort or directions to the grounds.

            We only passed a few fans drinking out of cans on the side of the

            road.     Most of the pubs were shut but we did hear of one open although

            we didn't go there because it/was supposed to have been packed.            I

            never saw any drunken fans//or any fighting on the way to the ground.

            We got to the ground abortit 1.15 pm (1315).      At Leppings Ln there
S .O ,6 _
            were a few groups of pfeople waiting around outside but there w a s n ’t

            a large crowd.     I didn't go in right away but went for something to

            eat as we were tool/early.

            I came back with my friends at aboi/t 2.30 pm (1430) and it was          packed
S.o-£-                                       /                   /   ---------------
            with hundreds of fans outside the/ground queueing ufj/butside in the

            street.

            We started to wait at the wrong    place     and queued up outside the

            stands.     When we realised we made a mistake ye moved over to the right.

 /buo^      I only remember seeing two policemen on horseback at this time and I
    /*rT
            don't   remember seeing any stewards.
  M
            The   pressure from the crowds was bad and there was no proper queueing

            outside.    There was a line of people going     in through the turnstile

            and   I couldn't get my hands from down by my sides to get my ticket

            from my top pocket and I went straight through without showing           it.

            I lost all my other friends but I met up with another friend that
                                                                         PAGE        3

didn't travel    up with us.    His name



I met up with         inside the ground.     I can't remember seeing any

police outside the turnstile or any stewards until        I got inside the


9round‘                    Ca t  cwrt-A-
I stopped inside for a while and I saw the gat^e open next to the

terrace turnstiles and then a load of p e o p l y came through.     I didn't

see who opened the gates I just saw the top of tbrem opening. A mass
                                 T c j w /v *^          v5T
of people came through and I went with the croya towards the tunnel.

There was that many people       I couldn't stop    I yfiad wanted to.

I didn't see any other gates open.   There we&e no police outside the
                        as/o o i ^ c n o M ) 6 igtnO  waiDiS-
tunnel and there were no signs directing y/fu anywhere.  I only saw two

stewards outside the stairs to the stand/.

I had heard about the crushing from someone before and they told me to

go to the side of the ground but I couldn't help myself,         I was pushed

to the middle.     I remember going into the tunnel and then the next

moment   I was out the oth/?rside with the pushing of the crowd.         There

were no police or stewards       in the tunnel at all   it was too crushed.

There was no fighting or disturbances       inside the ground as I went

towards the tunnel,
   p e w ^4-
I went to the leVt at the bottom of the tunnel with the group of fans

I was with.     I stopped about three people back from the wall.         It was

very tight at that time        and Iwas still able to move my arms.      I

stopped there for      about three minutes and there was a slight swaying

of the crowd.     I was then pushed gradually towards the front of the

terraces and it must have took me about two to three minutes to where

I finally stopped     which was about arms    length fn^m the fence onto the

pitch.   There was     about three people between y e and the fence.         I saw
CAT
people climbing over the fence onto the pit«m and I heard them

screaming for help,

        The next thing that happened was that        I passed ft!ut w ith the pressure

        around.     Someone screamed "Get    off my head,\,'/and that came from

        behind me.       X couldn't see who this was and this was just before         I

        passed out.       I remember   coming around and I felt y'le cold concrete

        floor on my      leg and there were dead bodies on m y legs.     I didn't     see

        these people all     I could see was the back of wieir heads.

        When I came around the crowds had gone and some lads helped me up on

        rny feet and I walked out of the ground.          I just wanted to get ^Ait.        I

        was still    in a bit of a daze.     I walked out through the tu n n e l .    I

        didn't wait around into the road and found my way back ti^p/the minibus.
                                                     ,/

        I was the first one back and had to w/it for my friends to come later.

        I was    injured but I didn't realise/unti 1. / I   got home and my right arm

        was hurting badly.

        I went to the same ground l^st year for the Semi Final match and there

        seemed to be more police -=ynd stewards on duty then.         Fans were stopped

        way back from the ground and checked for tickets.           There were a lot

        more    police at the entrance and police horses and the fans were made

        to queue,    then there was hardly any trouble then I think        if they had

        done    it this time there w o u l d n ’t have been this disaster happen.

        There should have been stewards directing fans to each side of the

        ground and stopping them going down the tunnel          in the numbers they did.

        I was wearing a                                                    and blue

        jeans and training shoes and I have       light brown short cropped hair,




        I have indicated my position in the terraces behind the goal on a

        sketch plan which I have signed as a true indication of my movements

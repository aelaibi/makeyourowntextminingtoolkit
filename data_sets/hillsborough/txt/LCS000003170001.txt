       Dear Sir/Madam,                         ■

       Hillsborough Assistance Unit                           ■

       Ivwrite further to my;-letter of-20th S e p t ember-regarding the..                                         .
       future funding arrangements for the H i l l s b o r o u g h Assistance
       Unit.’                                       ■ :.

       As you may recall, a -unanimous agreement was reached in
       Liverpool on 6th September that the wor k of the Unit should
       be cont inued and that the costs involved .should be u n d e r ­
       written by participating authorities until 31st March, 1991.

       The costs involved are e s t i m a t e d to be approximately £125,000
       in 1989/90 and £233,000 in 1990/91 (November 1989 prices)
       and w o u l d be reduced, as I m e n t i o n e d in my earlier letter, by
       any external grants received.          Whilst efforts to attract
       financial support and assistance from a lternative sources
       continue, no such grants have yet been confirmed, other than
       a sum of £100,000 from the Trust Fund towards the cost of
       the Helpline service to March, 1991, w h i c h has already been
       taken into account.

   This information was c o n v e y e d to the H i l l s b o r o u g h Inter-Agency
   Group, w hich met on Friday, 8.th December.              The Group believe
   firmly that the formal agreement and c o m m i t m e n t of finance by
   p a r t i c i p a t i n g authorities is now e s sential if the continuation
   of an effective and c o - o r d i n a t e d service is to be ensured.
   I am advised by the Group that any o n - g o i n g u ncertainty about the
   establishment of the Unit will give rise to a serious risk of
   b r e akdo wn of service provision.


When    calling   o t   telephoning   please ask   fo r   M r . Davey.
It is my understanding that the question of underwriting
the costs of the Hillsborough Assistance Unit has been
considered by all participating authorities and I now write
therefore to seek formal agreement to the underwriting of
the above costs, which equates to a m a x i m u m sum of £12,500 in
1989/90 and £25,000 in 1990/91 for each authority.

You may wish to know that questions about which authority
should undertake managerial r e s ponsibility for the Unit and the
locality in which the Unit w ould be establ i s h e d are being
addressed urgently by officers drawn from the Inter-Agency
Group and a firm proposal is expected very shortly.              The
proposed staffing structure of the Unit has, I believe,
been considered and approved by p a r t i c i p a t i n g authorities.

I now look, forward to the formal agreement of your A u t hority
to the commitment of funds for the u n d e rwriting of costs in
the manner proposed.                             —

It is hoped that Authorities will w ish to conclude this matter
in correspondence, rather than requiring Members to meet again
ifi L i v e r p o o l . . .' '         .

Yours faithfully,




City Solicitor,
Secretary to the Council.

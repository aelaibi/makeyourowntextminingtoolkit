            You asked me to monitor the situation between the Chief
       Constables of South Yorkshire and the West Midlands Police
       following their exchange of correspondence on the 5th and 6th
       September which tended to indicate that there may be some
       conflict between them.
            I spoke to Peter Wright on Wednesday 13th September and
       there is no doubt that he was now feeling much more relaxed
       about the affair and totally accepts the message contained in
       the letter from Geoffrey Dear dated 7th September, 1989.

            I had no difficulty in persuading Peter Wright to
       respond to the correspondence and to talk to Geoffrey Dear
       which he did on Thursday morning, 14th September.      There
       seems no doubt that there is total unanimity between the
       Chief Constables and Peter Wright will shortly be visiting
       West Midlands Police tof join Geoffrey Dear for lunch.

                  Q. They did not know, and could not know, the state of the
                     Leppings Lane terraces?   They were on the wrong side of
                     it. - A. Mr. King I have nothing to add.

            B              MR. KING:      Thank you.

                           THE   CORONER:      Mr. Catchpole?

                           MR.   CATCHPOLE:       Ihave no questions.

                          THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, you will be a little
                     bit longer than that, I take it?

            C              MRS. MCBRIEN:        Yes.

                           THE CORONER:        Miss Addleman?

                           MISS ADDLEMAN:         No questions, sir.

                           THE CORONER:        Mr. Russell?

                           MR. RUSSELL:        I have no questions.
            D
                          THE CORONER:   I do not think it is worth starting
                    before lunch but there is just one thing which the jury
                    have mentioned to me.    In fact they have mentioned it
                    twice, and that is what about the video evidence of the
                    terraces.    I have had the videos looked at and there is
                    actually next to nothing on the videos because, of
                    course, not everything was recorded.    That does not mean
                    to say they weren't possibly scenes, but there is, I
            £       understand, a little tiny bit which is actually on the
                    compilation which you have seen.    There is another
                    little bit which starts at 15.03 and goes on for a few
                    minutes.

                         What we have done is that we have clipped it, if
                    that is the right word, and we will show it to you, but
                    it is very poor quality and I do not think it is going to
                    help us very much.   As far as I can tell there isn't
                    much recorded.   Does that help?

                         Right, two o'clock,  Mr. Duckenfield you will
                    remember you are still on oath.

 \         Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Sergeant Goddard, just one general question, please,
prefa&ed with this.  Can you tell the Jury how long
you ha^e been a serving Police Officer? - A. I was a
Cadet for Sheffield City in 1959 and appointed Police
Officer ik 1962.

For how longvhave you been a Sergeant? - A. October
1976.        \

Without going ii^o detail, as part of your duty you
have to attend at\all manner of events and
emergencies? - A. r^s sir.

I want you to put thexevent when you were in the
Control Box and you started to receive the calls from
Mr. Marshall outside to open the gates because
otherwise someone would be killed, just put that in
the circumstances in which it happened, put that in
the context of your experience as a Police Officer.
How does this rank in terms of emergencies that you
have been involved in? - A. The most dire emergency
certainly.   I had never known anything before like
this at all.

     THE CORONER:  Sergeant Goddardy I am most
grateful to you for being here.  Thank you very much
for helping us.

     What we are now going to do is we are going to
hear Mr. Bichard in a moment.  We are going to press
on today, but what I want to do is you will remember
you were asking about the video, and I think we will
show this video now of the scene as far as we have got
it at Leppings Lane.  In fact, it was, of course,
taken by Mr. Bichard so it is a convenient time to
actually look at it, but I am going to get Mr. Killoch
who has actually selected the piece out that we need
to describe it.

              JOHN KILLOCH Recalled

                 By THE CORONER:

Give your name so we know who you are. - A. Sergeant
John Killoch, sir, West Midlands Police.  I have just
taken a short sequence from one of the South Yorkshire
Police videos, which shows pictures taken from one of
the CCTV cameras situated at the ground on 15th April.
These show scenes inside Leppings Lane of the Leppings
Lane pens, the West Stand.  I should mention, sir, I
think the Jury are already aware but some of the
                                                 J. KILLOCH


     pictures are in what they call time lapse, so that it
     will jump.

          THE CORONER: Yes.   It is not very long, about 10
     or 15 minutes.
Q.   Before we start, can you remember what time the
     sequence begins? - A. It starts, sir, at approximately
     15.02 and the first few frames are actually shown on
     the concourse area, and then the camera moves into the
     West Stand.

                   (The video was shown)
     MR. BEECHEY:   That is C.539.

     THE CORONER:   Have got an identification number or
something on the tape so that we know?

     MR. KILLOCH:   Yes, sir.   The original
identification is TB.l.   That is the West Midlands
Police reference.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Maxwell?

     MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, I am here today as you might
have guessed in order to present to you written
submissions on law of the Sheffield City Council.    I
would normally do that, of course, at the end of the
evidence.   That may yet be possible, but perhaps not
today, but we obviously want to comply with your
timetable.   At the moment it is a bit like Blue Peter,
"Here is one I made earlier"!   Sir, in due course, it
will be presented.

     Sir, there are certain matters I would wish to raise
with you now and which might be better dealt with in the
absence of the Jury, with our leave, sir.

                 (The Jury left Court)

     MR^. MAXWELL:   Sir, I have kept up with the evidence
in theseXlnquests with my daily dose of transcript and
the comments I make to you now concern the ending of
these Inquests and the ending of the evidence.    They are
intended to be, helpful.   I hope they are not taken as
some forensic cri de coeur, but there may be an element
of that in it.

     Sir, you may remember that case where the evidence
that went before an Inquest was likened to the tip of an
iceberg.   Normally, of course, icebergs get smaller but
there is at least a risk, sir, of the evidence here
getting larger in quantum arid may be getting unbalanced.
Alternatively it may be that tKe Jury is about to be
asked to look unnecessarily belch* the water line.
                                     '\

     I know you have considered this, already but there
are reasons why in my respectful submission you could
reconsider the point.   Messrs. Goddard* Bichard and Ryan
have run as a trio, or Goddard and Bichar<| as a duo, for
a long time in these proceedings.    I knowxyou have
considered already just how far one should go with their
evidence.

     Sir, I comfort myself in asking you to reconsider
the position with two thoughts.   The first is that you
have always shown that as your own man, and as very

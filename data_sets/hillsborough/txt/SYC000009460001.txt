  NOTES
1 M odify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  w ith and partly without a jury.

2 In the case o f a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want o f attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                     Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause o f death.

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a W here the cause o f death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one o f the following
    forms be adopted:

      C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                           Re
      C.D. died from the industrial disease of

      C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
      on drugs.

      C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

      (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
      suggested that the following words may, where
      appropriate, be added:
      "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                    Cause of death
      care/self-neglect').

   b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
     infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
     of the following forms be adopted:

      C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
      his/her mind was disturbed).

      C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
      induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
      C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.

      C.D. was killed lawfully.

      Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
      further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
      arose.

   c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
     it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

      C.D. was killed unlawfully.

  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
    complete the remainder of the form.

Dear Sirs,

Re:    RESU ME D INQUESTS 19th NO V EM B E R 1990.



If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people wh o died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
on the 19th of No ve mb er 1990 at 1 0 . a.m. Details of venue wi ll be n o t i f i e d in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, n o r of the natu re and limitations of a
coronal invest ig ati on w hi c h you w i l l recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my res ponsibility to select the
w it n e ss e s wh o w i s h to give evidence. I am at pr esent engaged in consi de ri ng
this and in de te rm i n in g who I w i s h to invite to attend.

With out pre judice in any wa y to m y rights in the matter, I am w r it i n g to you
to give you an oppo rt uni ty to d r aw to my att ent ion the names and other
ap propriate details of any witn es s or witn es se s w h o m you wo u l d like me to
consid er call ing to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

M a y I please ask you in cons id eri ng w h e t h e r you w i s h to draw any names                   to my
attention, to bear in mi nd the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also wa n t to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
names for co ns i d er at i on is no t hi ng more than that, and that the decis io n as
to w ho to call to give evidence is and remains a m a tt e r for me.

 I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
 hea rd from you by the end of Sept em be r I w i ll assume you have no names to
 submit.

 Yours        faithfully,

Dear         Sirs,

Re:                      JxGGSR.                  BALL (deceased) So*74,

As you are awaa^e, //■jjhe Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,
 H.M. Coroner.

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

           Dear Sirs

           RE: KESTER BALL - DECEASED

           I am in receipt of your comments regarding the summary of evidence in
           relation to the above-named person which were forwarded to us by Mr Fraser
           from the Hillsborough Steering Committee.

           Your comments are noted regarding the question in relation to whether or
           not the wearing of a scarf contributed to Kester Ball's death. This matter
           has been forwarded to H.M. Coroner for his information in order that he may
           address the comments you have raised.

           In relation to paragraph 4 of the summary of evidence, it is accepted that
           there appears to be a conflict of evidence between Police Constable
           Lawrence and the witness, Terence Pitt. Mr Pitt identifies Kester Ball
           from facial photographs taken of the deceased in the temporary mortuary at
           the gymnasium of Hillsborough football stadium. Police Constable Lawrence
           and Mr Pitt do not corroborate each others evidence. Your comments have
           been passed to H.M. Coroner for his information.

           In relation to paragraph 12, photograph reference POM , is the photograph
           that was published on the front page of the Times newspaper dated 17 April
           1989.

           Yours faithfully

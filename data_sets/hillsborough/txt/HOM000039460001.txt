 HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

 Note of a meeting on 8 December 1997


 Present: Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
          Tim King QC
          C F Bone (scrutiny secretary)


Mr King visited LJS-S in response to his (LJS-S’s) letter o f 5 November. He had
been junior Counsel to Benet Hytner QC, on behalf of the Steering Group
representing families of victims, at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry into the Hillsborough
disaster. He had then represented many of the families at the main Inquest.


 Video evidence

2.      Mr King had no recollection o f seeing any video evidence about the disaster
except for the compilation tape. He did not recall having seen tapes TB1 or TB2.
But he thought the families’ legal team had had access to any material they wanted,
including videos of the disaster, as set out in LJS-S’s letter (para 4).

3.      LJS-S described the background to the issue of the missing videotapes. Two
tapes were stolen from Sheffield Wednesday’s security room on the night o f the
disaster. These were tapes from the club’s own video system, not the police one, and
they would not have shown scenes on the Leppings Lane terrace. Tapes from the
police system still existed (TB1 and TB2) - among other things they showed scenes
on the Leppings Lane terrace from 1502 onwards, and these parts o f the tapes had
been shown at the Inquest.

4.       LJS-S was satisfied that there were no missing police tapes. Mr King said he
too felt this was so. He said that Elizabeth Steele (now HHJ Steele), who had also
acted for the Steering Group, had recently told him that she too did not recall any
argument about tapes being possibly missing.

5.       LJS-S’s letter to Mr King (para 9) had asked him whether the police had
contended that they could not see that the central pens 3 and 4 had been full because
their CCTV had not been working. Mr King believed they had not done that. The
issue was not whether they could see the problem but what steps they had taken to
solve it.

 6.     The argument at Taylor was all one way. It was obvious to everybody that
pens 3 and 4 had been full. The question was not whether the police knew they were
full but whether they had given any thought to where the extra fans would go after
Gate C had been opened. The police had tried at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry to run the
nonsense that the fans could ‘find their own level’ on the terrace - when they plainly
 couldn t. His main theme acting for the families at the Inquests was that Mr
 Duckenfield had ignored the obvious risks.


 Aftermath o f the disaster

 7.     Mr King confirmed that lawyers acting for the families knew that there were
 victims who had died after the 3.15 ‘cut-off time’. He pointed out that the Coroner
 had given his ruling on this (para 11a o f LJS-S’s letter) in the absence o f the jury.

 8.       LJS-S said that the families were arguing that the ‘rescue’ of fans after 3.15, or
 failure to rescue them, should be re-examined. He asked whether lawyers acting for
 the families at Taylor or the Inquests had had access to statements from South
 Yorkshire Ambulance Service employees. These had given statements to solicitors
 acting for the Ambulance Service, who then gave them to the West Midlands police
 inquiry team. Some of them then gave oral evidence at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, and in
 those cases their statements were available to lawyers acting for the families. But
 others did not.

9.     Some of their statements were included in the ‘body file’ for each victim
which West Midlands police prepared for the Inquests. But where that was so they
did not generally give personal evidence at the Inquests, since each case was dealt
with (at the mini-inquest stage) on the basis o f a police summary

10.    Mr King thought that he had not had access to unused statements by
ambulance people and others who had not given oral evidence. But he would
reflect on th at and write to LJS-S. He pointed out that St John Ambulanceman Mr
Saxton, mentioned at 1lc of the letter, had given oral evidence (at Lord Taylor’s
Inquiry) - which he thought was how he had come to see Saxton’s statement.

11.    Mr King recalled that the families had strongly believed that the rescue
services could and should have done more. But Lord Taylor had gone into the rescue
operation very thoroughly. LJS-S said that Taylor had made very pertinent findings.
His main criticism on this score was again of the police, for not realising what was
happening. He also pointed to the difficulty of getting people out of the pens quickly.
Mr King thought that Lord Taylor’s scope was very wide - he (Mr King) had not
been aware of any attempt to limit the issues considered by his Inquiry.


Inquests

12.    Mr King had told the families over and over again that challenging the
Coroner’s 3.15 cut-off point would mean getting expert medical evidence that there
were people whose fatal injuries were inflicted after 3.15. But no such evidence was
forthcoming. He thought that the jury would not have been aware that not everybody
who died did so before 3.15 (though he himself was aware of that). But that was not
relevant to the decisions the jury had to make - he did not know o f evidence o f any




C:\KINC.DOC
  novus actus interveniens after 3.15. The jury were certainly aware that not everybody
  who had been crushed in the pens had died.

 13.   Mr King could not say whether, as LJS-S had heard, it was the families
 themselves who pressed the Coroner to hold the ‘mini-inquests’. He had not been
 involved in them himself - between the appearance of Lord Taylor’s interim report in
 August 1989 and the start o f the main inquest he was working on the civil
 proceedings.

 14.     LJS-S said that the Coroner had a note o f a meeting with Mr Fraser, the
 families’ solicitor, saying that Mr Fraser had agreed to the 3.15 cut-off point. Mr
 King knew nothing about that. He was not aware either o f whether or not the
 Coroner had, as now alleged, misled families into believing that the questions of
 where and when people died would be looked at again during the main inquests. His
 efforts at the Inquest were directed to creating an overall picture o f what happened,
 not to establishing the precise circumstances in which particular individuals died. '


 Police statements

15.     LJS-S outlined the process by which South Yorkshire police officers provided
personal ‘recollections’ of the events at the stadium which were then put into
statement form, often with amendments, for the purpose of Taylor and the inquests.
He said that it was the ‘vetted’ version o f this material which was served on Counsel
at the inquiry and the inquest, though on at least one occasion (PC Huckstepp) Mr
King was plainly working from an original, unvetted, text.

16.    Mr King suspected that he had not known about this process. He had no
recollection o f hearing about changes to the original police statements.


General

17.     Mr King said that he would sum up the causes o f Hillsborough as follows -

        *       a ground designed years before, adapted both inside and outside to
        create pens which produced a funnel effect;

        *     a popular match, with late arrivals;

        *     the officer in charge had never run a match before,he was an
        administrator - anybody looking outside the control box could see the
        problem, but he didn’t;

        *     escape from the pens was practically impossible and the police on the
        perimeter were conditioned to think that anybody who tried it was a hooligan;

        *     it was a tragedy waiting to happen.


G:\KING.DOC
 18.    He thought that the families had got a fair break from Lord Taylor. Taylor
 had run a thorough and very impressive Inquiry and was 110% on the families’ side.

 19.     He understood why the families were aggrieved about the Inquests. The
 Coroner seemed to be trying to re-run the Taylor Inquiry. He was particularly
 insensitive to insist on hearing the results of the blood analysis for all the victims and
 to call evidence from local residents about some fans who were drunk.


Action

20.    Mr King to write to LJS-S (para 10). LJS-S to write to Benet Hytner QC to
ask what he had known about the changes to police statements.

21.    LJS-S assured Mr King that their discussion had been in confidence.         He
would not disclose any of it in his report without Mr King’s prior consent.

               On Saturday^              15th April          1989,       I was     on      duty      together           with    officers             in

               t he    F Division            Crime     & Vandal          u nit.    After         initial          duties       early          in the

               d a y we      were     directed         to    s t a n d b y as a       f u ll     unit       at    the    g y m at        S;W.F.C.

               This     was     done.

               About        2.40    pm th e      unit       was    directed        by m a t c h       control           radio       to

               Leppings         Lane      to a s s i s t     with       crowd     control.            The        unit    then       walteed

               under        the N o r t h      Stand    and approached                ’A ’ g a t e      at       Leppings       Lane-           I

               together         with PC         7S S Gee      of F C & V w e n t               to    t he    rear       of    the    turnstile

               next     to    this       gate    on    the    inside       of     the      ground       and as s i s t e d          in

               directing           persons       exiting          the    turnstiles            to    the N o r t h       Stand       seating

               area.         It was       obvious       by the          action     of      persons          coming       through          the

               turnstiles           t h at     there    was       a serious        crowd         congestion             situation

               outside        the     turnstiles.             People       were       coming         through           and    cornplainaing

               of     injuries        and      how    people       were    being        crushed         outside.              After       a    short

               ti me    I could          see    that    youths          were    climbing            over     the       outer    perimeter

               wall     and     standing         on    the    roo fs      of    the     turnstiles               just    to    the       r ight

               of     *6*    gate.,       X moved       o ve r     to    just     below        these        youths       together             with

               PC     7S2 Gee       as    Inspector          John Barrett             of    F division             c 1imbed         onto       the

               roof     with       those       youths       and    started        helping           them     o ve r     the    wall.           With

               PC     Gee    I helped          these    youths          down    from       the      roof.         I could       see       through

the      turnstile             doors         into       the        crowd     outside              and       could        see      people

screaming            and       shouting            being           squashed           trying         to      get      into        the

turnstile            entrance.                I could also                  see       the     b lu e        dividing           fence          in the

Leppings            Lane       turnstile               enclosure            and       could        see       people           scrambling                for

their         liv es      up    this         fence          and       then along             it    to       the     roof       of    the

turnstiles               where        I ns p . J o h n B e n n e t t             was     helping             t h e m over.               As    they

were      coming          over        I could           see       them      showing           us     their          match         tickets              but,

du e     to    the       urgency         of       the       situation            did     not       check           the      tickets.

After         a short          t im e    of       this       a serial            of     officers             were        stood       by       *B*       gate

which         could       be    seen         to    be       being       pushed          in f r o m          t he    outside          and       the

gate was            opened.             I cannot             say who         by.         People             then      fell        into        the

ground         through          the      g ate.             I stood         there        telling             them        to    be    calm and

slow      down.           Afte        the     mam           bulk      of    people           had     co me         through          and       the

crush         problem allevi a t e d                    the       gates      were        closed.             I ca n n o t         say     by wh o m .

I then         moved       o v er       to    g at e        ’A ’ a n d      saw       that        most       of m y         unit     was       there

going         through          that      gate          outside          in to         th e    Leppings              Lane       area.           I went

with      them and after                     only a short                  t ime      1 heard           a    radio          message           from

match         control          directing               all       available            units        on to       the       perimeter             track

in f r o n t        of    the L e p p i n g s           Lane.           As a u n i t          we w e n t           b ac k     through          gate

’A*      and    down       towards            the       North Stand                up    the       first           gangway          entrance             at

that      end       of    the       North         Stand and             through          onto        the       pitch.             I could              see

a    large      crowd          of     people           on    the       pitch a r o u n d           the       goal        area       at    the

Leppings            Lane       en d     and       it a p p e a r e d        to me        that        there          had       been a          pitch

invasion.                I saw        none        of    the       football            players           on     the       pitch.           Together

with      other          officers            I formed             a    cordon         around         the       IS y a r d s         box.           I

could         see    people           walking           around          holding          their          ribs        and       in o b v i o u s

pa in     but       did    not        realise           the       extent         of     the       disaster.                 The     cordon

moved         forward and               I spoke             to    f ans     on     the       pitch          directing             them        to       the

is     the     nearest          one      to       the       North       Stand.           PC       13 9 8 G o o d w i l l          of m y       un it

then approached                   me    and    i n f o r m e d me             t h at    he     had       seen     one       person          dead.

I    then went           o ver     to    behind          goal        area and             saw Po lic e            Officers             pulling

people          over    the       perimeter            fence         and       through             the    central           exit       ga te.        I

walked          around       t hi s     area      speaking               to    fans       who       appeared           injured          and

tried       to    calm       fans       down.          There         was       a    large          number       of     f an s     who       di d

not      appear        to    be    injured          but      were         in a v e r y a g g r e s s i v e                 mood.        I

could       s m ell     intoxicants               on a        l a rg e        number          of    these.            I could          see

persons          being       brought          out      of    the         stand         and     la id o n        the        grass       and

Police          Officers          giving       mouth         to m o u t h           resuscitation                 assisted             by    fans.

I then          saw    fans       breaking          up      the      advertising                   signs     around             the    pitch        to

make       make       shift       stretchers.                The         seriusly             injured        persons             were       placed

on    these       and       carried       away         by    police            officers             and     fans.           I assisted

putting          persons          onto    the       stretchers                 and      could        see     the m o s t          appeared

to    be    dead.           As    the    persons            were         being         carried           past     the       Kop       end    of

the      ground        the       Notts    forest            f a ns       began         chanting           and     clapping.                 This

aggravated             the L i v e r p o o l        f an s     on        the       pitch       and       in the        stand and             the

o ne s     on    the    pitch          began      running            towards            the K o p         end.         1    tried       to     c al m

people          down and          turn    them         back       and         then      ra n       down     the       pitch       to a r o u n d

the      penalty        box       area    at      the K o p          en d      of      the     pitch.           1 there           saw PS

in a       cordon across                the    pitch,          we        stood         there        and     prevented             fans

the      turnstiles.               I there          assisted              in e m e r g e n c y           vehicles           moving

through          the    crowd          into    the       ground and                 helped          f ans    with          any    of    their

  Lane     but       could        find      no    fighting.             We     then       returned          to L e p p i n g s      Lane

  and     left       the       vehicle          and   stood       by    the       emergency           vehicles           and    asissted

  in the        dispersal             of    f ans     there.           1 then        heard a          radio m e s s a g e          from

  there        and    joined          uni t      wh ic h was       complete             except        for     PC    1 39 8

  Goodwill.               As    a mobile          u n it    we    were       then       directed         to      fighting          at   the

  Burgoyne           Arms       public          hous e,     Langsett           Ro a d .        On arrival           all      was    quiet

  a n d we      resumed          back       to    the      ground.           We    were        then    directed           to

  the     casualty             dep t.      Northern General                  Hospital           a    report        of    fighting.            On

  arrival        all       was       quiet       a n d we    resumed           back       to    the    ground.            We    were

  then     directed             to    the       Leppings         Lane     terrace          where       we     made       a search         of a

  section        of       the    terrace          between         the     tunnel          entrance          and     the N o r t h          "/

  Stand.         On       completion             we   attended          C 1a y w h e e 1 s L a n e       and       had    our      meal.

  We    were     then          deployed          to N i a g a r a P o l i c e        Club       on    standby           duties.

  of    the     disaster             and    believed         that       at     most       no m o r e     than       about       10--13

  persons        had       been       killed.           It w a s       not     until       much       l at e r     that      I heard

  th at    the       number          of    persons         killed       was       93.

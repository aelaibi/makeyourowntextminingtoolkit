                  I am sending a copy of an article we are publishing on a point of view
              which has not, so far as I know, been covered by the media.   Perhaps it
              might be of some use to you?

prevent factors that create a crisis from building up.
    Govern         exists to further the common good; and
common glB r has different levels. There are hard-core
matters to do with our survival; and soft-core matters to do
with our enjoyment of life.
    Well, we’ve gone soft. We don’t turn a hair any more at
our administrators running our swimming baths or
organizing concerts for us. We forget, because it is
convenient to do so, that they should do none of these
things in preference to attending to the hard-core matters of
life and death.
    The primary functions of government are to protect us
from outside attack (to organize our defence against other
nations in times of war); and to protect us against ourselves
by the ordered manner in which our lives are conducted,
and the proper organization of common areas of land and
common services.
    It has to be accepted that since the war the public has
more money year by year to spend on leisure. And we have
gone for it in a big way. On a Bank Holiday, we pour into
stately homes, game parks, car parks turned into junk
markets and shopping emporia. People are increasingly put,
 or putting themselves, into situations in which they are
incapable of using their own initiative to rescue themselves
from the unforeseen
    When we go abroad, we herd ourselves into aeroplanes
without sprinklers into an ill-organized sky; and we stream
onto roll-on-roll-off ferries despite the massive history of
 ships lost at seas as a result of some unusual circumstance
combined with "air-bubbles" beneath the decks caused by
 design faults or by cavalier loading of cargo. We know these
 things. We swallow, and we get on board, because we don’t
 know how else we are going to get to the sun.
    In the last 20 years, the central government has done
 much to discard its inspectorial role. In my own field, the
Children's Department Inspectorate dropped that title in
 1974, giving a nice excuse to local authorities to bump up
 their headquarters staff to "inspect" their own services.
    In any such important matters, we should reinstitute

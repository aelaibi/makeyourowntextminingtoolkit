       Dear Mr.Kelly,
                                            F.A.Cup Sem i-final
                                           L iverpool .v . Nottingham F o re st

                            In re p ly to yours o f the 21 st in s ta n t, r e . the above,
       I r e g r e t th ere i s l i t t l e inform ation I can give which could be o f any
       value to your goodself.

                      However, I was seated on the fr o n t row o f th e D ire c to rs '
       Box and had a good view o f th e a re a in which the tragedy occurred.

                        I t appeared to me th a t even p r io r to th e commencement
      o f th e game th a t the a re a a llo c a te d to Liverpool su p p o rters was over
      "populated". Surely, th e person whoever i t may be gave th e in s tr u c tio n
      to open the gate should have s a t i s f i e d h im self as to the s itu a t io n in sid e
      the ground p r io r to g iv in g th e in s tr u c tio n s to open th e g a te .

                        I a lso f e e l t h a t the p u b lic address system should have
       been brought in to use a d v isin g th e p u blic o f the circum stances re . th is
       s itu a tio n .

                        I t also appeared to me th a t the P o lic e in s id e the ground
      a t the Leppings Lane end lack ed an O ffice r with the n ecessary experience
      to handle a d is a s te r o f t h i s dimension.


                                             Yours s in c e re ly .

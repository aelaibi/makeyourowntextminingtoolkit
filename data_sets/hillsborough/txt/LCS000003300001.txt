HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER UNIT
AND DROP-IN CENTRE
PROGRESS REPORT



1. Following the Disaster in Sheffield on 15th April various actions have been taken
   by the City Council to ensure that the Liverpool victims have been provided for
   and in addition the Social ServicesDepartment has continued to co-ordinate the
   main aspects of the disaster response.    Thedirect assistance to familiesand
   survivors has been the primary responsibility of the Social Services Department,
   but there have been and continue to be other major service provisions.

   The Social Services has worked with the four other Merseyside Authorities,
   Lancashire and Cheshire, to achieve a co-ordinated approach between all seven
   and with all other Social Services Departments throughout the country who are
   affected.

2. On 29th April the Leadership of these seven Councils, together with those from
   Nottinghamshire and Sheffield met to consider a Report of the Director of Social
   Services. The Report stressed the continuing need for co-ordinated response over
   time and the establishment of an appropriately staffed unit in order to achieve
   this.   The Report was agreed, in principle, and officers requested to investigate
   sources of finance. The services to. be provided by the Unit have been maintained
   to date by our Liverpool Social Services staff with support from the other
   Departments. This report addresses those issues.

3. On Sunday, '16th April, officers of .the Social’SerVices Departments met and agreed
   a concerted approach to Hillsborough.     Members have seen a resume of the action
   taken already. It was recognised that direct services to survivors and families
   would be provided within each Authority, but that certain core services could best
   be provided across all Authorities from one Unit'and an outline structure was
   devised for the establishment of such a Unit.

4. The Helpline has continued to provide a 7 day/week service since midday on 16th and;
   nearly 3,000 people have used this service from all over the country. A Database
   (computerised) has been established to ensure that people are not either missed
   from service or experience intrusive visiting. This database will also be expanded
   to keep track of people involved in Hillsborough who may be identified from other
   indirect sources enabling the service to take on a pro-active mode of operation.
   Many people involved live outside the seven Authorities involved and co-ordination
   of both information and outreach work across the country is necessary following the
   experience of previous disasters.

5. There is a continuing need for training and staff development to tackle this
   sensitive and often intensive work which exists across all of the Authorities and
   has been recognised by N.W.A.S.S.A. The interest of the media has predictably
   diminished following the first week and it is necessary to engage in substantial
   and positive publicity. This latter activity will be assisted by the production of
   a Newsletter for people who are experiencing problems following Hillsborough. There
   are obviously major support requirements for the Unit.   Approval has already been
   given to the establishment of a Counselling Service additional to the mainstream
   social work provision. Plans are finalised for the building of a permanent
   outreach centre near Anfield to be run with maximum user involvement.

6. The original proposals, contained in After Hillsborough, can be reduced by creating
   a shared Administration System for the Liverpool and Unit services in the first
   stages. The Unit services can be progressed from their present uncertainty through
   the appointment of a core of staff supported by the Liverpool Counselling Team and
   staff from other Local Authorities.
                                                                /cont1d
7. The proposal approved by the Leaders on 29th April which would have cost
   £350.000 during 1989/90 can therefore be reduced to £142,000. The service will
   be exceedingly difficult to maintain without this certainty. Staff have been
   diverted from the substantive responsibilities and have carried considerably
   increased workloads. This demonstrates a high level of personal commitment, but
   leaves this service, which is crucial to the services to families and survivors,
   in a marginal position. An initial appraisal of the service carried out recently
   shows that the uncertainty and lack of substantial co-ordination is leading to
   problems and risk of breakdown.

8. Drop-In Centre

   Plans have been prepared for a Centre which would provide an on-going base for
   activities for victims, of the disaster and their families. This would be a modul
   construction by Premier Building Systems and would provide for interview
   facilities; group meetings/activities rooms; kitchen; offices and storage
   facilities. The estimated cost of such a Unit is £72,000 plus fees estimated at
   £3,500. In addition furniture and equipment costs are estimated at approximately
   £ 1 0 , 000 .

   The builders involved have recognised that we are seeking financial assistance
   towards the cost of this facility and have indicated that they would be prepared
   to carry out the construction immediately provided that a guaratnee was given the-
   the costs would be met in due course.

9. Newsletter           '         :•

   Experience from other major disasters indicate that a very effective method of
   assisting victims to come to terms with the tragedy is the production of a
   Newsletter/Magazine. This enables those affected to share their experiences and
   make contact with others who have similar feelings. In addition this also providt
   a means whereby victims who are unable/uriwilling to seek help via Helpline or
   other agencies can be encouraged to seekassistance.    It isestimated that
   production of such a newsletter wouldcostapproximately £800 peredition. If
   there were 3 editions per annum the total yearly cost would be £2,400.

10.Staffing

   As metnioned above the original proposal was for a Regional Unit which would be
   separate from the resources of the various Local Authorities but in order that
   costs might be reduced to a minimum it is felt that a Unit which combined the
   need for a regional approach with the staff already approved by the City Council
   could provide a way forward. In this connection the following posts are
   required, viz: —

   10.1.      Assistant Director (Hillsborough Disaster Unit)
              Grade P.0.6. (£18,942 - £20,232).

              The occupant of the post will be responsible to the Director for
              co-ordinating the response to the Disaster. In addition to being responsibl
              for the operations of Helpline and the Drop-In Centre he/she will oversee
              the development of the computerised database, liaise with the Co-ordinating
              Committee of Local Authorities, liaise with other Local Authorities through
              out the country, liaise with the Trustees of the Hillsborough Disaster
              Appeal, plan and oversee the development of an outreach service so as to
              identify as yet unknown victims of the disaster, ensure the production and
              dissemination of information and statistics on the disaster, supervise the
              production and implementation of a training programme for appropriate
              agencies and personnel and with public relations issues.

                                                                 /cont1d

           rotas, training and briefing volunteers. Always ensuring prompt and
           effective response to crises including people at risk of self-harm. An
           important task will be the detailed work in developing an outreach service
           to identify casualties of the disaster and ensuring that proper services

           collection of data, refining and updating information already collected
           and ensuring that a comprehensive statistical base is devised to assist
           agencies working on this disaster, but which can also be utlised in the
           future for other emergencies. This will necessitate tracking and
           identifying those people who are being serviced by other statutory and
           voluntary agencies who are collaborating and monitoring the quality of
           service being given.

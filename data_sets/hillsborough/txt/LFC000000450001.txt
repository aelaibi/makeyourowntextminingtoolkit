          MINUTES OF A DIRECTORS MEETING HELD IN THE
        CLUB BOARD ROOM ON THURSDAY 4â„¢ JANUARY 1990


The Football Association

It was agreed that a letter be sent to the FA expressing surprise that the
balance from the Hillsborough semi-final tie has been divided in the usual way
and stating that it is hoped that all the recipients involved will donate their
share to charity as it would seem immoral for any football organisation to profit
from this particular match.

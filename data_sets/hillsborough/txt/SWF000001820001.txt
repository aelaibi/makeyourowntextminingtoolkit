      Dear Mr Mackrell

      FA CHALLENGE CUP COMPETITION
      SEASON 1988 - 89
      SEMI-FINAL TIES
      SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989

      As is customary this time of the Season, I am writing to
      enquire whether your Club would be interested in staging
      an FA Challenge Cup Semi-Final Tie on Saturday 15 April
      1989 or a replay during the following mid-week.

      I would inform you that you may charge 10% of all gross
      gate receipts, less V.A.T., for the hire of the ground.
      I would also like to take this opportunity of clarifying
      the position with regard to Executive Boxes. For Boxes
      leased out for the season, we would require a payment equal
      to the number of seats at top ticket price, while in the
      case of Boxes hired out on the one-off basis for the match,
      your Club will be entitled to retain 50% with the rest
      being paid into match receipts. These amounts, however, should
      not be included in the gross gate receipts when calculating
      the fee for the hire of the ground.



      continued
                                  Registered Office: 16 Lancaster Gate, London W2 3LW
                                  Incorporated in London Registration Number 77797
In the event of your Club playing in a Semi-Final T i e , would
you still be prepared to take the other Semi-Final Tie on
your ground the same day, bearing in mind the administrative
cost involved?

Please indicate if your Club has the necessary insurance cover
for matches of this nature. Clubs should also note the
requirements of Challenge Cup Rule 26(b) whereby the two
competing Clubs shall be entitled to 50% of the tickets for
sale. The Association in its absolute discretion may vary these
allocations.

Details of spectator segregation should be provided together
with details of the present ground capacity, number of seats
and standing places also indicating if safety fencing is
provided around the pitch.

Clubs should also note that any special areas such as Executive,
Vice-President, family or any similar seated or standing area
cannot be retained by the staging Club. All parts of the ground
must be allocated entirely for the two competing Clubs with
the exception of Directors Box, which will be controlled by this
Office.

An early reply would be appreciated as the Challenge Cup
Committee will be selecting the venues at their meeting to be
held on Monday 20 March 1989 and it is essential for the
above information to be prepared for the Committee prior to
the meeting.

Yours sincerely

          Dear Sir

          RE:     FOOTBALL MATCH               15TH APRIL 1989

          Thank you for your recent enquiry concerning temporary sign
          posting in connection with the above.

          Arrangements are presently in hand to seek permission from
          the Local Highway Authority for the Association to sign post
          the above and as soon as such permission is received I will
          re-contact you.

          The charge for the service will be based upon the following
          scale of charges which are V.A.T. inclusive:

                                            Up to 10 Signs               Each Additional Sign

          Up to 7 Days                            £79.25                              £8.14

          Up to 1 Month                           £87.41                              £8.14

          Each Additional
          Month                                   £23.70                              £8.14

          The Association reserves the right to decide the number of
          signs required and their position and at this stage it is
          estimated that approximately 1*0 signs will be required
          although it is stressed that this is only an approximate
          estimate which is given purely for your guidance.

          Please note that no payment should be made to the Association
          at this time and if meanwhile I can be of any further
          assistance in any way please do not hesitate to contact me.

          Yours faithfully

 Dear David,

 Further to our telephone conversation please find enclosed a copy of a letter
 and a drawing from the BBC Engineering Department regarding the location of a
 camera which they wish to position within the West Stand structure for the
 forthcoming semi-final on Saturday, 15th April 1989.

 I should be most grateful if you could direct it to the appropriate department.

 If you have any general queries please do not hesitate to contact me, if however
 there are any technical questions to be answered you could contact the BBC
 direct.

 Kind regards.

 Yours sincerely,




 G.H. fflacfcrell

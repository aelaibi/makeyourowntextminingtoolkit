          Dear Mr Wright

          I refer to your letter of 23 August 1989 to Mr Geoffrey Dear concerning
          our appointment as investigating officers in respect of criminal and
          disciplinary matters which may emerge from our inquiries. Mr Dear is
          presently away out of the Force until k September and, therefore, I am
          replying on his behalf. I have noted your comments about the meeting
          with Mr Hicks on 23 August and, as you probably know, I will be meeting
          with your Mr Anderson, Mr Cleugh of the Director of Public Prosecutions
          Office and Mr Noel Taylor of the Police Complaints Authority, tomorrow
          in London. At that meeting, both Stuart and I have agreed that we will
          pursue a clear understanding from the Police Complaints Authority and
          the Director of Public Prosecutions on precisely what are the terms
          of reference, the lines of communication and accountability. At that
          time we are hoping that the complaints already raised by Mr Hicks and
          others, can be considered as to whether they should fall to ‘_vie
          responsibility of my inquiry team or remain the responsibility of those
      «   presently involved.

          I have also noted the contents of your third and fourth paragraphs with
          regard to the financing of our investigation. Since receiving your
          letter I have received a letter, a copy of which is attached, from
          Mr Stephen Walker, Solicitor to your Police Authority. This letter, in
          fact takes us no further until the Home Office respond. We, therefore,
          wait for that response before we formally undertake the investigatory
          responsibilities. Having said that, our intended investigation on your
          behalf will not be prejudiced as I intend to pursue our inquiries as
          part of, which obviously they are, the coronal issues. However, until
          we formally receive appointment as Investigating Officers for police
          disciplinary purposes and have received formal ratification of that


   PLEASE REPLY TO THF OFFIPF AT        Lloyd House, Birmingham

appointment by the Police Complaints Authority, I do not see the clock
running" in respect of the service of notices under Regulation 7. My
understanding is that the responsibility falls upon the Investigating
Officer only when he has become the Investigating Officer. If the
clarification we both seek from the Home Office is not forthcoming in
the next few days, I will liaise with Mr Hayes or Mr Anderson with a
view to addressing this issue in order to ensure that any subsequent
disciplinary investigation or proceedings are not compromised by the
failure to serve such notices in good time.

I hope this letter clarifies our understanding of the position as of now.
No doubt by the end of Friday 25 August much will have come clearer.

Yours sincerely




Assistant Chief Constable
(Hillsborough Inquiry)

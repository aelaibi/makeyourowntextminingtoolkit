     I d i d not see a nyo n e e 1 imbi ng over                 the    t u r n s t i 1 e s o r gates.

     I had my ticket              in my hand when           I went     t h ro u gh the    gate.       I think       it

     must    have     been k noc ked        out    of my hand.          I h a v e n ’t got     it now.

     The    crowd was        such that you          c ou ld n' t /w a lk w h ic h way you w a n t e d anyway.

     You were       just swept           along.     We we/e       in the middle          of the    crowd and

     were    just swept a 3.ong            the    tunn/1 .      As we got       towards      the end?         I was

     pushed to the           left a nd              I got    to the     right.        I ended up        in Pen 4

     arm              was    in Pen 3. y l         did not see any P olice               or S Te w ar d s at       this

     For    the    next     10 m in ut es    or so      1 d i d n ’t stop moving.            At one      point my
a/
     feet were        off    the g r ou nd and         1 had no control          over my move me nt s.              I.

     t h i nk at    this     poi nI t he mat ch had ki cke d off                but    I di d n ’t see any of

     the game.         E v e ry s ec on d    I thought         I was going       to die.        The     heat was

     u n be l i e v a b l e and    the    crush was      such that there were               probably          or &

     people       pushed up a g ai ns t me all              unable    to move.

     j. found my se? if pushed up a ga in st a m an w no was                       up a gainst a cru h

     barrier.         I c o u l d n ’t move and         neither       could he.        He was     snouting

     'help,       h e l p 5 a nd then      ’please?      please*.        He was       very d i s t r e s s e d and

     kept    on folding           over    the barrier.          I managed       to get my hands           under his

     arms    and keep him up straight.                      E v e n t u a l l y he just s l um p e a and       I

     thought       he was     dead.        I w ou ld   describe        this man as being a w hite tnaie.^

     a g e d aoout           or 60 years            I think he wore dark blue jean

occasions            seeing           that    the        person who               I ha d      just       carried           out    ha d      been

covered          up.,    obviously            dead.            I kept           on    carrying           pe o p l e    out,       clearing

their      airways            on the         way.         1 was           covered          in v o m i t      but      just       kept       on

going.           I think          in all          1 must         have       carried           out     15 to EC) pe ople.

Eventually              the      terraces          cleared.                I sa w         hundreds          of   shoes          and    trainers

all     o v er    the      terraces.

I went         b ac K    outside            and    made        sure        that       all     the     pe o p l e      X had       carried

out    were       laying          in the          recovery           position and                  were      being         tended          to.       I

then     went        looking           f o r ________.           I h ad a g o o d             look       around        but       couldn't

see     him.         I then           ran f r o m        the     ground          and       bac k    to my        car.

weren't          there,          so    1 left        a    note       on     the       screen.            I ran        b ac k     to    the

sat     outside          on a w al l          and        just      waited.

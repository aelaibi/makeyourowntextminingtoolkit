HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


We spoke recently about Lord Justice Taylor's plans to visit
Manchester on 6 and 7 October, and agreed that he might visit the
Salford versus Leigh match on Saturday 7 October. You said that
you and your colleagues would be happy to meet him, and arrange
for him to visit that match. I am extremely grateful to you and
would like to make this a firm arrangement.
Lord Justice Taylor will be staying in Manchester (Midland Hotel)
on the night of 6 October and will be free to join you at a
convenient time on Saturday. I will accompany him throughout.
Perhaps you could be kind enough to suggest a programme, with
details of where we should be and when. You also kindly arranged
to give some help with transport, which would be much
appreciated: Lord Justice Taylor will probably be travelling on
to Leeds for Saturday evening.

I look forward to hearing from you.

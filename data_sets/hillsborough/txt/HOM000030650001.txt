      HILLSBOROUGH

     I refer to your letter of 7 October 1998, addressed to Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines about
     the release of material from the Hillsborough Archive and your enclosed list of outstanding
     statements. I am pleased to forward copies of the majority of the documents you requested as
     detailed below:-

      R566 BROOKE - Detective Chief Inspector Brooke did not make any statements in respect of
      the Hillsborough Disaster. It must be appreciated that the HOLMES computer system is both an
      investigative and a management tool and as such both statements and reports can be given a
      reference number on the system. R566 in a report dated 19 November 1990 by the above
      named officer, which does not relate to events of the day of the disaster. It is not a statement
      nor an officer's report about the events at Hillsborough and therefore does not fall within the
      criteria for being placed in the House of Commons Library. A copy is enclosed for your
      information only.

      R109 WALLACE - R109 related to a statement by Inspector Gordon Sykes, which has previously
      been forwarded to the House of Commons Library, not to a statement by an officer named
      Wallace. The nearest statement I can find to this is R127 by Inspector Brian Wallace and I
      enclose a copy of this in the event that it may be the one required.

      R336 HUCKSTEPP - A copy of the original recollection of PC 3066 Allison Huckstepp is
      enclosed.

      R293 ILLINGWORTH - To date I have only found one version of PC 417 Illingworth's
      recollections and a copy of this is enclosed but I have printed a copy of his original statement
      from the HOLMES computer and forward this too.

QOR84 WILD - A copy of the original version of PC 2909 Wild's statement is enclosed. (I am
concerned that the address and telephone number of a person giving him information is clearly
shown in this version.)

R516 T HIGGINS - Again I am unable to locate R516 A & B, but a check on HOLMES indicates
that former Sergeant Trevor HIGGINS made two statements and therefore there would not have
been a 516B. A copy of the two statements printed from HOLMES is enclosed.

PC BROMLEY - A copy of PC 2220 Paul Bromley's two statements have been forwarded to the
House of Commons Library, further copies are enclosed for your information.

Dr JACOB - Authority has been sought from Dr George Jacob for the release of his statement,
but he deferred that decision to HM Coroner, who was in turn approached and agreed the
release of the statement. A copy is therefore enclosed.
